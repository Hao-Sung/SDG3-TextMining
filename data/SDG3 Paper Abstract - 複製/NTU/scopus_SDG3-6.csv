Methods: This population-based study enrolled newly-diagnosed bipolar-spectrum patients, including 4,367 patients with early-onset bipolar disorder (EOBD), 64,787 patients with adult-onset bipolar disorder (AOBD), and the same number of age-controlled comparison subjects without bipolar disorder, from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Time-dependent covariate Cox regression models were used to estimate the effect of age-at-onset on clinical outcomes with adjustment for pre-existing psychiatric comorbid conditions and pharmacological treatment patterns. Sensitivity analyses using different definitions of study sample and age cutoffs were conducted. Results: The average follow-up duration was 5.7 years. After adjustment with time-dependent covariates and chronological age, there were no significant differences in the risks for developing new-onset alcohol or substance use disorders and psychiatric hospitalization between EOBD and AOBD patients. Although EOBD patients had a higher risk of hospitalization for suicide and self-harm than did AOBD patients in primary analysis, this finding did not replicated in the sensitivity analyses. Limitations: The symptom profile and severity of bipolar disorder was not available in the NHIRD; therefore, surrogate indicators of clinical outcome might not be sensitive enough to detect the subtle differences. Conclusions: EOBD and AOBD patients had similar risks for developing alcohol or substance use disorders. Their risk of psychiatric hospitalization was similar. Whether EOBD patients might have a higher risk of hospitalization for suicide and self-harm warrants further investigations. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Clinical outcomes; Early-onset bipolar disorders; Hospitalization; Self-harm; Substance use disorder,alcohol; antidepressant agent; benzodiazepine; mood stabilizer; neuroleptic agent; adult; age; Article; automutilation; bipolar I disorder; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; female; follow up; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sensitivity analysis; suicidal behavior; suicide,2-s2.0-85071724516

Previous studies have shown that some specific mutations in the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV4 can reduce channel activity and further cause the osteoarthropathy related disease. Mutations in this region probably influence the constitutive activity of the channel, which mainly regulated by the binding of a small ligand such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). These findings suggest that it is crucial to understand the fundamental mechanisms regulated by chemical ligands such as ATP binding with the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV4. However, how these mutations at the molecular level resulting in the related diseases are still unclear. Here we use full atomistic simulations to investigate the mutation induced conformational changes and ATP binding ability differences of TRPV4-ARD. Conformation characteristics of different mutations of TRPV4-ARD are explored. Optimal communication paths are studied to explain how a point mutation away from aim region (Finger 3) can cause a significant alteration on the conformation. We identify two molecular mechanisms through the conformation of Finger 3 and through alter the ATP binding mechanism correspondently to explain these unknowns. Our study provides fundamental insights into the mutation induced structural changes of the TRPV4-ARD and helps to explain how the mutations alter the ATP binding ability of the TRPV4-ARD. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,Adenosinetriphosphate; Ligands; Ankyrin-repeat domain; Atomistic simulations; Channel activity; Conformational change; Fundamental mechanisms; Molecular mechanism; Optimal communication; Transient receptor potentials; Conformations; adenosine triphosphate; ankyrin; finger 3 protein; k197r protein; protein; unclassified drug; vanilloid receptor 4; Article; chemical structure; conformational transition; hydrogen bond; ligand binding; molecular interaction; osteoarthropathy; point mutation; priority journal; protein conformation; protein domain; protein protein interaction; thermostability,2-s2.0-85071653969

The training program includes a 7-hour basic training (BT) to introduce ways of teaching and assessing the 6 core competencies identified by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and a 40-hour clinical training program. Methods: Physicians from different hospitals attended the GMFTPs. Since 2010, we have been using quick tests to assess trainees' familiarity of core competencies. Knowledge improvement (KI) was defined as the difference between post-BT and pre-BT test scores. Since 2013, we have been annually mailing questionnaires to assess trainees' teaching confidence (TC) of core competencies. We analyzed the correlations between trainees' characteristics, KIs, and TCs. Results: Between year 2009 and 2017, a total of 319 attending physicians (257 male, 62 female), with a mean age of 39.1 ± 6.2 years, completed the GMFTPs. Significant KI (32.6–55.4) was noted. There were no correlations between trainees' characteristics and KIs. The mean TCs for the 6 core competences were all above 4.0 (based on a 5-point Likert scale). TCs were positively correlated with age during GMFTP training, age when responding to the questionnaire, and duration between training and the last time responding to the questionnaire. TC showed no correlation with sex, hospitals, departments, or KI. Conclusion: Knowledge of teaching core competencies improved immediately after BT, but KIs did not correlate with TCs in long-term follow-up. After the training program, physicians' teaching confidence increased over time. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",Core competencies; General medicine faculty training program; Knowledge improvement; Teaching confidence,accreditation; adult; age; article; controlled study; female; follow up; general practice; human; human experiment; Likert scale; male; medical education; physician; questionnaire; student,2-s2.0-85070541868

Structured treatment interruption (STI) is a strategy for drug holiday or to boost HIV-specific immunity. But the long-term outcome of STI was never reported in literature. Methods: This is a single-center observational study. We followed the HIV-infected patients who already had a stable viral suppression and voluntarily started temporary STI with a fixed 12-week interval after counseling, evaluation and education. HIV-1-specific T cell response was also measured in some patients. Results: Totally 34 HIV-infected patients received temporary STI since July, 2006. 18 patients completed 10-year follow-up. All patients received protease inhibitors (PI)-based ART before and during temporary STI. The patients received temporary STI with a period of 36–85 weeks. All of them reached viral suppression after 12 weeks of restarting continuous ART. No viral rebound or opportunistic disease was recorded during follow-up. No adverse event or comorbidity was attributed to STI. The plasma viral load (PVL) at the end of STI was significantly lower than baseline PVL in patients with a longer duration of STI (?36 weeks vs. >36 weeks, P = 0.005). The T cell response study revealed that cyclically increased HIV-1-specific T cell response after starting STI in patients with baseline CD4+ count >350/μL. Conclusion: Temporary STI may not lead to worse long-term outcome among highly selected patients. The policy may partially control viral replication through reminding the HIV-1 specific T cell immunity. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",Antiretroviral treatment (ART); HIV-1; Structured treatment interruption (STI),,2-s2.0-85070253661

Methods: We identified one hospital-based cohort (HBC) and one population-based cohort (PBC) including patients receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate acid (Beta-lactam), gemifloxacin (Gemi), and fluoroquinolones other than gemifloxacin (Non-Gemi FQ) prior to TB treatment. Results: A total of 201 patients in the HBC and 3544 patients in the PBC were recruited. After 1:1 propensity score matching, TB treatment delay was statistically insignificant between Beta-lactam, Gemi group, and Non-Gemi FQ group in HBC (Beta-lactam vs Gemi: 22.3 ± 21.4 d vs 28.6 ± 27.9 d, p = 0.292; Beta-lactam vs Non-Gemi FQ: 33.3 ± 26.5 d vs 50.3 ± 47.3 d, p = 0.135) and PBC (Beta-lactam vs Gemi: 26.4 ± 29.1 vs 25.0 ± 28.1, p = 0.638; Beta-lactam vs Non-Gemi FQ: 29.4 ± 36.0 d vs 32.7 ± 35.0 d, p = 0.124, Non-Gemi FQ vs Gemi: 28.4 ± 33.0 d vs 25.0 ± 28.1 d, p = 0.29). Conclusion: While limited by relatively low case number, our study showed that use of gemifloxacin neither results in nor reduces delay in TB treatment. The issue of FQ use on TB treatment delay was also not observed in our study. Early survey and maintaining high clinical alertness remains the key to reducing TB treatment delay. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",Beta-lactam; Fluoroquinolone; Gemifloxacin; Treatment delay; Tuberculosis,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ciprofloxacin; gemifloxacin; levofloxacin; moxifloxacin; ofloxacin; quinolone derivative; adult; antibiotic therapy; Article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; female; hospital based case control study; human; ICD-9-CM; major clinical study; male; middle aged; propensity score; therapy delay; thorax radiography; tuberculosis,2-s2.0-85068047769

Preventive strategies may have marked impact on resource allocation in HBV endemic areas. This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness between prophylactic antiviral therapy and HBV DNA monitoring for the prevention of HBV-related complications. Methods: Data sources are studies of HBV-related events and survival for patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection published since 2006. Decision tree analysis was used to compare the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of preventing HBV-related death or liver decompensation for patients who undergo first-line rituximab-containing chemotherapy. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of the preventive efficacy, the duration of prophylactic antiviral therapy, and the cost of different interventions. The direct medical cost was derived from the database of the NHI Administration, Taiwan. The time frame of our analysis was set to 3 years after the completion of chemotherapy. Results: The median ICER of prophylactic antiviral therapy, according to current practice guidelines, ranged between USD 150,000 and 250,000 if we apply the guidelines generally. When a long-course (12 months after completion of chemotherapy according to clinical guidelines) prophylactic therapy was assumed, Option A was cheaper and more effective only in the anti-HBs-negative subgroup (median ICER US$149,932 vs. US$161,526, p = 0.013). Conclusion: Identification of anti-HBs-negative subgroups is critical to improve the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antiviral therapy in lymphoma patients with resolved HBV infection. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",Antiviral therapy; Chemotherapy; Hepatitis B reactivation; Rituximab,cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin plus prednisolone plus rituximab plus vincristine; hepatitis B surface antibody; antiviral therapy; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer survival; chemotherapy; clinical outcome; clinical study; cost effectiveness analysis; decompensated liver cirrhosis; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; disability-adjusted life year; endemic disease; follow up; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; hospital patient; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; national health insurance; nonhuman; outcome assessment; overall survival; population; practice guideline; prophylaxis; resource allocation; survival; treatment duration; virus reactivation; World Health Organization,2-s2.0-85067546088

In the initial stage, it is difficult to distinguish NF and cellulitis, and limited population-based reports are available. Methods: We queried inpatient data sets of National Health Institute Research Database in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011 for all patients with diagnoses of NF. Of them, only patients who underwent surgeries and had been admitted to intensive care units were included as the study group. Age and gender-matched patients with admission diagnoses of cellulitis were enrolled in a ratio of 1:4 as the control group. We calculated annual incidence, mortality rate, risk factors and predictors of mortality of NF. Results: The study group consisted of 7391 NF patients. Among them, 4715 patients (64%) were man and 2676 (36%) were women. The overall annual incidence of NF was 3.26 hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years, which rose with age with male predominance. The in-hospital mortality rate, which also rose with age, was 32.2%. Diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio, 2.93; 95% confidence interval, 2.77-3.11; P value < 0.0001), alcoholism (2.64; 2.27-3.08; P < .0001), and chronic kidney disease (1.98; 1.84-2.14; P < .001) were identified as risk factors. Chronic kidney disease (1.86; 1.64-2.10; P < .001) and liver cirrhosis (1.68; 1.50-1.88; P < .001) were identified as predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: Age and the presence of chronic diseases are major risk factors as well as prognostic factors of NF in Taiwan. Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of NF, but does not adversely affect the outcome. ? 2019",Epidemiology; Mortality; Necrotizing fasciitis; Predictors of mortality; Predisposing factors,adult; age; alcoholism; amputation; Article; case control study; cellulitis; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; controlled study; debridement; diabetes mellitus; disease predisposition; female; hospital admission; hospital mortality; hospitalization; human; incidence; intensive care; intensive care unit; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; necrotizing fasciitis; population based case control study; risk factor; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85061055941

Objectives: To investigate the association between CHC and parkinsonism and the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Methods: Using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 2004 to 2012, patients with and without CHC, patients receiving pegylated interferon-based antiviral therapy, and those without such therapy were matched by age, gender, and comorbidities by propensity scores and followed for new diagnoses of parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease (PD). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed. Results: Overall, 49,342 patients with CHC were matched with 49,342 non-CHC patients. After adjustment for confounding factors, there was a significantly increased risk (31%) of parkinsonism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.306; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.208–1.412) in those with CHC and the risk of parkinsonism requiring anti-Parkinson medication (HR 1.323; 95% CI, 1.214–1.441). Furthermore, 23,647 untreated CHC patients were matched with 23,647 patients receiving antiviral therapy. Patients receiving antiviral therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing parkinsonism (38%; HR 0.618; 95% CI, 0.498–0.765) and a reduced risk of parkinsonism requiring anti-Parkinson medication (HR 0.651; 95% CI, 0.515–0.823). In sensitivity analyses, antiviral therapy significantly reduced the risk of parkinsonism and PD after adjustment for detection, selection, disease latency biases, and competing mortality. Our results suggest successful antiviral therapy associates with a reduced risk of hepatitis C virus–related parkinsonism compared with those with treatment failure. Conclusions: CHC infection is associated with an increased risk of parkinsonism or PD. Antiviral therapy against CHC is associated with a reduced risk of parkinsonism or PD. ? 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. ? 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",direct antiviral agent; HCV; movement disorder; Parkinson's disease; pegylated interferon,,2-s2.0-85072164517

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common pathogenic species. The presence of MAC has a clinical relevance of around 35~42%, indicating the possibility of host susceptibility. Previous studies have shown that interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-1-receptor knock-out mice are susceptible to mycobacterial infections; however, the role of inflammasome-driven interleukin (IL)-1β has not been studied in MAC-LD. We enrolled patients with MAC-LD and healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated by MAC bacilli. The responses of interleukin(IL)-1β and the expression of inflammasome and toll-like receptors (TLRs) were measured. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also examined for NLRP3 and TLR2 genes. In the patients with MAC-LD, the IL-1β responses decreased in PBMCs, monocytes, and macrophages assayed by MAC bacilli in comparison to the healthy controls. In addition, the level of caspase-1 after stimulation was lower in the MAC-LD group, although the mRNA level of IL-1β was not significantly lower. In surveying the activation of IL-1β, the MAC-LD group had an attenuated mRNA level of NLRP3 but similar levels of AIM2 and ASC compared with the controls. The SNPs rs3806268 and rs34298354 in NLRP3 for females and rs3804100 in TLR2 for males were associated with MAC-LD. In conclusion, our patients with MAC-LD had attenuated IL-1β production, which may have been due to lower activation of the NLRP3-caspase-1 axis. Two SNPs of NLRP3 and one of TLR2 were correlated with MAC-LD, possibly indicating host susceptibility. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85071492451

Inhibiting autophagy has been considered as an adjuvant anti-cancer strategy. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of combining pulsed-wave ultrasound hyperthermia (pUH) enhanced PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) delivery with an autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). BALB/c mice bearing subcutaneous 4T1 tumor received intravenous injection of PLD (10 mg/kg) plus 15-minute on-tumor pUH on Day 5 after tumor implantation and were then fed with CQ (50 mg/kg daily) thereafter. Prolonged suppression of tumor growth was attained with PLD + pUH + CQ treatment, whereas in PLD + pUH group tumors quickly recurred after an initial inhibition. Treatment with CQ monotherapy had no benefit compared to the control group. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting showed that autophagy of cancer cells was blocked for the mice receiving CQ. It indicates that PLD + pUH + CQ is a promising strategy to treat cancer for a long-term inhibition. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85071418191

Everolimus can deregulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and affect a range of cellular functions. In some patients, the agent does not exhibit the desired efficacy and, even worse, not without the associated side effects. This study assessed the use of immunofluorescence (IF) as a modality to fill this unmet need of predicting the efficacy of everolimus prior to administration. Cell viability and MTT assays based on IF intensities of pho-4EBP1 Thr37/46 and pho-S6K1 Ser424 on breast cancer cells (Hs578T, MCF7, BT474, MDA-MB-231) and patient-derived cell culture from metastatic sites (ABC-82T and ABC-16TX1) were interrogated. Results show that independent pho-4EBP1 Thr37/46 and pho-S6K1 Ser424 IF expressions can classify data into different groups: everolimus sensitive and resistant. The combined IF baseline intensity of these proteins is predictive of the efficacy of everolimus, and their intensities change dynamically when cells are resistant to everolimus. Furthermore, mTOR resistance is not only consequence of the AKT/mTOR pathway but also through the LKB1 or MAPK/ERK pathway. The LKB1 and pho-GSK3β may also be potential predictive markers for everolimus. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85069926182

The NIACE score was calculated according to the Nodular numbers, tumor Infiltration, Alpha-fetoprotein level, Child–Pugh score, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score. The prognostic values of NIACE score for overall survival according to individual treatment and the Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging were analyzed. Results: A total of 468 patients were included with a median follow-up of 30?months. A greater NIACE score correlated with lower median survival and higher BCLC staging.

However, patient-centered outcomes are not consistently reported in trials in ADPKD, which can limit shared decision-making. We aimed to identify outcomes important to patients and caregivers and the reasons for their priorities. Methods: Nominal group technique was adopted involving patients with ADPKD and caregivers who were purposively selected from eight centres across Australia, France and the Republic of Korea. Participants identified, ranked and discussed outcomes for trials in ADPKD. We calculated an importance score (0–1) for each outcome and conducted thematic analyses. Results: Across 17 groups, 154 participants (121 patients, 33 caregivers) aged 19 to 78 (mean 54.5 years) identified 55 outcomes. The 10 highest ranked outcomes were: kidney function (importance score 0.36), end-stage kidney disease (0.32), survival (0.21), cyst size/growth (0.20), cyst pain/bleeding (0.18), blood pressure (0.17), ability to work (0.16), cerebral aneurysm/stroke (0.14), mobility/physical function (0.12), and fatigue (0.12). Three themes were identified: threatening semblance of normality, inability to control and making sense of diverse risks. Conclusion: For patients with ADPKD and their caregivers, kidney function, delayed progression to end-stage kidney disease and survival were the highest priorities, and were focused on achieving normality, and maintaining control over health and lifestyle.

Factors that determine the diversity of nasal microbiota in HCIs remain unclear. Herein, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to investigate the relationship between nasal and surface microbiota in three HCIs. Participants were classified into a hospitalised or nonhospitalised group based on their most recent date of hospitalisation. A total of 88 nasal samples and 83 surface samples were analysed. Dysgonomonas and Corynebacterium were the most abundant taxa in the surface and nasal samples, respectively. Significant differences were discovered in microbiota diversity among HCIs when comparing the surface and nasal samples. Fifteen taxa were identified as present in all the surface and nasal samples. SourceTracker analysis revealed that the ventilation conditions of environment might be associated with the proportion of shared microbial communities between nasal and surface. Additionally, as compared with the nonhospitalised group, the hospitalised group had a higher proportion of surface microbiota in their nasal samples, which might lead to a higher risk of human-related microorganisms or pathogens colonising the nasal cavity. The data suggest that nasal bacterial diversity could be influenced by both health status and living environment. Our results therefore highlight the importance of the indoor environment for HCI residents. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85064533891

Here we show that LRH-1 protein stability is regulated by the cullin 4 (CUL4) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. We found that DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2) directly interacts with LRH-1 and functions as a substrate recognition component of CUL4-DDB1 to promote LRH-1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, we observed that protein levels of endogenous LRH-1 are increased by insulin without a change in mRNA levels of LRH-1. However, overexpression of DDB2 impaired the insulin-stimulated increase in LRH-1 levels. In addition, DDB2 overexpression decreased LRH-1 transcriptional activation and expression of target genes, such as glucokinase, whereas knockdown of DDB2 increased the expression of glucokinase. Finally, we demonstrated that DDB2 knockdown increases glucose uptake and intracellular levels of glucose-6-phosphate in HepG2 cells.

Hemagglutinin (HA) is an important target in the therapeutic treatment and diagnostic detection of the influenza virus. Influenza A virus encompasses several different HA subtypes with different strains, which are constantly changing. In this study, we identified a fully human H1N1 neutralizing antibody (32D6) via an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cell-based technology. 32D6 specifically neutralizes the clinically isolated H1N1 strains after the 2009 pandemic but not the earlier strains. The epitope was identified through X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 32D6-Fab/HA1 complex structure, which revealed a unique loop conformation located on the top surface of HA. The major region is composed of two peptide segments (residues 172–177 and 206–213), which form an abreast loop conformation. The residue T262 between the two loops forms a conformational epitope for recognition by 32D6. Three water molecules were observed at the interface of HA and the heavy chain, and they may constitute a stabilizing element for the 32D6-HA association. In addition, each 32D6-Fab is likely capable of blocking one HA trimer.

Patients with metastatic RCC have an unusually poor prognosis and near-universal resistance to all current therapies. To improve RCC treatment and the survival rate of patients with RCC, there is an urgent need to reveal the mechanisms by which metabolic reprogramming regulates aberrant signaling and oncogenic progression. Through an integrated analysis of RCC metabolic pathways, we showed that methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) and its substrate methylthioadenosine (MTA) are dysregulated in aggressive RCC. A decrease in MTAP expression was observed in RCC tissues and correlated with higher tumor grade and shorter overall survival. Genetic manipulation of MTAP demonstrated that MTAP expression inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and migration of RCC cells. Interestingly, we found a decrease in the protein methylation level with a concomitant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation after MTAP knockout. A phospho-kinase array screen identified the type 1 insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) as the candidate with the highest upregulation in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to MTAP loss. We further demonstrated that IGF1R phosphorylation acts upstream of Src and STAT3 signaling in MTAP-knockout RCC cells. IGF1R suppression by a selective inhibitor of IGF1R, linsitinib, impaired the cell migration and invasion capability of MTAP-deleted cells. Surprisingly, an increase in linsitinib-mediated cytotoxicity occurred in RCC cells with MTAP deficiency. Our data suggest that IGF1R signaling is a driver pathway that contributes to the aggressive nature of MTAP-deleted RCC. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,"5' methylthioadenosine; 5' methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; 6 n,n' dimethylarginine; linsitinib; n(g) methylarginine; n(g),n(g) dimethylarginine; somatomedin C receptor; STAT3 protein; 786-O cell line; Article; cancer growth; cancer staging; cell growth; cell invasion; cell invasion assay; cell migration; cell structure; cell viability; clinical article; colony formation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; down regulation; drug mechanism; enzyme deficiency; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression; gene knockout; gene repression; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; molecular interaction; MTT assay; oncogene src; overall survival; protein expression; protein methylation; protein phosphorylation; renal cell carcinoma; renal cell carcinoma cell line; signal transduction; spectrophotometry; trypan blue assay; upregulation; Western blotting; wound healing assay",2-s2.0-85060956001

However, little is known about its role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effect of ADMA on cholesterol metabolism and its underlying molecular mechanism. Methods: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced macrophage foam cells were used as an in vitro model. Apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE?/?) hyperlipidemic mice were used as an in vivo model. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate protein expression. Luciferase reporter assays were used to assess the activity of promoters and transcription factors. Conventional assay kits were used to measure the levels of ADMA, cholesterol, triglycerides, and cytokines. Results: Treatment with oxLDL decreased the protein expression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 (DDAH-2) but not DDAH-1. Incubation with ADMA markedly increased oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophages. ADMA impaired cholesterol efflux following oxLDL challenge and downregulated the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 by interfering with liver X receptor α (LXRα) expression and activity. Additionally, this inhibitory effect of ADMA on cholesterol metabolism was mediated through the activation of the NADPH oxidase/reactive oxygen species pathway. In vivo experiments revealed that chronic administration of ADMA for 4 weeks exacerbated systemic inflammation, decreased the aortic protein levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1, and impaired the capacity of reverse cholesterol transport, ultimately, leading to the progression of atherosclerosis in apoE?/? mice. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the ADMA/DDAH-2 axis plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol metabolism in macrophage foam cells and atherosclerotic progression. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Asymmetric dimethylarginine; Atherosclerosis; ATP-Binding cassette transporter; Cholesterol metabolism; Liver X receptor α; Macrophage foam cell,"ABC transporter A1; ABC transporter G1; apolipoprotein E; dimethylargininase; dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1; dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2; liver X receptor alpha; n(g),n(g) dimethylarginine; oxidized low density lipoprotein; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aorta; Article; atherosclerosis; cholesterol metabolism; cholesterol transport; controlled study; down regulation; foam cell; human; human cell; in vivo study; inflammation; lipid storage; macrophage; macrophage foam cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction",2-s2.0-85071375700

This study predicted the presence of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer by using texture and morphology analyses on breast MRI. Materials and methods: A total of 107 breast cancers (dataset A) from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) consisting of 40 TP53 mutation cancer and 67 cancers without TP53 mutation; 35 PIK3CA mutations cancer and 72 without PIK3CA mutation. 122 breast cancer (dataset B) from Seoul National University Hospital containing 54 TP53 mutation cancer and 68 without mutations were used in this study. At first, the tumor area was segmented by a region growing method. Subsequently, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features were extracted after ranklet transform, and a series of features including compactness, margin, and ellipsoid fitting model were used to describe the morphological characteristics of tumors. Lastly, a logistic regression was used to identify the presence of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations. The classification performances were evaluated by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Taking into account the trade-offs of sensitivity and specificity, the overall performances were evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The GLCM texture feature based on ranklet transform is more capable of recognizing TP53 and PIK3CA mutations than morphological feature, especially for the TP53 mutation that achieves statistically significant. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for TP53 mutation dataset A and dataset B achieved 0.78 and 0.81 respectively. For PIK3CA mutation, the AUC of ranklet texture feature was 0.70. Conclusion: Texture analysis of segmented tumor on breast MRI based on ranklet transform is potential in recognizing the presence of TP53 mutation and PIK3CA mutation. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Breast Cancer; Computer-aided diagnosis; MRI; PIK3CA; TP53,adult; angiogenesis; Article; breast cancer; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; gene mutation; gene structure; human; major clinical study; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oncogene; PIK3CA gene; predictive value; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; TP53 gene; tumor localization,2-s2.0-85070916187

This study explored whether tumor response to ICIs in HCC varies among different organs. Methods: We reviewed the data of patients with advanced HCC who had received ICIs. Patients with measurable diseases were enrolled. Organ-specific response criteria, adapted from RECIST 1.1 and immune-related RECIST, were used to evaluate the objective response to ICIs in tumors located in the liver, lung, lymph node, and other intra-abdominal sites. Results: Of the 75 enrolled patients with advanced HCC, 51 and 11 patients had chronic hepatitis B virus and chronic hepatitis C virus infection, respectively. Regarding ICI treatment, 58, 1, and 16 patients had undergone anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) alone, anti-CTLA4 mAb alone, and anti-PD-1 mAb plus anti-CTLA4 mAb, respectively; 20 and 55 patients had received ICIs as first-line or ?second-line therapy. The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 28.0%. In total, 58, 34, 19, and 18 patients had measurable hepatic tumors and lung, lymph node, and other intra-abdominal metastases, and the corresponding organ-specific ORRs were 22.4, 41.2, 26.3, and 38.9%, respectively. Of the 39 patients who had both hepatic and extrahepatic tumors, 12 had disease control in extrahepatic tumors while progressive disease (PD) in hepatic tumors, whereas only 4 exhibited disease control in hepatic tumors while PD in extrahepatic tumors (p = 0.046, McNemar test). Of the 16 patients with only evaluable tumors in the liver and lungs at baseline, 8 had disease control in the lungs while PD in the liver, and none experienced disease control in the liver while PD in the lungs (p = 0.005). Conclusions: The hepatic tumors of HCC may be less responsive to ICIs than extrahepatic lesions. Lung metastases responded most favorably to ICIs. The mechanisms underlying this differential response to ICIs warrant further investigation. ? 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Treatments of advanced NSCLC patients with these mutations are well documented, and clinical responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are favorable. However, effective treatments for patients with exon 20 insertion mutations are not well verified. We investigated the clinical response to various treatments (chemotherapy and TKIs) of advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions. Patients and Methods: In this study, specimens from 3805 NSCLC patients were examined for EGFR mutations. Different first-line treatments and their effectiveness in NSCLC patients with exon 20 insertion EGFR mutations were investigated. Results: In the cohort of the 3805 patients, 2112 (55.5%) had EGFR mutations, including 84 patients (4.0%) with exon 20 insertion mutations. Efficacy of different first-line chemotherapy or TKIs were evaluated. Pemetrexed-containing therapies were related to better progression-free survival (6.2 vs. 2.7 months; P < .001) and overall survival (28.0 vs. 15.4 months; P = .009) than regimens without pemetrexed.

Immunosuppression is a significant risk factor for the disease. Previously, PML developed more commonly in patients of hematological malignancy and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In the era of biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, PML is more frequently reported in patients of autoimmune diseases. However, for its rarity and unspecific clinical presentations, accurate diagnosis and immediate immune restoration might be difficult in clinical practice, and the outcome might thus be miserable. Herein we present a 27-year-old lady of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – rheumatoid arthritis overlap syndrome with suspected involvement of central nervous system. Neuropsychiatric SLE was suspected first. However, after intensive immunosuppressive treatment, the condition kept deteriorating. An alternative diagnosis was thus considered. PML was suspected for her immunosuppressive status and suggestive radiological findings, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction of JC virus from cerebrospinal fluid. After restoring the immune status by decreasing the dose of immunosuppressants, the condition of the patient improved significantly. We report this case to raise the importance of clinical alertness for the rare but possibly underdiagnosed disease. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",Antirheumatic agents; Immunosuppressive agents; Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; Rheumatoid arthritis; Systemic lupus erythematosus,corticosteroid; double stranded DNA antibody; etanercept; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; mefloquine; methotrexate; paroxetine; prednisolone; rituximab; tocilizumab; adult; antibody blood level; antiviral therapy; arthropathy; Article; Babinski reflex; biological therapy; case report; clinical article; differential diagnosis; dizziness; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; dysmetria; female; follow up; gaze paralysis; headache; hemiparesis; human; hypesthesia; immune status; immunoglobulin deficiency; immunosuppressive treatment; JC virus; maintenance therapy; muscle strength; muscle weakness; nausea; neurologic examination; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nystagmus; plasmapheresis; pleocytosis; polymerase chain reaction; prescription; progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; quadriplegia; rheumatoid arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment duration; unsteady gait; virus load; vomiting; young adult,2-s2.0-85067110551

They are designed to reduce the risk of environmental or public health hazards due to waste disposal, and are used for waste management purposes in many places around the world. Depending on the design of the site and recovery methods, landfill sites can work as a potential reserve of energy and water for society. Landfill biogas is a source of renewable energy, and surface water can be collected in a retention pond. Although researchers broadly agree on the importance of incorporating the concept of the energy and water nexus into policy strategies and decision-making, the lack of studies focused on how governance methods that incorporate energy-water linkages at landfill sites can improve the provision of these two essential services has hindered progress in this direction. This study analyzes the links between water-energy nexus at a restored landfill site in Taipei City, Taiwan. The study tracks leachate and methane production at the site over the time periods when the landfill was actively receiving waste and after its closure and since its restoration. The results of model simulation of leachate yield and methane collection under different conditions show that energy and water production changed considerably during the time span under consideration. We identified an increasing trend of water and energy production in the landfill operation phase and a decreasing trend of water and energy production in the landfill restoration phase. In addition, we also identify a synergy between energy generation and water volume during the operation phase, and show that no trade-offs between energy generation and water volume were observed during any of the phases studied. These observations imply that greater water volumes will always lead to greater energy production, which can help inform future landfill design and governance practices. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Landfill biogas; Landfill restoration; Leachate volume; Synergy; Water-energy nexus,Biogas; Commerce; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Health hazards; Health risks; Mergers and acquisitions; Methane; Restoration; Surface waters; Energy productions; Landfill operations; Landfill restoration; Leachates; Methane production; Synergy; Water and energies; Water energy; Leachate treatment; methane; alternative energy; biogas; governance approach; landfill; leachate; methane; recovery; surface water; synergism; waste disposal; Article; ecosystem restoration; energy yield; environmental management; landfill; landfill leachate; priority journal; Taiwan; water content; water energy nexus; water management; Taipei; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85067198910

It has been identified as a Group 1 human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Chronic aflatoxin exposure has caused worldwide concern as a matter of public food safety. Peanuts and peanut products are the major sources of aflatoxin exposure. Therefore, some reduction interventions have been developed to minimize contamination throughout the peanut production chain. The purpose of this study is to estimate the efficacy of interventions in reducing the health impact of hepatocellular carcinoma caused by aflatoxin contamination in peanuts. The estimated total Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were calculated using FDA-iRISK software. Six aflatoxin reduction strategies were evaluated, including good agricultural practice (GAP), biocontrol, Purdue Improved Crop Storage packaging, basic processing, ozonolysis, and ultraviolet irradiation. The results indicated that basic processing could prevent huge public health loss of 4,079.7–21,833 total DALYs per year. In addition, GAP and biocontrol were both found to be effective strategies in the farm field. Meanwhile, the other three interventions had limited effectiveness in reducing total DALYs. In conclusion, this study could help farmers, processing plants, and government policy makers to alleviate aflatoxin contamination issues in the peanut production chain. ? 2019",Aflatoxin; Disability-adjusted life years; Health burden; Peanuts,"aflatoxin; aflatoxin; ozone; Article; biological pest control; clinical effectiveness; disability-adjusted life year; disease burden; evaluation study; food contamination; health impact assessment; human; intervention study; liver cell carcinoma; ozonolysis; peanut; priority journal; ultraviolet irradiation; adverse event; Arachis; biological control agent; chemistry; cost of illness; crop; dietary exposure; disability; food control; food handling; food poisoning; food storage; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; microbiology; prevention and control; procedures; protection; quality adjusted life year; risk assessment; risk factor; time factor; ultraviolet radiation; Aflatoxins; Arachis; Biological Control Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cost of Illness; Crops, Agricultural; Dietary Exposure; Disability Evaluation; Food Handling; Food Microbiology; Food Storage; Foodborne Diseases; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Ozone; Protective Factors; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Ultraviolet Rays",2-s2.0-85068988332

The specific aims of the study were to assess the combined effects and relative contributions of DPA1 and DPB1 genes. Methods: The cases were 152 adolescents who had undetectable (<1.0 mIU/mL) post-booster anti-HBs titers and the controls were adolescents who had residual anti-HBs ? 10 mIU/mL at aged 16 years (n = 207) or had detectable (?1.0 mIU/mL) anti-HBs titers after booster HBVac (n = 481). HLA-DPA1 and -DPB1 genotypes were determined by sequence-based typing. Results: HLA-DPA1*01:03:01 was correlated with lower ORs of undetectable anti-HBs titers, while -DPA1*02:02:02 and -DPB1*05:01:01 were correlated with higher ORs. The ORs for HLA-DPA1*01:03:01-DPB1*05:01:01 and DPA1*02:02:02-DPB1*protective combinatory types were significantly less than 1.0. As compared with subjects who had no protective allele, the adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 0.545 (0.328–0.906), 0.350 (0.174–0.702), and 0.122 (0.058–0.257), for subjects who had protective alleles on DPA1only, DPB1 only, and both genes, respectively.

It has been hypothesized that natural products may inhibit DNA repair and sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage-based cancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these activities remain unclear. In this study, we found that diallyl disulfide (DADS), an organosulfur compound, increased the sensitivity of yeast cells to DNA damage and has potential for development as an adjuvant drug for DNA damage-based cancer therapy. We induced HO endonuclease to generate a specific DNA double-strand break (DSB) by adding galactose to yeast and used this system to study how DADS affects DNA repair. In this study, we found that DADS inhibited DNA repair in single-strand annealing (SSA) system and sensitized SSA cells to a single DSB. DADS impaired DNA repair by inhibiting the protein levels of the DNA resection-related proteins Sae2 and Exo1. We also found that the recruitment of MRX and the Mec1-Ddc2 complex to a DSB was prevented by DADS. This result suggests that DADS counteracts G2/M DNA damage checkpoint activation in a Mec1 (ATR)- and Tel1 (ATM)-dependent manner. Only by elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which DADS influences DNA repair will we be able to discover new adjuvant drugs to improve chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Diallyl disulfide; DNA damage checkpoint; DNA repair; DNA resection; Homologous recombination,diallyl disulfide; double stranded DNA; endonuclease; exo1 protein; galactose; mec1 ddc2 complex protein; mec1 protein; mrx protein; nuclease; sae2 protein; tel1 protein; unclassified drug; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cancer cell; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; double stranded DNA break; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; nonhuman; priority journal; yeast cell,2-s2.0-85071560669

Lateral views of CXR are less effective and the aim of our study was to develop a rotation angle recommendation model to obtain the best oblique CXR with significantly increased contrast between lesions and surrounding normal structures in order to enhance the detection rate for potential obscured lesions on traditional posterior and anterior (PA) CXR. Methods: A total of 140 subjects receiving low-dose lung computed tomography (CT) screening were enrolled from the health check-up database. An additional 14 cases with lung lesions on chest CT were included. Demography was also reviewed. Gross, left and right cardiothoracic ratios (CTR) were measured. All CT images were transformed to CXR to detect the best rotation angles and produce different views of CXR. Contrast ratio was calculated in the transformed CXR from CT with lesions. Comparison of contrast ratio among oblique, posterior-anterior and lateral views was performed. Results: CXR shows smaller gross CTR and left CTR but larger heart width and thoracic width in men than in women. Correlation evaluation displays gross CTR, heart width and left CTR are positively correlated with age only for the women group. The most important factor for the best rotation angle is right CTR for left rotation angle and left CTR for right rotation angle. The contrast ratio of the lesion to surrounding structures is significantly better on the oblique views in the designed angles than that on the traditional views.

This study aims to investigate the effects of pterostilbene on reducing TMAO formation and on decreasing vascular inflammation in carnitine-feeding mice. Methods and results: C57BL/6 mice are treated with 1.3% carnitine in drinking water with or without pterostilbene supplementation. Using LC-MS/MS, the result shows that mice treated with 1.3% carnitine only significantly increased the plasma TMAO and pterostilbene supplementation group can reverse it. Additionally, pterostilbene decreases hepatic flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) mRNA levels compared to carnitine only group. It appears that pterostilbene can alter host physiology and create an intestinal microenvironment favorable for certain gut microbiota. Gut microbiota analysis reveals that pterostilbene increases the abundance of Bacteroides. Further, pterostilbene decreases mRNA levels of vascular inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin). Conclusion: These data suggest that amelioration of carnitine-induced vascular inflammation after consumption of pterostilbene is partially mediated via modulation of gut microbiota composition and hepatic enzyme FMO3 gene expression. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors on cardiac outcomes remain unclear. We assessed the effects of febuxostat and allopurinol on mortality and adverse reactions in adult patients with hyperuricemia. Methods and results: PubMed and EMBASE were searched to retrieve randomized controlled trials of febuxostat and allopurinol from January 2005 to July 2018. The meta-analysis consisted of 13 randomized controlled trials with a combined sample size of 13,539 patients. Febuxostat vs. allopurinol was not associated with an increased risk of cardiac-related mortality in the overall population (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.24–2.13, P = 0.55). Regarding adverse skin reactions, the patients receiving febuxostat had significantly fewer adverse skin reactions than those receiving allopurinol treatment (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30–085, P = 0.01). Compared with allopurinol, febuxostat was associated with an improved safety outcome of cardiac-related mortality and adverse skin reactions (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.55–0.96, P = 0.02). The net clinical outcome, composite of incident gout and the safety outcome, was not different significantly in the patients receiving febuxostat or allopurinol (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.76–0.1.42, P = 0.79). In sensitivity analyses, a borderline significance was found in the patients randomized to febuxostat vs. allopurinol regarding cardiac-related mortality (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.00–1.67, P = 0.05) after the CARES study was included.

However, the impact of a dysplastic surgical margin on patients with OSCC remains unclear. Materials and methods: Retrospectively, we reviewed patients with OSCC who were diagnosed and treated at the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2015. Patients were divided into four groups: clear (?5 mm), close (<5 mm), positive, and dysplastic margins. Results: Of 1642 patients, 596 had clear margin, 169 had positive margin, 707 had close margin, and 170 had dysplastic margin. The mean age at diagnosis was 55 ± 11 years (range, 16-97 years). Dysplastic margins were frequently present in patients with primary T1/T2 OSCC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, p = 0.009), tumor without perineural invasion (OR = 1.48, p = 0.04), and tumor thickness ?10 mm (OR = 1.94, p = 0.001). In patients with clear, close, positive, and dysplastic margins, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 63.1%, 51%, 37.2%, and 54.7%, respectively; overall survival (OS) rates were 71.1%, 61.9%, 49%, and 72%, respectively. Disease-free and overall survival were not significantly different in patients with dysplastic and clear margins (p = 0.37 and p = 0.38, respectively). Adjuvant radiotherapy had no significant benefit for patients with dysplastic margins. Finally, a multivariate analysis showed that the presence of a dysplastic margin was not an independent risk factor for disease-free (p = 0.43) and overall survival (p = 0.71).

In the present study, the electropolymerised hemin electrode was demonstrated to efficiently catalyse the reduction of azo-colourants. Taking advantage of the ability of cyclic protoporphyrin to exhibit π?π stacking interactions with azo compounds and the capability of the central ferric ion to electrostatically attract the negatively charged sulfonate group, sulphonated azo compounds were readily adsorbed by hemin molecules, facilitating the redox reaction of azo compounds. In response to 2 μM tartrazine (TT), the hemin-functionalised electrode exhibited a well-defined wave in square wave voltammograms (SWVs), and the wave current was approximately 5-fold greater than the signal yielded with the bare electrode. The parameters of hemin electropolymerisation yielding the maximum sensitivity were investigated, leading to a limit of detection of 360 nM (n = 3). Furthermore, simultaneous analysis of TT and sunset yellow (SY) in a mixture was demonstrated to be feasible, with well-separated (ΔE = 160 mV) voltammetric peaks obtained that corresponded to TT and SY. The electrode was also successfully tested with a drink-mimicking sample, indicating the negligible effects of oxygen and ions on analytical performance. To gain insight into the advanced catalytic property, catalytic kinetics were analysed, which revealed that the number of electrons transferred was 1.63 (for TT) and 1.67 (for SY). The reaction order of TT and SY was 2.7 and 1.8, respectively. The Tafel slope of TT and SY, derived from the polarisation curves, was 172 and 86 mV dec?1, respectively, and an approximately 33% increase in the exchange current was obtained compared with when the unmodified electrode was employed. The catalytic performance supports that electropolymerised hemin is a superior catalyst with promise for practical application in the detection of azo-colourants. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Azo-colourants; Catalytic reduction; Hemin; Sunset yellow; Tartrazine,Electrodes; Health risks; Redox reactions; Azo-colourants; Catalytic reduction; Hemin; Sunset yellows; Tartrazine; Dyes,2-s2.0-85068825509

Background: Advance care planning can facilitate discussion about end-of-life care and help to identify individual's views, wishes and beliefs about dying at a time when they have the cognitive capacity to reflect on and/or make such decisions. Design: A qualitative study was conducted. Methods: Twenty-eight older adults in a long-term care institution participated in person-to-person interviews using an ACP booklet, which included topics such as life review, healthy habits and behaviours, and end-of-life care issues and information. The discussions were recorded, and thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) checklist was followed. Results: Three themes were identified. First, participants identified that ACP could help to ensure that they achieved their view of a “good death.” Second, the process of ACP bought up difficult decisions that many participants expressed uncertainty about making. Third, participants' ability and willingness to plan for end of life were shaped by considerations about their family members' needs, views and potential role as their future carer. Conclusions: The ACP process involved not only personal ideas about good death but also families' concerns. Uncertainty and lack of information created difficult barriers. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare professionals could address the concept of good death, deliver information for their concerns and promote communication with family members. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",advance care planning; communication; long-term care; nursing; older adults; qualitative study,"advance care planning; aged; article; checklist; clinical practice; controlled study; death; habit; human; interview; long term care; nursing; qualitative research; resident; thematic analysis; uncertainty; attitude to death; caregiver; decision making; family; female; long term care; male; psychology; qualitative research; terminal care; very elderly; Advance Care Planning; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Death; Caregivers; Decision Making; Family; Female; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Qualitative Research; Terminal Care",2-s2.0-85067896774

However, its effect on long-term surgical outcomes or in one universal health care (UHC) system is unknown. This retrospective population-based study aims to validate the correlation between the increased hospital volume and better short- and long-term outcomes in patients who underwent total gastrectomy (TG) for gastric cancer. Methods: From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we examined 7905 patients who underwent TG between 2000 and 2010. The surgical outcomes of this study were defined as death within 30, 60, and 180?days after TG. Results: A total of 7905 subjects were included for analysis. The mean age was 65.8?years, and 68.8% were males. The 30-, 60-, and 180-day mortality rates after TG for gastric cancer were 2.7%, 6.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. On the multivariate analysis, TG at high-volume hospitals significantly contributed to lower 30-day (odds ratio 0.64; 95% confidence interval 0.48–0.85; P < 0.001), 60-day (odds ratio 0.68; 95% confidence interval 0.56–0.82; P < 0.001), and 180-day mortality rates (odds ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.70–0.90; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although TG is a complex operation with high mortality rates (~180-day), high hospital volume correlates with better perioperative outcomes even in UHC system. Hence, the strategy to advocate the centralization of TG is reasonable, especially for the elderly. ? 2019, Soci?t?

One major ecological perturbation underway over the past several decades of the Anthropocene is extensive tree and shrub mortality, or forest die-off, triggered by elevated temperatures and prolonged drought, and/or insect and pathogen outbreaks. This increasingly common disturbance has affected forests and woodlands on all vegetated continents and may alter terrestrial carbon fluxes in the biosphere. Remote sensing has enabled mapping of the extent and ecological patterns of tree loss and damage, assessing potential carbon emissions and monitoring ecosystem trajectories after tree mortality. In this review article, we cover drought-induced changes in plant physiology, chemistry, and structure that occur as an individual tree progresses from healthy to stressed to standing dead or coarse woody debris, and corresponding responses in remotely sensed data that provide the opportunity and potential for observation and analysis at large spatial scales and early detection. The linkages between changes associated with tree mortality and remote sensing show exceptional promise for strategic and adaptive natural resource management as climate models project warmer and drier climates in the coming decades. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Discoloration; Drought stress; Image fusion; Insect; Lidar; Pathogen; Pigment; Spectroscopy,Carbon; Chemical analysis; Climate models; Discoloration; Drought; Earth (planet); Ecology; Forestry; Image fusion; Natural resources management; Optical radar; Pathogens; Physiology; Pigments; Spectroscopy; Coarse woody debris; Drought stress; Elevated temperature; Human activities; Insect; Natural resource management; Pathogen outbreak; Remotely sensed data; Remote sensing; air-soil interaction; Anthropocene; drought stress; ecophysiology; forest canopy; forest ecosystem; insect; land surface; lidar; mortality; pathogen; perennial plant; pigment; remote sensing; shrub; spectroscopy; Hexapoda,2-s2.0-85066933604

This study was designed to examine the preventive effect of djulis on colon carcinogenesis in rats treated with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Rats were fed different AIN-93G-based diets: groups N and DMH were fed AIN-93G diet and groups LD, MD, and HD were fed AIN-93G diet containing 5, 10, and 20% djulis, respectively. All rats except for group N were injected with DMH to induce colon carcinogenesis. After 10 weeks, rats were sacrificed and colon and liver tissues were collected for analysis. The results showed that djulis-treated rats had significantly lower numbers of colonic preneoplastic lesions, aberrant crypt foci (ACF), sialomucin-producing (SIM)-ACF, and mucin-depleted foci. Djulis treatment increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in colon and liver. Djulis also reduced p53, Bcl-2, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expressions and increased Bax and caspase-9 expressions. Besides, phenolic compounds and flavonoids were found rich in djulis. These results demonstrate the chemopreventive effect of djulis on carcinogen-induced colon carcinogenesis via regulating antioxidative and apoptotic pathways in rats.

Therapeutic effects of ROS, cytosolic phospholipases A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were analyzed with a quantitative comparison of immunohistochemistry stains and morphometric approach in the tubulointerstitium of different groups. Compared with basal and HF groups, the HL group exhibited the most prominent obese kidney fibrosis, tubular epithelial lipid vacuoles, and lymphocyte infiltration in the tubulointerstitium. Furthermore, inhibitors of nonspecific ROS, cPLA2 and COX-2 ameliorated the above renal damages.

Its major animal hosts include rodents, dogs, cattle, sheep, pigs, and rabbits. Leptospirosis is a global public health issue, characterized by a sudden onset of fever, myalgia, conjunctival injection, and renal dysfunction. Renal dysfunction ranges from mild-to-severe acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring dialysis. Chronic infection with leptospirosis may progress to renal fibrosis and subsequent renal failure. The pathogenesis of leptospirosis-related CKD has been linked to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. Leptospirosis causes sodium transport dysregulation in the kidneys and decreased aquaporin 2 expression in the renal medulla, resulting in polyuria and natriuresis. Nonoliguria renal failure and hypokalemia are common because of tubular damage with transport defects in tubular epithelial cells. The clinical presentation of Leptospira infection is influenced by both the bacterial serotype and host immune system. A broad spectrum of renal pathological changes is possible, including direct bacterial invasion and interstitial nephritis and fibrosis caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, Leptospira outer membrane proteins may induce tubular injury and inflammation through activation of nuclear transcription factor kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and induction of cytokines and chemokines by the toll-like receptor-dependent pathways.

Going by the evidence-based principle, we use the simulation method to evaluate the effectiveness of mortality reduction resulting from PSA screening and its utilization using a personalized screening regime as opposed to a universal screening program. (2) Methods: A six-state (normal, over-detected, low-grade, and high-grade PrCa in pre-clinical phase, and low-grade and high-grade PrCa in clinical phase) Markov model with genetic and PSA information was developed after a systematic review of genetic variant studies and dose-dependent PSA studies. This gene-PSA-guided model was used for personalized risk assessment and risk stratification. A computer-based simulated randomized controlled trial was designed to estimate the reduction of mortality achieved by three different screening methods, personalized screening, universal screening, and a non-screening group. (3) Results: The effectiveness of PrCa mortality reduction for a personalized screening program compared to a non-screening group (22% (9%-33%)) was similar to that noted in the universal screening group (20% (7%-21%). However, a personalized screening program could dispense with 26% of unnecessary PSA testing, and avoid over-detection by 2%.

This study mainly investigated the effect of insoles on symptomatic flatfoot in preschool-aged children and followed up the changes in footprints after 1 year. This study was a prospective, observational cohort study. Children aged 3 to 5 years old who exhibit the signs of flatfoot feet were recruited from the kindergartens in the central Taiwan between March 2010 and December 2013. The Chippaux-Smirak index (CSI) was used to determine whether the footprints of children were associated with flatfoot. The children were divided into an insole group and a no-insole group according to diagnoses by doctors. This study used the modified shoe insole as the intervention, and the CSI measured and followed up the changes in footprints after 1 year. A total of 466 preschool-aged children aged 3 to 5 years old with flatfoot completed the 1-year follow-up study. Of these, 123 children (men 77; women 46) were in the insole group and 343 children (men 187; women 156) were in the no-insole group. After the insoles were worn for 1 year, the CSI values of the children with symptomatic flatfoot decreased by 9.7%, and the 5-year-old children had the biggest change (effect size=1.25). In the insole group, 34.1% of the footprints were determined as normal at 1-year follow-up, and CSI values decreased by 17.5%. High prevalence of joint laxity was found in both groups (insole group: 34.5%; no-insole group: 35.1%). Of the children in the insole group, the proportion of joint laxity was significantly higher in the flatfoot group (43.1%) than in the normal group (17.7%). This study showed that wearing insoles indeed can reduce the signs of flatfoot in preschool-aged children, and the effect is better in 5-year-old children. It is suggested that insoles can be provided as a conservative treatment for preschool-aged children with symptomatic flatfoot.

Citrus polymethoxyflavonoids (PMFs), such as tangeretin (PMF1), have been found to exhibit various biological activities. Here, we evaluated the inhibitory effects and mechanism of synthetic 5,4′-didemethyltangeretin (PMF2) on human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. We found that PMF2 inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells (GI50 14.6?μM) more strongly than PMF1, and it was less cytotoxic against the normal human prostate RWPE-1 cells. PMF2 upregulated Bad and Bax, downregulated Bcl-2, and activated caspase-3 and PARP in the LNCaP cells, thereby inducing apoptosis. PMF2 also suppressed the anchorage-independent growth of the LNCaP cells. It triggered p21 gene expression by demethylation of the p21 promoter region, and inhibited the protein expressions of DNMT 3B and HDACs 1, 2, and 4/5/9 by epigenetic regulations. We further found that PMF2 showed interactions with DNMTs 1, 2, and 3A ex vivo, which might inhibit DNMT activity. Additionally, PMF2 decreased the anchorage-independent growth of isolated LNCaP cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) with high CD166 mRNA expression. These results indicated that PMF2 might inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer cells through different mechanisms, suggesting that PMF2 could be an innovative agent for prostate cancer therapy and prevention. ? 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.","5,4′-didemethyltangeretin; cancer stem-like cells; epigenetics; p21; prostate cancer","5,4' didemethyltangeretin; activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; caspase 3; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; DNA methyltransferase; DNA methyltransferase 2; DNA methyltransferase 3A; DNA methyltransferase 3B; flavonoid; histone deacetylase 1; histone deacetylase 2; histone deacetylase 4; histone deacetylase 5; histone deacetylase 9; messenger RNA; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein BAD; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; protein p21; tangeretin; unclassified drug; anchorage independent growth; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer prevention; cancer stem cell; cancer therapy; controlled study; DNA demethylation; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug protein binding; drug selectivity; drug structure; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; epigenetics; ex vivo study; gene expression; GI50; human; human cell; in vitro study; LNCaP cell line; proapoptotic activity; promoter region; prostate cancer; protein analysis; protein expression; protein protein interaction; RWPE-1 cell line; upregulation",2-s2.0-85068775589

Method: Patients with acute psychiatric admissions between 1996 and 2012 were included based on the National Health Insurance Research Database. The patients' baseline characteristics were recorded. The study outcomes included inpatient mortality, length of stay, and readmission within 30 days. Multivariable linear regression and multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, diagnosis, and compulsory hospitalization status were performed. Results: Among 661,709 acute psychiatric admissions, there were 82,450 weekend admissions. The patients with weekend admissions tended to be younger and the proportion of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, substance use disorder, and compulsory hospitalization were higher. Weekend admissions were associated with a shorter length of stay (30.3 days vs. 33.3 days, p < 0.001), lower inpatient morality rate (0.07% vs. 0.11%, p = 0.007), but higher readmission rate (26.8% vs. 25.3%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The impact of weekend admission on clinical outcomes was relatively small compared to the differences in demographic and clinical characteristics. Despite the small influence of weekend admission, evaluation of the quality of care provided at weekends requires further attention and research to improve mental health care. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Length of stay; Mortality; Psychiatric admission; Readmission; Weekend admission,adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; bipolar disorder; clinical outcome; controlled study; demography; drug dependence; female; health care quality; hospital admission; hospital mortality; hospital patient; hospital readmission; human; involuntary commitment; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical record; mental health care; mortality rate; national health insurance; population research; psychiatric department; schizophrenia; sex difference; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85068646917

In addition to catalyzing the production of sarcosine in the one carbon metabolism pathway, it plays a role in the detoxification of environmental carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene, aflatoxin B1, and aristocholic acid. There is also increasing evidence suggesting a role of GNMT deficiency in liver carcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss the role of GNMT in the detoxification of xenobiotics and the mechanism of GNMT suppression during liver tumorigenesis. The protective role of GNMT in the liver allows GNMT to not only serve as a marker of liver disease, but also potentially be applied in the treatment of liver disorders and hepatocellular carcinoma. We describe the potential use of GNMT in gene therapy and we introduce the development of a GNMT promoter reporter assay that can be used to screen medicinal drugs and herbal libraries for natural compounds with anti-cancer properties. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Detoxification; Drug screening; Gene therapy; Glycine N-methyltransferase; Hepatocellular carcinoma,carcinogen; environmental chemical; glycine methyltransferase; natural product; sarcosine; cancer gene therapy; detoxification; human; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell carcinoma; liver disease; nonhuman; nonviral gene therapy; promoter region; Review; tumor suppressor gene,2-s2.0-85067862481

Upon treatment of Hep3B cells with 6.25–100 μg/mL of BOPE for 72 h, its antiproliferative effect was shown to increase in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The observations, such as concentration-dependent elevation of LC3 fluorescent puncta, increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, no characteristic apoptotic nuclear fragmentation, and no significant effect on percentages of annexin V-positive apoptotic cells, confirmed the autophagy triggered by BOPE in Hep3B cells. Moreover, BOPE promoted ROS generation and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress through calcium ion-related AMPK/TSC2/mTOR and DAPK/Beclin-1 pathways, leading to autophagic cell death. Furthermore, our analysis showed that the major components of BOPE, tangeretin and nobiletin, exhibited a synergistic effect on the growth inhibition of Hep3B cells. Thus, these results suggest that BOPE may be used as a functional food against liver cancer. ? 2019",Autophagy; Bitter orange peel extract; Combination effect; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Polymethoxyflavones,,2-s2.0-85067173245

In this study, the presence of the various different molecular forms of NGAL in cat urine (uNGAL) was examined and whether these forms are correlated with different urinary diseases was explored. Results: One hundred and fifty-nine urine samples from cats with various different diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI, 22 cats), chronic kidney disease (CKD, 55 cats), pyuria (44 cats) and other non-renal and non-pyuria diseases (non-RP, 26 cats), as well as healthy animals (12 cats), were collected. The molecular forms of and concentrations of urinary NGAL in these cats were analyzed, and their uNGAL-to-creatinine ratio (UNCR) were determined. The cats with AKI had the highest UNCR (median: 2.92 × 10- 6), which was followed by pyuria (median: 1.43 × 10- 6) and CKD (median: 0.56 × 10- 6); all of the above were significantly higher than the healthy controls (median: 0.17 × 10- 6) (p &lt; 0.05). Three different NGAL molecular forms as well as the MMP-9 monomer were able to be detected in the cat urine samples. Moreover, the cases where urine NGAL monomer were present also had significantly higher levels of BUN (median: 18.9 vs 9.6 mmol/L) and creatinine (327.1 vs 168 umol/L). The presence of dimeric NGAL was found to be associated with urinary tract infections. Most cats in the present study (126/159, 79.2%) and more than half of healthy cats (7/12, 58.3%) had detectable NGAL/MMP-9 complex present in their urine. Conclusions: The monomeric and dimeric molecular forms of uNGAL suggest upper and lower urinary tract origins of disease, respectively, whereas the presence of the uNGAL/MMP-9 complex is able to be detected in most cats, including seemingly healthy ones. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Biomarker; Feline urinary diseases; MMP-9; Molecular forms; NGAL,creatinine; gelatinase B; monomer; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; biological marker; isoprotein; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; acute kidney failure; Article; cat; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; creatinine urine level; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; hospitalization; leukocyte count; neutrophil; nonhuman; protein urine level; pyuria; urea nitrogen blood level; urinalysis; urine culture; Western blotting; animal; cat disease; chemistry; classification; urinary tract disease; urine; veterinary medicine; Animals; Biomarkers; Cat Diseases; Cats; Lipocalin-2; Protein Isoforms; Urologic Diseases,2-s2.0-85071625954

Although such tests include several techniques for detecting low levels of mutant genes in wild-type backgrounds with fairly high sensitivity, most tests are not specific, and may exhibit high false positive rates. In this study, we describe a new primer structure, named 'stuntmer', to selectively suppress amplification of wild-type templates, and promote amplification of mutant templates. Results: A single stuntmer for a defined region of DNA can detect several kinds of mutations, including point mutations, deletions, and insertions. Stuntmer PCRs are also highly sensitive, being able to amplify mutant sequences that may make up as little as 0.1% of the DNA sample. Conclusion: In conclusion, our technique, stuntmer PCR, can provide a simple, low-cost, highly sensitive, highly accurate, and highly specific platform for developing companion diagnostic tests. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cancer; cfDNA; Mutation,Diagnosis; Patient treatment; Polymerase chain reaction; Cancer; cfDNA; Construction technique; Diagnostic tests; False positive rates; High sensitivity; Mutation; Personalized medicines; DNA sequences; cell free DNA; DNA; unclassified drug; Article; cost; diagnostic test; DNA determination; DNA sequence; DNA template; exon; gene amplification; gene deletion; gene insertion; mutational analysis; polymerase chain reaction; process development; sensitivity and specificity; wild type,2-s2.0-85071474480

Methods: We developed our prognostic models by applying a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) data. A data-splitting strategy was used for internal validation, and a multivariable fractional polynomial approach was adopted for prognostic continuous variables. Subjects who were Asian, black, or white in the US-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were analyzed for external validation. Model discrimination and calibration were evaluated in both internal and external datasets. Results: In the internal validation, both training data and testing data calibrated well and generated good area under the ROC curves (AUC; 0.865 in training data and 0.846 in testing data). In the external validation, although the AUC values were larger than 0.85 in all populations, a lack of model calibration in non-Asian groups revealed that racial differences had a significant impact on the prediction of breast cancer mortality. For the calibration of breast cancer-specific mortality, P values < 0.001 at 1 year and 0.018 at 4 years in whites, and P values ? 0.001 at 1 and 2 years and 0.032 at 3 years in blacks, indicated that there were significant differences (P value < 0.05) between the predicted mortality and the observed mortality. Our model generally underestimated the mortality of the black population. In the white population, our model underestimated mortality at 1 year and overestimated it at 4 years. And in the Asian population, all P values > 0.05, indicating predicted mortality and actual mortality at 1 to 4 years were consistent. Conclusions: We developed and validated a pioneering prognostic model that especially benefits breast cancer patients in Asia. This study can serve as an important reference for breast cancer prediction in the future. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Asian; Breast cancer; Model; Mortality; Prognosis; SEER; Survival; Taiwan Cancer Registry,adult; area under the curve; Article; Asian; Black person; breast cancer; calibration; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cancer specific survival; cancer survival; Caucasian; female; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; overall survival; prediction; race difference; receiver operating characteristic; Taiwan; validation process,2-s2.0-85070748231

Many risk factors were identified and interventions were applied accordingly, but the incidence of end-stage renal disease continued increasing. Some other risk factors may be ignored. Gut microbiota has been recognized as an important endogenous organ. The kidney-gut axis would contribute to gut dysbiosis, which might worsen CKD. Constipation, commonly seen in CKD, was one of the clinical presentation of gut dysbiosis. The clinical impact of constipation to CKD remains unknown. Our study aimed at assessing the risk of ESRD between CKD patients with and without constipation in a nationwide database. Methods: We identified newly diagnosed cases of CKD without constipation history before in 2000-2011 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Subjects who developed constipation later formed constipation group. The others without constipation matched by propensity score formed non-constipation group. The incidence rates and hazards of ESRD in patients with and without constipation by the end of 2013 were compared by using Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable. Results: The incidences of ESRD per 1000 person-years were 22.9 for constipation group and 12.2 for non-constipation group, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.90 (95% CI, 1.60-2.27). Compared to the CKD patients without constipation, adjusted hazard ratio for the CKD patients with laxatives < 33, 33-197 and ? 198 days per year were 0.45 (0.31-0.63), 1.85 (1.47-2.31) and 4.41 (3.61-5.39) respectively. Conclusion: In a population of newly-diagnosed CKD patients, we observed that subjects with de novo constipation, as compared with non-constipation, have increased risk of developing ESRD. More severe constipation would increase the risk further. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Chronic kidney disease; Constipation; End-stage renal disease; Gut microbiota; Kidney-gut axis,aluminum; analgesic agent; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antidiarrheal agent; antihistaminic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium; calcium channel blocking agent; diuretic agent; iron; laxative; narcotic analgesic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; serotonin 3 antagonist; spasmolytic agent; aged; Article; chronic kidney failure; comorbidity; constipation; disease association; disease severity; drug use; end stage renal disease; female; human; ICD-9-CM; incidence; major clinical study; male; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85070366207

Intracellular forces generated by the mitotic spindle are increasingly well understood, and recent work has revealed that the efficiency and the accuracy of mitosis is ensured by the scaling of mitotic spindle size with cell size. However, the role of the spindle in cancer progression has largely been ignored. Two recent studies point toward the role of mitotic spindle evolution in cancer progression through extracellular force generation. Cancer cells with lengthened spindles exhibit highly increased metastatic potential. Further, interpolar spindle elongation drives protrusive extracellular force generation along the mitotic axis to allow mitotic elongation, a morphological change that is required for cell division. Together, these findings open a new research area studying the role of the mitotic spindle evolution in cancer metastasis. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",force generation; microtubule motors; natural and cancer evolution; Spindles,kinesin 5; anaphase; Article; astral microtubule; cancer growth; cell size; cytokinesis; extracellular matrix; extracellular space; genetic variability; human; in vitro selection; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; metaphase; metastasis; metastasis potential; microtubule; mitosis; mitosis spindle; molecular evolution; nonhuman; telophase; tumor microenvironment; upregulation,2-s2.0-85068136166

However, treatment adherence and persistence are still a concern. Methods We constructed a retrospective population-based cohort of patients, who initiated statin treatment within 90 days after discharge from hospital for ASCVD using the claims database of Taiwan National Health Insurance. Proportion of days covered (PDC) was used to measure statin adherence, and PDC ?80% was defined as good adherence. The study outcomes were subsequent rehospitalisation or in-hospital death due to composite ASCVD, myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke. Their associations with statin prescription adherence or persistence were analysed using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model. Results The study cohort included 185 252 postdischarge statin initiators. There were 50 015 subsequent ASCVD rehospitalisations including 2858 in-hospital death during 7 years of study period. Good adherence was significantly associated with lower risk of ASCVD rehospitalisation (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.90; 95% CI 0.87 to 0.92) and significantly lower risk of in-hospital death (aHR 0.59; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.65). Compared with constant use of statin, patients in the three less persistent states (recent stop, non-persistence and intermittent use) were associated with higher risk of subsequent ASCVD rehospitalisation, aHRs were 1.16, 1.13 and 1.26, respectively (all p<0.05). The increased risks were consistent with specific outcome of acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. Also, patients in the recent stop period had significantly higher risk for fatal CV event. Conclusions Good adherence and persistence to statin therapy are significantly associated with lower risk of secondary ASCVD rehospitalisation and in-hospital death. ?

The effects of particulate air pollution on skeletal muscle mass is not known. The study aims to assess the chronic effects of ambient fine particulates (PM2.5) on the body composition of the elderly. From October 2015 to November 2016, a cross-sectional survey on 530 elderly (age?>?=?65 years) was conducted in the Taipei Basin, Taiwan. The body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody 120). One year exposure to air pollution was estimated using the Kriging method at the participant's residence. Multiple linear regression analysis, after adjustments for demographics and co-pollutants, was used to examine the effects of PM2.5 on body composition indices and force of handgrip. Changes in body composition for an interquartile (1.4?μm/m3) increase in PM2.5 concentration included a 0.4?kg (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.31, -0.58; p?<?0.0001) decrease in skeletal muscle mass (2.0%) and a 0.7?kg (95% CI: 0.47, 0.91; p?<?0.0001) increase in body fat mass (3.6%). While PM2.5 reduced fat free mass in the upper extremities and trunk, but not in the lower extremities, it increased body fat mass in the three parts. There was no significant effect of PM2.5 on handgrip force. Higher physical activity (versus lower than median) was associated with less detrimental effect of PM2.5 on skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass (p values for interaction term: 0.009 and 0.013, respectively). Long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass and increased body fat mass in the elderly, which can be ameliorated by physical activity.",,aged; air pollution; article; body fat; controlled study; fat free mass; female; hand grip; human; impedance; kriging; lower limb; major clinical study; male; multiple linear regression analysis; muscle mass; physical activity; pollutant; skeletal muscle; statistical significance; Taiwan; upper limb,2-s2.0-85071001171

This study aimed to develop a simple risk scale using decision tree methodology to guide physicians in managing critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients who will benefit from endovascular therapy (EVT).A total of 736 patients with CLI, Rutherford classification (RC) stage ?4, and prior successful EVT were included. Variables significantly associated with LEA by univariate analysis (P < .05) were selected and put into classification tree analysis using the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model with a dependent variable, amputation, and depth of tree = 3. Four risk groups were generated according to the order of amputation rate. The amputation-free survival (AFS) times between groups were compared using the Kaplan-Meier curve with the log-rank test.Patients were classified as high risk for amputation (G4) (WBC counts ?10,000/μl, and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) ?130.337); intermediate risk group 1 (G3) (WBC < 10,000/μl and RC stage before EVT > 5); intermediate risk group 2 (G2) (WBC count ? 10,000/μl, and PLR < 130.337) and low-risk group (G1) (WBC < 10,000/μl, RC before EVT ? 5). G2, G3, and G4 risk groups had shorter AFS time (range, 58.7 to 65.5 months) than the G1 risk group (100 months) (P < .05). Risk of LEA was significantly higher in the G4, G3, and G2 groups than in the G1 group (P ? .05). The G4 group had the highest risk of amputation (odds ratio = 6.84, P < .001).This simple risk scale model can help healthcare professionals more easily identify and appropriately treat patients with CLI who are at different levels of risk for LEA following endovascular revascularization. ? 2019 the Author(s).",amputation; critical limb ischemia; endovascular therapy; risk stratification,albumin; creatinine; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; aged; albumin blood level; amputation free survival; Article; chronic kidney failure; coronary artery disease; critical limb ischemia; decision tree; end stage renal disease; endovascular surgery; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; hematocrit; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; high risk population; human; iliac artery; intermediate risk population; leg amputation; leg revascularization; low risk population; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; neutrophil count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; observational study; platelet count; platelet lymphocyte ratio; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; amputation; endovascular surgery; ischemia; Kaplan Meier method; lower limb; middle aged; mortality; odds ratio; peripheral occlusive artery disease; postoperative complication; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk factor; treatment outcome; vascularization; Aged; Amputation; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Ischemia; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Postoperative Complications; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85070759554

This study utilized the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to decipher the toxic effects of early life exposure to DEHP on aging and its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that exposure to DEHP at 0.1 and 1.5 mg/L inhibited locomotive behaviors. In addition, DEHP exposure significantly shortened the mean lifespan of the worms and further adversely affected pharyngeal pumping rate and defecation cycle in aged worms. Moreover, DEHP exposure also further enhanced accumulation of age-related biomarkers including lipofuscin, lipid peroxidation, and intracellular reactive oxygen species in aged worms. In addition, exposure to DEHP significantly suppressed gene expression of hsp-16.1, hsp-16.49, and hsp-70 in aged worms. Further evidences showed that mutation of genes involved in insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) pathway (daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, akt-1, akt-2, and daf-16) restored lipid peroxidation accumulation upon DEHP exposure in aged worms, whereas skn-1 mutation resulted in enhanced lipid peroxidation accumulation. Therefore, IIS and SKN-1 may serve as an important molecular basis for DEHP-induced age-related declines in C. elegans. Since IIS and SKN-1 are highly conserved among species, the age-related declines caused by DEHP exposure may not be exclusive in C. elegans, leading to adverse human health consequences due to widespread and persistent DEHP contamination in the environment. Early life DEHP exposure causes age-related declines, leading to potential adverse human health consequences. ? 2019",Age-related declines; Caenorhabditis elegans; DEHP; Insulin/IGF-1 signaling; SKN-1,"Crops; Esters; Gene expression; Health; Health risks; Insulin; Lipids; Oxidation; Oxidative stress; Age-related; Agricultural crops; Caenorhabditis elegans; DEHP; Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate; Emerging contaminant; Reactive oxygen species; SKN-1; Chemical contamination; insulin; lipofuscin; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; reactive oxygen metabolite; somatomedin C; akt-2 protein, C elegans; biological marker; Caenorhabditis elegans protein; DNA binding protein; heat shock protein; hsp-16.1 protein, C elegans; insulin; lipofuscin; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; plasticizer; protein kinase B; reactive oxygen metabolite; skn-1 protein, C elegans; somatomedin C; transcription factor; aging; bioaccumulation; biomarker; gene expression; hormone; mutation; nematode; phthalate; population decline; reactive oxygen species; signaling; toxicity; age 1 gene; aged; aging; akt 1 gene; akt 2 gene; animal experiment; Article; bioaccumulation; Caenorhabditis elegans; controlled study; daf 16 gene; daf 2 gene; defecation; environmental exposure; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; hsp 16.1 gene; hsp 16.49 gene; hsp 70 gene; lifespan; lipid peroxidation; locomotion; nonhuman; pdk 1 gene; signal transduction; skn 1 gene; aging; animal; biosynthesis; drug effect; genetics; longevity; metabolism; pollutant; signal transduction; toxicity; Caenorhabditis elegans; Aging; Animals; Biomarkers; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Diethylhexyl Phthalate; DNA-Binding Proteins; Environmental Pollutants; Heat-Shock Proteins; Insulin; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Lipid Peroxidation; Lipofuscin; Longevity; Plasticizers; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-85066078542

We planned to examine HRV during the performance of psychological tasks, and assumed that it could be applied for the diagnosis of SSD. Methods: Fifty-three patients with SSD and 52 healthy controls were recruited. Demographic and psychological data were collected. Subjects' HRV was measured over five 5-minute blocks during which they viewed different scripts (resting state; health anxiety; somatic distress; depression; neutral topic). After each block they completed a self-assessment manikin. Generalized estimated equation analysis was used to analyze the impact of mental scripts, SSD and sex on physiological and psychological indicators. Results: In men there was a script*SSD interaction concerning high-frequency power (HF) involving the neutral script; SSD men showed significantly higher HF than healthy men when viewing neutral script. In women there were script*SSD interactions with respect to low-frequency power (LF) and HF involving the somatic distress script and a script*SSD interaction with respect to LF and emotional valence involving the neutral script; SSD women revealed significantly lower LF and HF than healthy women when viewing somatic distress script, they also showed significantly lower LF and higher valence than healthy ones during neutral script. The somatic distress script*SSD interaction still influenced LF and HF in women after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusion: In women cue-specific HRV is a better method of differentiating people with SSD from healthy individuals than resting-state HRV.

The immunological response of mono- and poly-functional T cells, a representative of host reactivity to NTM, could be a surrogate biomarker for disease and progression prediction. Background: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)and M. abscessus (MAB)induced lung disease (LD)have become a clinical concern. Predicting clinical disease relevance and progression is important, but suitable biomarkers are lacking. The host immune response of mono- and poly-functional T cells might aid in clinical judgement. Methods: We enrolled 140 participants, including 42 MAC-LD, 25 MAB-LD, 31 MAC airway colonization (MAC-Co), 15 MAB-Co patients, and 27 healthy controls. Their blood mono- and poly-functional T cells were measured and analyzed after in-vitro stimulation. Results: Patients with MAC-LD generally had lower total IFN-γ+, total TNF-α+ and triple-positive T cells but higher mono-IL-2+ expression than the controls and MAC-Co group. The MAB-LD group had lower total IL-2 and triple positive cells than the controls and colonization group. Multivariate analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI), mono-IL2+ CD4+ and triple positive-CD8+ cells (PMA stimulation)significantly predicted MAC-LD from the controls. By contrast, male gender and triple positive-CD4+ cells predicted MAC-LD from colonization. On the other hand, the triple positive-CD4+ cells (PMA stimulation)alone or together with the mock/MAB ratio of IL-2+/TNF-α+ CD4 cells could predict MAB-LD in the MAB-Co group or the controls. Among MAC/MAB-LD patients without anti-mycobacterial treatment, MAC-specific mono-IFN-γ+ CD4+ cells and PMA-induced triple positive-CD4+ cells were correlated with progression, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.875. Conclusions: The patients with MAC/MAB-LD had attenuated poly-functional T cells. The triple-positive CD4+ cells could be useful in diagnosing disease from colonization. MAC-specific mono-IFN-γ+ CD4+ cells and triple positive-CD4+ might predict radiographic progression, which could be useful in making treatment decisions. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Lung disease; Mycobacterium abscessus; Mycobacterium avium complex; Nontuberculous mycobacteria; Poly-functional T cells,gamma interferon; tumor necrosis factor; adult; Article; atypical mycobacteriosis; atypical Mycobacterium; bacterial colonization; blood level; body mass; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; decision making; disease course; female; human; immune response; immunocompromised patient; lung disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Mycobacterium abscessus; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; prospective study; risk assessment; T lymphocyte; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85065400831

Study design: A prospective randomized controlled study. Main outcome measures: Between-group differences in the probability of re-treatment for OAB between the 3-month and 6-month groups. Methods: Women with OAB were randomly allocated to receive solifenacin (5 mg per day)for a treatment interval of either 3 or 6 months. Results: Ninety-one patients were treated in each group. The probability of re-treatment did not differ between the 3-month and 6-month groups (P = 0.11). Parity (hazard ratio = 1.81, P = 0.001), number of incontinence episodes (hazard ratio = 1.09, P = 0.008)and suboptimal response (hazard ratio = 3.56, P = 0.006)were independent predictors of re-treatment of OAB. Physical limitation, as indicated on the King's Health Questionnaire, was the only independent factor predicting completion of the scheduled treatment period (odds ratio = 1.01, P = 0.008). Conclusions: Prolonged antimuscarinic treatment does not decrease the need for re-treatment of OAB. Nonetheless, female patients with increased parity, more severe incontinence and a suboptimal response to antimuscarinic treatment are more likely to seek re-treatment of OAB due to recurrence of symptoms.

We aimed to assess the CVD risk of HIV-positive Taiwanese outpatients. Methods: We did cross-sectional questionnaire interviews to collect information of HIV-positive Taiwanese patients aged 40–79 at the HIV clinics of a medical center from 1 March to 31 August, 2017. The Framingham Risk Score (FRS), Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk score and Data-Collection on Adverse effects of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) risk score were used to estimate their CVD risk. Results: Of the screened 1251 patients, 1006 (80.4%) with complete data to assess their CVD risk were included for analyses. The prevalence of patients aged 40–75 and with a high CVD risk was 30.6% by FRS, 3.7% by D:A:D (R) risk score, and 22.2% by ASCVD risk score. In multiple logistic regression, older age, current smoking, higher systolic blood pressure, and higher triglyceride and fasting glucose levels were independently associated with the ASCVD risk score ?7.5%. If current smokers aged 55–59 had stopped smoking, the proportions of them with a 10-year CVD risk of ?10% by FRS and ?7.5% by ASCVD risk score would have decreased by 35.3% and 20.0%, respectively. Conclusions: Higher CVD risk estimates among HIV-positive Taiwanese aged 40–75 were associated with an older age, current smoking, higher systolic blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperglycemia. Smoking cessation could potentially lead to significant decreases of CVD risk. ? 2019",Antiretroviral therapy; Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); Comorbidity; Data-collection on adverse effects of anti-HIV drugs (D:A:D); Framingham equation,anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; antiretroviral therapy; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; CD4 lymphocyte count; cholesterol blood level; coronary artery atherosclerosis; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; female; follow up; Framingham risk score; glucose level; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hypertriglyceridemia; major clinical study; male; risk reduction; smoking; smoking cessation; systolic blood pressure; Taiwanese; virus load; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; complication; epidemiology; hypertension; middle aged; prevalence; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Anti-HIV Agents; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular Diseases; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; HIV; HIV Infections; Humans; Hypertension; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Smoking; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85064600472

Methods: A human cell line (PANC-1) derived from the pancreatic ductal epithelium was used in this study. After transduction of OATP1B3, the cellular physiological functions and the ability of intracellular uptake of the MRI contrast medium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) were examined. Induced differentiation of the PANC-1 cells into hormone-secreting cells were performed to simulate pancreatic β-like cells. The hormone-secreting cells were implanted into rats and in vivo MRI was evaluated. Results: The mRNA and proteins of OATP1B3 were highly expressed. No significant change of cellular physiological functions was found after the expression. After induced differentiation, the hormone secretion capacities of the OATP1B3-expressing PANC-1 cells were confirmed. Intra-cellular uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA was determined in vitro by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and MRI. In vivo MRI of the OATP1B3-expressing xenograft revealed an increased signal intensity after contrast enhancement.

Methods: Patients underwent DCE integrated MR-PET imaging 1?week before CRT. The following parameters were analyzed: primary tumor size, gross tumor volume, maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), apparent?diffusion coefficient (ADC), volume transfer constant (Ktrans), reverse reflux rate constant (kep), extracellular extravascular volume fraction (ve), blood plasma volume fraction (vp), and initial area under the time-concentration curve defined over the first 60?s post-enhancement (iAUC60). CRT responses were defined using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version?1.1). Results: Thirty patients were included. Non-responders demonstrated higher baseline TLG (p?= 0.012), and lower baseline Ktrans (p?= 0.020) and iAUC60 (p?= 0.016) compared to responders, indicating the usefulness of DCE integrated MR-PET to predict treatment responses. Receiver operating characteristic?curve indicated that TLG has the best differentiation capability to predict responders. By setting the threshold of TLG to 277, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 66.7%, 83.3%, and 75.0%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.776. The median follow-up time was 19.6 (range 7.8–32.0) months. In univariate analyses, baseline TLG &gt;277 (p?= 0.005) and baseline Kt rans &lt;254 (10?3?min?1; p?= 0.015) correlated with poor survival after CRT. In multivariate analysis, baseline TLG &gt;277 remained the significant factor in predicting progression (p?= 0.012) and death (p?= 0.031). Conclusions: The radiologic parameters derived from DCE integrated MR-PET scans are useful for predicting treatment response in NSCLC patients treated with CRT; furthermore, these parameters are correlated with clinical and survival outcomes including tumor progression and death. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Glycolysis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neoplasms; Progression-free survival; Therapeutic uses,accuracy; adult; aged; apparent diffusion coefficient; area under the curve; area under the time concentration curve; Article; blood plasma volume fraction; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; clinical outcome; controlled study; death; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; extracellular extravascular volume fraction; female; follow up; glycolysis; human; male; maximum standardized uptake value; non small cell lung cancer; positron emission tomography; practice guideline; prospective study; radiological parameters; receiver operating characteristic; response evaluation criteria in solid tumors; reverse reflux rate constant; sensitivity and specificity; total lesion glycolysis; treatment response; tumor growth; tumor volume; very elderly; volume transfer constant,2-s2.0-85059584143

Methods: To determine whether the simpler urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) calculated from spot urine samples could be accurately used for proteinuria monitoring in patients receiving lenvatinib, we evaluated the correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein results from the phase 3 REFLECT study. Paired data (323 tests, 154 patients) were analysed. Results: Regression analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein (R2: 0.75; P &lt; 2 × 10?16). A UPCR cut-off value of 2.4 had 96.9% sensitivity, 82.5% specificity for delineating between grade 2 and 3 proteinuria. Using this UPCR cut-off value to determine the need for further testing could reduce the need for 24-hour urine collection in ~74% of patients. Conclusion: Incorporation of UPCR into the current algorithm for proteinuria management can enable optimisation of lenvatinib treatment, while minimising patient inconvenience.

Study design: Retrospective study. Methods: The clinical entities and surgical outcomes of the patients who were histologically confirmed with a diagnosis of lacrimal adenoid cystic carcinoma in National Taiwan University Hospital between January 1995 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Enrolled were 11 patients. The median follow-up was 7.2 years. Eight patients (72.7%) were diagnosed as T1 or T2 disease, and three patients (27.3%) were diagnosed as T3 or T4 disease according to the AJCC 8th edition guideline. Eye-sparing surgery with radiotherapy was performed in nine patients. Local recurrence was noted in six patients (54.5%) with median disease-free interval of 23.5 months. Six patients (54.5%) developed distant metastases, including lung, bone, and cranial invasions. Overall survival rate during the study period was 54.6%. Five-year overall survival was 81.8% and ten-year overall survival was 68.2%.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major compound of Gram-negative bacteria, with stimulatory activities in some cancer types, but has not been fully studied in PCa. In this study, we examined the effect of LPS on the invasion of PCa cells. Interestingly, LPS can enhance the invasiveness of PCa, but had no significant effect on PCa cell viability. Using protease inhibitor screening and biochemical analyses, matriptase, a member of the membrane-anchored serine protease family, is found to play a key role in LPS-induced PCa cell invasion. Mechanistically, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4, LPS receptor)-sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) signaling underlies LPS-induced matriptase activation and PCa cell invasion. Specifically, LPS induced the S225 phosphorylation of SphK1 and the translocation of SphK1 to plasma membrane, leading to the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), ERK1/2 and matriptase activation via S1P receptor 4 (S1PR4). This phenomenon is further validated using the patient-derived explant (PDE) model. Indeed, there is a significant correlation among the elevated SphK1 levels, the Gleason grades of PCa specimens, and the poor survival of PCa patients. Taken together, this study demonstrates a potential impact of LPS on PCa progression. Our results provide not only a new finding of the role of bacterial infection in PCa progression but also potential therapeutic target(s) associated with PCa metastasis. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,bacterium lipopolysaccharide; matriptase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; sphingosine 1 phosphate; sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor; sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor 4; sphingosine kinase; sphingosine kinase 1; toll like receptor 4; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterial infection; biochemical analysis; cancer growth; cancer survival; cell invasion; cell membrane; cell migration; cell viability; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; Gleason score; human; human cell; human tissue; male; metastasis; mouse; NOD SCID mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein expression level; protein transport; recurrence free survival; signal transduction; tumor invasion; upregulation,2-s2.0-85066807958

Methods: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and DA tests were performed in diabetic patients and nondiabetic controls. DA was measured using AdaptDx dark adaptometer and the rod intercept was recorded. Macular OCTA images were acquired using the RTVue XR Avanti with AngioVue. Results: Eighty-six eyes from 57 patients with diabetes (19 with no DR, 19 with non-proliferative DR [NPDR], and 19 with proliferative DR [PDR] who had undergone photocoagulation) and 10 eyes from 10 patients without diabetes were recruited. A significant decrease in vascular density and a prolonged rod intercept were found as DR progressed (P &lt;.01). A negative trend was found between vascular density and the rod intercept. The negative trend in the deep layer (R2 = 0.28) was more substantial than that in the superficial layer (R2 = 0.14). A prolonged rod intercept was associated with elevated HbA1c (R2 = 0.08). Conclusions: The vascular density of the macula could be assessed by OCTA and the functional change in the outer retina could be measured non-invasively by DA. The severity of decreasing vascular density and prolongation of DA are proportional to progression of DR. Decreased deep retinal vascular perfusion density and impaired DA response are correlated and show a negative trend according to the severity of DR. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Correlation; Dark adaptation; Diabetic retinopathy; Optical coherence tomography angiography; Retinal vascular perfusion density,"hemoglobin A1c; adult; Article; blood vessel parameters; clinical evaluation; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dark adaptation; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; diabetic retinopathy; disease association; female; human; laser coagulation; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy; observational study; optical coherence tomography angiography; priority journal; proliferative diabetic retinopathy; retina macula lutea; retina rod; retinal rod outer segment; retinal vascular perfusion density; retrospective study; trend study; visual system parameters; aged; blood flow; capillary; dark adaptation; diabetic retinopathy; fluorescence angiography; follow up; optical coherence tomography; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; retina blood vessel; visual acuity; Aged; Capillaries; Dark Adaptation; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Macula Lutea; Male; Middle Aged; Regional Blood Flow; Retinal Vessels; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity",2-s2.0-85064667988

However, the role of hyperuricemia in the progression of CKD remains unclear. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of febuxostat, a first line urate-lowering agent, in CKD patients with hyperuricemia. METHODS: We have systematically searched for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of febuxostat versus control in CKD patients with hyperuricemia through MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. All statistical analyses were conducted by using the statistical package Review Manager, version 5.3.5. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q and I tests and summary statistics were reported with 95% confidence interval. Two-tailed test was used for analysis and a P value of <.05 is considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Eleven eligible trials with 1317 participants were included in the meta-analysis. A significant reduction in serum uric acid was found in the febuxostat treated group. Also, a significant higher eGFR was found in the febuxostat treated group among CKD stage 3 and 4 patients. No significant difference of major complication or death was identified between treatment and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis showed that other than its urate-lowering effect, febuxostat presented a reno-protective effect in CKD patients.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed and Embase (1966-February 2019). Selection criteria Prospective cohort studies were included for meta-analysis if they reported adjusted HRs with 95% CIs for associations between risk of all-cause mortality, stroke, major cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease and low fasting glucose levels (<4.6 mmol/L and/or 4.0 mmol/L, respectively) versus normal fasting glucose levels. Data extraction and statistical analysis Two independent reviewers extracted data from eligible studies. Heterogeneity was assessed by p value of χ 2 tests and I 2. We assessed four characteristics for each included study based on items developed by the US Preventive Task Force, as well as the modified checklist used in previous studies. Results Eleven articles (consisting of 129 prospective cohort studies) with 2 674 882 participants without diabetes and cardiovascular disease at baseline were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled results from the random effects model showed increased risks of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.56; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.23), total stroke (HR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.13) and ischaemic stroke (HR: 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10), and major cardiovascular events (HR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.07) among people with a fasting glucose <4.0 mmol/L, as compared with people with normal fasting glucose. The less stringent low fasting glucose level, <4.6 mmol/L, was not associated with increased risk of any endpoints. Discussion and conclusions Among people without baseline diabetes or cardiovascular disease, a fasting blood glucose level of <4.0 mmol/L is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events and stroke. ?

Methods: A total of 72 lung cancer outpatients and their family caregivers participated in this study. Family caregivers completed the Kingston Caregiver Stress Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-Compassion Scale, and Compassion from Others Scale. Patients completed the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), BDI-II, and FFMQ. Results: After controlling for patients' factors (treatment status, symptom distress, and depressive symptoms) and caregivers' health status, caregivers' stress and dispositional mindfulness, the domain of mindful awareness, and self-compassionate action were significantly associated with their depressive symptoms. Further analysis indicated that mindful awareness or self-compassionate action could buffer the effect of caregiving stress on depressive symptoms. When the two moderators, mindful awareness and self-compassionate action, were tested simultaneously, only self-compassionate action remained as a significant moderating effect. Conclusions: Caregivers' mindful awareness and self-compassionate action were protective factors, which mitigate the impact of caregiving stress on their depressive symptoms. Therefore, the future supportive program aims at training the competencies of self-compassionate action with mindful awareness, which may enhance caregivers' coping resources. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",compassion from others; dispositional mindfulness; family caregiver; lung cancer; self-compassion,adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; cancer patient; caregiver; caregiver burden; compassion; depression; empathy; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30; female; Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire; health status; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mindfulness; outpatient; psychological rating scale; questionnaire; self compassion; Self Compassion Scale; stress; symptom,2-s2.0-85067697730

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among non-pediatric TB patients registered in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 2002–2013. Diabetes, AMI, and stroke incidence were defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes, drug prescriptions, and records of patient's clinic visits. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard rate ratio (HR) of incident diabetes, AMI, and stroke. Results: From 2002–2013, there were 157,444 patients treated for TB registered in NHIRD. Among 129,453 patients with no prior history of diabetes, the age-adjusted incidence rate (IR) of diabetes was 3.85 (95%CI 3.70–4.01) per 1000 person-years. Among 143,646 patients with no prior history of AMI, the age-adjusted IR of AMI as 3.26 (95%CI 3.13–3.40). Among 118,774 patients with no prior history of stroke, the age-adjusted IR of stroke was 16.08 (95%CI 15.76–16.32). Conclusions: Chronic non-communicable disease risk factors like dyslipidemia, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease diagnosed before time of TB diagnosis were predictive of diabetes, AMI, and stroke incidence. ? 2019 The Authors",Diabetes; Incidence; Myocardial infarction; Stroke; Tuberculosis,acute heart infarction; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; data base; diabetes mellitus; follow up; human; ICD-9; incidence; major clinical study; national health insurance; prescription; retrospective study; Taiwan; tuberculosis; cerebrovascular accident; complication; diabetes mellitus; female; heart infarction; male; middle aged; proportional hazards model; tuberculosis; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Stroke; Taiwan; Tuberculosis; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85066446807

We present a case of primary ovarian mucinous carcinoid tumor, atypical type, and review the reported cases. Case report: A 33-year-old woman with a left ovarian tumor was diagnosed with primary ovarian mucinous carcinoid tumor, atypical type. She underwent left salpingo-oophorectomy and ipsilateral lymph node dissection. After 5 years, the tumor recurred on the right side, with large para-aortic lymphadenopathy that caused hydronephrosis. Complete surgical staging was performed, followed by nine cycles of weekly paclitaxel and gemcitabine. The tumor progressed after discontinuing the chemotherapy, and the patient died of disease 26 months after recurrence. Conclusion: Our patient demonstrated a more aggressive clinical course compared to that reported in previous literature. Based on this experience, complete surgical staging is highly recommended after the patient accomplished her fertility plan. Ovarian carcinoid tumors are relatively chemoresistant compared with epithelial ovarian cancers. The regimen of weekly paclitaxel and gemcitabine stabilized the disease but did not reach remission of the tumor. Further studies are required to determine the appropriate chemotherapy regimen. ? 2019",Carcinoid; Mucinous; Ovary,carcinoembryonic antigen; chromogranin A; estrogen receptor; gemcitabine; paclitaxel; synaptophysin; transcription factor Cdx2; adult; appendectomy; Article; ascites; cancer chemotherapy; cancer staging; carcinoid; case report; cell granule; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; cytoreductive surgery; echography; female; gastrointestinal endoscopy; human; hydronephrosis; hysterectomy; lymph node dissection; menorrhagia; menstruation disorder; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pelvis lymph node; primary ovarian mucinous carcinoid tumor; primary tumor; salpingooophorectomy; tumor biopsy; x-ray computed tomography,2-s2.0-85066122213

Nevertheless, few studies have demonstrated the efficacy of first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs in patients harboring the uncommon p.L747P and p.L747S mutations in exon 19 of EGFR. Materials and methods: From 2005–2018, we identified patients with lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR p.L747P or p.L747S mutations using DNA and cDNA sequencing or commercial kits and recorded their clinical data. Published data pertaining to these mutations were also reviewed. Results: Twelve eligible patients were enrolled at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), and ten additional patients were identified in published literature. In NTUH cohort, the direct DNA sequencing had a 60.0% (3 of 5 patients)false-negative rate, and use of commercial kits all caused misidentification of EGFR p.L747P or p.L747S. Of the 7 patients receiving EGFR TKI treatment, five stage-IV lung adenocarcinoma patients that received afatinib had a 80.0% objective response rate (ORR), while two patients administered gefitinib or erlotinib showed a 0% ORR. The median progression-free survival (PFS)rates were 11.97 and 0.92 months (P = 0.012)for afatinib and gefitinib/erlotinib, respectively. No patients (0%)acquired p.T790 M resistance after failure of afatinib (n = 3). Of 10 patients harboring EGFR p.L747P from published literature, six patients used first-generation EGFR TKIs as treatment also showed 0% ORR and 1.00 month median PFS. Conclusions: Patients with the uncommon EGFR mutations p.L747P and p.L747S could be incorrectly classified as having wild-type EGFR or a 19DEL when using direct DNA sequencing or commercial kits. Moreover, use of afatinib may provide significantly improved PFS in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with one of these two EGFR mutations. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor; Lung adenocarcinoma; p.L747P; p.L747S; Uncommon EGFR mutation,afatinib; complementary DNA; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; gefitinib; leucine; proline; serine; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer resistance; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical article; cohort analysis; DNA sequence; drug efficacy; drug response; EGFR gene; female; gene mutation; human; human tissue; lack of drug effect; lung adenocarcinoma; male; middle aged; priority journal; progression free survival; treatment planning; trend study; very elderly,2-s2.0-85065893640

VEGF is an angiogenic inducer, which promotes tumor angiogenesis, leading to rapid tumor growth and metastasis. VEGF could be substantially induced in the Ni-mediated Hep G2 cells. Through LFPF treatment, the Ni-induced VEGF generation could be suppressed significantly. The inhibition of HIF-1α expression by blocking phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, and the suppression of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT 3), and Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (RAF1)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK1/2)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathways are important molecular mechanisms for the LFPF action. LFPF should probably reduce the risk of liver cancer in Ni-contaminated environments by inhibiting VEGF expression. Practical applications: LFPF mainly contained (-)-epicatechin and proanthocyanidin A2. Our results demonstrated that LFPF considerably suppressed the Ni-induced VEGF expression through inhibition of JAK2/STAT 3 and RAF1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathways and prohibited HIF-1α expression through blocking PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

To better understand the impact of migraine on the quality of life of individuals with this diagnosis, and how these might differ from one country or culture to another, reliable and valid measures of quality of life that are available in different languages are needed. To address this need, here we (1) translated the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire into Chinese (MSQv2.1-C), and (2) examined the psychometric properties of the measure. Methods: Forward and backward translation was conducted using four bilingual experts. One native speaker finalized the translation. Cognitive testing was performed by interviewing 11 monolingual migraineurs, and modifications were made to the MSQv2.1-C, as appropriate. Next, 174 individuals with a history of migraine completed the MSQv2.1-C, along with the SF-12, Migraine Disability Assessment Scale, and numerical rating scale s assessing pain intensity. We then evaluated the reliability and validity of the MSQv2.1-C by performing analyses to evaluate its internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, criterion validity, and construct validity. Results: The MSQv2.1-C scales demonstrated (1) good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha s ? 0.81); (2) good 1-week test-retest reliability (intra-class coefficients ?0.69 and Spearman's rho correlation coefficients ?0.74); (3) convergent validity (positive correlations with the MSQ and SF-12 scales [rho range = 0.27 to 0.37, ps < 0.05]); (4) criterion validity (negative correlations [rho range = - 0.51 to - 0.25, ps < 0.05]) between the MSQv2.1-C scales and pain-related criterion variables; and (5) construct validity (item factor loadings ranging from 0.71 to 0.96 [> 0.5]).

In the present study, we determined the functions and mechanisms of hirsutanolA (HA), which is isolated from the red alga-derived marine fungus Chondrostereum sp. NTOU4196, on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators produced from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated THP-1 cells. Our results showed that HA suppressed LPS-triggered MMP-9-mediated gelatinolysis and expression of protein and mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner without effects on TIMP-1 activity. Also, HA significantly attenuated the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β from LPS-treated THP-1 cells. Moreover, HA significantly inhibited LPS-mediated STAT3 (Tyr705) phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and ERK1/2 activation in THP-1 cells. In an LPS-induced endotoxemia mouse model, studies indicated that HA pretreatment improved endotoxemia-induced acute sickness behavior, including acute motor deficits and anxiety-like behavior. HA also attenuated LPS-induced phospho-STAT3 and pro-MMP-9 activity in the hippocampus. Notably, HA reduced pathologic lung injury features, including interstitial tissue edema, infiltration of inflammatory cells and alveolar collapse. Likewise, HA suppressed the induction of phospho-STAT3 and pro-MMP-9 in lung tissues. In conclusion, our results provide pharmacological evidence that HA could be a useful agent for treating inflammatory diseases, including sepsis. ? 2019 by the authors.",Acute lung injury (ALI); Acute sickness behavior; Interleukin (IL); Lipopolysaccharide (LPS); Matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9); Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),"antiinflammatory agent; gelatinase B; hirsutanol A; I kappa B kinase alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; STAT3 protein; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; cytokine; gelatinase B; hirsutanol A; lipopolysaccharide; sesquiterpene; acute lung injury; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; anxiety disorder; Article; attenuation; body weight loss; cell viability; controlled study; cytokine production; drug determination; drug effect; endotoxemia; enzyme activation; gene expression; hippocampus; human; human cell; inflammatory cell; lung edema; lung infiltrate; male; motor dysfunction; mouse; nonhuman; protein degradation; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; THP-1 cell line; acute lung injury; animal; C57BL mouse; complication; drug effect; endotoxemia; illness behavior; lung; metabolism; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Acute Lung Injury; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytokines; Endotoxemia; Humans; Illness Behavior; Lipopolysaccharides; Lung; Male; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Sesquiterpenes; Signal Transduction; THP-1 Cells",2-s2.0-85067411175

The clinical courses, characteristics, methods to identify the suture exposure and treatment were presented. Results: The clinical presentations including local erosion of upper bulbar conjunctiva, corneal abrasion lines, local corneal epithelial defects with rough border, and subepithelial opacity were noticed in all four patients. RCE symptoms exaggerated in eye blinking and did not respond to artificial tears treatment. Erosion recurred soon after the removal of therapeutic contact lenses. They underwent blepharoplasty 1–10?years before RCE emerged, and the RCE lasted 1–8?months before suture exposure was found. RCE healed within 1?week after suture removal.

Patients with presumed sepsis were included. Serum PCT levels were measured at admission. Quick SOFA score and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria were calculated for each patient. PCT levels were assigned into 0, 1, and 2 points for a serum level of <0.25, 0.25 to 2, and >2ng/mL, and added to the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score. The incremental value of PCT to qSOFA was then evaluated by logistic regression, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and reclassification analysis.In all, 1318 patients with presumed severe infection were enrolled with a 30-day mortality of 13.5%. Serum level of PCT showed a high correlation with qSOFA score and 30-day inhospital mortality. The area under the ROC curve was 0.56 for SIRS criteria, 0.67 for qSOFA score, and 0.73 for qSOFA-PCT in predicting 30-day mortality. The risk prediction improvement was reflected by a net reclassification improvement of 35% (17%-52%). Incorporation of PCT into the qSOFA model could raise the sensitivity to 86.5% (95% confidence interval 80.6%-91.2%). In the validation cohort, qSOFA-PCT greatly improved the sensitivity to 90.9%.A simple modification of qSOFA score by adding the ordinal scale of PCT value to qSOFA could greatly improve the suboptimal sensitivity problem of qSOFA and may serve as a quick screening tool for early identification of sepsis. ? 2019 Oxford University Press.

No enamel defects were observed in Fam83h null mice suggesting that Fam83h truncation mice would better replicate human mutations. Methods: We generated and characterized a mouse model (Fam83hTr/Tr) expressing a truncated FAM83H protein (amino acids 1–296), which recapitulated the ADHCAI-causing human FAM83H p.Tyr297* mutation. Results: Day 14 and 7-week Fam83hTr/Tr molars exhibited rough enamel surfaces and slender cusps resulting from hypoplastic enamel defects. The lateral third of the Fam83hTr/Tr incisor enamel layer was thinner, with surface roughness and altered enamel rod orientation, suggesting disturbed enamel matrix secretion. Regular electron density in mandibular incisor enamel indicated normal enamel maturation. Only mildly increased posteruption attrition of Fam83hTr/Tr molar enamel was observed at 7-weeks. Histologically, the Fam83hTr/Tr enamel organ, including ameloblasts, and enamel matrices at sequential stages of amelogenesis exhibited comparable morphology without overt abnormalities, except irregular and less evident ameloblast Tomes' processes in specific areas. Conclusions: Considering Fam83h?/? mice showed no enamel phenotype, while Fam83hTr/Tr (p.Tyr297*) mice displayed obvious enamel malformations, we conclude that FAM83H truncation mutations causing ADHCAI in humans disturb amelogenesis through a neomorphic mechanism, rather than haploinsufficiency. ? 2019 The Authors.

The current paradigm for meta-analyses requires a presentation of the means under a random-effects model; however, a mean with a confidence interval provides an incomplete summary of the underlying heterogeneity in meta-analysis. Prediction intervals show the range of true effects in future studies and have been advocated to be regularly presented. Most commonly, prediction intervals are estimated assuming that the underlying heterogeneity follows a normal distribution, which is not necessarily appropriate. In this article, we provide a simple method with a ready-to-use spreadsheet file to estimate prediction intervals and predictive distributions nonparametrically. Simulation studies show that this new method can provide approximately unbiased estimates compared with the conventional method. We also illustrate the advantage and real-world significance of this approach with a meta-analysis evaluating the protective effect of vaccination against tuberculosis. The nonparametric predictive distribution provides more information about the shape of the underlying distribution than does the conventional method. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",meta-analysis; normality assumption; prediction interval; predictive distribution,"algorithm; computer simulation; confidence interval; human; literature; meta analysis (topic); normal distribution; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; statistical analysis; statistical model; tuberculosis; vaccination; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Confidence Intervals; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Models, Statistical; Normal Distribution; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Review Literature as Topic; Tuberculosis; Vaccination",2-s2.0-85066941731

Methods: Sixty-three patients with pathological diagnosis of SGC were enroled retrospectively. The clinicopathological features, treatments, and outcomes were collected. Prognostic factors associated with the outcome of local recurrence, regional lymph node metastasis, and tumour-related death were analysed. The performance analysis was performed by comparing the predictive value for survival and the monotonicity of gradients between the 7th and 8th staging systems. Results: The distribution of T1:T2:T3:T4 tumours according to the 7th and 8th edition was 6:40:16:1 and 23:26:5:9, respectively. Positive surgical margin was a poor prognostic factor. Local recurrence was associated with more aggressive histopathological features and surrounding structure invasions. Regional lymph node metastasis was associated with larger tumours. The T category of 8th edition showed better predictability for local recurrence and regional lymph node metastasis, while the T category of 7th edition had better monotonicity of gradients. Tumours classified as T2c or worse had higher risk of regional lymph node metastasis, while tumours T3b or worse in the 8th edition had more tumour-related death. Conclusions: Patients with higher T category are at risk of regional lymph node metastasis and tumour-related death. Further refinement of the T category of AJCC staging system can focus on the predictability for local recurrence and the monotonicity of gradients. ? 2019, ? 2019, The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.",,adult; aged; Article; brain metastasis; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer survival; Chinese; eyelid carcinoma; eyelid reconstruction; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; liver metastasis; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; perineural invasion; predictive value; recurrent disease; retrospective study; sebaceous carcinoma; surgical margin; Taiwan; very elderly,2-s2.0-85066784038

Here, we found that MT-1 expression was suppressed by 14-3-3ε, and MT-1 overexpression abolished 14-3-3ε-induced cell proliferation and tumor growth. We identified that 14-3-3ε induced expression of ZNF479, a novel potential transcriptional regulator by gene expression profiling and ZNF479 contributed to 14-3-3ε-suppressed MT-1 expression. ZNF479 induced the expression of DNMT1, UHRF1, and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex proteins (ASH2L and Menin), and increased tri-methylated histone H3 (H3K4me3) levels, but suppressed H3K4 (H3K4me2) di-methylation. ZNF479-suppressed MT-1 expression was restored by silencing of ASH2L and DNMT1. Furthermore, ZNF479 expression was higher in HCC tissues than that in the non-cancerous tissues. Expression analyses revealed a positive correlation between the expression of ZNF479 and DNMT1, UHRF1, ASH2L, and Menin, and an inverse correlation with that of ZNF479, ASH2L, Menin, and MT-1 isoforms. Moreover, correlations between the expression of ZNF479 and its downstream factors were more pronounced in HCC patients with hepatitis B. Here, we found that ZNF479 regulates MT-1 expression by modulating ASH2L in HCC. Approaches that target ZNF479/MLL complex/MT-1 or related epigenetic regulatory factors are potential therapeutic strategies for HCC. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; histone H3; metallothionein I; methionine; mixed lineage leukemia protein; protein 14 3 3; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; ash2l gene; cancer chemotherapy; carcinogenesis; cell function; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene; gene control; gene expression; gene silencing; histone methylation; human; human cell; human tissue; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; tumor growth; tumor volume; uhrf1 gene; znf479 gene,2-s2.0-85066318960

Staphylococcal toxin genes were analysed to identify potential health concerns. Methods and Results: Samples were obtained from 441 dogs and 9 workers. The respective isolation rates of S. aureus and MRSA were 49·0% (216/441) and 1·6% (7/441) for shelter dogs and 44·4% (4/9) and 33·3% (3/9) for workers, respectively.

This paper identifies the effects of AIS on the end-point control and on angular kinematics of the trunk and pelvis-leg apparatus during obstacle-crossing for both the concave- and convex-side limb leading. Materials and Methods: Sixteen adolescents with severe Lenke 1 AIS (age: 14.9 ± 1.7 years, height: 154.7 ± 5.0 cm)and sixteen healthy controls (age: 14.8 ± 2.7 years, height: 154.9 ± 5.6 cm)each walked and crossed obstacles of 3 heights with either the concave- (AIS-A)or convex-side (AIS-V)limb leading. Angular motions of the trunk, pelvis and lower limbs, and toe-obstacle clearances were measured. Two-way analyses of variance were used to study between-subject (group)and within-subject (limb and height)effects on the variables. Whenever a height effect was found, a polynomial test was used to determine the linear trend. α = 0.05 was set for all tests. Results: Patients with AIS significantly reduced pelvic downward list but increased dorsiflexion in both stance and swing ankles at leading limb crossing when compared to controls (p < 0.05). During AIS-A, additional kinematic modifications were observed, i.e., increased stance hip adduction (4.2 ± 0.8°, p = 0.005)and increased swing knee flexion (12.6 ± 1.4°, p = 0.106), with significantly decreased leading toe-clearance (AIS-A: 121.4 ± 6.7 mm, controls: 140.1 ± 5.6 mm, p = 0.031). Conclusions: Patients with AIS adopted an altered kinematic strategy for successful obstacle-crossing. With the concave-side limb leading, more joint kinematic modifications with reduced toe-clearance were found when compared to those during the convex-side limb leading, suggesting an increased risk of tripping. Further studies on the kinematic strategies adopted by different types of AIS will be needed for a more complete picture of the functional adaptations in such patient group. ? 2019",Gait; Kinematics; Obstacle; Scoliosis,"adduction; adolescent; adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; ankle; Article; clinical article; controlled study; gait; human; joint mobility; kinematics; knee function; limb movement; pelvis; priority journal; standing; thoracic spine; trunk; adaptation; biomechanics; case control study; female; male; pathophysiology; scoliosis; severity of illness index; walking; Adaptation, Physiological; Adolescent; Biomechanical Phenomena; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Scoliosis; Severity of Illness Index; Walking",2-s2.0-85065227370

Methods: This nationwide study enrolled patients receiving CM (N = 10,274) from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2010, from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Through a 2-year mirror-image comparison weighted by the contributed person-time for each subject, we evaluated changes in medical utilization. Furthermore, a case-crossover analysis was used to verify the independent effect of CM in changing medical utilization by adjusting the time-variant variables between the pre-2-year (within 2 years before receiving CM) and post-2-year (within years after receiving CM) periods. The same methodology was applied for the subsequent 2-year comparison to assess the maintenance effect. Results: Of the 10,274 patients receiving CM, 69.7% had schizophrenia. The results showed a chronological trend for the intervention of CM. The adjusted mirror-image analysis revealed a significant decrement of psychiatric and involuntary admissions after the intervention, and the utilization shifted toward psychiatric outpatient service. The case-crossover analysis with the adjustment of time-variant covariates confirmed the independent effect of CM on the changes of medical utilization. The comparable effect persisted after the next 2 years of intervention. However, CM showed no impact on lowering the admission rate for comorbid physical illnesses after the intervention. Conclusions: The CM model can effectively reduce psychiatric hospitalization and involuntary admission frequency but has no effect on comorbid physical illnesses. Care models aimed at ameliorating physical problems in such patients are needed. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Case management; Case-crossover study; Health service; Home care; Severe mental disorder,corticosteroid; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; bipolar disorder; case management; comorbidity; controlled study; disease severity; female; health care utilization; health insurance; home care; hospitalization; human; intensive care; length of stay; long term care; major clinical study; male; mental disease; methodology; middle aged; physical disease; priority journal; psychoeducation; regression analysis; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; urbanization; very elderly; young adult,2-s2.0-85065120852

Mercury (Hg) contamination in rivers, irrigation canals, and wetlands has been found in Taiwan, but a thorough investigation on the distribution of Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) in these waters and sediments, which may be present in a greater level with elevating total Hg (THg) concentration and markedly impact human health, is still lacking. In this study, surface waters and surface sediments were sampled from five major rivers, two irrigation canals, two reservoirs, and one wetland in Taiwan, and their THg and MeHg concentrations were quantified. Additionally, statistical analysis was carried out to understand the relationship between sediment properties and MeHg levels. The results showed that irrigation canal sediments were relatively more polluted by Hg and the THg concentrations of some sampling points exceeded the upper limit (i.e., 0.87?mg?kg?1) of sediment quality index (SQI) for THg promulgated by Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration, which may be attributed to the co-use of irrigation and drainage canals. Furthermore, the MeHg concentration in irrigation canal sediments was the highest; rivers came in second followed by wetlands. In addition, the Siangshan Wetland was analyzed to have the greatest THg and MeHg concentrations in its surface water. Linear regression analysis also indicated that total organic carbon and clay content substantially affected the MeHg production in sediments. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Irrigation canal; Mercury; Methylmercury; Reservoir; River; Surface sediment; Wetland,"fluvial deposit; irrigation; mercury (element); methylmercury; reservoir; spatial distribution; surface water; wastewater treatment; wetland; Taiwan; mercury; methylmercury derivative; analysis; environmental monitoring; river; sediment; Taiwan; water pollutant; wetland; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Mercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Rivers; Taiwan; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Wetlands",2-s2.0-85064930273

This study aims to identify and characterise novel factors potentially related to TGF-β-mediated tumour aggression in breast cancer. We treated the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A with TGF-β and observed TGF-β-dependent upregulation of FBN1, involving demethylation of CpG sites, in MCF10A cells undergoing EMT. The biological importance of fibrillin-1, encoded by FBN1, was evaluated through immunohistochemistry on 225 breast cancer specimens of various subtypes. Fibrillin-1 expression was observed only in metaplastic carcinoma of the breast (MCB) (51.7%), and the expression was observed in spindle sarcomatous metaplasia (SSM), but not in other metaplasia, including matrix-producing, pleomorphic, and squamous metaplasia, and carcinomatous components of both MCB and non-MCB. Fibrillin-1 expression was also restricted to the SSM of non-mammary carcinosarcomas of various organs. Overall, fibrillin-1 expression was enriched in MCB and non-mammary carcinosarcoma with SSM (93.7% and 93.3%, respectively), but not in MCBs and non-mammary carcinosarcoma without SSM. FBN1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells with high FBN1 expression did not compromise migration, invasion, and tumourigenesis, and did not alter the expression of other EMT-related markers. In conclusion, fibrillin-1 is a novel TGF-β-induced marker. Fibrillin-1 expression in SSM, but not in other metaplasia and carcinomatous components, in both MCBs and non-mammary carcinosarcomas, together with the inability of FBN1-knockdown to compromise migration and invasion, indicates that fibrillin-1 is a marker induced solely in spindle metaplasia during EMT and does not induce EMT nor lead to tumour aggressiveness. ? 2019 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia",breast; epithelial-mesenchymal transition; fibrillin-1; metaplastic carcinoma; TGF-β,"cdh2 protein; fibrillin 1; fn protein; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; protein; protein kinase B; snai1 protein; stress activated protein kinase; synaptophysin; transcription factor Slug; transcription factor ZEB1; Twist related protein 1; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vim protein; vimentin; fibrillin 1; transforming growth factor beta; Article; breast carcinoma; breast epithelium cell; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; carcinosarcoma; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; DNA demethylation; down regulation; gene expression; gene knockdown; human; human cell; human tissue; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; MDA-MB-468 cell line; metaplastic carcinoma; microarray analysis; priority journal; promoter region; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SK-BR-3 cell line; spindle sarcomatous metaplasia; squamous cell metaplasia; T-47D cell line; upregulation; breast; breast tumor; cell transformation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; epithelium cell; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; metaplasia; pathology; sarcoma; tumor cell line; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinosarcoma; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Epithelial Cells; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Fibrillin-1; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Metaplasia; Sarcoma; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85064426215

It remains unknown whether international network of HCV transmission has occurred in this region. Methods: HIV-positive patients with acute HCV infection, defined as HCV seroconversion within a year or documented acute hepatitis with seroconversion, diagnosed in Hong Kong, Taipei and Tokyo during 2010-2016 were included in this molecular epidemiology study. The NS5B region of the HCV genome (365?bp) was amplified using nested polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Results: Of 234 HIV-positive patients with acute HCV infection, all were male with 94% being MSM. At the diagnosis of acute HCV infection, 73.5% had concurrent sexually transmitted diseases and 88.0% were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. The most prevalent HCV genotype was 3a, 2a and 1b in Hong Kong, Taipei and Tokyo respectively. Nine independent clusters belonging to five genotypes (1b, 2a, 2c, 3a and 6a) were identified, each of which occurred in one city without overlapping except for one 3a sequence from Taipei that was closely related genetically to the Hong Kong cluster. Conclusions: No international network of HCV transmission was identified among HIV–positive patients in the three Asia-Pacific cities. The transmission dynamics of sexually acquired HCV differed by city, but the risk of intercity clustering should not be ignored. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This study aimed to investigate the role of PTTG1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) using in silico bioinformatics approaches. A pan-cancer analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data indicated that among all cancer types copy number amplification of PTTG1 gene was most frequently found in ccRCC. However, amplification of PTTG1 gene copy number did not correlate with the increase of mRNA level in ccRCC, and did not predict the patients' overall survival. Instead, ccRCC was correlated with overexpression of PTTG1 mRNA, and its expression level was stage-dependent increased in cancer patients. An outlier analysis using the Oncomine database suggested that PTTG1 mRNA expression served as a good biomarker for ccRCC. Pathway analysis for upregulated genes enriched in PTTG1-high expressing ccRCC patients found that PTTG1 overexpression was associated with mitotic defects. Mining drug sensitivity data using the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) discovered that PTTG1-high expressing ccRCC cell lines were susceptible to a Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) inhibitor NSC23766.

We randomly assigned 33 healthy older adults to either a VT group (mean age = 67.5 years) or a control group (mean age = 72.1 years). The VT group received two 1-hour VT training sessions per week for three months (24 sessions). Primary outcome measures collected before and after the intervention period were electromyographic muscle activation onset latencies of the hamstring and gastrocnemius and the center of pressure path, length and movement velocity in standing (reactive balance performance). Secondary outcome measures included isometric peak force and time to isometric peak force of the knee extensors and flexors, the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale score, and fall history. Results revealed that the mean gastrocnemius muscle activation onset latency was significantly longer (22.53 ms) in the VT group after the intervention. The peak force of the knee flexors significantly increased (by 1.58 kg) in the control group over time but not in the VT group.

Nonetheless, the evidence behind this recommendation is tenuous. The purpose of this study is to clarify the benefits of preoperative iodine administration from published comparative studies. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL from 1980 to June 2018. Review Methods: Studies were included that compared preoperative iodine administration and no premedication before thyroidectomy. For the meta-analysis, studies were pooled with the random-effects model. Results: A total of 510 patients were divided into the iodine (n = 223) and control (n = 287) groups from 9 selected studies. Preoperative iodine administration was significantly associated with decreased thyroid vascularity and intraoperative blood loss. Significant heterogeneity was present among studies. We found no significant difference in thyroid volume or operative time. Furthermore, the meta-analysis showed no difference in the risk of postoperative complications, including vocal cord palsy, hypoparathyroidism/hypocalcemia, and hemorrhage or hematoma after thyroidectomy.

In Taiwan, qualitative research exploring the experiences and perceptions of cyberbullying among Taiwanese young people is lacking. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with a convenience sample of high school students (aged 16 to 18) from five schools in Taipei, Taiwan, without prior knowledge of their cyberbullying experiences. In total, 48 participants were interviewed. Results: We found that the experience of cyberbullying is common, frequently occurs anonymously and publicly on unofficial school Facebook pages created by students themselves, and manifests in multiple ways, such as name-calling, uploading photos, and/or excluding victims from online groups of friends. Exclusion, which may be a type of cyberbullying unique to the Asian context, causes a sense of isolation, helplessness, or hopelessness, even producing mental health effects in the victims because people place the utmost importance on interpersonal harmony due to the Confucian values in collectivistic Asian societies. In addition, our study revealed reasons for cyberbullying that also potentially reflect the collectivistic values of Asian societies. These reasons included fun, discrimination, jealousy, revenge, and punishment of peers who broke school or social rules/norms, for example, by cheating others or being promiscuous. Conclusions: Our findings reveal the pressing need for the Taiwanese school system to develop cyberbullying prevention programmes considering the nature and sociocultural characteristics of cyberbullying. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Asian context; Cyberbullying; Qualitative research; Social networking services,adolescent; adult; article; clinical article; Confucian; controlled study; convenience sample; cyberbullying; female; friend; helplessness; high school student; hopelessness; human; human experiment; interview; jealousy; male; mental health; organization; punishment; qualitative research; social network; Taiwan; victim; anger; cultural factor; psychology; qualitative research; school; statistics and numerical data; student; Adolescent; Anger; Cultural Characteristics; Cyberbullying; Female; Humans; Male; Online Social Networking; Qualitative Research; Schools; Students; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85066412124

The aim of this study was to clarify the risk of chronic fatigue syndrome following the diagnosis of psoriasis, an immune-related dermatological disease, by analyzing the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Method: 2616 patients aged 20 years or older with newly diagnosed psoriasis during 2004-2008 and 10,464 participants without psoriasis were identified. Both groups were followed up until the diagnoses of CFS were made at the end of 2011. Results: The relationship between psoriasis and the subsequent risk of CFS was estimated through Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with the incidence density rates being 2.27 and 3.58 per 1000 person-years among the non-psoriasis and psoriasis populations, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, with 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-2.06).

Disease awareness and understanding of the disease burden can strongly influence vaccine coverage. This review provides insight into the current epidemiology and the importance of varicella from both public health and economic perspectives across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Areas covered: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies on the incidence, seroprevalence, fatality rate and complication rate of varicella. Economic burden studies were also captured. Altogether, 125 studies were identified across the region; these were supplemented by government reports (gray data). Reported vaccine coverage varied from 2.8% to 97%; a key influencing factor was inclusion of the varicella vaccine in national immunization programs. In general, varicella incidence in the unvaccinated population was highest in children ?5 years old and seroprevalence increased with age. Economic analyses highlighted the cost-saving potential of vaccination programs, especially from a societal perspective. Expert opinion: Varicella-related data varied greatly across the APAC region, highlighting the need to better understand the burden of varicella in this area, and particularly identified the need for better surveillance and reporting. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

The approach proposed in this study captures the reality that many persons experience more than one dimension of loneliness-varying degrees coupled with their psychological well-being in a family context. This study explores the latent structure of loneliness during young adulthood and its association with psychological well-being, as well as how these are related to their family characteristics in adolescence. Methods Data are from 2,748 young people, a cohort sample from the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP). Loneliness was assessed by a 6-item de Jong-Gierveld short scale with emotional and social loneliness domains. We describe the clustering between loneliness domains and psychological well-being, namely depressive symptoms, self-esteem, suicidal thoughts, and alcohol use using latent class cluster analysis. In addition to incorporating the Taiwanese family context, multivariate multinomial logistic regression models included data on family cohesion and parental guan (parental control) in adolescence. This might be associated with choices in partnership and childbearing, and influence loneliness in young adulthood. Results Our results demonstrate a three-cluster model of loneliness involving emotional loners, serious emotional loners, and severe emotional/social loners. We also found that a feeling of serious emotional loneliness and severe emotional/social loneliness were significantly associated with psychological well-being, even adjusting for individual characteristics. Among young adults who had a partner, the married adults were significantly less likely to feel serious emotional loneliness than those who were living alone. Furthermore, young adults with stronger family cohesion during early adolescence were less likely to suffer from serious emotional loneliness (Relative risk ratios [RRR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.91) and severe emotional/ social loneliness (RRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.85) in young adulthood. Discussion This measurement strategy provides a foundation for future research into how experts can address loneliness clusters in order to better understand psychological well-being during young adulthood and family context in adolescence. This is important because our results suggest that the various loneliness domains do not occur independently, but rather are embedded in patterns and are associated with family characteristics. ? 2019 Chiao et al.",,adult; alcohol consumption; Article; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; depression; disease association; disease course; disease severity; emotionality; family attitude; family size; female; human; human experiment; loneliness; male; marriage; normal human; outcome assessment; parental behavior; pregnancy; psychological well-being; risk factor; self esteem; social behavior; suicidal ideation; Taiwan; young adult,2-s2.0-85066614147

The chemical insecticides in use for mosquito control are toxic and ineffective due to the development of resistance to them. The new approach to reduce mosquito population by releasing genetically modified males to cause female infertility is still under environmental safety evaluation. Photodynamic insecticides (PDI) have long been known as a safe and effective alternative by using dyes as the photosensitizers (PS) for activation with light to generate insecticidal singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species. This approach warrants re-examination with advances in the chemical synthesis of novel PS, e.g. phthalocyanines (PC). Nine PC were compared with five porphyrin derivatives and two classic PS of halogenated fluoresceins, i.e. cyanosine and rose bengal experimentally for photodynamic treatment (PDT) of the larvae of laboratory-reared Aedes mosquitoes and their cell lines. Groups of 2nd instar larvae were first exposed overnight to graded concentrations of each PS in the dark followed by their exposure to dim light for up to 7 hours. Larvae of both experimental and control groups were examined hourly for viability based on their motility. Monolayers of mosquito cells were similarly PS-sensitized and exposed briefly to light at the PS-specific excitation wavelengths. Cell viability was assessed by MTT reduction assays. Of the 16 PS examined for photodynamic inactivation of the mosquito larvae, effective are three novel PC, i.e. amino-Si-PC1 and -PC2, anilinium Zn-PC3.4, pyridyloxy SiPC14 and two porphyrin derivatives, i.e. TPPS2 and TMAP. Their EC50 values were determined, all falling in the nanomolar range lower than those of rose bengal and cyanosine. All PS effective in vivo were also found to dose-dependently inactivate mosquito cells photodynamically in vitro, providing cellular basis for their larvicidal activities. The present findings of novel PC with effective photodynamic larvicidal activities provide fresh impetus to the development of PDI with their established advantages in safety and efficacy. Toward that end, the insect cell lines are of value for rapid screening of new PC. The optimal excitability of PC with insect-invisible red light is inferred to have the potential to broaden the range of targetable insect pests. ? 2019 Shiao et al.

Settings and participants Our study included patients with type 2 diabetes who received OHAs between March 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. All eligible subjects were classified into CKD and non-CKD cohorts and further categorized as the DPP-4i and non-DPP-4i users in each cohort. Methods The DPP-4i and non-DPP-4i groups were matched 1:1 by propensity score to attenuate potential selection bias. Propensity score was estimated by logistic regression, using demographics, co-medications, comorbidities. and adapted diabetic complication severity index at baseline. Outcomes Outcomes of interest included a composite endpoint of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death (major adverse cardiac events [MACE]), and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF). COX proportional hazard models were applied to examine the association between DPP-4i and outcomes of interest. Results We identified 37,641 and 87,604 patients with type 2 diabetes with and without CKD, respectively. After propensity score matching, 8,213 pairs of CKD patients and 12,313 pairs of non-CKD patients were included for analysis. In the CKD cohort, DPP-4i were associated with a 25% increased risk of hHF (DPP-4i vs. non-DPP-4i incidence/1,000 person-years: 15.0 vs. 9.9, HR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.01–1.54, p = 0.037) but not with the risk of MACE (HR = 0.89, p = 0.144). In the non-CKD cohort, DPP-4i were associated with a lower risk of MACE (DPP-4i vs. non-DPP-4i incidence/1,000 person-years: 9.8 vs. 12.6 HR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.61–0.87, p = 0.0007), but not the risk of hHF (HR = 1.09, p = 0.631). Conclusions DPP-4i were found to be associated with decreased risk of MACE in the non-CKD cohort in our study. However, DPP-4i were associated with increased risk of hHF in the CKD cohort. DPP-4i in the CKD cohort should be used cautiously. ? 2019 Huang et al.

Although dysfunction of podocytes, also termed glomerular visceral epithelial cells, is critically associated with diabetic nephropathy, the mechanism underlying podocyte dysfunction still remains obscure. Here, we identify that KDM6A, a histone lysine demethylase, reinforces diabetic podocyte dysfunction by creating a positive feedback loop through up-regulation of its downstream target KLF10. Overexpression of KLF10 in podocytes not only represses multiple podocyte-specific markers including nephrin, but also conversely increases KDM6A expression. We further show that KLF10 inhibits nephrin expression by directly binding to the gene promoter together with the recruitment of methyltransferase Dnmt1. Importantly, inactivation or knockout of either KDM6A or KLF10 in mice significantly suppresses diabetes-induced proteinuria and kidney injury. Consistent with the notion, we also show that levels of both KDM6A and KLF10 proteins or mRNAs are substantially elevated in kidney tissues or in urinary exosomes of human diabetic nephropathy patients as compared with control subjects. Our findings therefore suggest that targeting the KDM6A–KLF10 feedback loop may be beneficial to attenuate diabetes-induced kidney injury. ? 2019 The Authors.

Objective: This study examines the associations between poly-victimization and children's health problems requiring medical attention. Methods: A national stratified cluster random sampling was used to select and approach 25% of the total primary schools in Taiwan, and 49% of the approached schools agreed to participate in this study. We collected data with a self-report questionnaire from 6233 (4th-grade) students aged 10–11, covering every city and county in Taiwan. Results: Logistic regression analyses demonstrate a significant dose-response relationship between children's poly-victimization exposure and their health problems including hospitalization, serious injury, surgery, daily-medication requirements, heart murmurs, asthma, dizziness or fainting, allergies, kidney disease, therapies for special needs, smoking, and alcohol use. The results indicate that children's risk of having a health problem grew significantly with each increase in the number of victimization types that children experienced. Conclusions: These research findings underscore the effect of poly-victimization on children's health problems requiring medical attention, and stress the need for both proper screening methods for children's exposure to poly-victimization and stronger awareness of poly-victimization's effects on health conditions in healthcare clinics. ? 2019",Adverse childhood experiences; Childhood victimization; Health; Pediatric health outcome; Poly-victimization,alcohol; alcohol consumption; allergy; Article; asthma; child; child health; child hospitalization; childhood adversity; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dizziness; faintness; female; heart murmur; human; injury; kidney disease; male; pilot study; poly victimization; retrospective study; self report; smoking; Taiwan; victim,2-s2.0-85062438646

The purposes of the CAT-5F assessment are to describe patients’ levels of impairments or disabilities in the 5 functions and to serve as an outcome measure in patients with stroke. Design: This is a data-mining study based on data from a previous study using simulation analysis to develop and validate the CAT-5F. Setting: One rehabilitation unit in a medical center in Taiwan served as the setting for this study. Participants: Data were retrieved from totals of 540 (initial assessment) and 309 (discharge assessment) participants with stroke assessed in a previous study. The assessment data (N=540) were from the BI, PASS, and STREAM. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The outcome measures for this study were from BI, PASS, and STREAM. Results: The CAT-5F using the optimal stopping rule (limited reliability increased <0.010) had good Rasch reliability across the 5 functions (0.86-0.96) and needed 12.7 items, on average, for the whole administration. The concurrent validity (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, r=0.91-0.96) and responsiveness (standardized response mean=0.33-0.91) of the CAT-5F were sufficient in the patients.

However, only limited studies have examined its efficacy in patients with chronic stroke and therefore it remains controversial. Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial that enrolled patients from a rehabilitation department. Twenty-two patients with first-ever chronic and unilateral cerebral stroke, aged 30-70 years, were randomly assigned to the iTBS or control group. All patients received 1 session per day for 10 days of either iTBS or sham stimulation over the ipsilesional primary motor cortex in addition to conventional neurorehabilitation. Outcome measures were assessed before and immediately after the intervention period: Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block test (BBT), and Motor Activity Log (MAL). Analysis of covariance was adopted to compare the treatment effects between groups. Results: The iTBS group had greater improvement in the MAS and FMA than the control group (η 2 = 0.151-0.233; p &lt; 0.05), as well as in the ARAT and BBT (η 2 = 0.161-0.460; p &lt; 0.05) with large effect size. Both groups showed an improvement in the BBT, and there were no significant between-group differences in MAL changes. Conclusions: The iTBS induced greater gains in spasticity decrease and UL function improvement, especially in fine motor function, than sham TBS. This is a promising finding because patients with chronic stroke have a relatively low potential for fine motor function recovery. Overall, iTBS may be a beneficial adjunct therapy to neurorehabilitation for enhancing UL function. Further larger-scale study is warranted to confirm the findings and its long-term effect.

The aim of this study was to identify which patients with PCNs would benefit from EUS-FNA. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on patients with PCNs who underwent EUS-FNA between January 2009 and June 2018. A discordant or a consistent diagnosis after EUS-FNA was analyzed and was correlated with the clinical demographic data and cystic features. Predictors of the change in the diagnosis after EUS-FNA were analyzed. Results: One hundred eighty-eight cases of PCNs were analyzed. EUS-FNA changed the diagnosis in 45.7% of all patients with PCNs and 54.5% patients with presumed branch ductal type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) and impacted the recommendation in 35.6% of patients with PCNs and 50.5% patients with BD-IPMN. Patients with a discordant diagnosis after EUS-FNA were younger in age (54.8 ± 12.6 vs. 61.2 ± 14.2; p=.037) and had a cyst size larger than 3 cm than patients with a consistent diagnosis after EUS-FNA. The only worrisome feature (WF) that differed between patients with a discordant and a consistent diagnosis after EUS-FNA was the main pancreatic duct (MPD) between 5 and 9 mm (p=.013). In multivariate analysis, a cyst size >3 cm and age were independent predictors of diagnostic changes after EUS-FNA (OR: 5.33, 95% CI: 1.79–15.88, p =.003; OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93–0.99, p =.031).

Moreover, recent studies showed that accumulation of free cholesterol in macrophages leading to activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been linked to atherosclerosis-associated inflammation. However, it is not clear if cholesterol accumulation is associated with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in the liver. In this study, we investigated the association of free cholesterol and oxLDL accumulation in portal vein with the inflammation, atherosclerosis, and fibrosis in human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods: Serial sections derived from surgical specimens of NAFLD were stained with filipin and antibodies against IL-1β, CD68, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), oxLDL and lectin-like oxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1). Results: We show that free cholesterol was colocalized with oxLDL in the wall of portal vein, and which was associated with lumen narrowing, plaque formation, endothelium deformation, and portal venous inflammation. The inflammation was evidenced by the colocalization of Kupffer cells and IL-1β and the expression of LOX-1. Notably, ruptured plaque was closely associated with portal venous inflammation.

Methods: We conducted an anonymous survey for first-time DUI offenders who attended the mandatory educational program held by Taiwan Taipei District Prosecutors Office. Participants completed the following self-rated questionnaires: the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test for screening alcohol use disorder (AUD); the C-CAGE questionnaire for screening alcohol dependence (AD); and the Brief Symptom Rating Scale for screening psychological symptoms, alcohol drinking, and DUI variables. We defined a high frequency of DUI as occurrence of 2 or more DUI behaviors per month. Results: Among 597 participants, 52.3% and 34.4% had AUD and AD, respectively. Offenders with AUD or AD had higher risks of binge-drinking behavior, consuming a high alcohol concentration, and psychological and sleep problems. AUD, AD, and drinking at the workplace were potential risk factors for a high frequency of DUI. Notably, compared with offenders without AUD and AD, offenders with AUD and AD respectively had 5 and 2 times higher likelihoods of having a high frequency of DUI. Conclusions: AUD or its more severe form, AD, is relatively common in first-time DUI offenders. In particular, having AUD or AD is associated with an increased risk of a high frequency of DUI.

Most of the studies had cross-sectional designs and were from the United States; only a few longitudinal studies had follow-up periods of less than 1 year. Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, this systematic review provided some evidence of positive associations between e-cigarette use and smoking intentions, smoking behavior, and smoking frequency among adolescents. Future research must investigate the association of e-cigarette use with smoking-related behaviors by using longitudinal designs with long-term follow-ups to determine the respective causality for informing subsequent policymaking and research. ? 2019 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

Suggestions are proposed for improving hospitals' policies in this field. Methods: Eighteen physicians who had experienced malpractice disputes in the past 10 years were interviewed. Results: Most physicians received legal and financial support from hospital systems for malpractice disputes, but emotional support from colleagues and supervisors was inadequate due to a prevalent culture of shame and liability in malpractice dispute contexts. Hospital systems were reported to examine dispute events to assure monetary compensation but not to discover root causes of events or to devise preventive strategies. Most hospitals were determined to be reactive, with few implementing policies to proactively prevent malpractice disputes. Conclusions: Government authorities handling health affairs should request that hospitals organize educational activities regularly to improve medical staff members' knowledge and attitudes regarding malpractice disputes. Each malpractice dispute requires root cause analysis and recording of results to guide future policies. For resolution of potential malpractice disputes, hospitals should implement preventive policies to enable early assistance when adverse outcomes or patient complaints occur. ? 2019 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

This study aimed to characterize the epidemiologic features of FL in Taiwan to explore the factors relevant to disease development and prognosis. Methods: We obtained epidemiological data for Taiwanese citizens during 1990-2012 from Taiwan's National Cancer Registry Database, and the corresponding data for US Caucasians from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Changes in incidence rates were evaluated with age-period-cohort (APC) analyses. Patient outcomes were compared with 5-year relative survival rates (RS) estimates. Results: Incidence rates of FL in Taiwan increased continuously during the study period (0.34 to 0.91 per 100 000 person-year from 1993-1997 to 2008-2012 in men, and from 0.29 [1993-1997] to 0.81 [2008-2012] in women), while rates in the US remained stable in both sexes, ranging between 3.73 and 3.96 in men and between 3.24 and 3.55 in women. Estimates of average annual percentage changes in incidence were significantly positive in Taiwan, but not in US Caucasians. Notably, the APC analysis identified a strong birth-cohort effect in Taiwan, corresponding to environmental alterations present during the study period. The estimated 5-year RS rates in both populations showed steady improvement, but the RS in Taiwanese patients was consistently 10% lower than in US Caucasians. Conclusion: A distinct increasing trend of incidence with a strong birth-cohort effect was identified in Taiwan, providing evidence of the association between environmental factors and disease development. ? 2019 The Authors.

Local failure (LF) was correlated with biological and clinical prognostic factors. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: After a median followup of 43.5 months, the 3-year cumulative incidence of LF, EFS, and OS were 21.1%, 45.8%, and 62.9%, respectively. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase ?1,500 U/l was associated with worse LF (p=0.02). There was no 3-year LF noted for patients with gross residual disease (GRD) who received more than 21.6 Gy.

An effective screening method for pneumoconiosis in workers exposed to asbestos-contaminated minerals is still lacking. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of serum and urinary biomarkers for pneumoconiosis in workers exposed to asbestos-contaminated minerals. We conducted a case-control study in a cohort of stone craft workers in Hualien, where asbestos, nephrite, antigorite, and talc are produced. A total of 140 subjects were screened between March 2013 and July 2014. All subjects received a questionnaire survey and a health examination that included a physical examination; chest X-ray; and tests for standard pulmonary function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, serum soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP), fibulin-3, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and urinary 8-Oxo-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)/creatinine. After excluding subjects with uraemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we included 48 subjects with pneumoconiosis and 90 control subjects without pneumoconiosis for analysis. In terms of occupational history, 43/48 (90%) case subjects and 68% (61/90) of the control subjects had processed asbestos-contaminated minerals, including nephrite, antigorite, and talc. The case group had decreased pulmonary function in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC. The levels of SMRP, fibulin-3, urinary 8-OHdG/creatinine, and CEA were higher in the case group than in the control group. Subjects exposed to nephrite had significantly higher SMRP levels (0.84 ± 0.52 nM) than subjects exposed to other types of minerals (0.60 ± 0.30 nM). A dose-response relationship was observed between the SMRP level and the severity of pneumoconiosis. Machine learning algorithms, including variables of sex, age, SMRP, fibu-lin-3, CEA, and 8-OHdG/creatinine, can predict pneumoconiosis with high accuracy. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.7 to 1.0. We suggest that SMRP and fibulin-3 could be used as biomarkers of pneumoconiosis in workers exposed to asbestos-contaminated minerals. ? 2019 Hsiao-Yu Yang.

To strengthen programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (PMDT), Taiwan MDR-TB Consortium (TMTC) was established in 2007. We assess the performance and epidemiologic impact of TMTC. Methodology/Principle findings We analyzed the trends of proportion of TB cases with drug susceptibility testing, enrollment of MDR-TB patients into TMTC and outcomes of treatment of all MDR-TB patients in Taiwan from 2007–2016. We computed the trends of both incidence and prevalence of MDR-TB from 2007–2016. We assessed the trends of MDR-TB among both new and recurrent TB cases. The proportion of TB cases with drug susceptibility testing results increased from 24.2% in 2007 to 97.9% in 2016. Of the 1,452 MDR-TB patients who were eligible for TMTC care, 1,197 (82.4%) were enrolled in TMTC, in whom 82.9% had treatment success. MDRTB incidence was 9.0 cases per million in 2007, which declined to 4.6 cases per million in 2016 (p<0.0001). MDR-TB prevalence decreased from 19.4 cases per million in 2007 to 8.4 cases per million in 2016 (p<0.0001). The proportion of MDR-TB among new TB cases decreased from 1.4% in 2010 to 1.0% in 2016 (p = 0.039); and that among recurrent TB cases from 9.0% in 2010 to 1.8% in 2016 (p<0.0001). Conclusions We concluded that effective PMDT have had a significant impact on the epidemic of drug-resistant TB in Taiwan. ? 2019 Lee et al.

The case of social networking site usage (SNS, e.g. Facebook, Instagram or Twitter) is taken as the case out of the reason of prevalent user population. Design/methodology/approach: It is revealed that people tend to use SNS not only for building a relationship, but also for communicating. In other words, there are inner needs of adopting the SNS technology. However, no clear definitions can be followed for determining the problematic SNS usage, addictive behavior and the high-engagement behavior. Therefore, this study adopts the notion of uses and gratification theory (U&G theory) for investigating the SNS usage behavior. Also, the social anxiety is also first introduced to integrate into the research for an empirical study. Findings: Results reveal that gratification sought and relationship maintenance are associated with the addictive behavior, whereas the relationship maintenance is significantly related to high-engagement behavior. Research limitations/implications: First, the selected data represents a sample of SNW users in the Asian Pacific region and mainly from the group of young college users. Therefore, caution must be taken when generalizing the findings to other SNW users or groups. Second, the time aspect related to social media dependence may need to be considered in future studies. Third, the authors found marginal support for the influence of intentions of high engagement? and future studies may consider applying other theories that could better explain these types of behavior. Practical implications: The results of this study provide strong evidence that inner anxiety perceived by users should not be neglected while tackling the problematic internet use due to SNW addiction because it can strengthen the force for depending on SNW for seeking social support. Apart from the value of perceived enjoyment as asserted in previous studies, this study opens up a new opportunity to tackle SNW dependence. Social implications: The key implication of this research is that the impact of the mental health of users on SNW problematic should not be overlooked. The higher the level of anxiety perceived, the more likely is the SNW dependence. Therefore, the online behavior depending on psychological health should be addressed because it may be a critical point for assisting users to adopt SNW wisely. Originality/value: This study confirms that social anxiety people experience in real (offline) life has impacts on online behavior of SNS usage (online). It suggests that the difference between users as the perceived level of social anxiety can trigger different levels of SNS usage. Second, U&G theory is proven valid in understanding SNS addiction. Third, relationship maintenance through the use of SNS reveals its dissimilar effects on SNS addiction and high engagement. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",High engagement; Internet addiction; Relationship maintenance; Social anxiety; Social networking site; Uses and gratification theory,,2-s2.0-85063574651

Elevated thymidine phosphorylase (TP) levels, a key enzyme in the pyrimidine nucleoside salvage pathway, are associated with an aggressive disease phenotype and poor prognoses. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that is responsible for the stabilization and maturation of many oncogenic proteins. In this study, we report whether Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG could enhance salinomycin-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells through modulating TP expression in two non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, A549 and H1975. We found that salinomycin increased TP expression in a MKK3/6-p38 MAPK activation manner. Knockdown of TP using siRNA or inactivation of p38 MAPK by pharmacological inhibitor SB203580 enhanced the cytotoxic and growth inhibition effects of salinomycin. In contrast, enforced expression of MKK6E (a constitutively active form of MKK6) reduced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of salinomycin. Moreover, Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG enhanced cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of salinomycin in NSCLC cells, which were associated with down-regulation of TP expression and inactivation of p38 MAPK. Together, the Hsp90 inhibition induced TP down-regulation involved in enhancing the salinomycin-induced cytotoxicity in A549 and H1975 cells. ? 2019",Hsp90; Non-small-cell lung cancer; p38 MPAK; Salinomycin; TP,4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 methylsulfinylphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl)imidazole; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; salinomycin; tanespimycin; thymidine phosphorylase; A-549 cell line; Article; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug potentiation; enzyme activation; enzyme inactivation; enzyme inhibition; human; human cell; NCI-H1975 cell line; non small cell lung cancer; priority journal; protein expression,2-s2.0-85061991378

Methods: Age-period-cohort models are used to estimate the mortality trends of liver diseases from 1981 to 2016 and project these trends to 2035. Results: For chronic liver disease and cirrhosis among men, the age-adjusted mortality rate decreased from 1981 to 1991, increased until 1999, and subsequently decreased again until 2016. For women, the age-adjusted mortality rate exhibited an increasing but up-and-down trend from 1981 to 1998 and a decreasing trend to 2016. For liver cancer among men, the age-adjusted mortality rate exhibited an increasing trend from 1981 to 2002 and a decreasing trend to 2016. For women, the age-adjusted mortality rate exhibited an increasing trend from 1981 to 2003 and a decreasing trend to 2016. The age-adjusted mortality rates of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and liver cancer for both sexes are projected to decrease by more than 30% from 2016 to 2025 and by more than 55% from 2016 to 2035.

Particularly, we tested the impact of different cumulative duration, timing, and individual substance of DPP-4 inhibitors use on risk of arthralgia.

Results: An increased risk of arthralgia was observed during the first year after initiating DPP-4 inhibitors (adjusted Hazard Ratio?=?1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.75) but the risk declined with cumulative use. This duration–response relation was not found in TZDs use and acarbose use. In the nested case–control study, there was a slightly increased risk of arthralgia (aOR?=?1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12) associated with current DPP-4 inhibitor use. Conclusion: A relatively higher risk of arthralgia was associated with the initial administration of DPP-4 inhibitors, however, the risk declined among long-term users. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",arthralgia; cohort study; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors); epidemiology; nested case–control study; pharmacoepidemiology,"2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acarbose; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; linagliptin; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; vildagliptin; adult; arthralgia; Article; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; drug exposure; female; hazard ratio; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; priority journal; risk factor; survival rate; treatment duration",2-s2.0-85061316918

However, few reports addressed the patient-reported outcomes and long-term quality of life (QoL) of patients having undergone robotic liver surgery. Methods: This study presented the QoL and cost-effectiveness associated with robotic and open hepatectomy by performing a comparative survey using two standardized questionnaires (Short Form-36 and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index). Results: One hundred patients completed the study. The robotic group tended to experienced longer operation time but shorter length of hospital stay compared to open group. Moreover, the robotic group had faster return to daily activities, less need of patient-controlled anesthesia, and less wound-related complaints in long-term follow-up. The robotic group incurred higher peri-operative expenses; however, the cost of inpatient care was lower. Conclusions: Our study suggested that robotic hepatectomy provided good post-operative QoL and recovery of daily activity. However, efforts for lowering the financial burden of medical care by reducing the cost of robotic surgery is necessary for further application. ? 2019",Cost-effectiveness; Patient-reported outcome; Quality of life; Robotic hepatectomy,"aged; convalescence; cost control; cost of illness; economics; female; follow up; human; length of stay; liver; liver resection; male; middle aged; operation duration; patient; patient controlled analgesia; patient satisfaction; procedures; psychology; quality of life; robotic surgical procedure; statistics and numerical data; surgery; time factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; Cost of Illness; Cost Savings; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatectomy; Humans; Length of Stay; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Patient Satisfaction; Patients; Quality of Life; Recovery of Function; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85060647251

The impact of prior pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in clinical presentation and treatment outcome of ICU-admitted CAP and HCAP patients also remains unknown. Methods: We report a nationwide, multi-center, retrospective study. ICU-admitted CAP and HCAP patients from six medical centers in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. Patients were defined as either CAP or HCAP cases, and with and without prior PTB, according to the database of Taiwan CDC. The disease severity, microbiologic characteristics, and treatment outcomes between CAP and HCAP patients with or without prior PTB were compared and analyzed. Results: A total of 414 ICU-admitted patients, including 176 CAP cases and 238 HCAP cases were included for analysis during the study period. In both CAP and HCAP subgroups, the pneumonia severities, proportions of organ dysfunction, and microbiologic characteristics were similar between patients with and without prior PTB. In survival analysis, patients with prior PTB had higher 30-day mortality than those without prior PTB (38.9% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.021) in the CAP population. Multivariate analysis revealed that a history of prior PTB was an independent clinical factor associated with higher 30-day mortality rate in CAP patients (HR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.81–10.98, P = 0.001). Conclusion: History of prior PTB is an independent clinical factor for increased 30-day mortality rate in ICU-admitted CAP patients, but not in ICU-admitted HCAP patients. ? 2018",Community-acquired pneumonia; Healthcare-associated pneumonia; Intensive care unit; Mortality; Tuberculosis,"antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter baumannii; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic lung disease; clinical evaluation; community acquired pneumonia; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; Enterobacter; Enterococcus faecium; female; health care associated pneumonia; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; intensive care unit; Klebsiella pneumoniae; length of stay; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mortality rate; multicenter study; nonhuman; pathogen load; Pneumonia Severity Index; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; respiratory failure; retrospective study; septic shock; smoking habit; Staphylococcus aureus; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; adult; clinical trial; community acquired infection; comorbidity; demography; epidemiology; hospital; hospitalization; lung tuberculosis; microbiology; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; pneumonia; regression analysis; risk factor; severity of illness index; statistical model; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Community-Acquired Infections; Comorbidity; Demography; Female; Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Multivariate Analysis; Pneumonia; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85053687218

There are approximately 400 metric tons of chalazae produced yearly after the processing of the liquid-egg production, which are disposed of as waste. The objectives of this study were to look for the optimal production condition of antioxidant crude chalaza hydrolysates and evaluate the in vivo antioxidant capacity via a chronic alcohol consumption mouse model. RESULTS: Antioxidant crude chalaza hydrolysates (CCH-As) could be produced by protease A at 1:100 ratio (w/w) and 0.5 h hydrolytic period. After our analyses, CCH-As were rich in leucine, arginine, phenylalanine, valine, lysine and antioxidant dipeptides (anserine and carnosine), and the major molecular masses were lower than 15 kDa. Regarding protective effects of CCH-As against oxidative damage in alcoholic-liquid-diet-fed mice, alcohol-fed mice had lower (P < 0.05) liver antioxidant capacities, and higher (P < 0.05) liver lipid contents, serum lipid/liver damage indices and IL-1β/IL-6 values. CCH-A supplementation reversed (P < 0.05) liver antioxidant capacities and reduced (P < 0.05) serum/liver lipids in alcohol-fed mice, which may result from increased (P < 0.05) fecal lipid output, upregulated (P < 0.05) fatty acid β-oxidation and downregulated (P < 0.05) lipogenesis in the liver. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this CCH-A should benefit the liquid-egg industry, while also offering consumers a choice of healthy ingredients from animal sources. ? 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. ? 2018 Society of Chemical Industry",alcoholic fatty liver; amino acid profile; in vitro and in vivo antioxidant effects; lipid metabolism; protease-A-digested crude chalaza hydrolysate,"antioxidant; interleukin 6; protein hydrolysate; reactive oxygen metabolite; analysis; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; chicken; drinking behavior; drug effect; egg yolk; fatty liver; human; liver; male; metabolism; mouse; waste; Alcohol Drinking; Animals; Antioxidants; Chickens; Egg Yolk; Fatty Liver; Humans; Interleukin-6; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Protein Hydrolysates; Reactive Oxygen Species; Waste Products",2-s2.0-85057453081

This study surveyed the current antimicrobial resistance pattern among E. coli isolates that cause community-onset bacteremia, with a special focus on the prevalence of and the risk factors for 3GC resistance, and determined factors for poor outcomes among patients with community-onset E. coli bacteremia. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Taiwan. All adult patients with community-onset E. coli bacteremia between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015 were enrolled and were divided into two groups depending on whether the E. coli isolate was susceptible to 3GCs. Risk factors for 3GC resistance, 14-day all-cause mortality, and length of hospital stay were analyzed. Results: The overall rate of 3GC resistance among E. coli isolates causing community-onset bacteremia was 19.7%, whereas it was 9.6% if only isolates causing community-acquired bacteremia were considered. Independent risk factors for 3GC-resistant community-onset E. coli bacteremia were hospitalization within the past 1 year (odds ratio: 2.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.6-3.7, P < 0.001), exposure to antibiotics within the past 15 days (2.6, 1.4-4.9, P = 0.002), residence in nursing home or long-term care facility (3.6, 1.0-12.3, P = 0.044), presence of underlying genitourinary disease (1.9, 1.2-2.9, P = 0.005), and presence of indwelling implantable intravenous port (2.2, 1.1-4.1, P = 0.021). 3GC resistance was independently associated with increased length of hospital stays (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In this study, the prevalence of 3GC resistance was high among both patients with community-onset and those with community-acquired E. coli bacteremia. 3GC resistance is a strong independent risk factor for length of hospital stay. The effectiveness of empirical antibiotic treatment would partially explain the impact of 3GC resistance, but more evidence is needed. The choice of appropriate empirical antibiotics for community-onset E. coli bacteremia might impact outcomes in terms of the length of hospital stay and need to be individualized according to the patient-specific risk for acquiring drug-resistant pathogens. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Appropriate empirical treatment; Bacteremia; Community-onset infection; Escherichia coli; Third-generation cephalosporin resistance,"amikacin; antibiotic agent; cefazolin; cefepime; cefmetazole; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; cephalosporin derivative; ciprofloxacin; cotrimoxazole; ertapenem; gentamicin; imipenem; levofloxacin; meropenem; piperacillin plus tazobactam; sultamicillin; tigecycline; antiinfective agent; cephalosporin derivative; aged; all cause mortality; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterium isolate; community acquired infection; controlled study; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli bacteremia; female; Gram negative sepsis; hospitalization; human; infection risk; length of stay; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; nursing home; observational study; prevalence; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; tertiary care center; urogenital tract disease; urosepsis; bacteremia; community acquired infection; drug effect; Escherichia coli infection; hospital; microbiology; pathogenicity; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Cephalosporins; Community-Acquired Infections; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Hospitals; Humans; Prevalence; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85062835964

In the present study, we identified calreticulin (CRT) as a novel MYCN suppressor that downregulated MYCN promoter activity and protein expression to modulate neuronal differentiation and stemness. Our data showed that CRT-mediated MYCN suppression led to increased neurite length and commensurate elevation in differentiation marker GAP-43. We examined effect of radiotherapy and discovered that ionizing radiation (IR) was able to augment CRT expression dose-dependently in NB. Interestingly, neuronal differentiation and neurosphere formation (NSF) of NB were not only co-modulated by IR and CRT but were also dependent on Ca 2+ -buffering domain (C-domain) of CRT. Mutagenesis analysis showed that C-domain was indispensable for CRT-mediated MYCN regulation in NB differentiation and NSF. Of note, IR-induced formation of neural stem-like neurospheres (NS) was significantly impaired in CRT-overexpressed NB cells. The occupancy of CRT on MYCN 5′ proximal promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, revealing potential CRT binding sites that coincided with transcription factor E2F1 binding elements. In addition, we identified a physical interaction between CRT and E2F1, and demonstrated that CRT occupancy on MYCN promoter prevented E2F1-mediated MYCN upregulation. In line with in vitro findings, hampered tumor latency and retarded tumor growth in xenograft model corroborated IR and CRT co-mediated neuronal differentiation of NB. Together, our data delineated a novel mechanism of CRT-mediated MYCN regulation and warranted further preclinical investigation towards new therapeutic strategy for NB. CRT suppresses MYCN expression and promotes neuronal differentiation in NB. CRT regulates MYCN via interaction with E2F1 and direct binding to MYCN promoter. Ca 2+ -buffering domain of CRT is critical in MYCN regulation and NB differentiation. CRT-MYCN axis impacts on NB stemness by modulating neurosphere formation. Xenograft model corroborates in vitro NB differentiation mediated by CRT and IR. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Calreticulin; Differentiation; MYCN; Neuroblastoma; Neurosphere; Radiation,calcium ion; calreticulin; N Myc proto oncogene protein; neuromodulin; transcription factor E2F1; 5' untranslated region; animal experiment; animal model; Article; binding site; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer stem cell; chromatin immunoprecipitation; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; ionizing radiation; mouse; mutagenesis; nerve cell differentiation; neurite; neurite outgrowth; neuroblastoma; neuroblastoma cell line; nonhuman; oncogene c myb; promoter region; protein expression; protein protein interaction; receptor down regulation; SK-N-BE(2) cell line; SK-N-SH cell line; tumor growth; tumor suppressor gene; tumor xenograft,2-s2.0-85059591909

Serum TRACP5a is associated with symptom distress in lung cancer patients during chemotherapy. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether chemotherapy drugs modulate TRACP5a as an inducible marker for symptom distress in lung cancer patients during chemotherapy. In clinical analysis, lung cancer participants completely received the six-cycle chemotherapy process (n = 42). Clinical determinations for TRACP5a, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), white blood cells, monocytes, and hemoglobin were analyzed at six time points: BL, C1d8, C2d1, C4d1, C4d8, and Ed28. Meanwhile, five questionnaires for fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, depression, and confusion were finished before drug treatment. For monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, THP-1 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). TRACP5a secretion in THP-1 cells was determined at the following days up to 6 days after 1-day incubation of chemotherapy drugs by dot blotting. Clinical analysis revealed that TRACP5a significantly increased at C1d8 and C4d8, but dropped at C2d1 and Ed28. CRP and IL-6 displayed a broad-range variation, resulting in no significant difference among the assessment time points. In contrast, monocytes decreased at C1d8 and C4d8, but rose again at C2d1 and Ed28. In symptom distress, the changes only in fatigue and sleep disturbance were positively associated with the trend in TRACP5a. In PMA-treated THP-1 cells, TRACP5a significantly increased after stimulation with gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Taken together, induction of TRACP5a by chemotherapy drugs might be generated from monocyte-differentiated macrophages, further causing clinical symptom distress in lung cancer patients. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Chemotherapy drugs; Lung cancer; Monocyte-differentiated macrophages; Symptom distress; TRACP5a,"acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme; C reactive protein; carboplatin; cisplatin; gemcitabine; hemoglobin; interleukin 6; paclitaxel; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5a; unclassified drug; vinorelbine tartrate; acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme; antineoplastic agent; biological marker; C reactive protein; hemoglobin; interleukin 6; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; adult; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cell differentiation; clinical article; confusion; controlled study; depression; dot blotting; drug effect; fatigue; female; hemoglobin blood level; human; in vitro study; incubation time; leukocyte; leukocyte count; macrophage; male; mental stress; monocyte; multiple cycle treatment; non small cell lung cancer; pain; priority journal; protein analysis; protein blood level; protein expression; questionnaire; sleep disorder; THP-1 cell line; time factor; aged; blood; chemically induced; lung tumor; metabolism; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathophysiology; psychology; symptom assessment; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Differentiation; Confusion; Depression; Fatigue; Female; Hemoglobins; Humans; Interleukin-6; Leukocytes; Lung Neoplasms; Macrophages; Male; Middle Aged; Monocytes; Sleep Wake Disorders; Symptom Assessment; Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate; THP-1 Cells",2-s2.0-85060116392

Our aim was to elucidate predictors of lymphoceles. Methods: Between 2011 and 2017, medical records of consecutive women who underwent laparotomic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for FIGO stage I or II gynecologic cancer were reviewed. Results: A total of 204 women, including those with lymphoceles (n = 31) and symptomatic lymphoceles (n = 7), were reviewed. According to multivariable analysis, parity (odds ratio = 0.59, p = 0.003), adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy (odds ratio = 2.60, p = 0.039), and peritoneal nonclosure without pelvic drainage (odds ratio = 2.31, p = 0.048) were predictors of lymphoceles.

Gefitinib was initially approved and reimbursed as a third-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC by the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) in 2004; subsequently it became a second-line therapy (in 2007) and further a first-line therapy (in 2011) for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. Another targeted therapy, erlotinib, was initially approved as a third-line therapy in 2007, and it became a second-line therapy in 2008. Objectives: This study is aimed towards an exploration of the impacts of the Taiwan NHI reimbursement policies (removing reimbursement restrictions) related to accessibility of targeted therapies. Setting: We retrieved 2004-2013 claims data for all patients with lung cancer diagnoses from the NHI Research Database.

Results: Totally 92 220 patients with NSCLC were identified. The prescribing rate of the targeted therapies increased by 15.58%, decreased by 10.98% and increased by 6.31% following the introduction of gefitinib as a second-line treatment in 2007, erlotinib as a second-line treatment in 2008 and gefitinib as as first line treatment in 2011, respectively. The average time to prescription reduced by 65.84% and 41.59% following coverage of erlotinib by insurance and gefitinib/erlotinib as second-line treatments in 2007-2008 and following gefitinib as the first-line treatment in 2011. Conclusions: The changes in reimbursement policies had a significant impact on the accessibility of targeted therapies for NSCLC treatment. Removing reimbursement restrictions can significantly increase the level and the speed of drug accessibility. ? 2019 Author(s).",interrupted time series; lung cancer; reimbursement policy; targeted therapies,erlotinib; gefitinib; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer research; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; molecularly targeted therapy; national health insurance; non small cell lung cancer; outcome assessment; patient identification; prescription; reimbursement; Taiwan; trend study,2-s2.0-85063076233

Most γδ-T-cells become activated via a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent pathway by the interaction of their receptor, Natural Killer Group 2 Member D (NKG2D) with the tumor-specific NKG2D ligands, including MHC class I-related chain A/B (MICA/B) and UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs), to kill tumor cells. However, despite their potent antitumor effects, the treatment protocols specifically targeting ovarian tumors require further improvements. Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal and challenging female malignancies worldwide because of delayed diagnoses and resistance to traditional chemotherapy. In this study, we successfully enriched and expanded γδ-T-cells up to ~78% from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with mostly the Vγ9Vδ2-T-cell subtype in the circulation. We showed that expanded γδ-T-cells alone exerted significant cytotoxic activities towards specific epithelial-type OVCAR3 and HTB75 cells, whereas the combination of γδ-T cells and pamidronate (PAM), a kind of aminobisphosphonates (NBPs), showed significantly enhanced cytotoxic activities towards all types of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, in tumor xenografts of immunodeficient NSG mice, γδ-T-cells not only suppressed tumor growth but also completely eradicated preexisting tumors with an initial size of ~5 mm. Thus, we concluded that γδ-T-cells alone possess dramatic cytotoxic activities towards epithelial ovarian cancers both in vitro and in vivo. These results strongly support the potential of clinical immunotherapeutic application of γδ-T-cells to treat this serious female malignancy. ? 2019 by the authors.

This study investigates the characteristics of diabetic patients, with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), according to the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy and determines the influence of retinopathy in the deterioration of renal function. We conduct a multicenter, longitudinal cohort study based on the Epidemiology and Risk Factors Surveillance of the CKD project (2008–2013) and the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (2001–2013). A total of 4050 diabetic patients with CKD, 20–85 years of age, from 14 hospitals and the community are included in this study. As compared to CKD patients without DR, CKD patients with DR have a lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (39.17 ± 30.36 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 vs. 54.38 ± 33.67 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ); poorer glycemic control (higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.85 ± 4.97 vs. 7.29 ± 4.02, p &lt; 0.01); higher proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR)1.94 ± 2.96 g/dL vs. 0.91 ± 2.11 g/dL, p &lt; 0.01); more anemia (Hb 11.22 ± 2.43 g/dL vs. 12.39 ± 3.85 g/dL, p &lt; 0.01), and more hypoalbuminemia (3.88 ± 0.95 g/dL vs. 4.16 ± 1.74 g/dL, p &lt; 0.01). Later stage (stage 3b–5) CKD patients with DR had significantly higher CKD progression compared with patients without DR (OR (odds ratio) 1.66 (1.36–2.02)). Patients with proliferative DR had significantly higher CKD progression events compared to patients with non-proliferative DR (OR 2.18 (1.71–2.78)). The presence and severity of DR is a risk factor for CKD progression among our Taiwanese CKD patients with diabetes. Prevention and early detection of DR are important and DR should be routinely screened as early as possible among diabetic CKD patients. ? 2019 by the authors.

Methods: This study was a hospital-based design, we started to recruit clinical diagnosis of phenotypic FH since 2014 for the Ten Countries Study in the Asia-Pacific region. We consecutively recruited 302 FH patients and other 414 comparison subjects (214 subjects with hypertriglyceridemia and 200 subjects with normal lipid controls) from the special lipid clinic of National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei. All participants received cardiovascular health examinations and completed a self-reported questionnaire, including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) for assessment of the psychosocial depression. Results: Clinical FH patients had a higher risk of perceived depression, with an odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) of possible depression by 1.50 (1.07–2.11) and probable depression by 1.73 (1.10–2.75) than those of the non-FH groups after adjusted relevant cardiovascular risk factors. FH patients with a family history of coronary heart disease (CHD) had higher domain-specific depression scores than those of controls. In addition, this study found that FH patients with lower educational levels also had a higher risk of depression compared with those in control groups.

We analyzed TB cases newly diagnosed in 2006–2008, confirmed by the diagnostic laboratory, at a university-affiliated hospital in Taipei metropolitan area where TB is endemic in elderly populations. Numbers of randomly selected non-TB patients (as controls) from each district were proportional to the district population (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.8), which supports that patients who visited the hospital represent a spatially independent sample of total population in this area. We used the nearest neighbor hierarchical (NNH) clustering method and the spatial scan statistics to identify spatial TB clusters among 969 cases within the 10-km buffer, adjusting for the elderly population. One cluster with 10 TB cases from different households in geographic proximity to each other was detected by both NNH clustering and spatial scan statistics. Spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) genotyping showed that four of the six M. tuberculosis strains from this spatial cluster were identical. Three of those four patients were older than 70 years, but none were nursing home residents. The identical genotypes of M. tuberculosis strains in clustered elderly TB patients living in neighborhoods indicate that recent transmission plays a significant role in TB endemicity among elderly populations in Taiwan. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Genotyping; Recent transmission; Spatial clustering; Spatial epidemiology; Tuberculosis,disease transmission; elderly population; epidemiology; metropolitan area; neighborhood; spatial analysis; tuberculosis; urban society; Taipei; Taiwan; Mycobacterium tuberculosis,2-s2.0-85061746810

We aimed to investigate whether patients undergoing bariatric surgery are at risk of developing gallbladder disease postoperatively. Patients and methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study by using claims data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The study cohort comprised 4197 patients diagnosed with morbid obesity. Results: Among the morbidly obese patients, 2698 underwent bariatric surgery. Females and younger subjects were more prevalent in the surgical group than non-surgical group. Bariatric surgery reduced all obesity-related comorbidities. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed, which revealed increased risk of cholecystectomy after bariatric surgery among obese patients (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.43; p = 0.0165). After adjusting for sex and age, the incidence of cholecystectomy was increased in the females population (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.74; p < 0.05) and in 30–64 years-old-group (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.69, p < 0.05). The cumulative incidence rate of cholecystectomy showed an increased tendency in those undergoing bariatric surgery by log-rank test.

The clinicopathologic characteristics were reviewed and the overall survival (OS) was compared between patients with CIMP-high CRC and those with CIMP-low/negative CRC. Results: Among 450 CRC specimens with successfully determined CIMP statuses, 74 (16.4%) were CIMP-high CRC. Although there was no difference in OS between patients with CIMP-high and CIMP-low/negative CRC across all stages (p = 0.4526), intriguingly, patients with stage IV CIMP-high CRC had significantly worse OS than those with stage IV CIMP-low/negative CRC (p = 0.0047).

In addition to various experimental methods demonstrated to be feasible for lipid suppression, the postprocessing method is beneficial in the flexibility of applications. In this study, the signal space projection (SSP) algorithm is proposed to suppress the lipid signal in the MRSI. Methods: The performance of lipid suppression using SSP and SSP combined with the Papoulis-Gerchberg (PG) algorithm (PG+SSP) is examined in 2D MRSI data and the results were compared with outer volume saturation (OVS) methods. Up to 10 lipid spatial components were extracted by SSP from lipid signals in the range of 0.8~1.5 ppm. Results: Our results show that most lipid signals were found in the first 4 to 5 components and that lipid signals on the spectra can be suppressed using 4 to 5 components. Metabolites concentrations were quantified using LCModel. Two regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected on the peripheral and inner brain regions. The quantification of metabolites in terms of fitting reliability (CRLB) and spatial variations within ROIs (SpaVar) is improved using SSP. When 5 to 6 components were used in SSP and PG+SSP, the metabolite concentrations and the associated SpaVar and CRLB are at the same level as those from the OVS. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the SSP method can be used to suppress the lipid signals of MRSI and SSP with 5 to 6 components is suggested to have a similar suppression performance as the OVS method. ? 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",lipid suppression; MR spectroscopic imaging; out volume saturation; Signal space projection,lipid; algorithm; Article; comparative study; contamination; controlled study; human; image analysis; image processing; mathematical computing; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Papoulis Gerchberg algorithm; performance; radiological parameters; signal noise ratio; signal space projection algorithm; voxel based morphometry,2-s2.0-85053392684

Regarding a trial with censored time to endpoint, Lan and DeMets (1989) later defined information time at an interim analysis in a maximum duration trial. To compare two survival curves utilizing such a design, information times for group sequential logrank and Wilcoxon-type statistics have been developed by assuming that the survival time follows an exponential distribution or a Weibull distribution without considering the censoring distribution. To better address the practical concerns inherent in clinical trials with survival endpoints, we present a new approach to adequately design a group sequential trial using the Harrington–Fleming (1982) test based on our proposed information fractions by assuming the censoring distribution depends on the patient's accrual time according to various entry distributions and by extending the underlying survival distribution to the generalized gamma distribution. We also determine associated sample sizes, expected number of events and expected stopping time. Two phase III trials of non-small-cell lung cancer originally designed using fixed-sample tests are utilized to illustrate the potential advantages of using a group sequential design with the proposed approach.

In Taiwan, the numbers of the migrant workers from countries with high TB incidence increase significantly in past decades and the impact on public health remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the difference of TB incidence between Taiwanese and the migrant workers. Methods: The migrant workers are obligated to receive pre-arrival, post-arrival and regular chest X-ray screening during their stay in Taiwan. We retrospectively collected these data extracted from the Alien Workers Health Database in Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan from Jan. 1, 2004 to Dec. 31, 2013. Poisson regression models were used to compare the hazard ratios of TB between Taiwanese and the migrant workers after adjusting gender and age groups. Results: The total migrant workers in Taiwan reached 314,034 persons in 2004 and 489,134 persons in 2013, accounting for 2% of Taiwan population. The TB incidence of migrant workers was similar to Taiwanese (53-73.7 per 105 vs 45.5-76.8 per 105). Comparing with Taiwanese, the TB risk was significantly lower in male migrant workers (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70-0.83, P &lt; 0.001), but higher in female migrant workers (HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.35-1.46, P &lt; 0.001). Besides, we found that the TB risk in migrant workers was 5.30-fold (95% CI: 4.83-5.83, P &lt; 0.001) in youngest group (?24 year-old) comparing with Taiwanese. Conclusions: Migrant workers in Taiwan have higher TB incidence than Taiwanese in young groups, especially in females.

The contaminants impact eco-system and human health via food chain. Animals, including humans, are likely to accumulate contaminants in their bodies from direct exposure or feeding behavior, resulting in toxicity. Therefore, evaluation of the toxicity of contaminants is an important issue. Metals are highly toxic but the toxicity depends on many factors, including the valance and the complex form of metals, the organic matter level in the environment, the reducing/oxidizing condition of the environment, and etc. Since the level of metal amount does not directly correlate to bioavailability, cell culture is usually used for toxicity evaluation. In this study, a microfluidic chip was developed to evaluate the cell toxicity from exposure to metals, copper and thallium. Compared to traditional cytotoxicity assay using static state culture with tetrazolium reagent, this microfluidic chip can generate various shear stresses by changing geometry of culture areas or flow rate. Enhancement of shear stresses could increase cell sensitivity toward metal exposure. Therefore, this platform provides a more sensitive platform for quantitative analysis of cell toxicity and could be applied to evaluate toxicity from environmental samples. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Copper; Cytotoxicity; Microfluidic chip; Shear stress; Thallium,Biochemistry; Cell culture; Contamination; Copper; Fluidic devices; Metals; Microfluidics; Shear flow; Shear stress; Thallium; Toxicity; Anthropogenic sources; Cell sensitivity; Cytotoxicity assays; Environmental sample; Feeding behavior; Metal contaminants; Microfluidic chip; Screening methods; Cytotoxicity; copper; thallium; anthropogenic source; bioavailability; copper; pollution exposure; quantitative analysis; shear stress; thallium; toxicity; Article; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell structure; controlled study; cytotoxicity; fibroblast; flow rate; human; human cell; lethality; microfluidic analysis; pollutant; priority journal; quantitative analysis; shear stress; Animalia,2-s2.0-85053761147

Four hundred and thirty-seven women who underwent primary staging surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed from two medical centers. The prognostic factors were determined from multivariate survival analyses using Cox regression models. The majority of women were diagnosed with stage Ic (244/437, 55.8%). The histopathologic types were clear cell (37.5%), endometrioid (27.2%), serous (14.0%), and mucinous (13.3%). Fifty-seven percent (249/437) of the women received taxane-based (platinum plus paclitaxel) regimens and 43.0% received non-taxane (platinum plus cyclophosphamide) regimens as frontline adjuvant chemotherapy. Clear cell tumors (adjusted Hazard ratio (aHR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.73, p = 0.001) showed better 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) than serous tumors. Women diagnosed at FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage II (aHR 5.97, 95% CI = 2.47-14.39, p < 0.001), grade 3 tumor without clear cell (aHR 2.28, 95% CI = 1.02-5.07, p = 0.004) and who received 3-5 cycles of non-taxane regimens (aHR 3.29, 95% CI = 1.47-7.34, p = 0.004) had worse 5-year overall survival (OS). Clear cell histology treated with taxane-based regimens showed significantly higher 5-year DFS (91.2% vs. 82.0%, aHR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21-0.93, p = 0.043) and 5-year OS (93.5% vs. 79.0%, aHR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.13-0.70, p = 0.005) than those treated with non-taxane-based regimens.

Medical records of six patients diagnosed with CCC of the abdominal wall between May 2003 and May 2018 at the National Taiwan University Hospital were reviewed. All patients had prior obstetric or gynecologic surgeries. The primary clinical presentation was enlarging abdominal masses at previous surgical scars. Four patients underwent initial/primary surgeries with/without adjuvant chemotherapy. One patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical intervention and adjuvant chemotherapy, the other received chemotherapy and sequential radiotherapy without any surgical intervention. Two of four patients undergoing initial/primary surgeries had disease recurrence and the remaining two cases without initial surgery experienced disease progression during primary treatment. Inguinal lymph nodes were the most frequent sites of recurrence. In conclusion, previous obstetric or gynecologic surgery can be a risk factor for CCC of the abdominal wall. Complete resection of abdominal wall tumor and suspected intra-abdominal lesions with hysterectomy and bilateral inguinal lymph nodes dissection may be the primary treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy would be considered for potential benefits. For patients without bilateral inguinal lymph nodes dissection, careful inguinal lymph node palpation during postoperative surveillance is necessary. More cases are still needed to elucidate the clinical management of this disease. ? 2019 by the authors.

However, whether cordycepin affects FAK expression and cellular functions in ECs and the specific molecular mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we found that cordycepin suppressed FAK expression and the phosphorylation of FAK (p-FAK) at Tyr397 in ECs. Cordycepin inhibited the proliferation, wound healing, transwell migration, and tube formation of ECs. Confocal microscopy revealed that cordycepin significantly reduced FAK expression and decreased focal adhesion number of ECs. The suppressed expression of FAK was accompanied by induced p53 and p21 expression in ECs. Finally, we demonstrated that cordycepin suppressed angiogenesis in an in vivo angiogenesis assay and reduced HCC tumor growth in a xenograft nude mice model. Our study indicated that cordycepin could attenuate cell proliferation and migration and may result in the impairment of the angiogenesis process and tumor growth via downregulation of FAK and induction of p53 and p21 in ECs. Therefore, cordycepin may be used as a potential adjuvant for cancer therapy. ? 2019 by the authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of patient-centred and family-centred care meetings (PFCCM) on intensive measures and resource utilisation during end-of-life (EOL) hospitalisation among terminally ill patients. Design and setting A retrospective cross-sectional study using electronic medical records was conducted in a tertiary referral medical centre in Taiwan. Participants We identified 6843 deceased patients with terminal illness who either received or did not receive PFCCM during EOL hospitalisation between January 2013 and December 2015. Primary and secondary outcome measures Patients who were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Those who underwent invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, haemodialysis and surgical intervention during the final hospitalisation were determined by the use of intensive care measures; secondary measures were individual total and daily medical expenditures. A generalised estimating equation (GEE) model was used to compare the differences between the two groups. OR and beta coefficients (β) with 95% CI were estimated. Results This study identified 459 patients (6.7%) who received PFCCM during EOL hospitalisation. Multivariate analyses showed that patients who received PFCCM were less likely to have ICU admissions (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.57), undergo surgical interventions (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.66) during the final hospitalisation, after adjusting for patient demographics, clinical conditions and year of admission. Additionally, a significant decrease in daily medical expenditures was observed in PFCCM patients (β-0.18, 95% CI-0.25 to-0.12) than in non-PFCCM patients. Conclusions Patient-physician discussion through PFCCM is associated with less intensive care utilisation and daily medical expenditure during EOL hospitalisation in terminally ill patients. ? 2019 Author(s).",end-of-life; hospitalisation; intensive care; medical expenditure; patient- A nd family-centred care meetings; terminal illness,adult; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; clinical evaluation; confidence interval; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; doctor patient relationship; electronic medical record; family centered care; female; generalized estimating equation; health care cost; health care utilization; hemodialysis; human; intensive care; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; multivariate analysis; noninvasive ventilation; observational study; outcome assessment; patient care; retrospective study; shared decision making; surgical patient; terminal disease; terminally ill patient; tertiary health care; tracheostomy,2-s2.0-85061112812

Many printed versions of such material are available, including comics that explore the individual memories of patients who have gone through cancer treatment. These studies have been used to orientate patients, patients’ relatives, and physicians. However, only a few Web-based comics have been specifically designed for patients with breast cancer and used as aids to decision making. Objective: We aimed to describe the developmental process of creating an animated comic as a Web-based surgery decision-making tool; the comic was aimed at illustrating the feelings, thoughts, and meanings when a patient suffers from breast cancer. This was done by recounting the symptoms, diagnostic process, treatments, and treatment effects of such women from the diagnosis stage onward. Methods: Using cycles of planning, action, evaluation, and reflection, which involved collaborative work, action research was conducted to develop a Web-based animated comic. The stages of action research consisted of (1) semistructured and in-depth interviews to collect experiences of women with breast cancer; (2) construction of an animated comic by editors, graphics designers, dubbers, and information technology engineers; (3) redrawing of pictures of the comic after gathering feedback from a breast surgeon; and (4) evaluation of the Web-based animated comic using 6 patient focus groups. Results: The comic was produced and showcased on the website “The Network of Making-decision Aids for Breast Cancer Surgery”; the comic was accompanied by soft music and audio explanations. The comic functions as a personal statement that describes experiencing breast cancer. The animated comic consists of 8 chapters, based on the 8 themes deducted from the findings obtained during the analysis of relevant interviews. The 8 chapters include (1) the appearance of a lump; (2) confirmation by medical diagnosis; (3) the uncertainty of waiting (4) fear of life-threatening disease; (5) choosing life over despair; (6) being brave and deciding to undergo treatment; (7) choosing the type of surgery; and (8) being reborn. Conclusions: Using action research, this study illustrated that the comic that sheds light on issues of feelings, emotions, and thoughts that are present when a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and provides a communication medium to explain the steps in the process. Meanwhile, it implies that hope will be able to overcome the challenges that will be faced. Within the Web-based decision aid for patients with breast cancer, the animated comic acts as an information resource and is aimed at patients’ understanding of impacts of emotions arising when suffering from breast cancer. It is potentially applicable as a therapeutic tool that facilitates self-reflection and self-healing among newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer. ?

The present study, with a prospective longitudinal design, investigated the role of negative emotion recognition in moderating the linkage from insecure attachment cognitions to elevated depressive symptoms. A sample of 96 depression-prone individuals completed measures for attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, depression symptom severity, and a computerized facial and prosodic emotion recognition task twice with a four-week interval. Results revealed that the interaction between attachment avoidance and fearful prosodic emotion recognition significantly predicted subsequent depressive symptoms. More specifically, greater attachment avoidance with lower accuracy of fearful prosodic emotions at baseline predicted an increase of depressive symptoms over four-week interval. However, no moderating role of emotion recognition in the linkage from attachment anxiety to depression persistence was noted. The present study demonstrates that attachment avoidance and negative emotion recognition may together contribute to the maintenance of depression. The findings may be pertinent to attachment avoidance-related deactivating strategy that appears to be a specific cultural forbearance way for emotion regulation in collectivistic societies.

Coinfection with both viruses may further increase the risk. Currently, little is known about the role of fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, a simple liver fibrosis stage biomarker, in predicting the clinical outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 152 non-cirrhotic patients with dual chronic HCV and HBV infection: 56 patients received pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy, while 96 patients remained untreated. The association between the FIB-4 index and the incidence of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was explored. Results: After a 9.88-year follow-up, the incidence of hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance was 4.97 (95% confidence interval: 3.13–7.89) per 100 person-years in the treated group and was 1.77 (1.10–2.85) in the untreated group. Of the treated group, only three and six patients developed HCC and liver cirrhosis, respectively, while 17 and 23 patients developed HCC and liver cirrhosis, respectively, in untreated group. Baseline FIB-4 index correlated with the development of liver cirrhosis in multivariable analysis of all subjects. High baseline FIB-4 index (per 1 point increase) in the treated groups was associated with a higher risk of developing liver cirrhosis (P?=?0.001) and HCC (P?=?0.038) in univariable analysis.

Methods: Eighty-seven exclusively breast-fed infants with AD were enrolled in a prospective observational study. The infants were divided into 3 groups: breastfeeding only (BM group), partial breastfeeding and partial partially hydrolyzed whey formula (pHF-W) (Partial group) and pHF-W only (DC group). The extent and severity of AD were evaluated with the Patient-Oriented SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (PO-SCORAD) index at enrollment and 3 and 6 months later. Results: There were no significant differences in parental atopy history, PO-SCORAD scores, and medication scores at baseline. At month 3 and 6, the PO-SCORAD scores were significantly decreased in all groups. PO-SCORAD scores at month 3 and 6 and at the last time point when topical corticosteroids were given were significantly different among the groups. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that baseline PO-SCORAD scores and stopping breastfeeding were significantly associated with month 3 PO-SCORAD scores (p < 0.001), after adjusting for sex, age, baseline medication scores, partial breastfeeding and parental atopy history. In addition to baseline PO-SCORAD scores and stopping breastfeeding, partial breastfeeding was significantly associated with month 6 PO-SCORAD scores. Long-term follow-up showed that only stopping breastfeeding was significantly associated with the last time point when topical corticosteroids were given (p = 0.014). Conclusion: For exclusively breast-fed infants with AD, discontinuing breastfeeding and shifting to pHF-W might help to improve symptoms and shorten the duration of AD regardless of sex, age and parental atopy history. ? 2017",Atopic dermatitis; Breastfeeding; Partially hydrolyzed whey formula; PO-SCORAD,"antibiotic agent; antihistaminic agent; corticosteroid; emollient agent; fluticasone propionate; prednisolone; corticosteroid; age; Article; artificial milk; atopic dermatitis; atopy; breast feeding; breast feeding education; child; child parent relation; disease severity; family history; female; follow up; human; infant; major clinical study; male; milk; observational study; patient oriented scoring atopic dermatitis score; preschool child; prospective study; questionnaire; self evaluation; atopic dermatitis; pathology; risk factor; severity of illness index; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Breast Feeding; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Self-Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85023622521

H. pylori can secrete high temperature requirement A (HtrA) to mediate E-Cadherin cleavage for gastric epithelial junction disruption, so H. pylori CagL can adhere to integrin located on basolateral side of epithelium. The study test whether H. pylori HtrA amino acid polymorphisms can increase gastric cancer risk synergistically with CagL-Y58/E59. Methods: One-hundred and sixty-four H. pylori-positive patients, including 71 with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), 63 with peptic ulcers (PU), and 30 with gastric cancers (GC), were enrolled to receive upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to obtain gastric biopsies for H. pylori culture and histology by the updated Sydney system. Each isolate was screened for htrA & cagL genotype by polymerase chain reaction and HtrA & CagL-Y58/E59 amino acid sequence polymorphisms by sequencing. Results: The prevalence rates of htrA & cagL gene were both 100%. The HtrA amino acid sequence polymorphisms were not different between NUD and PU. The H. pylori isolates of GC had higher rates of HtrA residue 171 as leucine than those of NUD (73.3% vs. 50.7%, P = 0.036, OR[95%CI] = 2.7[1.1-6.8]). The risk of the H. pylori-infected subjects to get gastric cancer was increased up to 15.4-fold, if the infected isolates had presence of both HtrA-L171 and CagL-Y58/E59 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The H. pylori isolates of gastric cancer subjects had a higher rate of HtrA-L171.

The lncRNA SNHG1 was reported to be aberrantly expressed and associated with poor patient prognosis in several cancers including neuroblastoma. However, the interacting RBPs and biological functions associated with SNHG1 in neuroblastoma remain unknown. In this study, we identified 283, 31, and 164 SNHG1-interacting proteins in SK-N-BE(2)C, SK-N-DZ, and SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells, respectively, using a RNA-protein pull-down assay coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Twenty-four SNHG1-interacting RBPs were identified in common from these three neuroblastoma cell lines. RBPs MATR3, YBX1, and HNRNPL have the binding sites for SNHG1 predicted by DeepBind motif analysis. Furthermore, the direct binding of MATR3 with SNHG1 was validated by Western blot and confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP). Coexpression analysis revealed that the expression of SNHG1 is positively correlated with MATR3 (P = 3.402 × 10 -13 ). The high expression of MATR3 is associated with poor event-free survival (P = 0.00711) and overall survival (P = 0.00064). Biological functions such as ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, RNA processing, and RNA splicing are significantly enriched and in common between SNHG1 and MATR3. In conclusion, we identified MATR3 as binding to SNHG1 and the interaction might be involved in splicing events that enhance neuroblastoma progression. ?

Material and methods: A total of 138 CRS patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery were included. A brief history of rhinosinusitis symptoms, blood eosinophil count, blood-specific allergen tests, computed tomography (CT) scan findings, Lund-Mackay (LM) CT scores, and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) Questionnaire scores, and sinoscopy findings at 3 and 6?months postoperatively. Results: The ImmunoCAP test was positive in 71(51%) patients and negative in 67(49%) patients. The mean age of those who received endoscopic sinus surgery was 7-years younger in the allergic group compared with the non-allergic group (p =.008). The peripheral eosinophil count in the allergic group was higher than that of the non-allergic group (p =.008). The LM scores and SNOT-22 scores were not significantly different between the two groups. The recurrence rate of nasal polyps in the allergic group was higher but without statistical significance.

Methods: This observational single center study evaluated adult LC patients receiving open heart surgery with CPB during 2007 and 2017. The primary endpoint was post-operative hypoxic hepatitis (POHH), defined by post-operative serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase more than 10 times the pre-operative value. Results: In total, 61 patients were included in the study, of whom 14 (18.7%) developed POHH. Hospital mortality of non-POHH group (4.3%) was similar to that estimated using Euroscore II (4.0%), but that of the POHH group (21.4%) was 2.7 times as that estimated using Euroscore II (8.0%). Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and CPB duration were found as independent risk factors for POHH by multivariate logistic regression. POHH incidence was 0.0% if MELD <5 and 80.0% of MELD >20 regardless of CPB duration. For those with MELD between 5 and 20, POHH incidence increases as CPB duration increases. Conclusion: For LC patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, the incidence of POHH is highly associated with MELD score and CPB duration. To prevent POHH, the CPB duration should be shortened for those with MELD score between 5 and 20, and CPB be avoid for those with MELD >20. ? 2019",Cardiopulmonary bypass; Liver cirrhosis; MELD score; Open heart surgery; Post-operative hypoxic hepatitis,,2-s2.0-85072210921

Thus, DCs become a target for therapeutic design in allergic diseases. In this study, we aim to investigate the anti-allergic effect of pure compounds from a medicinal mushroom Antrodia cinnamomea (Ac) on DC-induced allergic responses. We identified a benzenoid compound 4,7-dimethoxy-5-methyl-l,3-benzodioxole (DMB) which may modulate Th2 polarization in bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and in a murine food allergy model. DMB effectively reduced the Th2 adjuvant cholera toxin (CT)-induced BMDC maturation and cytokine production. In studying the mechanism, DMB blocked the molecular processes involved in Th2 induction, including cAMP activation, IL-33 production, and IRF4/Tim4 upregulation, in CT-activated BMDCs. Furthermore, DMB treatment attenuated the symptoms, clinical scores, and Th2 responses of CT-induced ovalbumin (OVA)-specific food allergy in mice at sensitization stage. These results indicated that DMB could suppress DC function for Th2 polarization and mitigate allergic responses. Thus, DMB may have potential to be a novel agent for preventing or treating food allergy. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Antrodia cinnamomea; Cholera Toxin; Dendritic Cell; Food Allergy; Th2,"4,7 dimethoxy 5 methyl levo,3 benzodioxole; antiallergic agent; aromatic compound; cholera toxin; cyclic AMP; interferon regulatory factor 4; interleukin 33; ovalbumin; plant extract; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiallergic activity; Antrodia camphorata; Article; bone marrow derived dendritic cell; cell maturation; controlled study; cytokine production; drug isolation; drug mechanism; drug synthesis; food allergy; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; polarization; sensitization; Th2 cell; upregulation",2-s2.0-85072210371

The concept of palliative care is increasingly accepted, but the impacts of different major illnesses, geographic regions, and health expenses on DNR rates remain unclear. Methods This study utilized the two-million National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database to examine the percentage of DNR rates among all deaths in hospitals from 2001 to 2011. DNR in the study was defined as no resuscitation before death in hospitals. Death records were extracted from the database and correlated with healthcare information. Descriptive statistics were compiled to examine the relationships between DNR rates and variables including major illnesses, geographic regions, and NHI spending. Results A total of 126,390 death records were extracted from the database for analysis. Among cancer-related deaths, pancreatic cancer patients had the highest DNR rate (86.99%) and esophageal cancer patients had the lowest DNR rate (71.62%). The higher DNR rate among cancer-only patients (79.53%) decreased with concomitant dialysis (66.07%) or ventilator use (57.85%). The lower DNR rates in patients with either chronic dialysis (51.27%) or ventilator use (59.10%) increased when patients experienced these two conditions concomitantly (61.31%). Although DNR rates have consistently increased over time across all regions of Taiwan, a persistent disparity was noted between the East and the South (76.89% vs. 70.78% in 2011, p < 0.01). After adjusting for potential confounders, DNR patients had significantly lower NHI spending one year prior to death ($67,553), compared with non-DNR patients. Conclusion Our study found that DNR rates varied across cancer types and decreased in cancer patients with concomitant chronic dialysis or ventilator use. Disparities in DNR rates were evident across geographic regions in Taiwan.

The CD19+ CD1dhi CD5+ Bregs that can execute regulatory functions via secreting IL-10 are defined as B10 cells. Bregs suppress autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, whereas they exacerbate infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Notably, the molecular mechanisms regulating the development and functions of Bregs are still largely unknown. Furthermore, the biological impact of Bregs in fungal infection has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we compared the gene expression profiles of IL-10-producing and –non-producing mouse splenic B cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or anti-CD40 antibody. Blimp-1, a transcription factor known to be critical for plasma cell differentiation, was found to be enriched in the IL-10-producing B cells. The frequency of Blimp-1+ B10 cells was increased in LPS-treated mice and in isolated B10 cells that were stimulated with LPS. Surprisingly, B cell-specific Blimp-1 knockout (Cko) mice, generated by CD19 promoter driven Cre recombinase-dependent deletion of Prdm1 (gene encoding Blimp-1), showed higher frequencies of B10 cells both in the steady state and following injection with LPS, as compared with control littermates. However, B10 cells lacking Blimp-1 failed to efficiently suppress the proliferation of na?ve CD4+ T cells primed with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. B10 cells can be stimulated for further differentiation into plasmablasts, and a subset of plasmablasts express IL-10. We found that B10 cells from Cko mice failed to generate both IL-10-non-producing and IL-10-producing plasmablasts. Mechanistically, we found that Blimp-1 can directly suppress Il-10, whereas, in the presence of activated STAT3, Blimp-1 works together with activated STAT3 to upregulate Il-10. Moreover, we also found that B10 cells improve the clearance of Candida albicans infection but worsen the infection mortality. Notably, a lack of Blimp-1 in B10 cells did not change these effects of adoptively transferred B10 cells on fungal infections. Together, our data show that Blimp-1 regulates the generation, differentiation, and IL-10 production of Bregs. ? 2019 Wang, Tsai, Ko, Yang, Lin, Hung and Lin.",B10 cells; Blimp-1; Candida albicans; IL-10; Regulatory B cells,B lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1; CD19 antigen; CD40 ligand monoclonal antibody; interleukin 10; lipopolysaccharide; STAT3 protein; animal cell; animal experiment; apoptosis; Article; candidiasis; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell culture technique; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell transfer; chromatin immunoprecipitation; coculture; colony forming unit; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flow cytometry; gene; gene amplification; gene deletion; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene knockout; gene ontology; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; luciferase assay; macrophage; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; Prdm1 gene; promoter region; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulatory B lymphocyte; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA isolation; upregulation; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85071749401

In this longitudinal study, we investigated the causal relationship between pubertal maturation and asthma through Mendelian randomization (MR) and explored the joint effect of overweightness and early pubertal maturation on asthma. Methods: We used data from the Taiwan Children Health Study with longitudinal follow-ups of 2991 children aged 11-17?years. Six puberty-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (combined into a weighted allelic score) were used to yield genetic instrumental variables for early puberty. Early pubertal maturation was defined as reaching a certain pubertal stage earlier than the median age for that stage. Incident asthma cases were calculated by excluding children with a history of asthma prior to that age. Results: The results of MR analysis revealed that early pubertal maturation was associated with active asthma (OR?=?1.18; 95% CI: 1.08-1.28); this effect was significant in male children. Early pubertal maturation significantly increased the risk of incident asthma outcomes at 12 and 17?years of age in both sexes (hazard ratio?=?2.15; 95% CI: 1.21-3.84). Taking non-overweight and non–early puberty children as the reference group, we observed a synergistic effect of overweightness and early pubertal maturation on asthma risk (OR?=?1.08; 95% CI: 1.04-1.11) in children of both sexes. Conclusions: Early screening and intervention for obesity are recommended to prevent future early pubertal onset and asthma occurrence. ? 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

The rising incidence rate and female mortality make it a significant public health concern in recent years. Dovitinib is a novel multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been enrolled in several clinical trials in different cancers. However, its antitumor efficacy has not been well determined in breast cancers. Our results demonstrated that dovitinib showed significant antitumor activity in human breast cancer cell lines with dose- and time-dependent manners. Downregulation of phosphor-(p)-STAT3 and its subsequent effectors Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 was responsible for this drug effect. Ectopic expression of STAT3 rescued the breast cancer cells from cell apoptosis induced by dovitinib. Moreover, SHP-1 inhibitor reversed the downregulation of p-STAT3 induced by dovitinib, indicating that SHP-1 mediated the STAT3 inhibition effect of dovitinib. In addition to apoptosis, we found for the first time that dovitinib also activated autophagy to promote cell death in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, dovitinib induced both apoptosis and autophagy to block the growth of breast cancer cells by regulating the SHP-1-dependent STAT3 inhibition. ? 2019 Yi-Han Chiu et al.",,bafilomycin A1; beclin 1; caspase 9; cyclin D1; dovitinib; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein lc3b i; protein lc3b ii; protein mcl 1; protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 1; sequestosome 1; STAT3 protein; survivin; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cell death; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; ectopic expression; flow cytometry; HCC1937 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; MDA-MB-453 cell line; MDA-MB-468 cell line; MTT assay; protein expression; protein targeting; signal transduction; SK-BR-3 cell line; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85071644136

In particular, it appears to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. However, a major concern associated with HT is that the thermal dosage applied to the tumor cells may also harm the normal tissue cells. Besides, the drugs used in HT are conventional chemotherapy drugs, which may cause serious side effects. The present study demonstrated a novel methodology in HT therapy called thermal cycle (TC)-HT. With this strategy, a therapeutic window with a maximum synergistic effect was created by combining TC-HT with natural compounds, with minimal unwanted cell damage. The natural compound propolis was selected, and the synergistic anticancer effect of TC-HT and propolis was investigated in pancreatic cancer cells. The present results demonstrated for the first time that TC-HT could enhance the anticancer effect of propolis on PANC-1 cancer cells through the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway and cell cycle arrest. Combined treatment greatly suppressed mitochondrial membrane potential, which is an important indicator of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria. Furthermore, the cell cycle-regulating protein cell division cycle protein 2 was downregulated upon combined treatment, which prevented cellular progression into mitosis. The present study offers the first report, to the best of our knowledge, on the combination of TC-HT with a natural compound for pancreatic cancer treatment. It is anticipated that this methodology may be a starting point for more sophisticated cancer treatments and may thereby improve the quality of life of many patients with cancer. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) markers such as GATA3, cytokeratin (CK) 20, CK5/6, and p53 are associated with these subtypes. In this study, we investigated the biological and prognostic significance of these IHC markers in MIBCs from 91 patients who underwent radical cystectomy. High Ki-67 indices were associated with negative CK20 (p = 0.002) and diffuse CK5/6 (p = 0.001) staining. By contrast, tumors with diffuse GATA3 expression had low Ki-67 index (p = 0.006). Regarding p53, three staining patterns were associated with a high Ki-67 index: (1) complete absence, (2) diffusely strong nuclear reactivity, and (3) diffusely strong cytoplasmic staining (p < 0.001 compared with other patterns). CK5/6 and CK20 expression was typically present in a reciprocal fashion; however, diffuse GATA3 and CK5/6 coexpression was observed in 13 (14.29%) cases. Among 78 chemotherapy-na?ve patients, low GATA3 staining was associated with worse recurrence-free survival in both univariate (p = 0.008) and multivariate analyses (p = 0.002). CK20, CK5/6, or p53 expression was not associated with clinical outcome. Based on our results, IHC staining for GATA3 may help risk stratification in patients with MIBC receiving radical cystectomy. In addition, the differences in Ki-67 indices suggested that aberrant p53 expression was better defined by the three aforementioned patterns, rather than percentage of nuclear staining alone. ? 2019 Wang et al.

Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a seamless, Web-based workflow for comparing the safety and effectiveness of drugs in a database of electronic medical records. Methods: We proposed a comprehensive integration process for cohort surveillance using the National Taiwan University Hospital Clinical Surveillance System (NCSS). We studied a practical application of the NCSS that evaluates the drug safety and effectiveness of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin by cohort tree analysis in an efficient and interoperable platform. Results: We demonstrated a practical example of investigating the differences in effectiveness and safety between NOACs and warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) using the NCSS. We efficiently identified 2357 patients with nonvalvular AF with newly prescribed oral anticoagulants between 2010 and 2015 and further developed 1 main cohort and 2 subcohorts for separately measuring ischemic stroke as the clinical effectiveness outcome and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) as the safety outcome. In the subcohort of ischemic stroke, NOAC users exhibited a significantly lower risk of ischemic stroke than warfarin users after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, and comedication in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (P=.01) but did not exhibit a significantly distinct risk in an as-treated (AT) analysis (P=.12) after the 2-year follow-up. In the subcohort of ICH, NOAC users did not exhibit a different risk of ICH both in ITT (P=.68) and AT analyses (P=.15). Conclusions: With a seamless and Web-based workflow, the NCSS can serve the critical role of forming associations between evidence and the real world at a medical center in Taiwan. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Because of the limitations of traditional mammography and ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has gradually become an important radiological method for breast cancer assessment over the past decades. MRI is free of the problems related to radiation exposure and provides excellent image resolution and contrast. However, a disadvantage is the injection of contrast agent, which is toxic for some patients (such as patients with chronic renal disease or pregnant and lactating women). Recent findings of gadolinium deposits in the brain are also a concern. To address these issues, this paper develops an intravoxel incoherent motion- (IVIM-) MRI-based histogram analysis approach, which takes advantage of several hyperspectral techniques, such as the band expansion process (BEP), to expand a multispectral image to hyperspectral images and create an automatic target generation process (ATGP). After automatically finding suspected targets, further detection was attained by using kernel constrained energy minimization (KCEM). A decision tree and histogram analysis were applied to classify breast tissue via quantitative analysis for detected lesions, which were used to distinguish between three categories of breast tissue: malignant tumors (i.e., central and peripheral zone), cysts, and normal breast tissues. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed IVIM-MRI-based histogram analysis approach can effectively differentiate between these three breast tissue types. ? 2019 Si-Wa Chan et al.",,Article; breast cancer; breast cyst; breast tissue; decision tree; diffusion weighted imaging; histogram; image analysis; image processing; intravoxel incoherent motion magnetic resonance imagin histogram; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative analysis; radiological parameters; tumor classification,2-s2.0-85071150642

Objectives This study was designed to determine the optimal predictors of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in adult NHNT patients with cryptococcosis. Methods The study population consisted of adult NHNT patients with culture-confirmed cryptococcosis who sought care at a university hospital in Taiwan from 2002 to 2016. We used a case-control method to identify the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings associated with CNS involvement in patients who underwent a diagnostic lumbar puncture. In the sensitivity analysis, we included additional control patients who did not undergo lumbar puncture, but were followed beyond 12 months without the development of CNS involvement in the absence of exposure to any fungicidal agents. Results We entered 270 NHNT adult patients into the study during the 15-year period. CNS involvement was confirmed in 66 (71.0%) of 93 patients who underwent lumbar puncture. A multivariable analysis revealed that presence of neurological manifestations and elevated serum CRAG titers were independently associated with a 23.97-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.37–182.23) and 1.53-fold (per 2-fold increment, 95% CI 1.26–1.92) increased odds ratio for CNS involvement, respectively. Headache and focal neurologic signs were independently associated with CNS involvement. A cut-off serum CRAG titer of 1:64 provided the highest diagnostic performance by Youden index (sensitivity 83% and specificity 65%). Similar findings were noted in the sensitivity analysis including 198 (73%) patients. Conclusion Lumbar puncture is indicated for NHNT patients with cryptococcosis who have neurologic manifestations or a serum CRAG titer of 1:64. ? 2019 Huang et al.

Regular physical exercise has been found to attenuate the genetic predisposition to obesity. However, it remains unknown what kinds of exercise can modify the genetic risk of obesity. This study included 18,424 unrelated Han Chinese adults aged 30-70 years who participated in the Taiwan Biobank (TWB). A total of 5 obesity measures were investigated here, including body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Because there have been no large genome-wide association studies on obesity for Han Chinese, we used the TWB internal weights to construct genetic risk scores (GRSs) for each obesity measure, and then test the significance of GRS-by-exercise interactions. The significance level throughout this work was set at 0.05/550 = 9.1x10-5 because a total of 550 tests were performed. Performing regular exercise was found to attenuate the genetic effects on 4 obesity measures, including BMI, BFP, WC, and HC. Among the 18 kinds of self-reported regular exercise, 6 mitigated the genetic effects on at least one obesity measure. Regular jogging blunted the genetic effects on BMI, BFP, and HC. Mountain climbing, walking, exercise walking, international standard dancing, and a longer practice of yoga also attenuated the genetic effects on BMI. Exercises such as cycling, stretching exercise, swimming, dance dance revolution, and qigong were not found to modify the genetic effects on any obesity measure. Across all 5 obesity measures, regular jogging consistently presented the most significant interactions with GRSs. Our findings show that the genetic effects on obesity measures can be decreased to various extents by performing different kinds of exercise.

However, its role in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remains unclear. Here we showed greater expression of GPER in BCSCs than non-BCSCs of three patient-derived xenografts of ER?/PR+ breast cancers. GPER silencing reduced stemness features of BCSCs as reflected by reduced mammosphere forming capacity in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo with decreased BCSC populations. Comparative phosphoproteomics revealed greater GPER-mediated PKA/BAD signaling in BCSCs. Activation of GPER by its ligands, including tamoxifen (TMX), induced phosphorylation of PKA and BAD-Ser118 to sustain BCSC characteristics. Transfection with a dominant-negative mutant BAD (Ser118Ala) led to reduced cell survival. Taken together, GPER and its downstream signaling play a key role in maintaining the stemness of BCSCs, suggesting that GPER is a potential therapeutic target for eradicating BCSCs. ? 2019 The Authors.

Methods: We identified incident stage IV cancer patients from Taiwan Cancer Registry during 2009-2013 and ascertained the first episode of septic shock after cancer diagnosis. Patient was classified as ICU admission and no ICU admission during the index hospitalization. Primary outcome of interest was overall survival. Propensity score (PS) and proportional hazards regression were used to control potential confounders. Results: A total of 11,825 stage IV cancer patients with septic shock were identified. Among them, 6,089 (51.5%) patients were admitted to ICU during the index hospitalization and 3,626 (30.7%) patients survived the index hospitalization. A 1:1 propensity score (PS)-matched cohort of 7,186 patients were created for patients with/without ICU admission among the total study population. Both the PS-stratified analysis among the overall population (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.81) and analysis among the PS-matched population (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.72-0.79) showed association between ICU admission and better overall survival. ICU admission was also associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality in both PS-stratified analysis (pooled odds ratio [OR]: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.75) and PS-matched analysis (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.55-0.68). In PS-stratified analysis for long-term survival after discharge among hospital survivors, ICU admission was associated with improved long-term survival after discharge (pooled HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.68-0.80). Also ICU admission was associated with better long-term survival after discharge (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.85) in PS-matched analysis. Conclusions: Though ICU admission with aggressive treatment may be associated with improved survival, the majority (70%) of stage IV cancer patients with septic shock were unable to survive until hospital discharge. ?

Changes in the profile and proportions of drug use among older adults increase with increases in the severity of functional decline and the prevalence of chronic diseases. Drugs that are classified as “potentially inappropriate medications” (PIMs) carry a higher risk of causing adverse reactions in older adults, provide uncertain therapeutic benefits, or may be substituted by alternative drugs that are generally safer to use. Researchers have developed criteria for PIMs in geriatric medicine that are applicable to clinical practice and research.

Materials and Methods: The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was searched from 2001 to 2015 for women aged ?55?years (postmenopausal) with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Participants were age-matched with women without breast cancer in a 1:5 ratio. Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to examine associations between breast cancer, risk factors and the development of diabetes mellitus. Results: A total of 4,607 women with primary breast cancer and 23,035 age-matched controls without breast cancer were included (mean age 58.6?±?9.1?years). Adjusting for age, income, urbanization, Charlson Comorbidity Index and medical conditions, the risk of diabetes mellitus for participants with breast cancer at 1, 5, 10 and 15?years was 1.70-, 1.34-, 1.27- and 1.24-fold higher, respectively, than for participants without breast cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40–2.05; aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.17–1.54; aHR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13–1.44; aHR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11–1.40). The risk of diabetes mellitus at 1?year for breast cancer patients receiving hormone therapy was 1.22-fold higher than in those not receiving hormone therapy (aHR 1.22, 95% CI 0.86–1.74), but without statistical significance. Conclusions: Postmenopausal women with breast cancer are at increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus, independent of receiving hormone therapy, and should be closely monitored to establish an early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for improving related outcomes. ? 2019 The Authors.

The goal of this study was to explore the brain default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and decision-making performance based on the Cambridge gambling task in heroin-dependent individuals undergoing methadone treatment (MT, n = 11) and medication-free faith-based therapeutic community program (TC, n = 11). The DMN involved the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left inferior parietal lobe (IPLL), right inferior parietal lobe (IPLR), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) subregions for all participants inboth the MT and TC groups. Compared with MT, TC had an increased functional connectivity in IPLL-IPLR and IPLR-PCC and decreased functional connectivity in mPFC-IPLL and IPLL-PCC. Both groups exhibited no significant difference in the regional rs-fMRI metric [i.e., amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)]. In the analysis of the neural correlates for decision-making performance, risk adjustment was positively associated with ALFF in IPLL for all participants considering the group effects. The involvement of IPL in decision-making performance and treatment response among heroin-dependent patients warrants further investigation.

The analysis of sensitivity to change is an essential part of psychometric validation. With this study, we investigated the EORTC QLQ-FA12's sensitivity to change. Methods: The methodology follows the EORTC guidelines of EORTC QLG for phase IV validation of modules. We included cancer patients undergoing curative and palliative treatment at t1 and followed them up prospectively over the course of their treatment (t2) and 4 weeks after completion of treatment (t3). Data were collected prospectively at 17 sites in 11 countries. Sensitivity to change was investigated using analysis of variance. Results: A total sample of 533 patients was enrolled with various tumour types, different stages of cancer, and receiving either curative treatment (n=311) or palliative treatment (n=222). Over time all fatigue scores were significantly higher in the palliative treatment group compared with the curative group (p <.001). Physical fatigue increased with medium effect size over the course of treatment in the curative group (standardized response mean [SRM] (t1,t2) = 0.44]. After treatment physical [SRM (t2,t3) = 0.39], emotional [SRM (t2,t3)= 0.28] and cognitive fatigue (SRM [t2,t3] = 0.22) declined significantly in the curative group. In the palliative group, emotional (SRM [t2,t3] = 0.18) as well as cognitive [SRM [t2,t3] = 0.26) fatigue increases significantly. Conclusions: The EORTC-QLQ-FA12 proved to identify clinically significant changes in fatigue in the course of curative and palliative cancer treatment. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cancer-related fatigue; EORTC quality of life group; international field validation; module development; quality of life; sensitivity to change,adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer fatigue; cancer hormone therapy; cancer palliative therapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cognitive fatigue; controlled study; emotional fatigue; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire FA12; female; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; physical fatigue; prospective study; quality of life,2-s2.0-85068786414

In addition, BS69 acts as a transcriptional repressor via interaction with transcriptional factors associated with tumorigenesis, such as cellular homolog of the avian myeloblastosis viral oncoprotein, v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2 oncoprotein, MYC-associated protein X gene-associated protein. Overexpression of BS69 can suppress proliferation of osteosarcoma, breast cancer and glioma cells in vitro; and inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models. Therefore, BS69 may act as a tumor suppressor, and may be a new target for cancer therapy. However, BS69 down-regulation has been found to be involved in cellular senescence and is associated with the reversion of the malignant phenotype of breast cancer cells. Therefore, additional studies are necessary to clarify the role of BS69 in tumor development. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

The present study focused on manic episode in BD patients and aimed to investigate state-specific transcriptome alterations between acute episode and remission, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and micro-RNAs (miRNAs), using microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) platforms. BD patients were enrolled with clinical information, and peripheral blood samples collected at both acute and remission status spanning for at least 2 months were confirmed by follow-ups. Symptom severity was assessed by Young Mania Rating Scale. We enrolled six BD patients as the discovery samples and used the Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 to capture transcriptome data at the two time points. For replication, expression data from Gene Expression Omnibus that consisted of 11 BD patients were downloaded, and we performed a mega-analysis for microarray data of 17 patients. Moreover, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in additional samples of 7 BD patients. To identify intraindividual differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we analyzed data using a linear model controlling for symptom severity. We found that noncoding genes were of majority among the top DEGs in microarray data. The expression fold change of coding genes among DEGs showed moderate to high correlations (?0.5) across platforms. A number of lncRNAs and two miRNAs (MIR181B1 and MIR103A1) exhibited high levels of gene expression in the manic state. For coding genes, we reported that the taste function-related genes, including TAS2R5 and TAS2R3, may be mania state-specific markers. Additionally, four genes showed a nominal p-value of less than 0.05 in all our microarray data, mega-analysis, and RNA-Seq analysis. They were upregulated in the manic state and consisted of MS4A14, PYHIN1, UTRN, and DMXL2, and their gene expression patterns were further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR). We also performed weight gene coexpression network analysis to identify gene modules for manic episode. Genes in the mania-related modules were different from the susceptible loci of BD obtained from genome-wide association studies, and biological pathways in relation to these modules were mainly related to immune function, especially cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Results of the present study elucidated potential molecular targets and genomic networks that are involved in manic episode. Future studies are needed to further validate these biomarkers for their roles in the etiology of bipolar illness. ? 2019 Lee, Chao, Chang, Hsieh, Liu, Chen, Lu, Chen, Chen, Tsai, Lu, Huang and Kuo.

Sao Tome and Principe (STP), small islands located in the Gulf of Guinea, recently experienced a dramatic reduction in the incidence of malaria owing to international collaborative efforts. However, unexplained febrile illnesses persist. A One Health approach was adopted to investigate exposure to SFGR and C. burnetii in humans and examine the diversity of these bacteria in ticks parasitizing domestic ruminants. A cross-sectional human serological study was conducted in Agua Grande district in Sao Tome Island from January to March 2016, and ticks were collected from farmed domestic ruminants in 2012 and 2016. In total, 240 individuals varying in age were randomly screened for exposure to SFGR and C. burnetii by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Twenty of 240 individuals (8.3%) were seropositive for SFGR (4 for Rickettsia africae and 16 for R. conorii) and 16 (6.7%) were seropositive for C. burnetii. Amblyomma astrion were collected exclusively in 2012, as were A. variegatum in 2016 and Rickettsia spp. were detected in 22/42 (52.4%) and 49/60 (81.7%) respectively. Sequence analysis of multiple gene targets from Rickettsia spp. detected in ticks suggests the presence of a single divergent R. africae strain (Sao Tome). While no ticks were found positive for C. burnetii, Coxiella-like endosymbionts were detected in nearly all ticks. This is the first study in STP to provide serological evidence in humans of SFGR and C. burnetii and additional molecular evidence in ticks for SFGR, which may be responsible for some of the unexplained febrile illnesses that persist despite the control of malaria. Future epidemiological studies are needed to confirm the occurrence and risk factors associated with SFG rickettsioses and Q fever in both humans and animals. ? 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",Amblyomma; Coxiella burnetii; Coxiella-like endosymbionts; One Health; Sao Tome and Principe; spotted fever group rickettsiae,,2-s2.0-85068084100

Physicians completed the SDM-Q-Doc for each of their cancer patient. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch model were used to test the psychometric properties of SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc. Results: SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc demonstrated unidimensional structure in CFA and Rasch model. In addition, the measurement invariance was supported for both SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc across sex using the multigroup CFA. Rash analysis indicates no differential item functioning (DIF)across sex for all the SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc items. SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc were moderately correlated (r = 0.41; P< 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between CKD at all stages and the risk of incident TB. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using 100 058 participants of a community-based health screening programme in northern Taiwan, 2005-2008. Renal function was ascertained at baseline using serum creatinine level and the urine dipstick test. The occurrence of active TB was ascertained using the National Tuberculosis Registry. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association between CKD and TB. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.5 years, the number of TB incident cases was 472. In the Cox regression analyses, individuals with Stage 1-4 CKD had a 25% increase in TB hazard than those without disease (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.25, 95%CI 1.02-1.54). A positive correlation between CKD stage and TB was observed (P ? 0.02 for trend). TB risk increased by 5.1% with every 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (aHR 1.05, 95%CI 0.99-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested an increased risk of TB in early-stage CKD. TB prevention efforts should consider individuals with earlier stages of CKD. ? 2019 The Union",Estimated glomerular filtration rate; Longitudinal study; Renal function,adult; Article; body mass; chronic kidney failure; clinical protocol; cohort analysis; community care; controlled study; disease association; disease course; disease registry; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; glucose blood level; health program; human; major clinical study; male; observational study; priority journal; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; Taiwan; tuberculosis,2-s2.0-85066866320

The individual variation in functional exercise capacity (FEC) response to PR within the cohort is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify FEC patterns in response to PR in patients with chronic respiratory disease using the trajectory modeling method. Methods: The data of 67 patients with the chronic respiratory disease were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed in this study. All patients received once-weekly supervised training for 8 weeks. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) was used to measure FEC. Muscle strength and 6MWD were assessed at baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and monthly for two months after PR completion. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was used to identify patterns in 6MWD in response to PR. The generalized estimating equation method was then used to detect the differences within and between the trajectories of identified groups across time. Results: Patients were grouped into low-(n=13), moderate-(n=34) and high-(n=20) FEC group based on GBTM analysis. All groups demonstrated significant improvements in 6MWD and leg muscle strength after 8-week PR. Compared to the high-FEC group, a greater proportion of the patients in the low-FEC group required oxygen supplementation during training and had worse baseline leg muscle strength. Conclusions: Patients showed distinct patterns of 6MWD changes in response to 8-week PR. Distinct characteristics for the low-FEC group included poor lower extremity strength and a greater proportion of required oxygen use at home and during training. ? 2019 Lee et al.",Chronic respiratory disease; Exercise training; Functional exercise capacity; Trajectory,"beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; corticosteroid; long acting drug; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; aged; Article; body mass; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic respiratory tract disease; controlled study; disease severity; exercise; female; forced expiratory volume; functional assessment; group based trajectory modeling; hand grip; human; leg muscle; major clinical study; male; mathematical analysis; muscle strength; oxygen therapy; pulmonary rehabilitation; retrospective study; six minute walk test; Taiwan; treatment duration; treatment response; chronic disease; convalescence; exercise tolerance; kinesiotherapy; lung; lung disease; middle aged; pathophysiology; skeletal muscle; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; walk test; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chronic Disease; Exercise Therapy; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Humans; Lung; Lung Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Walk Test",2-s2.0-85066488826

Mobile health (mHealth) platforms are progressively used for monitoring clinical conditions in medical subjects. Despite prevalent enthusiasm for the use of mHealth, limited studies have applied these platforms to surgical patients who are in much need of care because of acutely significant loss of physical function during the postoperative period. Objective: The aim of our study was to determine the feasibility and clinical value of using 1 wearable device connected with the mHealth platform to record PA among patients with gastric cancer (GC) who had undergone gastrectomy. Methods: We enrolled surgical GC patients during their inpatient stay and trained them to use the app and wearable device, enabling them to automatically monitor their walking steps. The patients continued to transmit data until postoperative day 28. The primary aim of this study was to validate the feasibility of this system, which was defined as the proportion of participants using each element of the system (wearing the device and uploading step counts) for at least 70% of the 28-day study. “Definitely feasible,” “possibly feasible,” and “not feasible” were defined as ?70%, 50%-69%, and <50% of participants meeting the criteria, respectively. Moreover, the secondary aim was to evaluate the clinical value of measuring walking steps by examining whether they were associated with early discharge (length of hospital stay <9 days). Results: We enrolled 43 GC inpatients for the analysis. The weekly submission rate at the first, second, third, and fourth week was 100%, 93%, 91%, and 86%, respectively. The overall daily submission rate was 95.5% (1150 days, with 43 subjects submitting data for 28 days). These data showed that this system met the definition of “definitely feasible.” Of the 54 missed transmission days, 6 occurred in week 2, 12 occurred in week 3, and 36 occurred in week 4. The primary reason for not sending data was that patients or caregivers forgot to charge the wearable devices (>90%). Furthermore, we used a multivariable-adjusted model to predict early discharge, which demonstrated that every 1000-step increment of walking on postoperative day 5 was associated with early discharge (odds ratio 2.72, 95% CI 1.17-6.32; P=.02). Conclusions: Incorporating the use of mobile phone apps with wearable devices to record PA in patients of postoperative GC was feasible in patients undergoing gastrectomy in this study. With the support of the mHealth platform, this app offers seamless tracing of patients’ recovery with a little extra burden and turns subjective PA into an objective, measurable parameter. ?

This study aimed to investigate the association between IL-10 gene rs1800896 (-1082 A/G), rs1800871 (-819 T/C), rs1800872 (-592 A/C), and rs3021094 (3388 A/C) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and GDM susceptibility. Methods: This study included 72 GDM patients and 100 healthy pregnant women. Direct sequencing of the products from polymerase chain reactions of the extracted genomic DNA from study subjects were conducted for analyzing IL-10 gene polymorphism and further genotype frequencies were compared. Plasma IL-10 concentration was measured by ELISA method. Results: The results revealed no significant difference in-592 A/C,-819 T/C, and-1082 A/G genotypes. Significantly increased prevalence of A allele (P = 0.028, OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.081-2.64) and A/A genotype (P = 0.031, OR = 2.881, 95% CI = 1.145-7.250) at a previously un-characterized rs3021094 SNP were discovered in the GDM group. Increased IL-10 levels and insulin resistance were also related to the genotype of rs3021094. The risk of GDM was increased when IL-10 level was over 6.5 pg/ml. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that A allele and A/A genotype of rs3021094 SNP in IL-10 gene were linked to increased risk for GDM, IL-10 plasma level and insulin resistance, which could be potential targets for early screening and detection of GDM. ? 2019 Kang, Liu, Lee, Li, Yang, Huang, Lin and Jou.",Gene Polymorphism; Gestational Diabetes; Inflammation; Interleukin-10; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism,C peptide; cholesterol; genomic DNA; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; insulin; interleukin 10; low density lipoprotein; metformin; triacylglycerol; adult; antidiabetic activity; Article; birth weight; chest circumference; controlled study; DNA extraction; DNA polymorphism; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gene frequency; genetic linkage; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genotype; gestational age; glucose blood level; head circumference; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin resistance; lipid fingerprinting; major clinical study; newborn; oral glucose tolerance test; polymerase chain reaction; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; promoter region; retrospective study; single nucleotide polymorphism; Taiwanese,2-s2.0-85065970696

Previous studies exploring this topic contained important limitations resulting in inconsistent recommendations within the current treatment guidelines. We undertook a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis to identify the most appropriate PEG-IFN treatment stopping rules. Methods: Roche’s internal database, PubMed and conference abstracts were searched for studies that enrolled &gt;50 treatment-naive patients with CHB who received PEG-IFN treatment for 48 weeks. Stopping rules were identified using receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses and pre-specified biomarker cutoff target performance characteristics (sensitivity &gt;95%, specificity &gt;10%, negative predictive value &gt;90%). Robustness of proposed stopping rules was assessed using internal/external validation analyses. Results: Eight study datasets were included in the meta-analysis (n=1,423; 765 hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-positive, 658 HBeAg-negative patients). In general, performance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA cutoffs at weeks 12 and 24 was similar, and common biomarker cutoffs that met target performance criteria were identified across multiple patient subgroups. For HBeAg-positive genotype B/C and HBeAg-negative genotype D patients the proposed stopping rule is HBsAg &gt;20,000 IU/ml at week 12. Alternatively, HBV DNA level cutoffs of &gt;8 log10 and &gt;6.5 log10 IU/ml, respectively, can be used instead. The proposed stopping rules accurately identify up to 26% of non-responders. Conclusions: The meta-analysis demonstrates that early PEG-IFN discontinuation should be considered in HBeAg-positive genotype B/C and HBeAg-negative genotype D patients at week 12 of treatment based on HBsAg or HBV DNA levels. ?2019 International Medical Press",,alanine aminotransferase; biological marker; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; virus DNA; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; chronic hepatitis B; drug efficacy; Hepatitis B virus genotype A; Hepatitis B virus genotype B; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; Hepatitis B virus genotype D; human; meta analysis; predictive value; prevalence; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; treatment duration; treatment response; treatment withdrawal; validation process,2-s2.0-85065857249

Regrettably, melanoma acquires resistance to BRAF inhibitors, e.g., vemurafenib (PLX4032) casting doubt on this promising melanoma targeted therapy. In this study, we explored the bioactivity of triterpenoid saponin cumingianoside A (CUMA), isolated from leaves and twigs of Dysoxylum cumingianum against PLX4032-resistant BRAFV600E mutant melanoma A375-R in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that CUMA treatment inhibited A375-R melanoma cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. CUMA also suppressed the activity of CDK1/cyclin B1 complex and led to G2/M-phase arrest of A375-R cells. Furthermore, CUMA treatment resulted in induction of apoptosis as shown by the increased activation of caspase 3 and caspase 7, and the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). We also observed that CUMA induced autophagy-like activity in A375-R cells, as shown by the increased expression of autophagy-related genes and increased formation of autophagosomes. Moreover, we found that CUMA treatment induced ER stress response and co-treatment with an ER stress inhibitor (4-PBA) could attenuate apoptosis induced by CUMA. Importantly, orally administered CUMA as a single agent or in combination with PLX4032 exhibited strong tumor growth inhibition in a PLX4032-resistant A375-R xenograft mouse model, and with little toxicity. This is the first report to explore the anti-tumor activity of CUMA in vitro and in vivo mechanistically, and our results imply that this triterpenoid saponin may be suitable for development into an anti-melanoma agent. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

Methods: In a retrospective observational study of older people aged 65 years and older who died in hospitals between 2008 and 2012, we used NHIRD to measure numbers, incremental changes and determinants of symptom-relief and comorbid drug use in the last month of outpatient care and last hospitalisation before death. Results: We included 59 407 older adults (cancer 37%, organ failure 26%, frailty 35% and sudden death 2%) who died in hospitals for this study. In the last hospitalisation before death, individuals who died of cancer received greatest number of symptom-relief drugs (mean: 4.65, [SD 2.77]) and increased most the average change in the number of symptom-relief drug use (+1.60; SD 3.36). However, individuals who died of organ failure received the highest number of comorbid drugs (mean 2.88, [SD 1.95]) and also increased most the average change in the number of comorbid drug use (+0.17; SD 2.28) at last hospitalisation. Different dying trajectories were key determinants of receiving symptom-relief and comorbid drugs in our study. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the drug use of older adults at the end of life in the cancer group is different from that in the organ failure and frailty groups. Policymakers and health professionals should consider the different strategies to optimise drug use for older people with different dying trajectories near their end of life. ?

Intravenous γ-immunoglobulin (IVIG) is recommended to be administrated within 10 days after fever onset. However, some patients didn't have IVIG therapies because of atypical disease presentations or spontaneous defervescence. We aimed to evaluate the coronary outcomes of the KD patients who didn't receive IVIG and had defervescence within 10 days. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the KD patients in NTUCH between 2008 and 2015. The patients with a diagnosis of KD and had a febrile length between 5 to 10 days were enrolled. Days of fever, clinical symptoms, laboratory data at the acute stage and series of coronary artery measurements within a minimum of 3 months after disease onset were recorded. Risk factors associated with coronary lesions one month after KD onset were also analyzed. Results 293 eligible KD patients were enrolled (Male: 55.1%, mean age of onset: 1.8 years old). 37 patients had spontaneous defervescence without IVIG treatment. The incidence of coronary aneurysms at the 4th week after disease onset was higher in spontaneously defervesced KD patients than those treated with IVIG (18.9% vs. 20.3%, p = 0.002). Interestingly, of the 238 KD patients without coronary lesions at their acute phase, percentages of emerging coronary aneurysms became significantly higher if they didn't have IVIG therapies due to spontaneous defervescence (4/31), compared with those who received IVIG (3/208). Further analysis showed the development of coronary lesions at one month after disease onset was associated with younger age (< 12 months old, p = 0.024), and leukocytosis (WBC > 17,000/cumm, p = 0.031). Conclusions: 18.9% of KD patients with spontaneous defervescence had coronary aneurysms. Even without initial coronary lesions, such patients were still riskier to develop coronary aneurysms, compared with KD patients who received IVIG therapies. Such findings address the importance of refining the strategy for use of IVIG in the spontaneously defervesced KD patients within 10 days after fever onset, at least in those with age younger than one year and those with leukocytosis. ? 2019 Hu, Liu, Lin, Chen, Chiu, Lu, Chang, Wang and Wu.",Coronary artery lesions; Immunoglobulin; kawasaki disease; Risk factors; Spontaneous defervescence,aspartate aminotransferase; C reactive protein; hemoglobin; immunoglobulin; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; child; clinical feature; clinical outcome; comparative study; controlled study; coronary artery; coronary artery aneurysm; coronary artery disease; female; fever; hemoglobin blood level; human; incidence; left anterior descending coronary artery; left coronary artery; leukocytosis; major clinical study; male; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; onset age; preschool child; retrospective study; risk factor,2-s2.0-85064680444

The signals required to fit the elastance–resistance model are the simultaneously recorded left ventricular (LV) pressure and aortic flow (Q m ), followed by the isovolumic LV pressure. In this study, we evaluated a single-beat estimation technique for determining the E max and Q max by using the elastance–resistance model based solely on the measured LV pressure and cardiac output. The isovolumic LV pressure was estimated from the measured LV pressure by using a non-linear least-squares approximation technique. The measured Q m was approximated by an unknown triangular flow (Q tri ), which was generated by using a fourth-order derivative of the LV pressure. The Q tri scale was calibrated using the cardiac output. Values of E max triQ and Q max triQ obtained using Q tri were compared with those of E max mQ and Q max mQ obtained from the measured Q m . Healthy rats and rats with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus were examined. We found that the LV E max and Q max can be approximately calculated using the assumed Q tri , and they strongly correlated with the corresponding values derived from Q m (P &lt; 0.0001; n = 78): E max triQ = 51.9133 + 0.8992 × E max mQ (r 2 = 0.8257; P &lt; 0.0001); Q max triQ = 2.4053 + 0.9767 × Q max mQ (r 2 = 0.7798; P &lt; 0.0001).

Therefore, complementary and alternative medicine, including patch treatments, is often used. The physiologic mechanisms of pain relief produced by patch treatment, however, are not well elucidated. In the present study, we introduce a pyramidal thorn (PT) patch that we developed, demonstrate the effects of this PT patch for the treatment of various types of pain in 300 subjects, and suggest a physiologic mechanism for the pain relief effects. One treatment with the PT patch effectively relieved pain in almost half the subjects evaluated. Except for pain generated deeply under the skin, such as low-back pain, pain was eliminated within four treatments with the PT patch in almost all of the subjects. Interestingly, the pain-sensing region moved along the nerve fibers after each trial. Further, patches without PT also provided some pain relief. We considered that this effect was due to hair deflection on the skin; that is, adhesion of the PT patch activates Merkel cells directly as well as Merkel cell-neurite complexes around the hair follicles by deflecting the hair follicles, whereas adhesion of a patch without PT only activates the Merkel cell-neurite complexes. In any case, patch adhesion stimulates Aβ fibers to alleviate pain. Finally, we found that the pain threshold is increased by electric stimulation, suggesting that the gentle adhesion of a PT patch would be more effective. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate physiologically the validity of an adherent patch for pain relief. ? 2019 The Authors.

Methods: The data were collected from July - October 2016. A total of 65 individuals were included. The treatment group received 40?min of music therapy twice per week over the course of 10?weeks. The control group maintained its typical routine. The research data were collected using structured questionnaires, including basic information, the Inventory of Peer Attachment, the Beck Depression Inventory-II questionnaires, and salivary cortisol concentrations.

However, it remains mostly unclear whether exposure to IONPs affects neuroinflammation under disease conditions. The present study aims to investigate the impact of IONPs on autoimmune-mediated neuroinflammation using a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that mimics human multiple sclerosis. Methods: Mice were either left untreated or immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glyco-protein on day 0 followed by two injections of pertussis toxin for EAE induction. The EAE mice were intravenously administered with a single dose of the carboxydextran-coated IONPs, ferucarbotran (20 mg Fe/kg) and/or saline (as vehicle) on day 18. Symptoms of EAE were daily monitored until the mice were killed on day 30. Tissue sections of the brain and spinal cord were prepared for histopathological examinations. Iron deposition, neuron demyelination and inflammatory cell infiltration were examined using histochemical staining. The infiltration of microglial and T cells, and cytokine expression were examined by immunohistochemical staining and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Iron deposition was detected in both the brain and spinal cord of EAE mice 3 days post-ferucarbotran treatment. The clinical and pathological scores of EAE, percentage of myelin loss and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the spinal cord were significantly deteriorated in EAE mice treated with ferucarbotran. Furthermore, ferucarbotran treatment increased the number of CD3 + , Iba-1 + , IL-6 + , Iba-1 + TNF-α + and CD3 + IFN-γ + cells in the spinal cord of EAE mice. Conclusion: A single exposure to ferucarbotran exacerbated neuroinflammation and disease severity of EAE, which might be attributed to the enhanced activation of microglia and T cells. These results demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory effect of ferucarbotran on the central nervous system is closely associated with the deterioration of autoimmunity. ? 2019 Hsiao et al.",Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; Ferucarbotran; Iron oxide nanoparticles; Microglia; Multiple sclerosis; Neuroinflammation; T cell,"calcium binding protein; CD3 antigen; cytokine; ferucarbotran; gamma interferon; interleukin 6; myelin; myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; pertussis toxin; protein Iba 1; sodium chloride; tumor necrosis factor; ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide; unclassified drug; cytokine; dextran; iron; magnetite nanoparticle; messenger RNA; superparamagnetic iron oxide; allergic encephalomyelitis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autoimmunity; brain tissue; cell activation; cell infiltration; central nervous system; controlled study; demyelination; disease association; disease severity; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; experimental neuroinflammation; female; histochemistry; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; inflammatory cell; iron metabolism; microglia; mouse; multiple sclerosis; nervous system inflammation; nonhuman; pathophysiology; population exposure; protein depletion; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; spinal cord; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; animal; C57BL mouse; disease model; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; genetics; human; immunology; inflammation; metabolism; pathology; severity of illness index; Animals; Central Nervous System; Cytokines; Dextrans; Disease Models, Animal; Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Iron; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Mice, Inbred C57BL; RNA, Messenger; Severity of Illness Index; Spinal Cord; T-Lymphocytes",2-s2.0-85062859287

However, acquired drug resistance eventually develops. This study explored the novel mechanisms related to TKI resistance. To identify the genes associated with TKI resistance, an integrative approach was used to analyze public datasets. Molecular manipulations were performed to investigate the roles of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) in lung adenocarcinoma. Clinical specimens were collected to validate the impact of IGFBP7 on the efficacy of EGFR TKI treatment. IGFBP7 mRNA expression in cancer cells isolated from malignant pleural effusions after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI was significantly higher than in cancer cells from treatment-na?ve effusions. IGFBP7 expression was markedly increased in cells with long-term TKI-induced resistance compared to in TKI-sensitive parental cells. Reduced IGFBP7 in TKI-resistant cells reversed the resistance to EGFR-TKIs and increased EGFR-TKI-induced apoptosis by up-regulating B-cell lymphoma 2 interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) and activating caspases. Suppression of IGFBP7 attenuated the phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) and downstream protein kinase B (AKT) in TKI-resistant cells. Clinically, higher serum IGFBP7 levels and tumors with positive IGFBP7-immunohistochemical staining were associated with poor TKI-treatment outcomes. IGFBP7 confers resistance to EGFR-TKIs and is a potential therapeutic target for treating EGFR-TKI-resistant cancers. ? 2019 by the authors.

This present study incorporated multiple structural and functional connectivity metrics into a graph theoretical analysis framework and investigated alterations in brain network topology in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. By using this multiparametric analysis, we expected different connectivity metrics may reflect additional or complementary information regarding the topological changes in brain networks in MCI or AD. In our study, a total of 73 subjects participated in this study and underwent the magnetic resonance imaging scans. For the structural network, we compared commonly used connectivity metrics, including fractional anisotropy and normalized streamline count, with multiple diffusivity-based metrics. We compared Pearson correlation and covariance by investigating their sensitivities to functional network topology. Significant disruption of structural network topology in MCI and AD was found predominantly in regions within the limbic system, prefrontal and occipital regions, in addition to widespread alterations of local efficiency. At a global scale, our results showed that the disruption of the structural network was consistent across different edge definitions and global network metrics from the MCI to AD stages. Significant changes in connectivity and tract-specific diffusivity were also found in several limbic connections. Our findings suggest that tract-specific metrics (e.g., fractional anisotropy and diffusivity) provide more sensitive and interpretable measurements than does metrics based on streamline count. Besides, the use of inversed radial diffusivity provided additional information for understanding alterations in network topology caused by AD progression and its possible origins. Use of this proposed multiparametric network analysis framework may facilitate early MCI diagnosis and AD prevention. ? 2019 The Authors",Alzheimer's disease; Brain network; Diffusion tensor imaging; Functional connectivity; Graph theoretical analysis; Mild cognitive impairment; Resting-state functional MRI; Structural connectivity,adult; Alzheimer disease; analytical parameters; Article; axial diffusivity; body mass; brain function; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; echo planar imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; limbic system; major clinical study; male; Markov chain; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; multiparametric graph theoretical analysis; priority journal; radial diffusivity,2-s2.0-85060729622

The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based therapy opens a therapeutic window for RGC degeneration, and tissue engineering may further promote the efficiency of differentiation process of iPSCs. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of a novel biomimetic polybenzyl glutamate (PBG) scaffold on culturing iPSC-derived RGC progenitors. The iPSC-derived neural spheres cultured on PBG scaffold increased the differentiated retinal neurons and promoted the neurite outgrowth in the RGC progenitor layer. Additionally, iPSCs cultured on PBG scaffold formed the organoid-like structures compared to that of iPSCs cultured on cover glass within the same culture period. With RNA-seq, we found that cells of the PBG group were differentiated toward retinal lineage and may be related to the glutamate signaling pathway. Further ontological analysis and the gene network analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes between cells of the PBG group and the control group were mainly associated with neuronal differentiation, neuronal maturation, and more specifically, retinal differentiation and maturation. The novel electrospinning PBG scaffold is beneficial for culturing iPSC-derived RGC progenitors as well as retinal organoids. Cells cultured on PBG scaffold differentiate effectively and shorten the process of RGC differentiation compared to that of cells cultured on coverslip. The new culture system may be helpful in future disease modeling, pharmacological screening, autologous transplantation, as well as narrowing the gap to clinical application. ? 2019 by the authors.

However, its impact on renal function remains uncertain. Methods: A total of 26,249 adults aged ?20 years were recruited through voluntary health examinations in Taiwan. Sleep duration was self-reported by questionnaire. Proteinuria was graded semi-quantitatively by dipstick urine test. The associations of sleep duration with proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were analyzed. Results: After an average follow-up period of 2.62 years, the crude hazard ratio (HR) for proteinuria progression were 1.92 (95% CI 1.22-3.03), 1.23 (95% CI 1.09-1.39), and 1.18 (95% CI 1.00-1.39) for those with sleep duration < 4, 4-6, and > 8 h compared to those with sleep duration of 6-8 h (the reference group), respectively. The HR remained significant for those with sleep duration < 4 h (adjusted HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.05-2.61]) and 4-6 h (adjusted HR 1.19 [95% CI 1.06-1.35]) after adjustment for age, sex, blood pressure, fasting glucose, body mass index, cholesterols, triglycerides, uric acids, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, income/educational levels, and baseline eGFR. However, eGFR was not significantly different among different sleep duration groups. Discussion: This result indicates short sleep duration is independently associated with the progression of proteinuria. ? 2018 S.

We investigated the association between psychological work environment and suicidal ideation among hospital nurses in Taiwan. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Taiwan female nurses using stratified sampling by region (north, central, south, and east) to select representative centers for this study. Methods: A self-report questionnaire including items on demographic data, the psychological work environment, and suicidal ideation was sent to nurses working in hospitals. Multiple logistic regression and population attributable risk analyses were performed to assess the effect of the psychological work environment on suicidal ideation. Findings: A total of 2,734 eligible questionnaires (76.8%) were returned. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 18.3%, and higher risk was found to be associated with the educational level of junior college or below, higher personal burnout, higher client-related burnout, and always feeling stressed at work. Estimation of population attributable risk showed that higher personal burnout, client-related burnout, and always feeling stressed at work were the most crucial factors among nurses, accounting for 19.4%, 8.6%, and 10.5% of suicidal ideation, respectively. Conclusions: A considerable proportion of nurses developed suicidal ideation. A poor psychological work environment was a relevant factor for suicidal ideation. Clinical Evidence: This study provides relevant knowledge for nursing management levels in preventing the development of suicidal ideation among nurses. Not only for nurses’ mental health, but for patient safety and care quality, further studies in improving nurses’ psychological work environment are warranted. ? 2018 Sigma Theta Tau International",Burnout; nurses; psychological work environment; suicidal ideation,,2-s2.0-85057059158

Debridement of the necrotic bone with preservation of the cortical shell and bone substitute packing for the defect (light bulb procedure) were performed. The symptoms resolved by 3 months postoperatively, and the patient could return to work. At a 6-year follow-up visit, the patient was free of symptoms, and MRI showed remodeling of the tarsal navicular without further collapse. ? 2018",4; autologous graft; bone substitute; karyorrhexis; percutaneous decompression; sclerotic bone; transillumination,"calcium sulfate; adult; American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot scale score; ankle pain; arthroscopic surgery; Article; bone lesion; bone necrosis; case report; cast application; clinical article; conservative treatment; female; fluoroscopy; foot disease; foot pain; foot surgery; human; intraoperative period; light bulb procedure; musculoskeletal system parameters; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; percutaneous decompression; postoperative period; scoring system; talus osteochondral lesion; tarsal navicular osteonecrosis; weight bearing; bone necrosis; bone prosthesis; debridement; decompression surgery; diagnostic imaging; drug therapy; pathology; tarsal bone; Adult; Bone Substitutes; Debridement; Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Osteonecrosis; Tarsal Bones",2-s2.0-85056461458

Recently, MRI images have been used for the diagnosis of biliary atresia with improved accuracy of diagnosis when other imaging modalities such as ultrasonography are equivocal. This study aimed to evaluate the juxta-hilar extrahepatic biliary tree using MRI images to determine a quantitative value for diagnosing biliary atresia. Materials and methods: This retrospective study was approved by the Ethical Committee at Mackey Memorial Hospital (IRB Number: 15MMHIS149e). Between January 2010 and December 2015, twenty-five patients with surgically confirmed biliary atresia were enrolled (age 18–65 days). Another 25 patients with clinically or surgically diagnosed idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (age 6–64 days) and 20 patients with non-hepatobiliary disease (age 6–65 days) were considered control group and normal subjects, respectively. The diameter of the enlarged, T2-hyperintense structure was measured using MRI images by two radiologists both blinded. The cut-off value for a biliary atresia diagnosis was obtained by area under the curve analysis. Results: The diameter of the T2-hyperintense structure at porta hepatis in biliary atresia (4.79 ± 1.14 mm) is larger than in idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (1.72 ± 0.42 mm) or in non-hepatobiliary disease (1.72 ± 0.35 mm) (p < 0.05). The optimum cut-off value for diagnosing biliary atresia was 3.1 mm with 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Conclusion: The value of the enlarged, T2-hyperintense structure measured on MRI images was significantly increased in biliary atresia and may be useful in diagnosing biliary atresia. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Biliary atresia; Extrahepatic bile duct; Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis; Magnetic resonance imaging,"Disease control; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Area under the curves; Bile ducts; Biliary atresia; Hepatobiliary disease; Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis; Imaging modality; Quantitative image analysis; Quantitative values; Diagnosis; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bile duct atresia; bilirubin blood level; cholangiography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; echography; female; human; image analysis; intrahepatic bile duct; major clinical study; male; newborn; newborn hepatitis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; radiological parameters; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; abnormalities; bile duct atresia; diagnostic imaging; extrahepatic bile duct; infant; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Bile Ducts, Extrahepatic; Biliary Atresia; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Retrospective Studies; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-85056209764

This study assessed whether application of pure type-1 collagen to the third molar extraction socket can reduce post-operative pain score and duration and promote socket bone healing. Methods: Fourteen patients who underwent 20 bilateral and symmetric third molar extractions were included in this study. After two tooth extractions at two different occasions in the same patient, one socket was filled with pure type-1 collagen (experimental group, n = 20) and the other socket received nothing but the blood clot (control group, n = 20). The post-operative pain score and duration, mouth-opening limitation, and the bone density at the socket site were assessed at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 after tooth extraction. Results: Patients in the experimental group had a significantly lower mean post-operative pain score (2.6 ± 1.2) than patients in the control group (4.7 ± 2.0), and had a significantly shorter post-operative pain duration (2.7 ± 1.4 days) than patients in the control group (3.7 ± 1.8 days). We also observed a significantly lower frequency of mouth-opening limitation in 20 experimental-group patients (45%) than in 20 control-group patients (90%, P = 0.007). Moreover, a significantly higher mineralization ratio (10.2%) was found in the experimental socket site than in the control socket site. Conclusion: Application of pure type-1 collagen to the third molar extraction socket can reduce post-operative pain score and duration, decrease the frequency of mouth-opening limitation, and increase mineralization ratio at the extraction socket site. ? 2018",Pain; Pure type-1 collagen; Socket bone healing; Third molar extraction,"collagen type 1; biomaterial; collagen type 1; adult; Article; blood clot; bone density; bone mineralization; clinical article; controlled study; disease duration; female; follow up; fracture healing; human; male; mandibular third molar; maxillary third molar; operation duration; pain assessment; postoperative pain; postoperative pain score; retrospective study; second molar; tooth extraction; tooth socket; adolescent; mandible; postoperative complication; postoperative pain; Taiwan; third molar; tooth disease; tooth extraction; wound closure; wound healing; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biocompatible Materials; Collagen Type I; Female; Humans; Male; Mandible; Molar, Third; Pain, Postoperative; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Tooth Extraction; Tooth, Impacted; Wound Closure Techniques; Wound Healing; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85054303980

This study investigates the formation of THMs and their associated risks during different tea brewing habits. Three main categories of tea (black, oolong, and green) under various brewing conditions and drinking water sources were tested. Tea samples prepared in ordinary thermos flask formed significant levels of total THM (TTHM). The highest TTHM formation came from black tea made with tap water, plausibly due to higher concentrations of reactive THM precursors. Compared with tap water, when the background solution is bottled water or distilled water, less TTHM was observed in prepared tea infusions. The results also revealed that unlike the traditional teapot-based tea serving habit, the removal of THMs is significantly reduced when tea infusion is stored in enclosed containers. Risk assessment analysis based on the survey among tea shop costumers also revealed that cancer risks induced by ingestion of THMs through drinking tea infusions prepared in thermos flask exceeded the tolerable level. Data obtained in this research demonstrated that drinking tea infusions directly from enclosed containers can be a significant source of exposure to THMs. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Drinking water; Exposure assessment; Tea; Trihalomethane,trihalomethane; water; adolescent; adult; analysis; chemistry; dietary exposure; female; human; male; risk assessment; tea; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Dietary Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Risk Assessment; Tea; Trihalomethanes; Water; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85052728414

This study aimed to analyze the treatment efficacy of ASCT in a Taiwanese cohort and evaluate possible prognostic factors. Methods: From the database of the Taiwan Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, data on 396 patients with MM who underwent ASCT were reviewed. Results: The average age of participants was 54.8 years, and there were more men than women (57.6% vs. 42.4%). Most patients were diagnosed with IgG-type myeloma (52.4%), followed by IgA-type (23.2%) and light-chain type (21.4%).

Identifying the predictors of EAS demand will help the EAS service managing authority in formulating focused policies to maintain service quality. Methods: Over 160,000 electronic EAS usage records were used with a negative binomial regression model to assess rural–urban differences in the predictors of EAS demand and misuse. Results: The factors of 1) ln-transformed population density, 2) percentage of residents who completed up to junior high school education, 3) accessibility of hospitals without an emergency room, and 4) accessibility of EAS were found to be predictors of EAS demand in rural areas, whereas only the factor of percentage of people aged above 65 was found to predict EAS demand in urban areas. For EAS misuse, only the factor of percentage of low-income households was found to be a predictor in rural areas, whereas no predictor was found in the urban areas. Conclusion: Results showed that the factors predicting EAS demand and misuse in rural areas were more complicated compared to urban areas and, therefore, formulating EAS policies for rural areas based on the results of urban studies may not be appropriate. ? 2018",Emergency ambulance service; Geographic information system; Misuse; Planning; Rural–urban difference,adult; ambulance; article; emergency ward; female; geographic information system; high school; household; human; human experiment; lowest income group; male; population density; resident; rural area; urban area; ambulance; clinical trial; comparative study; emergency health service; health care delivery; health service; multicenter study; prognosis; rural population; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; urban population; Ambulances; Emergency Medical Services; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services Misuse; Humans; Linear Models; Prognosis; Rural Population; Taiwan; Urban Population,2-s2.0-85048807764

In this study, our purpose is to design an ultrasound transducer that can be used for clinical application for brain tumor nanodrug delivery. Computer simulation has been used to calculate the pressure field, temperature distribution and thermal dose in the brain for different parameters of a spherical array ultrasound transducer. An ultrasound transducer with 112 disc elements (1, MHz, 2, cm in diameter) was constructed and its heating ability was characterized using a skull phantom filled with hydrogel. The simulation results showed that the position of peak pressure was slightly offset when the transducer was mechanically moved 3, cm away from the center point in all directions. There was no significant side-lobe developed when the transducer was moved away from the center 2, cm. Temperature distribution showed that the heating zone was an ellipsoid with temperature higher than 42 °C for a maximum intensity of 121, W/cm2. Phantom experiment showed that the 42 °C color-changeable hydrogel would turn to be white at the focal point when the transducer was moved 2, cm in all directions with an electrical power 55, W.

However, no calibration coefficient is currently available for Taiwan. Methods: Data from the Taiwanese Survey on Hypertension, Hyperglycemia, and Hyperlipidemia (TwSHHH) were used to calibrate the Framingham equation for Taiwanese usage and compared with coefficients of the Chinese Multi-provincial Cohort Study (CMCS). Coronary events were identified through the link to National Health Insurance claim data and the national death registry for 2011. The risk factorswere total cholesterol (mg/dL), systolic blood pressure (mmHg), cigarette smoking (yes/no), and diabetes (yes/no). The mean of these risk factors and the baseline survival probability were derived from TwSHHH. They were applied to the Framingham score function. Finally, the ratio of observed/ predicted was applied to calibrate the predicted probabilities. Results: When applying the Framingham function, agreement between the predicted and observed risk matched reasonably well in Taiwanese males, but not in females. The CMCS coefficients did not fit the Taiwanese population well. We recommend using 0.7958 and 1 as calibration coefficients for males and females, respectively. Conclusion: We generated Framingham calibration coefficient for the Taiwanese population. We recommend that the mean of predictors and the baseline survivorship derived from TwSHHH should be used in the model. Nonetheless, it is crucial to develop a risk function specific for this population.

Methods: A total of 29,937 thyroid FNA results, reported between April 2012 and December 2016, were retrieved from the database of a medical center. We reviewed the electronic medical records and analyzed the management of these patients. Results: Overall frequency of AUS/FLUS is 3.1% in our laboratory, which is at the lower limit of the recommended range. Of these, 891 reports of AUS/FLUS from 770 patients were identified. Out of the 770 patients, 367 had surgical intervention. In these 367 patients, final surgical pathology yielded 204 (55.6%) malignancies, 12 indeterminateness (3.3%), and 151 (41.1%) benignity.

This study reviewed our experience about the technique evolution and outcome of using LDG for the patients with clinical stage (c-stage) I gastric cancers. Methods: A retrospective review of the patients undergoing LDG for c-stage I gastric cancers at a medical center of Taiwan was performed. The demographics, peri-operative parameters, reconstruction methods, morbidities, pathologic and oncological outcomes were analyzed. Results: A total of 100 patients with c-stage I gastric cancers between October 2005 and September 2016 were enrolled. Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) was performed in the initial 69 cases. Total laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) was done in the following 31 cases. There was no conversion of procedures, nor surgical mortality. The surgical morbidity rate was 13%, including 3 major complications.

Among the continents, North America had the highest rates of incidence and mortality, whereas the highest MIRs were in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Globally, favorable MIRs correlated with high e/GDP and good WHO ranking (regression coefficient, ?0.014 and 0.001; p = 0.004, and p = 0.014, respectively). In conclusion, the MIR for lung cancer in different countries varies with the expenditure on health care and health system rankings. ? 2018 by the authors.

Moreover, dLGG-20 and CP-2 treatment prolonged mouse mean survival time. dLGG-20 treatment significantly inhibited the expression levels of several molecular markers, that is, PCNA, MMP2, COX-2, VEGF, vimentin, snail, TGF-β, β-catenin, TNF-α, PD-1 and PD-L1 in mouse lung tissues compared to tumor control mice. Significant inhibition of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and promotion of CD8 + Tc cell recruitment in the lung microenvironment was observed in dLGG-20-treated mice. A LC/MS-based comparative oxylipin metabolomics study showed that dLGG-20 treatment significantly induced (5.0- to 12.8-fold) the 12/15-LOX catalyzed oxylipin products in mouse serum including 17-HDHA from DHA, 15-HEPE from EPA, 8- and 12-HETEs from AA, and CYP450-derived 20-HETE from AA. CP-2 treatment increased 12/15-LOX derived 8-, 11- and 12-HETEs from AA, and CYP450 derived 11,12-EET from AA ad 9,10-DHOME from LA by 5.3- to 8.1-fold. Of note, dLGG and 17-HDHA were more effective than CP in preventing B16 melanoma cell-induced pulmonary vascular permeability in mice through inhibition of TNF-α production, up-regulation of tight junction proteins claudin1 and ZO-2 and deregulation of Src activation. In conclusion, this study shows the novel therapeutic effect of phytoagent dLGG and suggests its potential as a therapeutic agent for metastatic melanoma. ? 2018 UICC",17-HDHA; galactolipid; metastatic melanoma; oxylipin metabolome; pulmonary vascular permeability,"1,2 di o linolenoyl 3 o beta galactopyranosyl sn glycerol; antimetastatic agent; arachidonic acid; beta catenin; cisplatin; claudin 1; cycline; cyclooxygenase 2; docosahexaenoic acid; galactolipid; gelatinase A; icosapentaenoic acid; oxylipin; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 receptor; protein tyrosine kinase; transcription factor Snail; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; vimentin; zonula occludens protein; 1,2-dilinolenoyl-3-galactopyranosylglycerol; 17-hydroxy-4,7,10,13,15,19-docosahexaenoic acid; antineoplastic agent; docosahexaenoic acid; focal adhesion kinase 2; glucoside; glycerol; oxylipin; protein tyrosine kinase; Ptk2b protein, mouse; tumor marker; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bioluminescence; blood vessel permeability; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; drug activity; drug efficacy; enzyme activation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lung metastasis; macrophage migration inhibition; male; metabolomics; metastasis inhibition; metastatic melanoma; mouse; mouse model; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; pulmonary vascular permeability; survival time; tumor microenvironment; analogs and derivatives; animal; blood; C57BL mouse; capillary permeability; cell proliferation; chemistry; drug effect; epithelial mesenchymal transition; experimental melanoma; human; lung tumor; metabolism; physiology; plant; prevention and control; pulmonary artery; pulmonary vein; secondary; signal transduction; tight junction; tumor invasion; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Biomarkers, Tumor; Capillary Permeability; Cell Proliferation; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Focal Adhesion Kinase 2; Glucosides; Glycerol; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Melanoma, Experimental; Metabolomics; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Oxylipins; Plants; Pulmonary Artery; Pulmonary Veins; Signal Transduction; src-Family Kinases; Tight Junctions; Tumor Microenvironment; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85053941060

""Low-value care"" has received attention because it can increase the cost of health care, cause physical and mental harm to patients, including iatrogenic harm, and reduce the availability of high-value health care services. Efforts to reduce the prevalence of low-value care can, therefore, reduce the incidence of unnecessary treatments and their accompanying costs. This paper reviews the contexts in which low-value care occurs and investigates the manner in which clinicians, patients, and health care systems contribute to the prevalence of low-value care. This paper also discusses the effect of low-value care on patients and health care providers. Finally, we summarize the current status of policies and interventions aimed to curb the provision of low-value care in several countries to illuminate potential targets for policy interventions and solutions to reduce the provision of low-value care in Taiwan. ?

We applied Rasch analysis as the means of testing the psychometrics of the scale. Results: The final version of the sf-ADLS used in this study included 14 items, with no differential item functioning being discernible on the gender variable. The scale was found to be of use in classifying the subjects into four levels of independence. Conclusions: The revised sf-ADLS conforms to the Rasch measurement model in the formulation of a unidimensional scale. The scale can be used to measure the level of independence with acceptable reliability (internal consistency as 0.9) and validity. ?

The present study assessed the associations of genetic variants in eight GRM genes with regard to risk and overall survival (OS) in 780 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients and controls. After adjustment for known risk factors, GRM5 rs7102764 T was associated with an increased risk of RCC (P?=?0.006). Additional analysis has provided evidence that rs7102764 T was correlated with a higher expression of GRM5, which is consistently found to be upregulated in tumours, compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, the GRM3 rs701332 C, GRM4 rs2499707 T, and GRM4 rs4713742 T alleles were significantly associated with a poorer OS (P???0.030). The three loci were also observed to have strong cumulative effects on OS. Additional analysis has revealed a significant genotype-expression correlation of rs2499707 T with increased GRM4 expression, which in turn leads to poorer OS in patients with RCC. GRMs might be involved in RCC development and progression, and genetic variants in GRMs might be promising biomarkers. ? 2018 The Authors.

This study aimed to compare the difference in TJR rate between patients with hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB). A final total of 935 PWH (782 HA and 153 HB) without inhibitors were collected from the Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2013. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and TJR rate were compared between the 2 groups. The annual use of clotting factor concentrate was not different between HA and HB groups (P =.116). The rate of comorbidities except for 29 PWH having HIV who were all in the HA group was also not different between the 2 groups. A total of 99 (10.6%) PWH had undergone 142 TJR procedures during the study period. All of them had received on-demand therapy. No difference was found in the cumulative incidence of TJR between HA and HB (P =.787). After adjusting for various confounders including age, pyogenic arthritis, and HIV infection, no increased risk of TJR was found in patients with HA versus Patients with HB (hazard ratio: 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.54-1.58). This finding suggests that the rate of TJR between patients with HA and HB is not significantly different. ?

This study investigated whether the care paths implemented by oncologists and non-oncologists differ with regard to patient outcomes. Setting Data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry and National Health Insurance Database were linked to identify patients with colon cancer who underwent colectomy as first treatment within 3 months of diagnosis and adjuvant chemotherapy between 2005 and 2009. Participants and methods Postoperative patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy were included in this study. The exclusion criteria included patients with stage IV disease, a positive surgical margin and early disease recurrence. Among the patients presenting with multiple primary cancers, we also excluded patients who were diagnosed with colon cancer but for whom this was not the first primary cancer. The variables included sex, age, comorbidities, disease stage, chemotherapy cycle and changes in treatment regimen as well as the specialty of treatment providers and their case volume. Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to examine differences in outcomes in the matched cohorts. Results We examined 3534 patients who were prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy by physicians from different disciplines. In terms of 5-year disease-free survival, no significant difference was observed between the groups of oncologists or surgeons among patients with stage II (90.02%vs88.99%) or stage III (77.64%vs79.99%) diseases. Patients who were subjected to changes in their chemotherapy regimens presented recurrence rates higher than those who were not. Conclusions The discipline of practitioners is seldom taken into account in most series. This is the first study to provide empirical evidence demonstrating that the outcomes of patients with colon cancer do not depend on the treatment path, as long as the selection criteria for adjuvant chemotherapy is appropriate. Further study will be required before making any further conclusions. ? ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

However, there is limited understanding about these relationships among adults in Taiwan. Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the association between individual-level network and cohesion-based social capital and depressive symptoms among a population-based sample of Taiwanese adults. Methods: Data were obtained from the 1997 Taiwan Social Change Survey (n = 2,598). The 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptom scores; ?16 represented high depressive symptoms. Network-based social capital was measured using a position generator. Two dimensions of cohesion-based social capital were assessed: cognitive (perceived neighborhood trust and reciprocity) and structural (local community participation and organizational participation). Multivariable log-binomial regression models, weighted to account for the complex sampling design and adjusted for confounders, estimated prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine the association between each social capital measure and depressive symptoms. Results: In this study, 29.6% of respondents were classified as having high depressive symptom scores. Higher scores of composite cognitive social capital (adjusted Prevalence Ratios (aPR) = 0.92, 95% CI = [0.90, 0.95]) and structural social capital (aPR = 0.80, 95% CI = [0.65, 0.99]) were associated with a lower likelihood of high depressive symptom scores after controlling for confounders. However, there was no association between network social capital and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the relationship between social capital and depressive symptoms in Taiwan differs according to the specific dimension of social capital assessed. Differentiating between network- and cohesion-based social capital merits greater attention to inform our understanding of building social capital to promote and improve mental health outcomes. ?

Using a multicenter cohort, we showed that the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) attenuated the probability of PREM improvement in fracture patients. Introduction: Assessing PREM can assist physicians in improving patients’ experiences. Patients with CKD are at an increased risk of exhibiting poor PREM and developing fractures. We aimed to assess whether CKD influences the probability of PREM improvement during follow-up among patients with fractures. Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with hip or vertebral fractures from different institutes into a fracture liaison service program. After registering clinical histories, they received a baseline PREM assessment based on EuroQol group–5 dimension content, including self-care, daily activity, and pain severity using a 5-point Likert scale. A follow-up PREM assessment was arranged 4?months later, and we evaluated whether baseline CKD was predictive of PREM improvement. Results: Among 593 fracture patients (18% with CKD), 37.3% and 62.7% presented with hip and vertebral fractures, respectively. Self-care, daily activity, and pain severity improved after follow-up in 32%, 27%, and 43% participants; those with CKD exhibited worse self-care ability and daily activity than those without. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that baseline CKD was significantly associated with lower possibility of improvement in daily activity (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, p = 0.049) and pain severity (OR 0.52, p = 0.01), and an insignificant change in the possibility of improvement in self-care ability (OR 0.61, p = 0.09).

Methods: Eighty-two patients with locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage III/IV) buccal cancer who underwent surgery followed by postoperative IMRT between January 2007 and October 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Eighteen patients had local recurrences as the first recurrent site and 11 had supramandibular notch recurrences; the majority of recurrences were classified as marginal failures. The median time from the first local or regional recurrence to death was 5.9 months. In multivariate analyses of survivals, the initial masticator space involvement was the most important prognostic factor. Masticator space involvement, N classification, and maxillectomy were the significant prognostic predictors for supramandibular notch recurrences. Conclusion: Postoperative IMRT for buccal cancer should not include the surgical beds alone, rather, it should be based on the potential patterns of spread. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",adjuvant radiotherapy; buccal cancer; oral cavity cancer; patterns of failure; postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT),cisplatin; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; female; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; major clinical study; male; mandible resection; mastication; maxilla resection; mouth cancer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; radiation dose; retrospective study; treatment failure; treatment outcome; x-ray computed tomography,2-s2.0-85056388549

Toxins produced by C. perfringens in conjunction with predisposing factors are responsible for the onset and development of NE. Recently, several lines of evidence indicated the potential role of plasmid-encoded toxins in the virulence of NE, particularly necrotic enteritis B-like (NetB) toxin. However, the association of NetB, beta2 toxin (CPB2), and C. perfringens large cytotoxin (TpeL) in clinical NE isolates are not well-established. Therefore, we characterized the toxinotype and the presence of netB, cpb2, and tpeL genes in 15 NE-producing and 15 non-NE-producing C. perfringens isolates using conventional PCR and quantified netB among those isolates by quantitative PCR (qPCR). All isolates were characterized as toxinotype A and were negative for cpe, which is associated with human food poisoning. The netB was detected in 6.7% and 70% of NE-producing isolates by PCR and qPCR, respectively. In 15 non-NE-producing isolates, netB was not detected by conventional PCR, but was detected in 60% of isolates by qPCR. The presence of and the copy number of netB were not significantly different between NE- and non-NE-producing isolates (p > 0.05). No difference was observed between NE- and non-NE-producing isolates in the presence of cpb2 or tpeL (p > 0.05). These results suggest that the presence of netB, cpb2, and tpeL, as well as the copy number of netB in C. perfringens is not correlated with clinical NE. In addition, we suggest that qPCR, but not conventional PCR, be used to detect netB. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Clostridium perfringens; cpb2; Necrotic enteritis; netB; qPCR; Toxins; tpeL,"amplicon; animal tissue; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium identification; bacterium isolation; chicken; Clostridium perfringens; controlled study; cpb2 gene; gene dosage; gene identification; gene sequence; jejunum; necrotizing enteritis; netB gene; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; tpeL gene; animal; bird disease; Clostridium infection; Clostridium perfringens; enteritis; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; veterinary medicine; bacterial toxin; cpb2 protein, Clostridium perfringens; enterotoxin; NetB protein, Clostridium perfringens; Animals; Bacterial Toxins; Chickens; Clostridium Infections; Clostridium perfringens; Enteritis; Enterotoxins; Gene Dosage; Poultry Diseases",2-s2.0-85053143628

While the strength of the association between ACEs and attempted suicide is weakened following adjustment for AD, no study to date has directly been performed to determine whether AD affects the risk of suicide attributable to ACEs. The study aimed to examine the possible role of alcohol dependence (AD) in the relationship between various ACEs and attempted suicide. This cross-sectional study assessed history of ACEs among 184 AD patients and 205 control participants using the Family Health Questionnaire. Lifetime history of attempted suicide was collected using the Chinese version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. We used the Sobel test to examine the mediating effects of AD on the relationship between ACEs and attempted suicide. Results showed that the suicide attempters were associated with higher rates of AD and ACEs. The regression analysis showed that AD and multiple ACEs exposure are independently associated with attempted suicide. AD appears as a partial mediator in the relationship between attempted suicide and the specific type of ACE (exposure to a battered mother or sexual abuse) or exposure to ?3 types of ACEs. We conclude that AD might partially mediate the associations detected between attempted suicide and exposure to a battered mother, sexual abuse, and ?3 types of ACEs.

In our previous report, real-time RT-LAMP was used for blood identification by using HBB detection as a model but in this advanced study, this method was refined for the identification of the more challenging body fluid of saliva. Expression of the18S rRNA gene was used as the internal control and the Statherin (STATH) gene as the saliva-specific marker. A turbidimeter was used for real-time detection of the RT-LAMP products, and confirmation was obtained that the real products were generated using: agarose gel electrophoresis, calcein fluorescence detection and/or enzymatic digestion. The specificity of the test was performed using 42 samples including 7 different body fluids, and the expression of STATH was only observed in all the saliva samples (6) with a threshold time of 39.4 ± 2.9?min. Sensitivity testing showed that RT-LAMP products for STATH were stably detected when the RNA template was not less than 6.25?ng. When the primer concentrations for STATH were two times that of 18S rRNA, saliva could be identified in the body fluid mixtures even at a ratio (saliva:semen) of 1:3 (without loop primer)/1:5 (with loop primer). A multiplex RT-LAMP was established to simultaneously amplify the 18S rRNA and STATH genes, and applied to the identification of saliva on ten non-probative cigarette butts. A positive result for saliva was obtained from all ten butts, even for those that returned a negative or ambiguous result using the amylase test. A direct RT-LAMP test is also reported where the RNA extraction step was omitted to speed the collection of data and all tests using either the simplex or multiplex RT-LAMP resulted in a positive response if saliva was present. Our data provide a simple and effective means to detect the presence of saliva. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Multiplex RT-LAMP; Non-probative evidence samples; RT-LAMP; Saliva identification; Statherin (STATH),"amylase; biological marker; RNA 18S; saliva protein; STATH protein, human; chemistry; forensic medicine; genetic marker; genetics; human; metabolism; nucleic acid amplification; procedures; saliva; sensitivity and specificity; Amylases; Biomarkers; Forensic Medicine; Genetic Markers; Humans; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Saliva; Salivary Proteins and Peptides; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-85050938211

Chronic kidney disease(CKD), another important cause of death, shares several traditional cardiovascular riskfactors with ischaemic stroke. Therefore, it is important to examine the existence of shared risk factors in the association between CKD and ischaemic stroke. This study used a health examination database from a medical centre in Taiwan. A generalized linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between CKD and ischaemic stroke. The Maentel-Haenszel test was performed to analyse the effect of possible confounding factors on the association between CKD and ischaemic stroke. A prevalence rate study showed that more subjects with CKD suffered from ischaemic stroke than subjects without CKD. Diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia were associated with increased risks of ischaemic stroke in CKD subjects. There was an inverse association of the odds ratio of ischaemic stroke between CKD and non-CKD patients, which implied that younger subjects with CKD should be made aware of ischaemic stroke prevention. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"adult; aged; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; chronic kidney failure; complication; factual database; female; human; male; middle aged; odds ratio; prevalence; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Brain Ischemia; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Stroke; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85050632042

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, quantification of adenosine triphosphate, and bioluminescence imaging of PRF sections were used to assess cytokine and entrapped platelet distribution. Three-dimensional structures of fibrin networks revealed concentration gradients of the platelet-derived growth factor beta beta homodimer and the transforming growth factor-beta 1. Histological analysis of PRF sections (from the red blood cell end to the plasma end of a clot) showed a gradual increase in average porosity, most prominently in PRF clots from young and middle-Aged men and women, and a decrease in compactness along the longitudinal axis of the PRF gel.

Here, we developed a novel method for determining visceral fat by measuring liver–kidney space (LKS) on abdominal sonography and expanded its utilization in the elderly to predict MS. Methods: To assess the correlation between the LKS and MS, 317 consecutive outpatients scheduled for health evaluation were retrospective analyzed. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose levels, and lipid profiles were obtained following standard protocols. On sonography, the thickness of visceral fat between the liver and right kidney was measured. We also compared its accuracy to predict MS with sonographic fatty liver changes. A total of 72 elderly patients older than 65 years were evaluated (mean age: 66.02 [65–83]). Results: In the current study, LKS = 4 mm enabled a better prediction of MS. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.626. The sensitivity and specificity for the presence of visceral fat to predict MS in the elderly were 0.58 and 0.73, respectively. The accuracy to predict MS was 68.1% for the measurement of visceral fat compared with 59.6% for sonographic fatty liver change in the elderly. Conclusion: Measuring LKS by sonography may be a practical method for evaluating visceral fat in the elderly and for predicting MS better than sonographic fatty liver changes. LKS was more associated with abdominal girth and BMI in the elderly from the study supporting the observation that LKS are well correlated with general adiposity. ? 2018",body mass index; metabolic syndrome; obesity; sonography; visceral fat,glucose; adult; aged; Article; blood sampling; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; comparative study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; echography; fasting; fatty liver; female; geriatric disorder; glucose blood level; human; intra-abdominal fat; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; outpatient; prediction; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; subcutaneous fat,2-s2.0-85048335532

Conclusions: Our study provides robust evidence that sexual dysfunction and poor satisfaction, together with severe perineal laceration, greater pain, and a medical condition, predict depressive symptoms during the 24-month postpartum period. ? 2018 Australian College of Midwives",Childbirth; Depression; Longitudinal study; Postpartum; Sexual function,"adult; antenatal depression; Article; childbirth; cohort analysis; episiotomy; female; female sexual dysfunction; Female Sexual Function Index; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; perineal pain; perineum injury; postnatal depression; priority journal; prospective study; sexual function; sexual satisfaction; Taiwan; Taiwanese; birth; depression; laceration; obstetric delivery; pain; postnatal depression; pregnancy; psychology; psychosexual disorder; puerperium; risk factor; sexual dysfunction; Adult; Cohort Studies; Delivery, Obstetric; Depression; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Humans; Lacerations; Pain; Parturition; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85040952971

The aforementioned conditions raise the possibility of the infection risk; however, clinical episodes of sepsis have not been reported in PA. Methods: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2009, we identified PA and aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) matched with essential hypertension (EH) at a 1:1 ratio by propensity scores. The incidences of sepsis and mortality after the index date were evaluated, and the risk factors of outcomes were identified using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models and taking mortality as a competing risk. Results: We enrolled 2448 patients with PA (male, 46.08%; mean age, 48.4 years). There were 875 patients who could be ascertained as APA. Taking mortality as the competing risk, APA patients had a lower incidence of sepsis than their matched EH patients (hazard ratio (HR) 0.29; P < 0.001) after target treatments. Patients receiving adrenalectomy showed a benefit of decreasing the risk of sepsis (PA vs EH, HR 0.14, P = 0.001; APA vs EH, HR 0.16, P = 0.003), but mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment may differ. Compared with matched control cohorts, patients with APA had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (PA, adjusted HR 0.84, P = 0.050; APA, adjusted HR 0.31, P < 0.001) after target treatments. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that patients with PA/APA who underwent adrenalectomy could attenuate the risk of sepsis compared with their matched EH patients. We further found that APA patients with target treatments could decrease all-cause mortality compared with EH patients. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Chronic inflammation; Glucocorticoid; Hypertension; Oxidative stress; Primary aldosteronism; Sepsis; Taiwan Primary Aldosteronism Investigation,angiotensin receptor antagonist; anticoagulant agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; inotropic agent; mineralocorticoid antagonist; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adenoma; adrenalectomy; adult; Article; attenuation; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; death; essential hypertension; female; hazard ratio; human; hypertension; ICD-9-CM; incidence; infection risk; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; primary hyperaldosteronism; priority journal; propensity score; proportional hazards model; risk factor; sepsis; septic shock; static group comparison; complication; hyperaldosteronism; pathophysiology; procedures; risk assessment; sepsis; Taiwan; Adrenalectomy; Adult; Female; Humans; Hyperaldosteronism; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Propensity Score; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sepsis; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85056947969

Because sRAGE is regarded as a scavenger to AGE, we hypothesized that the ratio of AGE to sRAGE (AGE/sRAGE) is associated with albuminuria in hypertensive patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 104 patients with essential hypertension were recruited. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure???140?mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure???90?mmHg, or use of antihypertensive treatment. Albuminuria was defined as albumin excretion rate ≧ 20?μg/min. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between AGE/sRAGE and albuminuria. RESULTS: Among the 104 patients, 30 (28.8%) patients had albuminuria and 74 (71.2%) patients did not. Patients with albuminuria had higher AGE (2.15 vs. 1.71?μg/mL), lower sRAGE (424.5 vs. 492.5?pg/ml) and higher AGE/sRAGE (3.79 vs. 3.29?μg/pg) than those without albuminuria. Multivariate logistic regression model revealed that AGE/sRAGE (OR?=?1.131, 95% CI?=?1.001-1.278, P?=?0.048) was independently associated with albuminuria. There was no significant relationship between AGE and sRAGE alone with albuminuria. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the ratio of AGE to sRAGE may be a surrogate biomarker for microvascular injury. Further prospective studies of the prognostic value of the ratio in relation to microvasular injury are needed.",Advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor; Advanced glycosylation end products; Albuminuria; Hypertension,"advanced glycation end product; advanced glycation end product receptor; biological marker; sRAGE protein, human; aged; albuminuria; blood; cross-sectional study; female; human; hypertension; male; middle aged; Aged; Albuminuria; Biomarkers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products",2-s2.0-85056522953

Hatcheries are the main source of chickens for commercial farms. To characterize the potential pathogenicity of E. coli strains isolated from hatcheries, 2344 fluff samples from 1-day-old chickens were collected from hatching incubators between October 2016 and November 2017. Among the hatcheries, the incidence of E. coli varied from 0% to 16.9%, with an overall incidence of 2.0%. High incidences reflected inadequate sanitation in some hatcheries. We also compared 20 clinically isolated APEC strains with fluff-originated E. coli in terms of existence of 10 virulence-associated genes (VAGs) and antimicrobial-resistance genes, and antimicrobial resistance using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Our results showed that APEC more-frequently possessed most of the assessed VAGs (papC, astA, cvaC, hlyF, fyuA, iroN, iutA, iss, and ompT), suggesting that fluff-originated E. coli is less likely to cause avian colibacillosis. However, fluff-originated E. coli more-frequently expressed the adhesion gene fimC, which could confer higher upper respiratory tract adhesion. Both APEC and fluff-originated E. coli demonstrated multidrug resistance including 100% resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cephalexin, florfenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Based on median MIC values, fluff-originated E. coli was more susceptible to antibiotics. However, resistance-gene existence did not significantly differ between groups, suggesting that fluff-originated E. coli should still be a public health concern. Molecular subtyping with XbaI-digested pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that only a few strains showed identical patterns, indicating that a variety of contamination sources were present within individual hatcheries. Identical strains within the same hatchery may indicate vertical transmission from parent flocks. Overall, this is the first study to characterize fluff-originated E. coli. Our results suggest that it has lower pathogenicity than APEC and that thorough sanitation should be performed to reduce the occurrence of fluff-originated E. coli in hatcheries.Caracterizaci?n de Escherichia coli aislada de plum?n de pollitos de un d?a en plantas de incubaci?n en Taiw?n. La colibacilosis aviar resultante de Escherichia coli patog?nica aviar (APEC) puede afectar de manera severa a la producci?n av?cola. Las plantas de incubaci?n son la fuente principal de pollos para las granjas comerciales. Para caracterizar la patogenicidad potencial de las cepas de E. coli aisladas de las plantas de incubaci?n, se recolectaron 2344 muestras de plum?n de pollos de un d?a de edad de plantas de incubaci?n entre octubre del 2016 a noviembre del 2017. Entre las plantas de incubaci?n, la incidencia de E. coli fue del cero por ciento hasta el 16.9%, con una incidencia global del 2.0%. Las altas incidencias reflejaron una sanidad inadecuada en algunas plantas. Tambi?n se compararon 20 cepas de E. coli patog?nica aviar aisladas de casos cl?nicos con E. coli originada del plum?n con relaci?n a la presencia de 10 genes asociados a la virulencia (VAG), con genes asociados con la resistencia a los antimicrobianos y se evalu? la resistencia a los antimicrobianos mediante valores de concentraci?n m?nima inhibitoria (MIC). Los resultados mostraron que la E. coli patog?nica aviar pose?a con mayor frecuencia la mayor?a de los genes asociados con virulencia evaluados (papC, astA, cvaC, hlyF, fyuA, iroN, iutA, iss y ompT), lo que sugiere que la E. coli originada del plum?n es menos probable que cause colibacilosis aviar. Sin embargo, la E. coli originada de plum?n expres? con mayor frecuencia el gene de adhesi?n fimC, que podr?a conferir una mayor adhesi?n en el tracto respiratorio superior. Tanto la E. coli patog?nica aviar como la E. coli originada del plum?n demostraron resistencia a m?ltiples f?rmacos, incluida una resistencia del 100% a la ampicilina, amoxicilina, cefalexina, florfenicol y trimetoprimsulfametoxazol. Con base la mediana de los valores de la concentraci?n m?nima inhibitoria, la E. coli originada del plum?n fue m?s susceptible a los antibi?ticos. Sin embargo, la existencia del gene de resistencia no fue diferente significativamente entre los grupos, lo que sugiere que la E. coli originada del plum?n puede ser un problema de salud p?blica. El subtipo molecular con electroforesis en gel de campo pulsado digerido con XbaI revel? que solo unas pocas cepas mostraron patrones id?nticos, lo que indica que una variedad de fuentes de contaminaci?n estaban presentes en las plantas de incubaci?n individuales. Las cepas id?nticas dentro de la misma planta de incubaci?n pueden indicar transmisi?n vertical a partir de las parvadas paternas. En general, este es el primer estudio en caracterizar E. coli originada del plum?n. Estos resultados sugieren que tiene una patogenicidad m?s baja que la E. coli patog?nica aviar y que se debe realizar una limpieza y desinfecci?n exhaustivas para reducir la aparici?n de E. coli originada de plum?n en las plantas de incubaci?n.",antimicrobial resistance; Escherichia coli; fluff; hatcheries; molecular subtyping; virulence-associated genes,,2-s2.0-85069150390

Therefore, this study developed and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy program, described the patterns of use and measured change in risk factors. Methods This study adopted an online video conference system, JointNet, to maintain group interaction functions similar to face to face groups online, and also built an self-learning platform to deliver psychoeducation content and cognitive-behavior therapy related materials and homework. Forty-three out-patients were recruited in the pilot study, who then chose to participate in either the Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy or face to face group based on their preference. Fourteen patients were assigned to the waiting-list control. Results Seventeen participants (17/43 = 39.5%) chose the Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy program. Among them, thirteen participants (13/17 = 76.5%) finished the program and were more male (92.3% vs. 50%), employed (53.8% vs. 35.3%), and had longer education duration (13.9 vs. 12.5 years) than the counterparts of the face to face group. Furthermore, they were highly motivated with average number of log-ins (66.5 time), website surfing time (950.94 min), reading frequency (78.15 time) and reading time (355.90 min) for the self-learning platform during eight weeks; and also highly satisfied (97%) with visiting the self-learning platform and video conferences. The treatment effectiveness of Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy was comparable with face to face one in reducing anxiety, hostility, respiration rate, and in improving vasodilation but not depression compared with the waiting-list control. Conclusion These results indicated that the Internet-based group therapy program using video conference is feasible and acceptable for the psychosocial rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery heart disease, and provides an alternative for patients who are unable to obtain conventional psychosocial rehabilitation conducted face to face. ? 2018 Lin et al.

Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening. Methods This was a mixed-method research study. Quantitative data were to analyze completeness and timeliness of surveillance system performance from national District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) during October 2014 to September 2016. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district and 7 key informants of the IDSR system implementation and administration at district and national levels. Findings The current IDSR system showed relatively good completeness (73.1%) but poor timeliness (40.2%) of total expected monthly reports nationwide and zero weekly reports during the study period. Major implementation gaps were lack of weekly report and trainings. The challenges of IDSR implementation revealed through qualitative data included case identification, compiling reports for timely submission and inadequate resources. Conclusions The differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice were huge. The developing information technology infrastructure in Malawi and emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology can be opportunities for the country to overcome these challenges and improve surveillance system to have better timeliness for the outbreaks and unusual events detection. ? 2018 Joseph Wu et al.

We hypothesized that regional measures of visceral adiposity would associate with commonly obtained clinical measures of immune status. We consecutively studied 3,291 subjects (mean age, 49.8±9.8 years) who underwent an annual cardiovascular risk survey. Peri-cardial (PCF) and thoracic peri-aortic adipose tissue (TAT) volumes were determined by dedicated computed tomography (CT) software (Aquarius 3D Workstation, TeraRecon, San Mateo, CA, USA). Hepatic steatosis was assessed by abdominal ultrasonography. We explored cross-sectional associations between visceral fat measures and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), leukocyte counts, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ration (NLR). Among 3,291 study participants, we observed positive linear associations between PCF and TAT, higher degree of hepatic steatosis and hs-CRP, various leukocyte counts, either total and its differential counts, and NLR (all trend p<0.001). Multi-variate linear and logistic regression models showed independent associations between PCF/TAT (?-Coef: 0.14/0.16, both p<0.05) and total WBC counts, with only TAT further demonstrated significant relations with neutrophil counts and NLR (both p<0.05) and independently identified abnormally high WBC and NLR (Odds ratio: 1.18 & 1.21, both p<0.05). C-statistics showed significant incremental model prediction for abnormally high WBC and NLR (both ΔAUROC<0.05) when TAT was superimposed on traditional cardiovascular risks and biochemical information. Greater visceral adiposity burden and hepatic steatosis may be associated with higher circulating leukocyte counts and markers for atherosclerosis, with more pronounced influences for peri-aortic adiposity. Our data suggested the differential biological impacts for region-specific visceral adiposity. ? 2018 Sung et al.

Methods We enrolled laboratory-confirmed EV71 cases and healthy age- and gender-matched controls in Taiwan from 2000 to 2012. We detected genetic polymorphisms in SCARB2, PSGL-1, and ANXA2 and correlated the results with EV71 susceptibility and severity. Results We collected 599 EV71 cases and 98 controls. Among EV71 patients, the male to female ratio was 1.61, and the mean age was 2.99±2.47 years.

In this study, we reported the survival outcomes of pediatric patients in relation with the donor-recipient weight ratio. Methods: Twenty-eight children, aged 3 months to 17 years, with dilated cardiomyopathy underwent primary cardiac transplantation at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1995 and 2012. We analyzed these patients according to the donor-recipient weight ratio: group 1 (n = 19) with donor-recipient weight ratio <2.5 (median 1.1, interquartile range 1.0–1.6), and group 2 (n = 9) with donor-recipient weight ratio ?2.5 (median 3.0, inter-quartile range 2.87–3.5). Results: The 30-day survival rate was 100% for both group 1 and group 2 (P = 1). The survival rates for group 1 and group 2 were 95% vs 100% at 1 year, 84% vs 89% at 5 years, and 73% vs 61% at 10 years. The median survival was 14.4 years vs 12.9 years (P =.6313).

First, after reviewing the historical documents and the statistical databases created by the Ministry of Education from 1998 to 2015, we divided the nation's development of public health education into four stages: founding stage (1993-1970), thriving stage (1971-1990), rapid-expansion stage (1991-2007), and reorganization stage (after 2007). We then reviewed the trend of the establishment of public health-related departments or institutions, the composition of faculty, and the number of enrolled students in the higher education. Second, we discussed critical issues revealed by these empirical data, including core courses, competence examination, the evaluation of departments/institutions, and job markets. Lastly, we suggested some directions for future reforms, such as establishing professional organization to conduct accreditation for departments/institutions, advocating Public Health Specialist Act to certify professionals, and fostering emerging human resources market for public health professionals.

We analyzed the benefits of universal NAT by estimating the number of prevented transfusion-Transmitted infections (TTIs) and calculating the saved cost of medical expenditures, relief payments, litigation costs, and medical care for secondary HIV transmission. Methods: We determined the number of NAT yield cases (seronegative NAT- reactive donors) during the study period of 2013-2016. The number of prevented TTIs was estimated based on the number of NAT yield cases after considering the number of blood components produced per donation, recipient susceptibility, and viral infectivity. Results: Among 7,001,347 donations, we identified 6 HIV, 52 HCV, and 1927 HBV seronegative NAT-reactive donors. The expected number of prevented TTIs was 16.7 for HIV, 115.6 for HCV, and 55.2 for HBV. After further considering donations contributed from donors with occult HBV infection, an additional 1032.2 cases of TTIs were prevented. An estimated 1219.7 cases of TTIs were prevented. The cost of NAT during the 4 years was NT$740 million. The estimated savings from medical expenditures, relief payments, litigation costs, and secondary transmissions of HIV from NAT yield cases were respectively NT$259 million; NT$642 million; NT$98 million; and NT$28 million. The savings attributed to NAT screening totaled NT$1,027 million. Conclusions: Universal NAT improves the safety of blood donation. The total cost of NAT in Taiwan was NT$740 million over 4 years. An estimated 1,220 TTIs were prevented, and approximately NT$1,027 million was saved. NAT screening of donor blood is conclusively cost effective.

However, the number of organ/tissue donors per year in Taiwan is extremely low, resulting in increased mortality. This is also true in Europe and in the United States. Recently, data from the Taiwan Organ Registry and Sharing Center showed that, although fundraising for organs/tissues slightly increased, the number of donors did not exhibit a corresponding growth trend. Identifying appropriate donors and the provision of good quality transplantation care by medical team members are current challenges. Hence, the application of information technology to in-service education for organ transplantation professionals has been suggested. This was a qualitative study that employed qualitative content analysis with purposive and snowball sampling. The study participants (n = 8, mean age 39.88 ± 3.06 years) included medical staff involved in tissue/organ transplantation from 4 leading medical centers and 3 regional teaching hospitals, and those who participated in the informatics education system. The interviewees from multidisciplinary medical teams showed the status of and dilemma in organ fundraising/donation/ transplantation, noting 6 core themes. Regarding relevant education and training, 4 core themes were identified. Current educational courses for organ fundraising/donation/transplantation are inadequate and seem to provide insufficient information to multidisciplinary medical teams. Hence, it is necessary to develop a theoretical construct to create a complete curriculum framework and to establish complete fit-in professional and ethical organ transplantation learning programs based on informatics technology to increase the interdisciplinary exchange of experience.

The objective of this study was to systemic investigate relationships of urinary arsenic (As) concentrations, the As methylation capability, and toenail As concentrations on cognitive, language, and motor development in VLBWP children under 24 months of corrected age. Participants (n = 60) in our study were recruited from October 2010 to April 2013. Urine and toenail samples were collected for evaluation to assess As exposure. The Bayley scales of infant development III were used to evaluate neurodevelopment at 2 years of corrected age. Concentrations of As species in urine and the As concentration in toenails were, respectively, analyzed using HPLC-HG-AAS and ICP-MS. The mean concentration of total As was 28.6 mg/g creatinine, and inorganic As was 1.01 mg/L in urine. The urine contained an average of 3% inorganic As, 2% monomethylarsonic acid, and 95% dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). The mean concentration of As in toenails was 225 ng/g. Children with a longer gestational age (?28 weeks) and higher DMA % levels appeared to have the highest unadjusted cognitive and fine motor scores. Our study results suggest that gestational age is associated with neurodevelopment in VLBWP children. We recommend that further study simultaneously analyze multiple environmental contaminants that may have adverse effects on neurodevelopment, use biomarkers for the mother-child pair, and determine whether prenatal or postnatal As exposure has a greater influence on the neurological development of VLBWP children.

Methods Longitudinal data from four waves of the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA), collected between 1996 and 2007, were used for analysis (N = 3,429). Parallel-process latent growth curve modeling was adopted to evaluate the process by which LTA mediated between sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, self-rated health, comorbidities, and depression) and the outcome process of functional disabilities. Results When mediated by baseline level of LTA, five sociodemographic factorsage, gender, education level, self-rated health, and number of comorbiditieshad significant and negative mediating effects on baseline or change in functional disability, thus improving disability outcomes. However, four of the sociodemographic factors (age, education level, and number of comorbidities), when mediated through the rate of change in LTA, were found to have significant and positive mediating effects, which increased disability levels. The proportion of effects mediated by the LTA trajectory ranged from 0% to 194%. Discussion The large proportion of effects mediated through the LTA process underlines the importance of LTA to public health policy and health programs for older adults. The study's findings shed light on how to better target populations of older adults to promote an active lifestyle and achieve more successful aging in late life in Asian countries. ? 2018 Chen et al.

The purpose of this study was to develop a typology to describe patterns of interactions between patients with APC, their caregivers, and healthcare providers as regards to symptoms and symptom management. Methods: Thematic analysis was used to analyze 37 transcripts of audio-recorded, naturally occurring encounters among APC patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Transcripts were drawn from the Values and Options in Cancer Care study, a larger randomized controlled communication and decision-making intervention trial, which recruited advanced cancer patients and caregivers across the USA. All transcripts from APC patients that were pre-intervention were analyzed. Results: Eight unique types of interaction patterns among patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers were identified as follows: collaborative interactions, explanatory interactions, agentic interactions, checklist interactions, cross-purpose interactions, empathic interactions, admonishing interactions, and diverging interactions. Conclusions: Our findings provide a systematic description of a variety of types of interaction patterns regarding symptom discussion among APC patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers. These typologies can be used to facilitate effective communication and symptom management. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Advanced pancreatic cancer; Cancer care; Communication; Symptoms; Thematic analysis,advanced cancer; Article; caregiver; clinical article; decision making; empathy; health care personnel; human; interpersonal communication; pancreas cancer; priority journal; symptom; thematic analysis; United States; adult; aged; clinical trial; controlled study; disease exacerbation; female; human relation; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; multicenter study; palliative therapy; pancreas tumor; pathology; professional-patient relationship; psychology; randomized controlled trial; Adult; Aged; Caregivers; Communication; Decision Making; Disease Progression; Empathy; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Palliative Care; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Professional-Patient Relations,2-s2.0-85052594527

We aimed to develop a scoring model incorporating information from blood culture time to positivity (TTP-NTSVI) and compared the prediction capability for VI among adults with NTS bacteremia between TTP-NTSVI and a previously published score (Chen-NTSVI). Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 217 adults with NTS bacteremia ≧ 50 years old. We developed a TTP-NTSVI score by multiple logistic regression modeling to identify independent predictors for imaging-confirmed VI and assigned a point value weighting by the corresponding natural logarithm of the odds ratio for each model predictor. Chen-NTSVI score includes hypertension, male sex, serogroup C1, coronary arterial disease (CAD) as positive predictors, and malignancy and immunosuppressive therapy as negative predictors. The prediction capability of the two scores was compared by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The mean age was 68.3 ± 11.2 years-old. Serogroup D was the predominant isolate (155/217, 71.4%). Seventeen (7.8%) patients had VI. Four independent predictors for VI were identified: male sex (24.9 [2.59–239.60]; 6) (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]; assigned score point), peripheral arterial occlusive disease (9.41 [2.21–40.02]; 4), CAD (4.0 [1.16–13.86]; 3), and TTP <10 h (4.67 [1.42–15.39]; 3). Youden's index showed best cutoff value of ≧7 with 70.6% sensitivity and 82.5% specificity. TTP-NTSVI score had higher AUC than Chen-NTSVI (0.851 vs 0.741, P = 0.039). Conclusion: While the previously reported scoring model performed well, a TTP-incorporated scoring model was associated with improved capability in predicting NTSVI. ? 2018",Blood culture; Nontyphoidal Salmonella; Prediction; Time to positivity; Vascular infection,"aged; Article; blood culture; cardiovascular infection; cohort analysis; coronary artery disease; female; gender; Gram negative sepsis; human; hypertension; immunosuppressive treatment; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; nontyphoid Salmonella bacteremia; peripheral occlusive artery disease; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; salmonellosis; scoring system; serotype; Youden index; bacteremia; classification; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; microbiology; middle aged; risk factor; Salmonella; salmonellosis; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; Taiwan; time factor; university hospital; vasculitis; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bacteremia; Blood Culture; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Salmonella; Salmonella Infections; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serogroup; Taiwan; Time Factors; Vasculitis",2-s2.0-85042648195

Current polysaccharide vaccines have limited serotype coverage and therefore cannot provide maximal and long-term protection. Global efforts are being made to develop a conserved protein vaccine candidate. PrtA, a pneumococcal surface protein, was identified by screening a pneumococcal genomic expression library using convalescent patient serum. The prtA gene is prevalent and conserved among S. pneumoniae strains. Its protective efficacy, however, has not been described. Mucosal immunization could sensitize both local and systemic immunity, which would be an ideal scenario for preventing S. pneumoniae infection. Methods: We immunized BALB/c mice intranasally with a combination of a PrtA fragment (amino acids 144-1041) and Th17 potentiated adjuvant, curdlan. We then measured the T-cell and antibody responses. The protective efficacy conferred to the immunized mice was further evaluated using a murine model of acute pneumococcal pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia. Results: There was a profound antigen-specific IL-17A and IFN-γ response in PrtA-immunized mice compared with that of adjuvant control group. Even though PrtA-specific IgG and IgA titer in sera was elevated in immunized mice, only a moderate IgA response was observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The PrtA-immunized antisera facilitated the activated murine macrophage, RAW264.7, to opsonophagocytose S. pneumoniae D39 strain; however, PrtA-specific immunoglobulins bound to pneumococcal surfaces with a limited potency. Finally, PrtA-induced immune reactions failed to protect mice against S. pneumoniae-induced acute pneumonia and bacterial propagation through the blood. Conclusions: Immunization with recombinant PrtA combined with curdlan produced antigen-specific antibodies and elicited IL-17A response. However, it failed to protect the mice against S. pneumoniae-induced infection. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Curdlan; IL-17A; PrtA; Streptococcus pneumoniae,"curdlan; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 17; Pneumococcus vaccine; recombinant protein PrtA; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; Pneumococcus vaccine; adjuvant chemotherapy; amino terminal sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; antigen specificity; Article; bacteremia; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; cell activation; controlled study; disease severity; drug efficacy; gene expression; gene library; humoral immunity; immune response; immunization; lack of drug effect; macrophage function; male; mouse; nonhuman; phagocytosis; pneumococcal infection; protein expression; Streptococcus pneumonia; T lymphocyte; Th17 cell; animal; Bagg albino mouse; drug effect; immunization; immunology; metabolism; physiology; procedures; RAW 264.7 cell line; Streptococcus pneumonia; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Immunization; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Phagocytosis; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Pneumonia, Pneumococcal; RAW 264.7 Cells; Streptococcus pneumoniae",2-s2.0-85054028152

However, the measurements of multistate outcome are prone to the errors of classification, particularly when a population-based survey/research is involved with proxy measurements of outcome due to cost consideration. Such a misclassification may affect the effect size of relevant covariates such as odds ratio used in the field of epidemiology. We proposed a Bayesian measurement-error-driven hidden Markov regression model for calibrating these biased estimates with and without a 2-stage validation design. A simulation algorithm was developed to assess various scenarios of underestimation and overestimation given nondifferential misclassification (independent of covariates) and differential misclassification (dependent on covariates). We applied our proposed method to the community-based survey of androgenetic alopecia and found that the effect size of the majority of covariate was inflated after calibration regardless of which type of misclassification. Our proposed Bayesian measurement-error-driven hidden Markov regression model is practicable and effective in calibrating the effects of covariates on multistate outcome, but the prior distribution on measurement errors accrued from 2-stage validation design is strongly recommended. ? 2018 The Authors.

However, its effects on short- and long-term health outcomes and medical utilization are not fully elucidated. This study aimed to compare short- and long-term utilization and health outcomes of colon cancer patients who underwent either laparoscopic or open surgery in a population-based cohort. Methods: This study was conducted by linking data from Taiwan Cancer Registry, National Health Insurance claims and Death Registry. Patients aged 18 and older with colon cancer between 2009 and 2012 were included in the study. Propensity score matching was used to minimize selection bias between laparoscopic and open surgery groups. Cox proportional hazard regression and generalized linear mixed logistic regression were used to test hypotheses. Results: Among the 11,269 colon cancer patients who underwent colectomy, 3236 (28.72%) received laparoscopy and 8033 (71.28%) underwent open surgery. Patients who received laparoscopic surgery had better overall survival (HR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70–0.97). These patients also had lower 30 day mortality (0.44% vs. 0.91%), lower 1 year mortality (2.83% vs. 4.68%), lower overall occurrence of complications (6.16% vs. 8.77%), shorter mean length of stay (12.53 vs. 14.93 days) and lower cost for index hospitalization (US$4325.34 vs. US$4453.90). No significant differences were observed in medical utilization over a period of 365 days after the surgery. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that, in both the short- and long-term post-operation periods, laparoscopic surgery reduced the likelihood of postoperative complications, 30 day, and 1 year mortality while being no more expensive than open surgery for colon cancer. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",colon cancer; complications; healthcare utilization; Laparoscopy; survival,bevacizumab; cetuximab; irinotecan; oxaliplatin; regorafenib; adult; aged; Article; cancer radiotherapy; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; colon cancer; colon resection; confounding variable; controlled study; female; health care quality; health care utilization; hospitalization cost; human; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; open surgery; outcome assessment; overall survival; postoperative complication; postoperative period; propensity score; proportional hazards model; recurrence free survival; sepsis; survival; Taiwan; treatment outcome; adverse event; colon resection; colon tumor; hospitalization; laparoscopy; patient attitude; postoperative complication; procedures; retrospective study; survival analysis; Adult; Aged; Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Postoperative Complications; Propensity Score; Quality of Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85049079710

Methods Pooled and area-specific weather related cumulative six-day (lags 0 to 5) relative risks (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) of ERV for OHCA were evaluated for CMS cases, using distributed lag nonlinear models and multivariate meta-analytical second-stage model in association with the daily average temperatures and daily concentrations of air pollutants. Results ERV risk increased as average temperature dropped to <27°C. At the mean temperature of 14°C, the cumulative six-day RRs of ERV were 1.73 (95% CI: 1.22, 2.46) for all OHCA patients, 1.74 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.84) for OHCA patients younger than 65 years old, and 1.99 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.81) for subjects with pre-existing hypertension. High temperature was also associated with elevated ERV of OHCA. Increased ERV risks in cases with pre-existing hypertension and diabetes mellitus were also associated with concentrations of air pollutants in northern Taiwan. Conclusions Our data provided evidences to clinicians, emerging medical services and public health that the ERV risk for OHCA patients is greater at low temperature than at high temperature. Patients with cardio and metabolic disorders need to pay greater attention to low temperature and avoid heat wave. ? 2018 Wang et al.

This study aimed to examine the prognostic importance of uremic pruritus and to identify the determinants for higher pruritus intensity in PD patients. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients receiving maintenance PD. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score was used to measure the intensity of uremic pruritus. The composite endpoint of PD technique failure or all-cause death was assessed using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. The determinants for the VAS score of uremic pruritus was assessed using a multivariable linear regression model. Results Among the 85 PD patients, 24 (28%) had uremic pruritus. During a median follow-up of 28.0 months, 12 patients experienced technique failure, and 7 died. We found that a higher VAS score of pruritus intensity was an independent risk factor for technique failure or death (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.18 to 2.28; P = 0.003) after adjusting for a variety of confounding factors. We also found that a weekly total Kt/V of less than 1.88, a longer duration of dialysis, a higher dietary protein intake, and higher blood levels of intact parathyroid hormone and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were independent determinants of higher VAS scores of pruritus intensity. Conclusions Our results show that uremic pruritus is an independent risk factor of technique failure and death in patients receiving PD.

Design: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of two cohorts of healthy pregnant women recruited from a prenatal clinic in a medical center in Northern Taiwan. Methods: A total of 322 women reported sociodemographic and health characteristics in a structured interview and wore a wrist actigraph on their nondominant wrist for 7 consecutive days to assess objective sleep patterns. The women's resting blood pressures were measured while seated in the clinic by trained personnel using an electronic sphygmomanometer. Findings: One hundred thirty-three (41.3%) women reported snoring. Ninety-three women (28.9%) had <6 hr of nighttime sleep, with only 95 (29.5%) women averaging 7 or more hours of nighttime sleep. In the univariate analyses, snoring was positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as mean arterial pressure levels (p <.05). In the multivariate analyses, snoring remained as a significant predictor of higher diastolic blood pressure (β = 2.07, p <.05) and mean arterial pressure levels (β = 2.00, p <.05), after adjustment for age, parity, gestational age, body mass index before pregnancy, and sleep quantity and quality by actigraphy. Conclusions: Snoring is a highly prevalent condition experienced by healthy third-trimester pregnant women and is associated with elevated blood pressure. Clinical Relevance: Clinical assessment and screening of snoring are of utmost importance in obstetric nursing practice to potentially prevent or reduce the associated adverse cardiovascular consequences in women during pregnancy. ? 2018 Sigma Theta Tau International",Actigraphy; blood pressure; pregnancy; sleep; snoring,"adult; blood pressure; cross-sectional study; female; human; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; prevalence; sleep; snoring; Taiwan; third trimester pregnancy; young adult; Adult; Blood Pressure; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Prevalence; Sleep; Snoring; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85050454856

VAP-1 has been strongly implicated in several pathological processes, including diabetes, inflammation, hypertension, hepatic steatosis and renal diseases, and is an important disease marker and therapeutic target. Here, we aimed to identify the genetic loci for circulating VAP-1 levels. Materials and Methods: We carried out a genomic-wide linkage scan for the quantitative trait locus of circulating VAP-1 levels in 1,100 Han Chinese individuals from 398 families in the Stanford Asian Pacific Program for Hypertension and Insulin Resistance study. Regional association fine mapping was carried out using additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Results: The estimated heritability of circulating VAP-1 levels is high (h2 = 69%). The most significant quantitative trait locus for circulating VAP-1 was located at 38 cM on chromosome 20, with a maximum empirical logarithm of odds score of 4.11 (P = 6.86 × 10?6) in females. Regional single-nucleotide polymorphism fine mapping within a 1-unit support region showed the strongest association signals in the MACRO domain containing 2 (MACROD2) gene in females (P = 5.38 × 10?6). Knockdown of MACROD2 significantly suppressed VAP-1 expression in human adipocytes, as well as the expression of key adipogenic genes. Furthermore, MACROD2 expression was found to be positively associated with VAP-1 in human visceral adipose tissue. Conclusion: MACROD2 is a potential genetic determinant of serum VAP-1 levels, probably through transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis. ? 2018 The Authors.

However, advanced cancer therapy is expensive and requires good health care systems. For kidney cancer, no studies have yet established an association between clinical outcome and health care disparities. Methods: We used the mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) for kidney cancer as a marker of clinical outcome to compare World Health Organization (WHO) country rankings and total expenditures on health/gross domestic product (e/GDP) using linear regression analyses. Results: We included 57 countries based on data from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database. We found that more highly developed regions have higher crude and age-standardized rates of kidney cancer incidence and mortality, but a lower MIR, when compared to less developed regions. North America has the highest crude rates of incidence, but the lowest MIRs, whereas Africa has the highest MIRs. Furthermore, favorable MIRs are correlated with countries with good WHO rankings and high e/GDP expenditures (p < 0.001 and p = 0.013, respectively). Conclusions: Kidney cancer MIRs are positively associated with the ranking of health care systems and health care expenditures. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Incidence; Kidney cancer; Mortality; Mortality-to-incidence ratio,"Africa; age distribution; Article; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; clinical outcome; controlled study; developed country; epidemiological data; female; gross national product; health care cost; health care disparity; health care system; human; kidney cancer; life expectancy; major clinical study; male; mortality to incidence ratio; North America; standardization; world health organization; comparative study; economics; factual database; global health; health care delivery; health care disparity; incidence; kidney tumor; mortality; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; Databases, Factual; Delivery of Health Care; Global Health; Gross Domestic Product; Health Care Costs; Health Expenditures; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Incidence; Kidney Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85054930343

Recursive partition trees, nonlinear association curve fit and geographic information system maps were incorporated to verify results of conventional pooled analyses for sources of heterogeneity. Results from 61 studies (16,219 cases, 12,222 controls) revealed a significant increased relative risk (RR) of IHD associated with NOS3 894 polymorphisms TT (RR = 1.44) and GT (RR = 1.37). Subgroup analysis revealed that the TT polymorphism genotype had significantly increased risk of IHD in Caucasian, East Asian, South Asian, and Middle Eastern populations (all p < 0.05). It is important to point out that many countries demonstrated an average risk of greater than two, which identifies the NOS3 894 TT polymorphism as a potential causal factor and biological marker of IHD, based on criteria for strong evidence used in international consensus panels. These 10 countries include Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Chile, Japan, South Korea, India, Iran, Egypt and Morocco. For these countries with elevated risk (RR > 2) from the NOS3 894 TT polymorphism, meta-predictive analysis demonstrated an increasing trend in air pollution association with increased NOS3 894 polymorphisms. Further studies are needed to explore the complexity of the associations among NOS3 gene polymorphisms per population stratifications within countries, detailed air pollution data for added specificity for geographic location across time, and disease risk. ? 2018 by the authors.",Cardiovascular disease; Ischemic heart disease; Meta-analysis; NOS3 G894T gene,,2-s2.0-85056434858

However, SDs might also contribute to the development of CSU. Here, we present the first population-based cohort study on the association between SDs and subsequent CSU development. This study investigated whether SDs increase the risk of CSU by using a population-based database in Taiwan. This retrospective matched-cohort study included 105,892 patients with new-onset SDs (SD cohort) and 105,892 randomly selected controls (control cohort). Each patient was monitored for 10 years to individually identify patients who were subsequently diagnosed as having CSU during the follow-up period. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to determine the risk of CSU in patients with SDs compared with the controls. All relevant comorbidities were more prevalent in the SD cohort than in the control cohort (P<.001). During the follow-up period, the incidence rates of CSU among the patients with SDs and controls were 53.4 and 28.3 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, the adjusted hazard ratio for CSU in the SD cohort was 1.83 (95% confidence interval=1.73-1.93, P<.001).

The clinical manifestations of CSP present a wide range of variations, and the optimal management is yet to be defined. We retrospectively enrolled 109 patients with the diagnosis of CSP from our department and categorized them into four grades based on the ultrasound presentation. Grade I CSP indicated the GS embedded in less than one-half thickness of the lower anterior corpus; and grade II CSP represented the GS extended to more than one-half thickness of overlying myometrium. Grade III CSP implied the GS bulged out of the cesarean scar; and grade IV CSP denoted that GS became an amorphous tumor with rich vascularity at the cesarean scar. Seventy-eight women received surgery, and the complication rate was 14.1% (11/78). Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between the invasiveness of the surgery and their ultrasound gradings. The mainstream operation for grade I CSP was transcervical resection, while the majority of grade III and IV patients required hysterotomy or hysterectomy. Another 31 women received chemotherapy with methotrexate as their initial treatment. The success rate for chemotherapy was 61.3%; the remaining patients required further surgery due to persistent CSP or heavy bleeding during or after chemotherapy. Fifteen patients (48.3%) receiving chemotherapy suffered from complications (mostly bleeding). Among them, 7 (22.6%) patients experienced bleeding of more than 1,000 mL, and 9 (29.0%) of these 31 patients required blood transfusions. Our novel ultrasound grading system for CSP may help to communicate between physicians, and determine the optimal surgical strategy. Chemotherapy with methotrexate for CSP is not satisfactory and is associated with a higher rate of complications. ? 2018 Lin et al.

However, there are limited data on factors associated with prolonged length of stay (LOS) in the PES. The objective of this study was finding factors associated with prolonged LOS in the PES and moving towards a solution to this problem. Methods The study sample comprised 200 PES visits randomly chosen from January 2011 to December 2015 in a psychiatric hospital in Taiwan. Relevant data were collected comprehensively through the health information system and by reviewing medical records. The primary outcome was LOS longer than 24 hours while LOS longer than 48 hours was used as the secondary outcome. Results Mean LOS was 17.6±23.2 hours, with 53 (26.5%) visits lasting more than 24 hours and 15 (7.5%) visits lasting more than 48 hours. After adjusting for related confounders, LOS longer than 24 hours was associated with use of restraints in the PES (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.13, 95% CI = 1.59–6.15) and history of illicit substance use (aOR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.11–5.44). LOS longer than 48 hours was associated with use of restraints in the PES (aOR = 4.11, 95% CI = 1.2–14.14), history of illicit substance use (aOR = 6.16, 95% CI = 1.37–27.62) and first time visit to the hospital (aOR = 8.54, 95% CI = 2.03–35.96). Neither outcome was associated with transfer to an inpatient unit. Conclusion Prolonged LOS was common in the study sample. Discharged patients had an equally high rate of prolonged LOS as admitted patients. Therefore measures should be taken to facilitate timely discharge. Use of restraints and history of illicit substance use were common among patients with prolonged LOS. ? 2018 Hsu, Chan.

Because most previous studies have investigated suicide behaviors among HIV-positive patients during their first six months of diagnosis only, there is a current lack of understanding of suicide behaviors among this group. Purpose: This study aimed at HIV-positive patients who had been diagnosed between six months and one year ago and examined their suicide ideation and suicide attempt profiles and the associated factors of suicide. Methods: This study adopted a cross-sectional design. A total of 114 HIV-positive patients were interviewed in the HIV clinics of a medical center in Taipei City. Information collections included demographic and HIV-related data and measurements of suicide ideation, suicide attempt, depression, body image, meaning in life, and social support. Independent samples t tests, chi square tests, and logistic regressions were conducted to examine the associated factors and predictors of suicide ideation and suicide attempt. Result: Slightly over one-quarter (27.2 %) of the participants reported suicide ideation and 14.0% reported attempting suicide in recent one week prior the study interview. Duration since being diagnosed HIV-positive, level of education, and history of depression were each associated with suicide ideation, while only history of depression was associated with suicide attempt. Having a higher level of education and having a higher level of social (family) support were both predictors of lower risk of suicide ideation, while having a higher level of depression predicted a greater risk of suicide attempt. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: This study found high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempting suicide among HIV-positive patients during the six month to one year period after diagnosis. Moreover, the prevalence was similar to that among HIV-positive patients during the first six months of diagnosis. Suicide prevention should be a focus of care plans provided to HIV-positive patients during their first year after diagnosis. These results may be provided as a reference for developing suicide-prevention strategies for HIV-positive patients. Routine screening for depression, guiding families to increase their provision of social support, and giving assistance to individuals with higher levels of depression contribute to the effective prevention of suicide among HIV-positive patients. ? 2018 Slack Incorporated.All Rights Reserved.",Depression; HIV/AIDS; Psychosocial factors; Suicide attempt; Suicide ideation,"cross-sectional study; depression; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; psychology; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; time factor; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; HIV Infections; Humans; Risk Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85051022821

However, parallel work in other ethnical populations, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region, is lacking. Therefore, we designed this study to explore the association between clinical/laboratory parameters and hemogram levels. Adult individuals who came to our hospital for health exams were screened. Information on demographics and laboratory profiles was obtained. We analyzed the impacts of these parameters on the variation of hemogram. Overall, 26,497 adults were included in the current analysis after excluding those with abnormal hemogram. Multivariate regression analysis showed increasing age and male gender negatively affected the number of platelets, whereas a higher serum apolipoprotein B level was associated with an elevated platelet count. Gender and serum albumin level were the major determinants of variation in hemoglobin level. A modestly increased white cell count was seen in men as well as individuals with elevated apolipoprotein B levels, but it was inversely correlated with changes in age and serum albumin levels. Conversely, some variables, although statistically significantly associated with the hematological indices, only provided a trivial explanation for the heterogeneity observed. We further established predictive models for the approximate estimation of hematological indices in healthy adults. Our data indicate that age, gender, and serum levels of apolipoprotein B and albumin affect hematological indices in various ways. We also demonstrate that variation in hemogram could be successfully predicted by a number of clinical and laboratory parameters. ? 2018 Wang et al.

However, little is known about these changes. The current study aimed to bridge the gap by quantifying the motion of the body’s center of mass (COM) relative to the center of pressure (COP) in terms of COM-COP inclination angles (IA) and their rate of change (RCIA) in fifteen older adults with mild PD and fifteen healthy controls when crossing obstacles of heights of 10, 20 and 30% leg length. There were no between-group differences for either the leading or trailing toe clearances (p?>?0.05). With the unaffected limb leading, the PD subjects significantly increased the crossing sagittal and frontal IA, crossing sagittal RCIA, the peak RCIA, and average sagittal and frontal RCIAs during double-limb support for all obstacle heights when compared to those with the affected limb leading and those of the Controls (p?<?0.05). The poor balance control in the mediolateral direction during obstacle-crossing in PD indicated an increased risk of falling. The differences in the crossing patterns between leading with the affected or unaffected limb suggest that patients with PD should lead with the affected limb when crossing obstacles. The current findings suggest that early dynamic balance training is important in the management of patients with PD. ? 2017, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.",Balance; Gait analysis; Obstacle-crossing; Parkinson’s disease,Balancing; Gait analysis; Patient monitoring; Center of pressure; Crossing pattern; Functional tasks; Group differences; Inclination angles; Neuromuscular impairments; Obstacle crossings; Parkinson; Disease control; adult; Article; biomechanics; body center of mass; body equilibrium; body height; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; falling; female; human; leg length; limb movement; lower limb; male; motion; outcome assessment; Parkinson disease; patient risk; range of motion; risk assessment; risk factor; toe,2-s2.0-85049936167

It can be answered by using longitudinal follow-up data on repeated rounds of screen, namely periodic screen, but such kind of data are rather complicated and fraught with intractable statistical properties including correlated multistate outcomes, unobserved and incomplete (censoring or truncation) information, and imperfect measurements. We therefore developed a negative-binomial-family-based discrete-time stochastic process, taking sensitivity and specificity into account, to accommodate these thorny issues. The estimation of parameters was implemented with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We demonstrated how to apply this proposed negative-binomial-family-based model to the empirical data similar to the Finnish breast cancer screening program. ? 2016, The Author(s) 2016.",cancer screening; disease natural history; geometric model; Multistate model; negative binomial model,"adult; algorithm; Article; Bayes theorem; breast cancer; cancer screening; controlled study; female; Finland; follow up; generalized linear model; human; limit of quantitation; Markov chain; measurement accuracy; measurement error; measurement precision; Monte Carlo method; population research; probability; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; breast tumor; early cancer diagnosis; mass screening; middle aged; statistical model; Bayes Theorem; Breast Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Finland; Humans; Markov Chains; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stochastic Processes",2-s2.0-85049881536

As a consequence, obtaining the valuable medical data with minimal cost and impacts on hospital work comes as the first concern of researchers. Anesthesia plays a widely recognized role in surgeries, which attracts people to undertake relevant research. In this paper, a real-time physiological medical signal data acquisition system (PMSDA) for the multi-operating room applications is proposed with high universality of the hospital practical settings and research requirements. By utilizing a wireless communication approach, it provides an easily accessible network platform for collection of physiological medical signals such as photoplethysmogram (PPG), electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) during the surgery. In addition, the raw data is stored on a server for safe backup and further analysis of depth of anesthesia (DoA). Results show that the PMSDA exhibits robust, high quality performance and efficiently reduces costs compared to previously manual methods and allows seamless integration into hospital environment, independent of its routine work. Overall, it provides a pragmatic and flexible surgery-data acquisition system model with low impact and resource cost applicable to research in critical and practical medical circumstances. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Anesthesia; Data acquiring; Flexible; Multi-operating room; Physiological medical signal; Wireless network platform,"anesthesia; anesthesia level; Article; electrocardiography; electroencephalography; human; information processing; photoelectric plethysmography; wireless communication; anesthesiology; child; devices; operating room; physiologic monitoring; Taiwan; Anesthesia; Anesthesiology; Child; Electrocardiography; Electroencephalography; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Operating Rooms; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85049263403

Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants performed a force-matching task while standing on a mobile platform, and were instructed to focus their attention on either the postural task (posture-first strategy) or the force-matching task (posture-second strategy). Setting: University research laboratory. Participants: Individuals (N=16) with early-stage PD who had no clinically observed postural symptoms. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Dual-task change (DTC; percent change between single-task and dual-task performance) of posture error, posture approximate entropy (ApEn), force error, and reaction time (RT). Positive DTC values indicate higher postural error, posture ApEn, force error, and force RT during dual-task conditions compared with single-task conditions. Results: Compared with the posture-first strategy, the posture-second strategy was associated with smaller DTC of posture error and force error, and greater DTC of posture ApEn. In contrast, greater DTC of force RT was observed under the posture-second strategy. Conclusions: Contrary to typical recommendations, our results suggest that the posture-second strategy may be an effective dual-task strategy in patients with early-stage PD who have no clinically observed postural symptoms in order to reduce the negative effect of dual tasking on performance and facilitate postural automaticity. ? 2018 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine",Attention; Parkinson disease; Postural balance; Rehabilitation,adult; Article; attention; body position; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dual-task performance (test); female; force matching task; human; male; middle aged; Parkinson disease; posture approximate entropy; posture first strategy; posture second strategy; response time; standing; aged; body equilibrium; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; physiology; reaction time; task performance; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Postural Balance; Reaction Time; Task Performance and Analysis,2-s2.0-85046169279

Starting off with a discussion on the characteristics of AD/D and competing theories of their causes, their human and financial costs, and the increasing burden they place on all societies as populations age, the book examines in detail the range of policy issues they raise. These include funding policies, payment policy and regulatory functions, long-term services and support (LTCS), public health and prevention policies. The book analyses the big business surrounding AD/D and shows that the strong public fear of developing dementia heightens the likelihood of exploitation of vulnerable people looking for a technological fix. It examines both informal and formal caregivers and the heavy burden placed on families, primarily women, and recent policy attempts to strengthen LTCS. It also examines the latest evidence of potential risk-reduction and prevention strategies and the difficult issues surrounding advance directives, assisted suicide, and definitions of death that increasingly face policy makers.

The play is concerned with Christopher, a young black man who was arrested by the police because of his misconduct in public and is about to be released after his 28 days of observation in a hospital in London. However, the psychiatrist in charge, Bruce, intends to keep Christopher longer because he suspects him of being a paranoid schizophrenic. Bruce 's consultant, Robert, simply wants to dismiss Christopher into Care in the Community. Robert accuses Bruce of being ethnocentric and attributes Christopher's condition to cultural difference. Vehement debates thus ensue between the doctors as to the exact diagnosis of Christopher and treatment. Employing the sociology of mental illness as theoretical framework, the paper has two main parts: the first part will look at the manifest schizophrenic symptoms in Christopher and unravel the main causation of his mental disorder, namely, the everyday racism he encounters; the second part will show how institutional racism is revealed in Bruce's paternal attitude towards Christopher and in Robert's diagnostic theory of cultural difference. Through its exploration of how racism affects a black man's psyche, this paper will attempt to expound Penhall' s sociological account for high rates of schizophrenia among the African-Caribbean population in English society and present his call for recognition and understanding of the mental disease. ? 2018, Sun Yat-sen Journal of Humanities.

Methods: Women with their first diagnosis of ASCUS cytology were retrieved from the national cervical cancer screening database and linked to the national health insurance research database to identify the management of these women. The incidences of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and invasive cervical cancer (CIN3+) were calculated, and the hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the National Taiwan University Hospital and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02063152). Results: There were total 69,741 women included. Various management strategies including colposcopy, cervical biopsies and/or endocervical curettage, and cryotherapy, failed to reduce the risk of subsequent CIN3+ compared with repeat cervical smears. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure/conization significantly decreased risk of subsequent CIN3+ lesions (HR=0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.07-0.68; p=0.010). Women in their 40s-50s had an approximately 30% risk reduction compared to other age groups.

Conclusion: In women of first-time ASCUS cytology, a program of repeat cytology can be an acceptable clinical option in low-resource settings. Caution should be taken especially in women with remote cervical screening history more than 5 years. ? 2018.

However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effects of national policy on early diagnosis and later surgical incidence. The purpose of this national study is to estimate DDH incidence in the Taiwanese population through a new diagnosis definition and to examine whether a health promotion policy could reduce surgeries for DDH. Methods and results Six birth-year cohorts (2000–2005) were evaluated for DDH diagnosis and related surgeries using the database of the National Health Insurance Administration, which covers 99% of the population of Taiwan. Children with three or more sequential International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes (754.3x) in the outpatient claim file or DDH-related surgeries were studied. The outcome of hip screening was evaluated with the ratio of early diagnosis (0–6 months) to late diagnosis (1–5 years) and the incidence of major surgeries for DDH. DDH incidence was 1.54 per thousand live births (2,255/ 1,462,539). After a hip screening promotion policy was implemented in 2002, ratios of early/ late diagnosis increased from 1.06, 1.25, 1.38, and 1.5 to 1.75 for the years 2000 to 2005, respectively. Incidences of major surgery decreased from 0.41–0.47 per thousand before policy administration to 0.33–0.37 per thousand after policy administration. Discussion The DDH incidence of 1.54 per 1,000 in a geographically well-defined area offered epidemiological data for further studies in Asian populations. The results suggest that the health promotion policy is associated with an increase in early diagnosis and subsequently a decrease in surgeries for DDH. ? 2018 Chang et al.

Design In a crossover study, 30 stroke patients performed sit-to-stand test in seven situations in a random sequence: without a cane, three positions with a regular cane (parallel to the ankle, parallel to the 5th toe, and 10 cm in front of the 5th toe), and the same three positions with a quad cane. The peak vertical ground reaction force and maximum vertical cane support force during sit-to-stand were recorded. Results Using a cane significantly reduced the peak ground reaction force by 3% to 9% of body weight compared with that without a cane (P = 0.000-0.023). Different cane positions strongly influenced the maximum cane support force and peak ground reaction force. When the cane was closer to the ankle, the maximal cane support force increased by 6.7% to 8.6% of body weight, which resulted in a decrease in the peak ground reaction force. Conclusions Both types of cane reduced lower limbs' load during sit to stand. When the cane was closer to the trunk, the load on legs was lessened, whereas the load on the upper limb increased. Upper limb's load during sit to stand was greater when using quad cane than using regular cane. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Cane; Sit-to-stand; Stroke,"aged; body equilibrium; crossover procedure; female; human; male; middle aged; movement (physiology); physiology; physiotherapy; procedures; skeletal muscle; stroke rehabilitation; weight bearing; Aged; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; Stroke Rehabilitation; Weight-Bearing",2-s2.0-85048854212

Data Sources: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, were searched for studies published up to November 2016. Study Selection: We included all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, and observational studies investigating the effectiveness of IA steroid injection, distension, and physiotherapy in patients with frozen shoulder. Sixteen RCTs and 1 observational study were enrolled in meta-analysis. Data Extraction: Full texts were independently reviewed, and quality of RCTs was assessed with The Cochrane Collaboration's tool. The primary outcome was functional improvement; the secondary outcomes included pain reduction and external rotation (ER) improvement. Data Synthesis: In pairwise meta-analysis, pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of functional improvement and pain reduction revealed equal efficacy at 3 follow-up time points. With respect to ER improvement, distension has a superior effect compared with IA steroid injection in the short term [(2–4wk; SMD, ?.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], ?.68 to ?.04) and medium term (6–16wk; SMD, ?0.80; 95% CI, ?1.32 to ?0.29). The network meta-analysis indicated a better efficacy for distension than for IA steroid injection in ER improvement only in the medium term (6–16wk; SMD, ?0.70; 95% CI, ?1.19 to ?0.21). Conclusions: IA steroid injection was as effective as distension in shoulder function improvement, pain reduction, and increasing ER of the shoulder. Distension yielded better ER improvement in the medium term but to a minor extent in the long term. For patients with predominant ER limitation, early distension could be considered the primary choice of treatment. ? 2017 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine",Meta-analysis [publication type]; Rehabilitation,"hyaluronic acid; ketorolac; methylprednisolone; triamcinolone; steroid; abduction; comparative effectiveness; Constant Murley (score); Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (score); follow up; frozen shoulder; human; joint mobility; medical procedures; meta analysis; network meta-analysis; neuromuscular facilitation; physiotherapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); range of motion; Review; Short Form 36; shoulder distension; shoulder pain; Shoulder Pain and Disability Index; steroid therapy; systematic review; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; ultrasound diathermy; visual analog scale; bursitis; comparative effectiveness; complication; female; intraarticular drug administration; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiotherapy; shoulder; shoulder pain; treatment outcome; Bursitis; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Female; Humans; Injections, Intra-Articular; Male; Middle Aged; Network Meta-Analysis; Physical Therapy Modalities; Shoulder Joint; Shoulder Pain; Steroids; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85032199509

Method:: Data were searched from the databases of PubMed, CINAHL, EMbase, Medline, and Cochrane Library through 2 November 2017. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were (1) randomized control trails, quasi-experimental study, and retrospective observational studies and (2) used outcome indicators of DNR designation rates. The Effective Public Health Practice Project tool was used to assess the overall quality of the included studies. Result:: The 14 studies with a total of 7,180 participants were included in this review. There were 78.6% (11 of 14) studies that indicated that the interventions could improve the DNR designation rates. Three types of DNR interventions were identified in this review: palliative care unit service, palliative consultation services, and patient-physician communication program. The significant increases of the time between DNR designation and death only occurred in a patient-physician communication program. Significance of results:: The palliative care unit service provided a continuing care model to reduce unnecessary utilization of healthcare service. The palliative consultation service is a new care model to meet the needs of cancer patients in non-palliative care unit. The share decision-making communication program and physician's compassion attitudes facilitate to make DNR decision early. The individualized DNR program needs to be developed according to the needs of cancer patients. Copyright ?

To improve the effectiveness of biomonitoring, omic technologies have recently been applied to model the systemic changes in an organism. Membrane lipids create a dynamic cell structure based on the physiological state, which offers a distinct lipid profile to specifically detect environmental threats and assess the associated health risk. To demonstrate the potential of a lipidomic methodology for biomonitoring, the glycerophosphocholine (GPC) profiles of the coral Seriatopora caliendrum were observed during 3 days of Irgarol (0.1–2.0 μg/L) exposure. The lipid profile variations were modeled based on the Irgarol dose and the coral photoinhibition levels to develop an excellent quantitative model. The predominant changes correlated with the photoinhibition, decreasing the lyso-GPCs and GPCs with lower unsaturated chains and increasing GPCs with highly polyunsaturated chains, can be related to the consequence of blocking the photosynthetic electron flow based on the associated physiological roles. Other dose-specific lipid changes led to the partial exchange of PC(O-16:0/20:5) for PC(16,0/20:5) as a first-line response to counteract the membrane opening caused by Irgarol. Increased levels of the GPCs with 20:4 or 22:6 chains, which can promote mitochondrial functionality, confirmed an elevated respiration level in the coral exposed to Irgarol levels of >0.5 μg/L. Notably, plasmanylcholines with 20:4 or 22:6 chains and phosphatidylcholines with 22:6 or 22:5 chains, which can alter their membrane material properties to mitigate organelle pre-swelling and swelling in different ways, formed in the coral exposed to the 0.5 and 2.0 μg/L Irgarol levels. Such coral adaptations further predict the health risks associated with altered physiological conditions. In this study, the lipidomic methodology is demonstrated as a potential tool for environmental monitoring and assessment. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Algaecide; Coral reef; Environmental measurement; Oxidative stress; Photosynthesis; Respiration,"Biomarkers; Chains; Environmental impact assessments; Health risks; Lipids; Oxidative stress; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Plants (botany); Algaecide; Coral reef; Environmental measurements; Environmental Monitoring; Mitochondrial functionality; Physiological condition; Respiration; Seriatopora caliendrum; Risk assessment; 2 tert butylamino 4 cyclopropylamino 6 methylthio 1,3,5 triazine; glycerophosphorylcholine; phosphatidylcholine; polyunsaturated fatty acid; 2 tert butylamino 4 cyclopropylamino 6 methylthio 1,3,5 triazine; herbicide; triazine derivative; bioindicator; biomarker; coral reef; environmental assessment; environmental modeling; environmental monitoring; oxidative stress; pesticide; photosynthesis; respiration; Article; biological monitoring; cell membrane; cell organelle; cell swelling; controlled study; coral reef; correlational study; ecotoxicity; electron transport; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; lipid analysis; lipidomics; nonhuman; photoinhibition; photosynthesis; plant cell; priority journal; quantitative analysis; respiratory function; Seriatopora caliendrum; toxic concentration; toxicity testing; water pollution; animal; Anthozoa; drug effect; physiology; risk assessment; toxicity; water pollutant; Anthozoa; Seriatopora caliendrum; Animals; Anthozoa; Environmental Monitoring; Herbicides; Risk Assessment; Triazines; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2-s2.0-85041458652

In this study, we examined whether manual acupuncture (MA) at particular acupoints represses deoxycholic acid (DCA)-induced scratching behavior and microglial activation and compared these effects with those induced by another pruritogen, 5’-guanidinonaltrindole (GNTI, a kappa opioid receptor antagonist). MA at Hegu (LI4) and Quchi (LI11) acupoints significantly attenuated DCA-and GNTI-induced scratching, whereas no such effects were observed at the bilateral Zusanli acupoints (ST36). Interestingly, GNTI-induced scratching was reduced similarly by both MA and electroacupuncture (EA) at the LI4 and LI11 acupoints. MA at non-acupoints did not affect scratching behavior. Intraperitoneal injection of minocycline (a microglial inhibitor) reduced GNTI-and DCA-induced scratching behavior. In Western blot analysis, subcutaneous DCA injection to the back of the neck increased spinal cord expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) as compared with saline injection, while MA at LI4 and LI11 reduced these DCA-induced changes. Immunofluorescence confocal microcopy revealed that DCA-induced Iba1-positive cells with thicker processes emanated from the enlarged cell bodies, while this effect was attenuated by pretreatment with MA. It is concluded that microglia and TNF-α play important roles in the itching sensation and MA reduces DCA-induced scratching behavior by alleviating spinal microglial activation. MA may be an effective treatment for cholestatic pruritus. ?

Methods: This study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to evaluate the incidence and medical cost of TBI in Taiwan. Multi-level logistic regression models were used to assess the correlations between factors. Results: A total of 290,114 subjects were included from 2002 to 2011. The incidence of head injury was around 126.1 cases per 100,000 population per year. Around 1/3 of TBIs were caused by traffic accidents, and the mortality rate was lower than 4%. The incidences of TBI in males were significantly higher than those in females in all age groups. The average length of stay was 11.53 days. The average total medical cost was $USD 2809.24. The incidence of TBI was significantly higher in subjects aged 25 to 44 years (25.58%) and those aged 45 to 64 years (24.95%). Conclusion: The incidences of TBI vary in hospitals of different levels and in different regions. Acute subdural hematoma (SDH), traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) have higher severities than other TBIs, especially at the older ages. The male TBI subjects had both a higher incidence and a higher mortality rate than the female subjects in all age groups and TBI groups, with the exception of SAH. ? 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Epidemiology; Medical Expenditures; Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database; Traumatic brain injury,Brain; Epidemiology; Health; Hospitals; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Average length of stays; Intracranial hemorrhages; Medical expenditures; Mortality rate; Multi-level logistics; Research database; Subarachnoid hemorrhages; Traumatic Brain Injuries; Health insurance,2-s2.0-85055684440

Methods: Data came from the Taiwan Birth Cohort Study. A total of 18,845 children were included. Their parents completed four waves of interview surveys between 6 and 66 months of age, with a response rate of 88.7%. The independent variable was children's RSOC including RSOC in clinics, RSOC in hospitals, and no RSC when the children were 6 to 36-months old, and the dependent variable was medical utilization when the children were 66-months old. Results: A total of 63.5% of the children had a RSOC including 44.7% in clinics and 18.8% in hospitals. Children were less likely to have a RSOC with parents of lower education, foreign-born mothers, arid a household monthly income less than 30,000 NTD dollars. After controlling for children's gender, maternal nationality, socioeconomic characteristics, and health status, children with RSOC in hospital was significantly associated with higher likelihood of ES and HOSP (ES, OR=1.6; HOSP, OR? 1.8) as were those who did not have a RSC (ES, OR=1.2; HOSP. OR=!.4), compared with those who did not have a RSOC. Conclusions: Children with RSOC in clinics was significantly associated with lower likelihood of ES and HOSP.

Damage to the callosal motor fibers (CMFs) may affect motor recovery in patients with stroke. However, whether the severity of CMF impairment varies with lesion locations remains unclear. Objective. To investigate (1) whether CMF impairment occurs after stroke and whether the impairment varies with lesion locations and (2) the associations of CMF impairment and upper extremity (UE) motor impairment. Methods. Twenty-nine patients with lesions involving the corticospinal tract (CST) were categorized into 2 groups: lesions involving the CMFs (CMF group, n = 15), and lesions not involving the CMFs (non-CMF group, n = 14). Thirteen healthy adults served as the control group. Tract integrity, assessed by the mean generalized fractional anisotropy (mGFA) using diffusion spectrum imaging, of the CMFs and the CST above the internal capsule (CST ABOVE ) of the ipsilesional hemisphere were compared. Results. After accounting for the effect of lesion load on the CST, the CMF group exhibited a significantly lower mGFA of the CMFs than did the control and non- CMF groups (post hoc P =.005 and.001, respectively). No significant difference was observed between the non-CMF and control groups (post hoc P =.999). The CST and CMF impairment accounted for 56% of the variance of UE motor impairment in the CMF group (P =.007), whereas no significant association was observed in the non-CMF group (P =.570). Conclusions. CMF impairment after stroke depends on lesion locations and CMF integrity has an incremental contribution to the severity of UE motor impairment in the CMF group. ?

Methods The original Health Enhancement Lifestyle Profile (HELP) is a 56-item self-report questionnaire measuring various aspects of health-related lifestyles in older adults. The standard cultural-adaptation procedure was used for questionnaire translation and modification. A field test was conducted for culturally specific item selection, rating-scale analysis, and psychometric validation of the HELP-T in a sample of 274 community-dwelling older adults via classical test theory. Results The 59-item HELP-T is culturally adapted from the original 56-item HELP. The original 6-point rating scale was modified to a 3-point scale for easy use by Taiwanese older adults. The HELP-T had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82). The test-retest reliability for the total score was high (0.92), and moderate to high (range: 0.57–0.92) for subscales. The construct validity was supported by the significant correlations between each subscale and the total score (Spearman’s rho = 0.41–0.67, p < 0.0001) and by the ability of the scores to significantly discriminate between participants with different levels of self-rated health (p = 0.0001). Conclusions The HELP-T is a suitable clinical tool for assessing and monitoring lifestyle risk factors, establishing client-centered lifestyle intervention goals, and determining the outcomes of lifestyle interventions. ? 2018 Su et al.

We aimed to examine the risk of cancer among patients with NOAF in general population. A retrospective cohort of 5130 patients with NOAF was identified from a random sample of one million subjects between 2005 and 2010 from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The standard incidence ratio of incident cancer and hazard ratios were calculated by modeling cumulative incidence with competing risk of death. During a mean follow-up duration of 3.4 years, 330 patients developed cancer. The standard incidence ratio of all malignancies was 1.41 (95% confidence interval 1.26–1.57), suggesting a 41% increase in cancer risk compared with the general population. The risk of cancer was higher among men or the elderly with NOAF after adjusting for confounding factors and after considering the competing risk of death. The risk of cancer was not associated with CHA2DS2–VASc score (p = 0.32) among patients with NOAF. In conclusion, patients with NOAF were associated with a higher risk of cancer. Within this group, the risk of ischemic stroke (in terms of CHADS2-VASc score) did not reflect the risk of incident cancer. ? 2018 Hung et al.

Whether asymptomatic patients with intermediate pauses have increased future cardiovascular events remains unknown. We hypothesize that intermediate pause is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality. Methods and Results--We retrospectively analyzed 5291 patients who have pauses of < 3 seconds on 24-hour Holter monitoring. Patients with pauses of 2 to 3 seconds constitute the intermediate pause patients, who are further divided into daytime pause (8:00 AM-8:00 PM), nighttime pause (8:00 PM-8:00 AM), and daytime plus nighttime pause groups depending on the occurring time of the pauses. The rest of the patients (pause < 2 seconds) are the no pause group. The multivariate Cox hazards regression model was used to assess the hazard ratio for mortality (primary outcome) and adverse cardiovascular events (secondary outcome). There were 4859 (91.8%) patients in no pause, 248 (4.7%) in nighttime pause, 103 (1.9%) in daytime pause, and 81 (1.5%) in daytime plus nighttime pause groups. After a follow-up of 8.8±1.7 years' follow-up, 343 (6.5%) patients died. The risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular-cause hospitalization, pacemaker implantation, new-onset atrial fibrillation/heart failure, and transient ischemic attack, were higher in daytime pause and nighttime pause patients than those in the no pause group. Daytime pause (hazard ratio, 2.35; P=0.008) and daytime plus nighttime pause (hazard ratio, 2.26; P=0.016) patients have a higher mortality rate than that in nighttime pause. Conclusions--Patients with intermediate pause are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Intermediate pauses occurring at daytime have a higher mortality rate than that at nighttime during long-term follow-up. ? 2018 The Authors.",24-hour Holter monitoring; Intermediate pause; Mortality,"antiarrhythmic agent; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; atrioventricular block; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; Holter monitoring; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; observational study; pacemaker implantation; priority journal; retrospective study; sick sinus syndrome; sinus arrest; Taiwan; transient ischemic attack; bradycardia; circadian rhythm; clinical trial; comparative study; epidemiology; heart rate; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; pathophysiology; prognosis; risk assessment; risk factor; time factor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bradycardia; Circadian Rhythm; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85049126282

The QOLMD contains 45 items, which are divided into eight domains. However, the factor structure of the QOLMD has not been evaluated, which restricts the interpretations of the results of this scale. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factor structures (i.e., unidimensionality, eight-factor structure, and second-order model) of the QOLMD in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Two hundred thirty-eight outpatients with schizophrenia participated. We first conducted confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the unidimensionality of each domain. After the unidimensionality of the eight individual domains was supported, we examined the eight-factor structure and second-order model. Results: The results of unidimensionality showed sufficient model fit in all of the domains with the exception of the autonomy domain. A good model fit was confirmed for the autonomy domain after deleting two of the original items. The eight-factor structure for the 43-item QOLMD showed an acceptable model fit, although the second-order model showed poor model fit. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Our results supported the unidimensionality and eight-factor structure of the 43-item QOLMD. The sum score for each of the domains may be used to reflect its domain-specific function. We recommend using the 43-item QOLMD to capture the multiple domains of HRQOL. However, the second-order model showed an unsatisfactory model fit. Furthermore, caution is advised when interpreting overall HRQOL using the total score for the eight domains. ? 2018 Taiwan Nurses Association.",health-related quality of life; schizophrenia; validity,"adult; factor analysis; female; human; male; middle aged; outpatient; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; schizophrenia; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Adult; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outpatients; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Schizophrenia; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85048328381

The treatment modalities of ARDS include mechanical ventilation, corticosteroid, extracorporeal membranous oxygenation, inhaled nitrogen oxide, and the prone position. Among these, the prone position is supported by evidence showing significantly reduced mortality in patients that adopt this modality. Lying in the prone position reduces atelectatic lung volumes by recruitment of dependent parts and facilitates normal regulation of alveolar ventilation, giving better-matched ventilation perfusion and, thus, improved oxygenation. Lying in the prone position should be initiated as early as possible and may be implemented when there is limited improvement after 12-24 hours under mechanical ventilation and when the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is less than 150 mmHg. However, the prone position may not be appropriate for patients with increased intracranial pressure, hemodynamic instability, an open abdominal wound, or pregnancy. Prior to setting a patient in the prone position, fixation of tubings should be affirmed, and all tubings should be reexamined after each adjustment in position in order to ensure that they are free of twists and function well. In addition, caution should be given to the skin at pressure points to avoid pressure sores and foam dressings may be applied in advance for protection. This article summarizes the pathophysiology of ARDS, the principle of applying the prone position, and related indications, complications, and nursing care in order to give nurses more confidence in caring for patients using the prone position. ? 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Hitherto, there has been minimal study of the association between common childhood infections (e.g. enterovirus [EV]) and speech and language. The impetus for evaluating this association is provided by evidence linking inflammation to neurodevelopmental disorders. Herein we sought to determine whether an association exists between EV infection and subsequent diagnoses of speech and language impairments in a nationwide population-based sample in Taiwan. Methods: Our study acquired data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The sample was comprised of individuals under 18 years of age with newly diagnosed EV infection during the period from January 1998 to December 2011. 39669 eligible cases were compared to matched controls and assessed during the study period for incident cases of speech and language impairments. Cox regression analyses were applied, adjusting for sex, age and other physical and mental problems. Results: In the fully adjusted Cox regression model for hazard ratios, EV infection as positively associated with speech and language impairments (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06–1.22) after adjusting for age, sex and other confounds. Compared to the control group, the hazard ratio for speech and language impairments was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.03–1.21) amongst the group of EV infection without hospitalization, and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.10–1.45) amongst the group of EV infection with hospitalization. Conclusions: EV infection is temporally associated with incident speech and language impairments. Our findings herein provide rationale for educating families that EV infection may be associated with subsequent speech and language problems in susceptible individuals and that monitoring for such a presentation would be warranted. What this paper adds?: Speech and language impairments associated with central nervous system infections have been reported in the literature. EV are medically important human pathogens and associated with select neuropsychiatric diseases. Notwithstanding, relatively few reports have mentioned the effects of EV infection on speech and language problems. Our study used a nationwide longitudinal dataset and identified that children with EV infection have a greater risk for speech and language impairments as compared with control group. Infected children combined other comorbidities or risk factors might have greater possibility to develop speech problems. Clinicians should be vigilant for the onset of language developmental abnormalities of preschool children with EV infection. ? 2018",Enterovirus infection; Speech and language impairments; Taiwan national health insurance,"adolescent; adult; Article; attention deficit disorder; autism; cerebral palsy; child; controlled study; disease association; Enterovirus infection; female; hearing impairment; hospitalization; human; intellectual impairment; language disability; major clinical study; male; newborn disease; otitis media; outcome assessment; premature labor; small for date infant; speech disorder; Taiwan; traumatic brain injury; Coxsackie virus infection; developmental language disorder; Echovirus infection; enteritis; Enterovirus infection; hand foot and mouth disease; herpangina; incidence; infant; preschool child; proportional hazards model; virology; virus meningitis; Child; Child, Preschool; Coxsackievirus Infections; Echovirus Infections; Enteritis; Enterovirus Infections; Female; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Herpangina; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Language Development Disorders; Male; Meningitis, Viral; Proportional Hazards Models; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85046355223

Therefore, there is an urgent demand to find alternative or complementary approaches to deal with depression. Gastrodia elata Blume (GE) is not only a traditional Chinese medicine but also a food material that has been widely used in treating numerous neurological disorders in East Asia, including migraine, seizure, and mood disorders. In the present review article, we summarized the antidepressant-like effects of GE that have been reported in animal studies and elucidate its cellular mechanisms. Recent Findings: GE and its active compounds, gastrodin, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, vanillin, and their derivatives have recently been reported to have intensive antidepressant-like effects in several animal models of depression, such as the forced swim test, the tail suspension test, and the chronic mild stress. The molecular mechanisms of GE-induced antidepressant-like effect are likely through regulation of neurotransmitters, antioxidation, antiinflammation, modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, neurotrophic effects, regulation of stem cell, and enhancement of neuroplasticity and neuroprotection. Summary: GE and its bioactive components have been shown to possess antidepressant-like effects in several well-conducted animal studies. Additionally, GE has been applied to manipulate mood disorders in Chinese medicine for many years. However, more accurate and specific initial targeting of the mechanism of action of GE, as well as the application of clinical trials, are warranted and deserve further investigation. ? 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",4-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol; Depression; Gastrodia elata Blume; Gastrodin; Vanillin,antioxidant; brain derived neurotrophic factor; Chinese drug; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; cyclooxygenase 2; Gastrodia elata blume extract; gastrodin; neuroprotective agent; neurotransmitter; plant extract; protein Bax; unclassified drug; vanillin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antidepressant activity; Chinese medicine; chronic stress; controlled study; depression; down regulation; forced swim test; Gastrodia elata; human; human cell; inflammation; migraine; mood disorder; nerve cell plasticity; neuropharmacology; neuroprotection; nonhuman; phytochemistry; priority journal; rat; Review; seizure; tail suspension test; upregulation,2-s2.0-85045345545

Materials and Methods: This open-label randomized trial included 38 HRLPC patients who received TGC between July 2011 and March 2013. Within 4 weeks after TGC, subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the 12-month adjuvant ADT or non-adjuvant ADT group. The primary outcome was biochemical failure measured by the Phoenix definition. Adverse events were measured at month 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12. In addition, a cohort of 145 HRLPC patients was selected retrospectively for outcome validation. Results: The adjuvant ADT and non-adjuvant ADT groups did't differ in peri-operative characters, such as age, preoperative PSA, tumor stages, Gleason score, prostate size and cryoprobe number. Four patients with adjuvant ADT withdrew from this trial for personal reasons (N = 2), elevated liver function (N = 1) and poorly controlled hyperglycemia (N = 1). In contrast, none in non-adjuvant ADT group experienced adverse events. Biochemical failures were identified in 5 (26%) patients in each group during a median follow-up duration of 45 months. The median times to biochemical failure were 25 and 5.5 months for adjuvant ADT and non-adjuvant ADT groups, respectively. Biochemical-failure survival curves converged 24 months after TGC. Univariable and multivariable analyses revealed adjuvant ADT was not associated with biochemical recurrences in the validation cohort. Conclusions: Adjuvant ADT does not reduce biochemical failure for HRPLC patients undergoing TGC. It should be further confirmed by a larger cohort. ? 2018",Complication; Cryosurgery; Cryotherapy; Hormone therapy; Prostate tumor,"gonadorelin agonist; prostate specific antigen; antiandrogen; adult; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; biochemical recurrence; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; cryoablation; follow up; Gleason score; high risk patient; human; hyperglycemia; liver dysfunction; male; outcome assessment; patient safety; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostate size; randomized controlled trial; retrospective study; survival rate; survival time; total gland cryoablation; adjuvant chemotherapy; blood; cryosurgery; middle aged; prostate tumor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Androgen Antagonists; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Cryosurgery; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85045100433

Results: By studying the heterozygous knockout of Lmbrd1 (Lmbrd1 +/? ), we discovered that lack of Lmbrd1 not only resulted in the increase of cardiac-glucose uptake, pathological consequences were also observed. Here, we have distinguished that Lmbrd1 +/? is sufficient in causing cardiac diseases through a pathway independent of the recessive vitamin B 12 cblF cobalamin transport defect. Lmbrd1 +/? mice exhibited an increase in myocardial glucose uptake and insulin receptor signaling that is insensitive to the administration of additional insulin. Pathological symptoms such as cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular tissue fibrosis, along with the increase of heart rate and cardiac muscle contractility were observed. As Lmbrd1 +/? mice aged, the decrease in ejection fraction and fraction shortening showed signs of ventricular function deterioration. Conclusion: The results suggested that Lmbrd1 gene not only plays a significant role in mediating the energy homeostasis in cardiac tissue, it may also be a key factor in the regulation of cardiac function in mice. ? 2017",Cardiac hypertrophy; Disease animal model; Gene knockout; Human LMBRD1 gene; LMBD1 protein; Mouse Lmbrd1 gene,"alpha smooth muscle actin; cyanocobalamin; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; glucose; insulin; insulin receptor; lactate dehydrogenase; lmbd1 protein; lmbrd1 protein; membrane protein; myosin heavy chain; unclassified drug; wortmannin; insulin receptor; Lmbrd1 protein, mouse; nucleocytoplasmic transport protein; aged; allele; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cyanocobalamin deficiency; deterioration; echocardiography; electrocardiogram; gene knockout; glucose transport; heart function; heart muscle contractility; heart rate; heart tissue; heart ventricle function; heart ventricle hypertrophy; heterozygote; immunohistochemistry; insulin blood level; insulin tolerance test; male; micro positron emission tomography; mouse; nonhuman; positron emission tomography; signal transduction; systolic dysfunction; allele; animal; cardiac muscle cell; cardiomegaly; diagnostic imaging; disease model; genetics; knockout mouse; metabolism; Alleles; Animals; Cardiomegaly; Disease Models, Animal; Echocardiography; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Myocytes, Cardiac; Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins; Positron-Emission Tomography; Receptor, Insulin; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85019612451

In contrast to conventional APR, extralevator APR is characterized by that the dissection of levators is performed close to their attachment on the lateral pelvic sidewall, thus making the resected anorectal specimen cylindrical rather than with a waist in shape. Technically, extralevator APR would seem to be probably more effective in reducing the positivity of circumferential resection margin and intraoperative rectal perforation but is associated with the disadvantage of more extensive tissue removal from around the anorectum, which leaves a large cavity to close. To date, systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing extralevator APR with conventional APR were inconclusive. In this chapter, we present the knack and pitfall in performing the extralevator APR. In our view, although the evidences for the oncologic superiority of extralevator APR are still weak, it does benefit for some carefully selected patients with locally invasive diseases. ?

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 503 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. Patients were classified as HVD if visceral metastases were present and/or ?4 bone lesions with ?1 lesion beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival were investigated based on the disease burden. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the prognostic factors. Results: About 50.7% patients were classified as low-volume disease (LVD) and 49.3% were HVD at diagnosis. The medians of OS and cancer-specific survival were 64 and 116 months, respectively, for patients with LVD and 26 and 46 months, respectively, for men with HVD (both P < 0.001). Among patients with HVD, 76.6% had both high-volume bone disease (HBD) (?4 bone metastases) and appendicular bone involvement. There was no significant difference in both OS and cancer-specific survival between patients with visceral metastases and those with HBD combined with appendicular bone involvement. In the multivariable analysis, presence of Gleason score ?8, HBD, or HVD may predict poorer OS and cancer-specific survival outcomes (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: Asian patients with high-volume metastatic prostate cancer had a larger proportion of HBD with appendicular bone involvement, who had a comparably poor prognosis to those with visceral metastases. Patients with HBD or HVD had reduced survival outcomes. ? 2018 Medknow Publications.

Previous Western studies reported that they were associated with prostate cancer. However, none Taiwanese series report the subsequent cancer detection in ASAP and HGPIN patients. This study aimed to examine the results of repeated biopsies in the patients with ASAP and HGPIN. Materials and Methods: A total of 220 consecutive patients with ASAP and/or HGPIN at our institute between January 1990 and December 2010 were enrolled. Patient demographics and clinical information were extracted from the electronic database of our institute. Prostate biopsies were performed through transrectal ultrasound guidance. The patients who had concurrent prostate cancer (n = 51) and no repeated prostate biopsies (n = 103) were excluded from the study. Patients with biopsy pathologies reporting low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (n = 2) were also excluded. The remaining 64 patients were available for the final analysis. Results: Nearly, 38, 24, and 2 patients were initially diagnosed as ASAP, HGPIN, and ASAP along with HGPIN, respectively. After 10 years of follow-up, 36.8% patients in ASAP group developed prostate cancer, while 16.7% in HGPIN group and 100% in ASAP + HGPIN group. Median time to developing prostate cancer were 20 months in ASAP group, 31 months in HGPIN group, and 48 months in ASAP + HGPIN group. There was no significant difference of prostate cancer development between ASAP and HGPIN group (P = 0.291). Only older age, classified by 65 years, was significantly associated with a higher detection rate of prostate cancer. Conclusion: Patients with the initial diagnosis of ASAP or PIN has a high risk of developing prostate cancer. Therefore, those patients should be well announced and followed regularly. ? 2018 Medknow Publications.

In this study, a G-FET device paved with a supported lipid bilayer (referred to as SLB/G-FET) was first used to monitor the catalytic hydrolysis of the SLB by phospholipase D. With excellent detection sensitivity, this G-FET was also modified with a ganglioside GM1-enriched SLB (GM1-SLB/G-FET) to detect cholera toxin B. Finally, the GM1-SLB/G-FET was employed to monitor amyloid-beta 40 (Aβ40) aggregation. In the early nucleation stage of Aβ40 aggregation, while no fluorescence was detectable with traditional thioflavin T (ThT) assay, the prominent electrical signals probed by GM1-SLB/G-FET demonstrate that the G-FET detection is more sensitive than the ThT assay. The comprehensive kinetic information during the Aβ40 aggregation could be collected with a GM1-SLB/G-FET, especially covering the kinetics involved in the early stage of Aβ40 aggregation. These experimental results suggest that SLB/G-FETs hold great potential as a powerful biomimetic sensor for versatile investigations of membrane-related protein functions and interaction kinetics. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",amyloid-beta; biosensor; cholera toxin; field-effect transistor; ganglioside GM1; graphene; phospholipase D; supported lipid bilayer,Biomimetics; Biosensors; Cytology; Diseases; Field effect transistors; Glycoproteins; Graphene; Kinetics; Lipid bilayers; Proteins; Amyloid betas; Cholera toxin; ganglioside GM1; Phospholipase D; Supported lipid bilayers; Graphene transistors; ganglioside GM1; graphite; cell membrane; genetic procedures; lipid bilayer; Biosensing Techniques; Cell Membrane; G(M1) Ganglioside; Graphite; Lipid Bilayers,2-s2.0-85045691383

In addition, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize basal cells and stem cells since CNN has excellent performance on processing abundant data. Actually, the procedure of acquiring biomedical images is too complicated to collect, hence hand-crafted initialization is adopted to overcome the issue of the lack of training data according to prior knowledge or the suggestion from medical doctors. The experimental results show that the accuracy of hand-crafted initialization is higher than random distribution kernels and the convergence time is shorter also since a better initial condition may lead to better results in optimization theory. ? 2017 IEEE.",Cell segmentation algorithm; Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD); Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs); Hand-crafted initialization; Third Harmonic Generation (THG),Citrus fruits; Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Cytology; Data handling; Harmonic generation; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Site selection; Cell segmentation; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Convolutional neural network; Hand-crafted initialization; Intrinsic characteristics; Optimization theory; Random distribution; Third-harmonic generation microscopy; Stem cells,2-s2.0-85048526244

Methods: This retrospective study identified very elderly (> 85 years) patients, who were medically managed, with their first AMI from the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims database from 2007 to 2010. Patients were classified as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) group, aspirin only group and clopidogrel only group. Study outcomes included all-cause death, cardiovascular death and gastrointestinal bleeding. Treating DAPT group as the reference, we employed a multivariable Cox regression model to compare the relative risks of outcomes between 3 groups using pairwise comparison approach. Results: Among 1469 patients with incident ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 14%) or non-STEMI (86%), 390 patients were prescribed DAPT, 549 aspirin only, and 530 clopidogrel only. After 9 months of follow-up, aspirin only group had similar risks of all-cause death (adjusted HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.89, p = 0.41), cardiovascular death (adjusted HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.66-2.04, p = 0.60) and gastrointestinal bleeding (adjusted HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.77-3.57, p = 0.20) in comparison with DAPT group. Clopidogrel users had a higher risk of all-cause death (adjusted HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.00-2.25, p = 0.049) but similar risks of cardiovascular death and gastrointestinal bleeding when compared with DAPT. Conclusions: Among very elderly patients who were medically managed after AMI, single antiplatelet therapy had comparable protective effect as DAPT.

Autoantibodies to the acetylcholine receptor or, less frequently, to muscle-specific kinase, attack against the postsynaptic junctional proteins, resulting in fluctuating and variable weakness of muscles. Extraocular, levator palpebrae superioris, and orbicularis oculi muscles are particularly susceptible. The majority of patients with MG present with purely ocular symptoms including ptosis and diplopia initially. About half of these patients progress to generalized disease within 2 years. The prevalence of MG in Taiwan is 140 per million with male to female ratio of 0.7. The incidence rate is higher in the elderly. Several immune-related diseases such as lymphoid malignancy, diabetes, and thyroid diseases are associated with MG in the national population-based studies in Taiwan. Ice pack test, rest test, Tensilon/neostigmine test, circulating antibody measurement, and electrophysiological studies are useful diagnostic tools with variable sensitivity and specificity. For the patients with ocular MG, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are usually the first-line treatment. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressant could provide better disease control and may reduce the risk of conversion to generalized form although there is still some controversy. A thymectomy is also beneficial for ocular MG, especially in refractory cases. The correction of ptosis and strabismus surgery could improve the visual outcome but should be performed only in stable disease. ? 2018 Taiwan J Ophthalmol Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Acetylcholine receptor antibody; epidemiology; muscle-specific kinase antibody; ocular myasthenia gravis; thymectomy,,2-s2.0-85048330830

Materials and Methods Adult patients with advanced GI malignancies expressing GCC (H-score ? 10) received TAK-264 on day 1 of 3-week cycles as 30-minute intravenous infusions for up to 1 year or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety profile including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during cycle 1, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and characterize the PK profile of TAK-264. Results Twelve patients were enrolled and treated with 1.2 mg/kg (n=3), 1.5 mg/kg (n=3), or 1.8 mg/kg TAK-264 (n=6). Median number of treatment cycles received was two (range, 1 to 10). None of the patients experienced a DLT and the MTD was not determined. Ten patients (83%) experienced adverse events (AEs). The most common were neutropenia, anorexia, and nausea (each reported by four patients). Five patients (42%) experienced grade ? 3 AEs consisting of tumor hemorrhage and hypertension, ascites, adrenal insufficiency, neutropenia and asthenia. Serum exposure to TAK-264 increased proportionally with the dose and the median half-life was approximately 5.5-6.6 days. No patients experienced an objective response.

While few studies have explored social work practices with immigrant children and families in the child welfare field, very little is known about the experiences, perceptions, and practices of child welfare social workers who are immigrants themselves. This study applies the socioecological framework to identify strengths and challenges among immigrant social workers at different system levels. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with ethnic Chinese immigrant social workers who work or have worked in a family supportive service program in New York City. Findings from this study reveal that, at the individual level, immigrant social workers expressed the following advantages: 1) engaging families through emotional connections, 2) being a role model for families, 3) performing as a mediator between parents and children, and 4) being open-minded to different cultures. They also experienced challenges such as 1) unfamiliarity with Chinese subcultures, 2) power imbalance with clients, and 3) clients’ resistance. At the agency and community levels, immigrant social workers were likely to 1) provide culturally appropriate services and 2) become a cultural broker for colleagues within the agency and for other professionals in the larger community. Particularly, immigrant social workers were building a community with available and accessible services for diverse groups. But they encountered agency and community discrimination and/or exploitation and felt insecure about their jobs due to their immigration status.

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of SGA augmentation for overall and older patients with MDD inpatient history by assessing the change in 1-year hospitalization before and after SGA augmentation using the latest National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Methods: The samples were MDD patients (ICD-9 CM code: 296.2 and 296.3) who had psychiatric inpatient history. A total of 2602 MDD patients including 430 elderly subjects (age ? 60 years) who received SGA augmentation for 8 weeks between January 1998 and December 2012 were included in this 1-year mirror-image study. Outcome measures included number and length of psychiatric and all-cause hospitalizations. Results: After 8-week continuous SGA augmentation in the study subjects, the total number and days of psychiatric hospitalizations among overall patients reduced by 33.57% (p <.0001) and 18.24% (p <.0001), respectively; the total number and days of psychiatric hospitalizations among older patients (age ? 60) reduced by 44.52% (p <.0001) and 27.95% (p <.0001), respectively. Similarly, the total number and days of all-cause hospitalizations were significantly reduced. Limitations: MDD patients without inpatient history were not included due to data limitation; hence, the results may not be generalized to all patients. Conclusions: The results support that SGA may be effective in reducing psychiatric and all-cause hospitalization among overall and elderly MDD patients. More studies focusing on the safety of SGA among older MDD patients is warranted. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Depression; Geriatric/Aging/Elderly; Pharmacoepidemiology; Pharmacotherapy; Treatment resistance,"amisulpride; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; aripiprazole; atypical antipsychotic agent; central stimulant agent; chlorpromazine; lithium; olanzapine; paliperidone; quetiapine; risperidone; thyroid hormone; ziprasidone; zotepine; neuroleptic agent; adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; comorbidity; controlled study; drug megadose; dysthymia; electroconvulsive therapy; endocrine disease; female; hospital utilization; hospitalization; human; length of stay; major clinical study; major depression; male; medical history; outcome assessment; priority journal; Taiwan; evaluation study; factual database; health insurance; hospitalization; major depression; mental hospital; middle aged; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; trends; Aged; Antipsychotic Agents; Databases, Factual; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Hospitalization; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Insurance, Health; Male; Middle Aged; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85041569858

Early diagnosis, discovery and treatment are currently the optimal approach to reducing mortality rates and increasing the length of cancer patients' lives. Presently, mammography is the most effective screening method for early breast tumour detection. This paper proposes a decomposition and recompilation approach for the analysis of mammograms. The decomposition stage is based on multiband generation processes (MBGP), which are used to expand the dimensionality of a mammogram. Recompilation uses principal-component analysis (PCA) to generate different views of the mammogram based on the orthonormal basis vectors. Using Otsu's thresholding method, the abnormal parts of mammographic images can be easily detected. In experiments, the average Jaccard values determined using the Bayes, Markov, Windows, and proposed method were 0.253, 0.228, 0.201, and 0.441, respectively, for images from the mini–MIAS; averages were 0.132, 0.186, 0.158, and 0.261 for images from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography. Thus, the proposed method outperformed the other methods. The main contributions of the current paper are as follows: A novel methodology consisting of multiband generation processes and principal-component analysis for analyzing abnormities in mammograms is proposed. Two practical data sets were used to develop and evaluate the proposed approach.

The effectiveness of caregiver participation in hospital discharge planning has seldom been explored. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of caregiver participation in hospital discharge planning for clients with schizophrenia in reducing caregiver burden and improving health status. A quasi-experimental research design was adopted. The research location was in a psychiatric hospital in Northern Taiwan. The target population was caregivers of inpatients with schizophrenia. Nurses served as care coordinators and provided six-step hospital discharge planning services to caregivers. Structured questionnaires were employed to measure caregiver burden and health status. Intervention effect was tested using analysis of covariance in which outcome measure at pretest and selected demographic variables were treated as covariates. A total of 114 caregivers completed pretest and posttest evaluations, with 57 people in each group. A significant difference was found between the experimental and the control group regarding the caregiver burden and health status (P < 0.001) The caregiver burden and health status of the experimental group improved more significantly compared with the control group. The caregiver-involved discharge planning process developed in this study effectively reduced the burden placed on caregivers and improved their health status. Mental health nurses can serve as the main care coordinators for assessment, planning, referral and provision of the required services. Caregiver-involved hospital discharge planning should become part of the routine care process. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Caregiver burden; Discharge planning; Effectiveness research; Health status; Schizophrenia,"adult; caregiver; comparative effectiveness; female; health status; hospital discharge; hospital patient; human; male; mental hospital; middle aged; nursing; psychiatric nursing; psychology; questionnaire; schizophrenia; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Adult; Caregivers; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Female; Health Status; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Inpatients; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Discharge; Psychiatric Nursing; Schizophrenia; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85032990441

The hepatoprotective effects of red mold dioscorea (RMD) from Monascus purpureus NTU 568 were evaluated in vivo using a mouse model of chronic alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD). RESULTS: ALD mice were orally administered vehicle (ALD group) or vehicle plus 307.5, 615.0 or 1537.5 mg kg –1 (1 ×, 2 × and 5 ×) RMD for 5 weeks. RMD lowered serum leptin, hepatic total cholesterol, free fatty acid and hepatic triglyceride levels and increased serum adiponectin, hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase and antioxidant enzyme levels. Furthermore, ankaflavin (AK) and monascin (MS), metabolites of RMD fermented with M. purpureus 568, induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ expression and the concomitant suppression of ethanol-induced elevation of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1 and TG in HepG2 cells.

It is well-known that once we entrust our tasks to a cloud server, we may face several threats, such as privacy-infringement with regard to users attribute information; therefore, an appropriate privacy preserving mechanism is a must for constructing a secure cloud-based data management system (SCBDMS). To design a reliable SCBDMS with server-enforced revocation ability is a very challenging task even if the server is working under the honest-but-curious mode. In existing data management systems, there seldom provide privacy-preserving revocation service, especially when it is outsourced to a third party. In this work, with the aids of oblivious transfer and the newly proposed stateless lazy re-encryption (SLREN) mechanism, a SCBDMS, with secure, reliable and efficient server-enforced attribute revocation ability is built. Comparing with related works, our experimental results show that, in the newly constructed SCBDMS, the storage-requirement of the cloud server and the communication overheads between cloud server and systems users are largely reduced, due to the nature of late involvement of SLREN. ? 2017 IEEE.",Lazy re-encryption; Privacy preserving; Revocation,Cloud computing; Cryptography; Digital storage; Information management; Attribute information; Communication overheads; Data management system; Privacy infringement; Privacy preserving; Re-encryption; Revocation; Storage requirements; Data privacy,2-s2.0-85046758639

There have only been a few studies, however, investigating antepartum UTIs and mental stress. As such, the present study was conducted in order to investigate the association between antepartum UTIs and postpartum depression (PPD). Methods: We used data from the 2000-2013 National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. Data regarding a total of 55,087 singleton pregnancies was utilized, including data regarding 406 women who were newly diagnosed with PPD in the first 6 months postpartum. The associations between PPD and antepartum UTIs or other risk factors were examined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: The logistic regression analysis results indicated that PPD was associated with antepartum UTIs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] (1.07-1.65). Furthermore, the risk of PPD was higher in women with an upper antepartum UTI (aOR 2.97 (1.31, 6.77) than in those with a lower antepartum UTI (aOR 1.21 (1.02, 1.58)). Conclusions: Antepartum UTIs, particularly upper antepartum UTIs, are significantly associated with PPD. This information may encourage physicians to pay greater attention to the mental health of women who have suffered upper UTIs during their pregnancies. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Female; National health insurance research database; Postpartum depression; Urinary tract infection,"adult; age; Article; asthma; chronic kidney failure; chronic lung disease; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; epilepsy; female; heart disease; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; hypertension; income; intrauterine infection; labor onset; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; peptic ulcer; population research; postnatal depression; prematurity; risk factor; Taiwan; urinary tract infection; young adult; evaluation study; factual database; health insurance; odds ratio; postnatal depression; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; psychology; retrospective study; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; urinary tract infection; Adult; Databases, Factual; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Humans; Insurance, Health; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Urinary Tract Infections",2-s2.0-85044426243

During pregnancy, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation carries an increased risk of enlargement and rupture, which could lead to life-threatening hemothorax. This is the first case reporting successful thoracoscopic surgery for a pregnant woman with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation rupture-related hemothorax. Case presentation: We present a case of a 32-year-old pregnant Asian woman (31 weeks' gestation) whose pulmonary arteriovenous malformation ruptured, leading to right-sided spontaneous tension hemothorax. First, an emergency cesarean section for hypovolemic shock-related fetal distress was performed to save the baby. Immediately afterwards, video-assisted thoracic surgery with the single-incision approach allowed us to successfully obtain hemostasis and eradication of abnormal vasculature by conducting wedge resection of the pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. Conclusions: Emergency thoracoscopic surgery for a pregnant woman with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation rupture-related hemothorax is safe and feasible. In contrast to transcatheter arterial embolization, video-assisted thoracic surgery could simultaneously achieve hemostasis for prevention of mortality, eradication of abnormal vasculature, and removal of massive thrombi. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Emergent cesarean; Hemothorax; Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations; Thoracoscopy; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery,"paracetamol; adult; artery rupture; Article; Asian; case report; cesarean section; clinical article; echography; emergency surgery; female; fetus distress; fluid resuscitation; general anesthesia; gestational age; Glasgow coma scale; hematothorax; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; hypotension; hypovolemic shock; neurologic examination; postoperative pain; postoperative period; pregnant woman; priority journal; pulmonary arteriovenous fistula; scoring system; thoracostomy; thorax radiography; vein rupture; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; wedge resection; arteriovenous malformation; complication; hematothorax; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; procedures; rupture; treatment outcome; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Adult; Arteriovenous Malformations; Cesarean Section; Female; Hemothorax; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Rupture, Spontaneous; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85044110513

However, information of normal ranges of microcirculatory parameters in the healthy population remain limited. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the differences in microcirculatory parameters between healthy volunteers and patients with sepsis. METHODS: This observational study enrolled 45 healthy female and 45 healthy male volunteers, and divided them equally into three age groups: young (20-39 years), middle-age (40-59 years), and elderly (60-79 years). In addition, we enrolled 32 patients with sepsis. Images of sublingual microcirculation were obtained through sidestream dark field videomicroscopy and were analyzed using automated analysis software. Microcirculation parameters, namely the total small vessel density (TSVD), perfused small vessel density (PSVD), proportion of perfused vessel (PPV), microvascular flow index (MFI) score, and heterogeneity index (HI), were evaluated. One-to-one matching between the septic patients and the healthy volunteers was performed on the basis of demographic data including age and gender. RESULTS: The elderly group had lower MFI scores and a higher HI. Age was positively correlated with the HI (r = 0.38, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with the PPV and MFI scores (r = -0.26, p = 0.014 and r = -0.37, p < 0.001, respectively). TSVD was higher in female participants than in male participants. Body mass index (BMI) was negatively correlated with TSVD. In multivariate regression analysis, the independent factors associated with PPV are age and sex, however age is the only independent factor associated with MFI and HI. In patients with sepsis, TSVD (17.5 [3.3] vs. 21.7 [3.0]; p = 0.002), PSVD (15.0 [3.0] vs. 21.1 [2.5]; p < 0.001), and MFI score (2.0 [1.6-2.5] vs. 2.9 [2.5-3.0]; p < 0.001) were lower in the 28-day nonsurvivors than in the survivors. Matched comparison revealed that the TSVD (20.7 [3.7] vs. 25.2 [2.3]; p < 0.001), PSVD (19.8 [3.0] vs. 24.3 [2.7]; p < 0.001), and MFI score (2.7 [2.4-3.0] vs. 3.0 [2.7-3.0]; p = 0.019) were lower in the patients with sepsis than in the healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Age and sex were correlated with microcirculatory parameters of the healthy volunteers. In the patients with sepsis, microcirculatory dysfunction was more severe in the 28-day nonsurvivor group than in the 28-day survivor group. Furthermore, the patients with sepsis exhibited significantly lower TSVD, PSVD, and MFI scores than the healthy volunteers.",microcirculation; sepsis; shock,adult; aged; body mass; comparative study; female; human; male; microcirculation; middle aged; normal human; pathophysiology; physiology; sepsis; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Microcirculation; Middle Aged; Sepsis,2-s2.0-85063713448

Therefore, we first proposed a method to reduce the time needed for administering a sustained attention test (the Computerized Digit Vigilance Test, C-DVT). The method was to retrieve 5 segments from different trial positions of the original C-DVT testing. Then we compared the concurrent validity, convergent validity, and random measurement error of the examinees’ performance on these segments to find the segment with better psychometric properties. The 5 segments were as follows: the first 50% of testing, the 21st~50th percentile of testing, the first 60% of testing, the 31st~60th percentile of testing, and the 36th~65th percentile of testing. Then we compared the validities and random measurement error of the examinees’ performance on these segments. Ninety patients with stroke participated in the validity study, and 44 of them participated in the random measurement error study. The patients’ scores on the 5 segments were highly correlated with those of the C-DVT (Pearson’s r 0.98), indicating excellent concurrent validity. The patients’ scores on the 5 segments were moderately correlated with those of the Tablet-based Symbol Digit Modalities Test (Pearson’s r = -0.51~-0.48), indicating sufficient convergent validity. The amounts of random measurement error (percent standard error of measurement) were all limited: 5.1% for the C-DVT, 6.6% for the first 50% of testing, 6.0% for the 21st~50th percentile of testing, 6.1% for the first 60% of testing, 6.0% for the 31st~ 60th percentile of testing, and 6.1% for the 36th~65th percentile of testing. The patients needed on average 3~4 minutes to complete all the aforementioned testing. The patients’ scores on the 5 segments showed excellent concurrent validity, sufficient convergent validity, and limited amounts of random measurement error in patients with stroke. We suggest the 31st~60th percentile of testing segment for users because it had the lowest amount of random measurement error and can reduce the time needed for formal testing by about 40%. ? 2018 Lin et al.

To investigate reliability and validity, a subset of the 300 healthy participants was randomly selected to receive a second TOENST (n = 30) or conventional WM tests (n = 42). The split-half reliability of the TOENST ranged from 0.69 to 0.95, and its test–retest reliability was 0.75.

Objectives: To identify the prevailing ethical dilemmas among terminal care physicians 15 years after the Natural Death Act was enacted in Taiwan. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional survey from April 2014 to February 2015 using the clustering sampling method and a well-structured questionnaire. Targeted participants included physicians at oncology and related wards or palliative care units where terminal cancer care may be provided in Taiwan. Results: Among the 500 physicians surveyed, 383 responded (response rate 76.6%) and 346 valid questionnaires were included in the final analysis (effective response rate 69.2%). The most frequently identified ethical dilemma was “place of care,” followed by “use of antimicrobial agents” and “artificial nutrition and hydration.” The dilemma of “truth telling,” which ranked first in the 2005–2006 survey, now ranked at the fourth place. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender and knowledge of palliative care were negatively correlated with the extent of dilemmas regarding issues of “life and death.” Conclusion: The prevailing ethical dilemmas have changed in Taiwan 15 years after the enactment of the Natural Death Act, supporting that some previous strategies had worked. Our results suggest that education on the core values of palliative care, improvement of community-based hospice care program, and creating treatment guidelines with prognostication may resolve the current dilemmas. This type of survey should be adapted by individual countries to guide policy decisions on end-of-life care. ? 2017 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine",Ethical dilemmas; Natural Death Act; terminal cancer,antiinfective agent; adult; Article; cancer palliative therapy; cross-sectional study; drug use; female; follow up; human; hydration; knowledge; law; living will; major clinical study; male; medical ethics; nutrition; physician; Taiwan; terminal care; ethics; health personnel attitude; legislation and jurisprudence; neoplasm; psychology; terminal care; trends; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Physicians; Taiwan; Terminal Care,2-s2.0-85039997281

The management and prognosis of iatrogenic CCF during CAO recanalization have never been well described and discussed in the literature. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis for CAO recanalization attempts in National Taiwan University Hospital and affiliated hospitals. Incidence and presentation, demographic and angiographic variables, and clinical follow-up of the development of iatrogenic CCF were carefully reviewed. Results: A total of 138 consecutive de novo CAO endovascular recanalization attempts were reviewed. The technical success rate was 61.6% (85/138). Complication rate, including death, stroke, and intracranial or sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (ICH or SAH) was 4.3% (6/138). CCF developed in 11 patients (8.0%), and none resulted in death, stroke, or ICH/SAH within 30 days. Female gender and distal carotid artery reconstitution at communicating or ophthalmic segments were associated with development of CCF.

Early diagnosis of DRESS is crucial for administering timely treatment; however, prompt diagnosis based on its early presentation can be quite problematic due to its clinical resemblance to common maculopapular eruptions (MPE). Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patient data from September 2010 to June 2016 was conducted to compare the clinical presentations of DRESS and MPE validated by the RegiSCAR scoring system. The demographic data, clinical presentations, and histopathological patterns were reviewed. Results: Fifty-eight patients with DRESS and 29 patients with MPE were included. The mean age at diagnosis of DRESS was 47 years (range: 2–82 years), and female patients predominated by a ratio of 2.2:1. The three most common culprit medications for DRESS were allopurinol, sulfasalazine, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The most significant differences between the DRESS and MPE groups were the presence of fever, peripheral blood eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytosis, characteristic skin lesions, abnormal liver functions, and prolonged resolution of skin lesions for more than 15 days in the DRESS patients. The most common histologic features in the DRESS patients were coexistent eczematous, interface dermatitis, and vascular damage patterns, or interface dermatitis alone. The concurrence of fever, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and abnormal liver function within three days of visiting a medical facility were more common in cases of DRESS than of MPE (24.1% vs. 0%, P = 0.004). Conclusion: Although DRESS and MPE look similar, especially in the early stage of DRESS, the concurrence of fever, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and abnormal liver functions within three days of visiting a medical facility might aid in the early diagnosis of DRESS. ? 2017",Abnormal liver function; Atypical lymphocytosis; Culprit medication; Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS); Maculopapular eruption (MPE),allopurinol; cotrimoxazole; dapsone; phenytoin; salazosulfapyridine; adult; Article; blood vessel injury; body surface; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comparative study; dermatitis; DRESS syndrome; eosinophilia; erythroderma; face edema; female; fever; histopathology; human; human tissue; liver function; lymphocytosis; maculopapular rash; major clinical study; male; papule; purpuric rash; retrospective study; skin biopsy; skin defect,2-s2.0-85029654453

However, the clinical application focusing on the elderly population is scanty. Methods: Consecutive procedures for EUS-FNA diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms at a tertiary referral center from March 2014 to December 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. The procedures were divided into two groups according to their age, the control group consisted of patients ?60 years old and the elderly groups consisted of patients >60 years old. The primary outcome is the accuracy of the diagnosis in the two groups. The secondary outcome is the safety during the procedure. Results: A total of 28 EUS-FNA procedures were performed. The mean age of the control group was 48.7 years (n = 14) versus 70.2 years (n = 14) for the elderly cohort. Diagnostic accuracy of the EUS-FNA procedure in detecting malignant (true positive) and benign (true negative) lesions were higher in the control group (nonelderly: 85.7% vs. elderly: 50%; P = 0.046). There were two mild acute pancreatitis associated to the EUS-FNA procedures in the control group. Conclusion: Although EUS-FNA is safe and well tolerated in the elderly patients, our study showed a lower EUS-FNA diagnosis accuracy in this group.

We used occupational asbestos-related diseases (OARDs) as an example to explore the opinions of occupational health physicians (OHPs), who play important roles in the OHE system, regarding the necessity, feasibility, and potential impact of post-exposure OHEs involving asbestos-exposed workers. Methods: Fifteen OHPs were interviewed individually during the period from January to August 2017, with questions on the following two themes: (1) opinions about the current OHE system for asbestos-exposed workers; and (2) opinions on the establishment of post-exposure OHEs for asbestos-exposed workers. Results: All of the interviewees agreed that the current OHE system fails to detect OARDs, thus reforms are needed; however, the interviewees had concerns regarding the establishment of a post-exposure OHE system, which were summarized in the following 5 dimensions: (1) problems of identifying asbestos-exposed workers; (2) difficulties in verifying asbestos exposure; (3) uncertainty in choosing a suitable screening tool and in ensuring qualified personnel; (4) lack of financial resources and administrative support; and (5) problems of moral hazards. Conclusions: All of the interviewed OHPs agreed that the establishment of a post-exposure OHE system is needed, not just for asbestos-exposed workers, but for workers exposed to other types of hazardous substances with long disease latencies. To design the system and its implementation procedures, more discussions are needed, especially with respect to the aforementioned issues. ? 2018 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

The purposes of the study were (1) to develop a marker-based scapular locator for measuring scapular poses and (2) to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the locator in terms of intra-class correlation (ICC). About 22 healthy volunteers without shoulder pathologies participated in the current study. Each subject was tested separately by two examiners using the marker-based scapular locator while performing static shoulder flexion at 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100° and 120° in the sagittal plane. The reliability models, ICC(2;k) and ICC(3;k), were used to analyze the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability for scapular rotation and translation. Good to excellent intra-user reliability for both examiners was found for the scapular rotations (range: 0.81-0.97) and displacements (range: 0.88-0.99) for different shoulder flexion conditions. Excellent inter-rater reliability was found for scapular rotations (range: 0.92-0.99) and translations (range: 0.92-0.99) for all conditions. The results showed the high intra-And inter-examiner reliabilities for scapular rotations and translation using the marker-based scapular locator. The developed locator will be helpful for future clinical research of the shoulder complex. ? 2018 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte Ltd.

In this study, the functional insole was composed of a forefoot wedge and a medial arch support. Twelve healthy young adults (six males and six females) participated. Each subject wore sneakers with and without functional insole and stood as still as possible on a force plate with feet together, arms by side and head facing ahead for 60 s, while eyes open and eyes closed, respectively. The functional insole was applied in the random sequence of no insole, wearing insole with a medial arch and a four-degree forefoot wedge, as well as wearing insole with a medial arch and an eight-degree forefoot wedge. The sway areas as well as the maximal excursions of the center of pressure (COP) in anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions were used to evaluate the static postural stability. During stance with feet together and eyes closed, the sway area and maximal excursion of the COP in the AP direction were significantly decreased when wearing an eight-degree forefoot wedge functional insole. Since the reduced displacements of the COP indicated better postural control, it was suggested that the functional insole with an eight-degree forefoot wedge and a medial arch support might be beneficial to improve the postural stability in patients with impaired balance control, especially for whom having high risk of forward falls. ? 2018 World Scientific Publishing Co.

Fear of experiencing hypoglycemia may lead to lower quality of life, impaired glycemic control, and emotional distress, all of which impair the ability of patients to self-manage their diabetes effectively. Problem solving is central to diabetes self-management and may help patients achieve effective self-care of their disease. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of people with diabetes to avoid hypoglycemia and to explore associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used for the study. Data were collected using a demographic and disease characteristics datasheet, the Hypoglycemic Problem Solving Scale, and the Disease-Associated Negative Mood Scale. Results: Three hundred thirteen participants were recruited, with a mean age of 55.49 years. The average item score for the questions on hypoglycemic problem-solving ability was 2.43 (SD = 0.75). In comparing Hypoglycemic Problem Solving Scale subscales, participants scored highest on the problem orientation subscales and lowest on the problem-solving skills subscales. Multiple regression analysis revealed that being younger and unmarried and having a higher level of education, a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes, and a lower negative mood score were each significantly associated with greater problem-solving ability as regards hypoglycemic events. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: We suggest that patients with diabetes, especially those who are older or with lower levels of education, receive disease-related psychological interventions and that healthcare professionals teach problem-solving abilities in conjunction with hypoglycemia management.

This study is aimed at determining the impact of positive LN and the survival benefit of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) after CCRT plus surgery on esophageal cancer patients. Methods: Seventy patients with positive LN after neoadjuvant CCRT followed by esophagectomy were enrolled in the study. Patients were grouped into surgery alone following neoadjuvant CCRT (n = 41) and surgery plus PORT following neoadjuvant CCRT (n = 29) groups. The preoperative radiation dose was 36-45 Gy (mean 40 Gy) and the postoperative radiation dose was 20 Gy in 10 fractions. Results: The 5-year survival rate and mean survival was 40% and 58.6 ± 53.9 months for patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) compared with 8.3% and 22.7 ± 35.5 months, respectively, for non-pCR patients (p = 0.026). Local and distant recurrent patterns were similar for patients who did and did not receive PORT (p = 0.876). The mean survival did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (p = 0.889). Pathological complete response to CCRT was the only significant factor influencing survival (p = 0.026). Conclusions: Postoperative RT did not improve survival in patients with positive LN after CCRT followed by curative surgery for esophageal cancer. ? 2017 S.

Without antiviral therapies, a quarter of the HBV carriers will eventually succumb to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (Fattovich et al. 2004; Di Bisceglie 2009; Beasley 1988; Liaw et al. 1988). Active therapies have been developed, such as pegylated interferon and antiviral nucleos(t)ide analogs, in the last 20 years (Belloni et al. 2012; Papatheodoridis et al. 2002; Lau et al. 2005). Despite of an effective control of HBV replication by long-term NA treatments, the success of eliminating intrahepatic HBV or infected hepatocytes remains low (about 1-10% of treated patients). A search for novel, curative antiviral therapies has been actively taken up in many institutes. Practically, current NA therapies effectively eliminate extracellular virions, and so the next step will be to eliminate the intracellular viral RNAs, viral proteins, or eventually viral DNAs. The theme has become a more and more important medical task, especially after the advent of highly effective direct antiviral agents curing essentially hepatitis C. Therefore, there are many excellent reviews on the HBV life cycle or immunology that point out or summarize possible targets for future antiviral development (Lanford et al. 2013; Isogawa et al. 2005; Ma et al. 2015; Tang et al. 2016; Petersen et al. 2016). This chapter will skip these overlapping parts but only describe certain exploratory experiments toward novel targets ongoing. The main approach is to develop antiviral immunotherapies which can eradicate intrahepatic HBV DNAs or the HBV-infected hepatocytes in the near future. ? Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

Despite successful immunoprophylaxis program and advancement in antiviral therapies in the past decades, there are still an enormous load of afflicted people, mostly adults born before HBV universal vaccination program and children with hepatitis B immunization failure. Infected children, like adults, may experience hepatitis activity and chronic consequences without awareness and thus require screening, followed by close monitoring and proper treatment. Pregnant women with HBV infection are a special group that may need screening to identify as well as monitor disease activity and viral loads, not only during pregnancy but also postpartum, to implement proper management for either maternal or fetal health and/or for prevention of mother-to-infant transmission of HBV. Although there are approved antiviral therapies for adults with chronic hepatitis B, the best practice and long-term impacts in children, and pregnant women/offspring are still evolving. To eradicate global HBV endemics, preventive vaccination is the frontline program; screening, monitoring, antiviral therapy, and surveillance of complications, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, are the backup strategies which should include children and pregnant women as a whole. ?

To investigate the effects of practice variability combined with task-oriented electromyographic biofeedback (EMGBFB) on strength and balance in people with chronic stroke. Methods. Thirty-three participants were randomly assigned into the constant force EMGBFB tibialis anterior (TA) exercise (constant) group, the variable force EMGBFB tibialis anterior exercise (variable) group, or the upper extremity exercise without EMGBFB (control) group. Subjects in each group received 6 weekly sessions of exercise training (18 sessions, 40 minutes each). Motor outcomes were TA strength, balance (anteroposterior sway amplitude defined by limits of stability test in dynamic posturography), walking speed, Timed Up and Go test (TUGT), and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Data were measured at baseline, 1 day, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks posttraining. Results. TA strength increased significantly in both the constant and variable groups after training. Balance significantly improved only in the variable group. All participants showed improvements in walking speed, TUGT, and 6MWT. Conclusions. Task-oriented EMGBFB-assisted TA exercise training improved muscle strength in people with chronic stroke. Practicing to reach varying force levels during EMGBFB-assisted tibialis anterior exercises facilitated improvements in the ability to sway in the anteroposterior direction while standing. Our findings highlight the importance of task-oriented and motor learning principles while using the EMGBFB as an adjunct therapy in stroke rehabilitation.

Methods: Maximum likelihood estimation, non-linear regression, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation were used to estimate test sensitivity, mean sojourn time, and underlying breast cancer incidence in four time periods, covering 40 years of breast cancer screening in Nijmegen (1975–2012). Results: Maximum likelihood estimation generated an estimated test sensitivity of approximately 90% and a mean sojourn time around three years, while the estimates based on non-linear regression and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation were 80% and four years, respectively. All three methods estimated a rise in the underlying breast cancer incidence over time, with approximately one case more per 1000 women per year in the final period compared with the first period. Conclusions: The three methods showed a slightly higher mammographic sensitivity and a longer mean sojourn time in the last period, after the introduction of digital mammography. Estimates were more realistic for the more sophisticated methods, non-linear regression and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, while the simple closed form approximation of maximum likelihood estimation led to rather high estimates for sensitivity in the early periods. ?

Conventional treatments against the disease are designed to target viral proteins. However, the emergence of viral variants carrying drug-resistant mutations can outpace the development of pathogen-targeting antivirals. Diphyllin and bafilomycin are potent vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, their poor water solubility and potential off-target effect limit their clinical application. Methods: In this study, we report that nanoparticle encapsulation of diphyllin and bafilomycin improves the drugs’ anti-influenza applicability. Results: Using PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers, sub-200 nm diphyllin and bafilomycin nanoparticles were prepared, with encapsulation efficiency of 42% and 100%, respectively. The drug-loaded nanoparticles have sustained drug release kinetics beyond 72 hours and facilitate intracellular drug delivery to two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines. As compared to free drugs, the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited lower cytotoxicity and greater in vitro antiviral activity, improving the therapeutic index of diphyllin and bafilomycin by approximately 3 and 5-fold, respectively. In a mouse model of sublethal influenza challenge, treatment with diphyllin nanoparticles resulted in reduced body weight loss and viral titer in the lungs. In addition, following a lethal influenza viral challenge, diphyllin nanoparticle treatment conferred a survival advantage of 33%. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the potential of the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors for host-targeted treatment against influenza. ? 2018 Hu et al.",Bafilomycin; Diphyllin; Influenza virus; Nanoparticles; Vacuolar ATPase inhibitor,"bafilomycin; diprophylline; macrogol; nanoparticle; polyglactin; 1,3 benzodioxole derivative; antivirus agent; bafilomycin A; diprophylline; enzyme inhibitor; lignan; macrolide; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; viral protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiviral activity; Article; body weight loss; controlled study; disease severity; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug release; drug structure; drug therapeutic index; female; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; influenza; Influenza virus; mouse; mouse model; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; virus load; virus strain; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell line; chemistry; dog; drug effect; human; influenza; kinetics; metabolism; Orthomyxoviridae; orthomyxovirus infection; physiology; ultrastructure; virology; virus replication; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Benzodioxoles; Cell Line; Dogs; Drug Liberation; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Influenza, Human; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Kinetics; Lignans; Macrolides; Mice; Nanoparticles; Orthomyxoviridae; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases; Viral Proteins; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-85058838391

However, shoulder pain quality descriptors mostly remain unknown. Furthermore, sex-related differences considerably affect clinical pain experience. The aim of this study was to investigate pain quality descriptors and to compare sex-related differences in using pain descriptors among patients with shoulder pain. Materials and methods: A sample of 120 patients (41 males and 79 females) with shoulder pain was recruited from Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Shoulder pain quality descriptors were investigated using a 36-item pain quality list. Sex-related differences in the number and frequency of pain quality descriptors were compared using independent t-test and X test, respectively. 2 Results: Fifteen commonly used shoulder pain quality descriptors were identified. Among them, “sore” was the most frequently used, followed by “pulled”. Deep pain sensations (eg, sore, pulled, torsion, and taut) were relatively more predominant than superficial pain sensations (eg, pricking and lacerating). In terms of sex-related differences, female patients used more pain quality descriptors than the male patients (5.5 vs 3.7, P<0.001). The frequency of paroxysmal, dullness, and constriction-related pain quality descriptors, such as “shooting”, “faint”, “clicking”, and “squeezing”, were higher in females than in males (all P<0.05). Conclusion: The results provide commonly used shoulder pain quality descriptors that are useful for assessing shoulder pain and for developing a new shoulder pain assessment tool. Because the shoulder pain quality profiles differed between male and female participants, clinicians and researchers should consider sex-related differences in assessing and treating shoulder pain. ? 2018 Rau et al.",Culture; Measurement; Musculoskeletal pain; Pain assessment,adult; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; humeroscapular periarthritis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pain assessment; pain intensity; retrospective study; sex difference; shoulder pain; tendinitis; tenosynovitis,2-s2.0-85058798121

However, studies on these associations are limited. In this study, we investigated the incidence of DED among patients with asthma and its correlation with other allergic comorbidities. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. We compared the data of 41,229 patients with asthma with those of 164,916 sex- and age-matched non-asthma controls. We followed up the patient and control groups from 1998 to 2010, and compared the rate of DED in these two groups. We further analyzed the allergic comorbidities and asthma-related medication use among the patients with asthma to verify whether these factors were associated with DED. Results: The patients in the asthma group were more likely to have DED than were the controls (6.35% vs. 4.92%, p < 0.0001). In the asthma group, female had a higher risk of DED (odds ratio (OR) = 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.57–1.85]) than males did. After adjustment for sex, age, income, urbanization, and the other two allergic comorbidities, patients with allergic rhinitis (adjusted OR = 1.58, 95% CI [1.46–1.72]) and urticaria (adjusted OR = 1.25, 95% CI [1.12–1.38]) were more likely to have DED, but not patients with atopic dermatitis (adjusted OR = 1.17, 95% CI [0.98–1.40]). Patients with asthma who had prescriptions of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) (adjusted OR = 1.29, 95% CI [1.01–1.64]), oral antihistamines (adjusted OR = 2.02, 95% CI [1.84–2.21]), and inhaled corticosteroids (adjusted OR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.04–1.36]) exhibited association with DED. Discussion: Our findings reveal that patients with asthma—particularly females—were more likely to have DED, with comorbidities such as allergic rhinitis and urticaria, and prescriptions including LTRAs, antihistamines, and inhaled corticosteroids. The results suggest that in clinical practice, physicians should pay attention to DED, particularly in patients with a high risk of DED. ? 2018 Huang et al.",Allergic comorbidities; Allergy; Asthma; Dry eye disease; Immunology; NHIRD; Taiwan,antihistaminic agent; corticosteroid; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; adult; aged; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; dry eye; female; human; ICD-9-CM; juvenile; major clinical study; male; population research; retrospective study; tear film; urticaria,2-s2.0-85058333491

The parent materials of serpentine soils are characterized by much higher contents of elements such as Mg, Fe, Cr, Ni, Co, and Mn, and thus the derived soils display potentially ecological or environmental risk due to high levels of geogenic heavy metals, low concentrations of P and K, low Ca/Mg ratios, unique flora, and unstable landscape. Serpentine soils can be produced by ultramafics alone and also by hydrothermally altered ultramafics in the presence of serpentines, but they are abundant in ophiolite belts along tectonic plate margins. To sustain natural resources such as serpentine soils, we need a better understanding for the impact of serpentine soils on (1) the pedosphere and rhizosphere, (2) ecology and restoration, (3) biogeochemical cycling of elements, (4) environmental quality, crop quality, food safety, and human health, and (5) phyto-accumulation and agromining of heavy metals (i.e., nickel) worldwide. Hence, the purpose of this book is to study the biogeochemical characteristics of serpentine soils. In the beginning, the authors introduce the basic knowledge of these soils including pedogenesis, mineral weathering, morphology, and classification. Moreover, bioavailability, plant uptake, and human health risk were discussed for the enriched heavy metals in serpentine soil. Finally, applications of serpentine soil in the environment were examined for research needs in the future. ? 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. Objectives: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. Materials and methods: A dengue–mosquito–human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector–host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R0)–DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. Results: We showed that R0 and DALYs peaked at 25°C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267–379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%.

Patients and methods: Overall, 296 patients with ADHD (mean age: 9.5 years) already on IR-MPH treatment were enrolled. Upon enrollment, a flexible dose of OROS-MPH was administered, replacing IR-MPH. Patients were assessed at baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 8 using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham version IV scale (SNAP-IV) and the Clinical Global Impression for ADHD symptoms. The Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents assessed social functions, and the Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and Family Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection, and Resolve evaluated parental and family functions. Results: Switching from IR-MPH to OROS-MPH yielded significant improvements in all ADHD symptoms, as rated by parents, teachers (SNAP-IV), and study investigators (Clinical Global Impression). CHQ scores and all Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents subscores except spare time scores improved significantly. Patients with poor IR-MPH adherence had greater improvements in teacher-rated SNAP-IV and mothers’ mental health (CHQ) after switching. Conclusion: Switching from IR-MPH to OROS-MPH improved patients’ behavioral ADHD symptoms and social adjustment, and mental health of patients’ mothers. This was most evident in patients who previously exhibited poor IR-MPH adherence. ? 2018 Chou et al.",ADHD; Central nervous system stimulant; Drug adherence; Family; Social adjustment,methylphenidate; abdominal pain; adolescent; Article; attention deficit disorder; child; Chinese Health Questionnaire; clinical effectiveness; Clinical Global Impression scale; controlled clinical trial; controlled drug release; controlled study; decreased appetite; dizziness; drowsiness; drug release; drug safety; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; family functioning; female; headache; human; immediate drug release; insomnia; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; multicenter study; nausea; osmotic controlled drug release; patient assessment; patient compliance; school child; scoring system; social adaptation; Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescent; social status; stomach pain; Swanson Nolan and Pelham version IV scale; treatment duration; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85057534040

We attempted to assess the effects of market competition on inpatient care quality of stroke patients in a retrospective study of the universal single-payer health insurance system in Taiwan. Methods: In this 11-year population-based study, we conducted a pooled time-series cross-sectional analysis with a fixed-effects model and the Hausman test approach by utilizing two nationwide datasets: the National Health Insurance Research Database and the National Hospital and Services Survey in Taiwan. Patients who were admitted to a hospital for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were enrolled. After excluding patients with a previous history of stroke and those with different types of stroke, 247 379 ischemic and 79 741 hemorrhagic stroke patients were included in our analysis. Four outcome indicators were applied: the in-hospital mortality rate, 30-day post-operative complication rate, 14-day re-admission rate and 30-day re-admission rate. Results: Market competition exerted a negative or negligible effect on the medical care quality of stroke patients. Compared to hospitals located in a highly competitive market, in-hospital mortality rates for hemorrhagic stroke patients were significantly lower in moderately ( = –0.05, P < 0.01) and less competitive markets ( = –0.05, P < 0.01). Conversely, the impact of market competition on the quality of care of ischemic stroke patients was insignificant. Conclusions: Simply fostering market competition might not achieve the objective of improving the quality of health care. Other health policy actions need to be contemplated. ?

However, the efficacy of long-term opioid analgesics is attenuated by tolerance and/or hyperalgesia after long-term use, preventing adequate pain relief under stable opioid dosages for chronic pain patients. Classical neuron-centered concepts about tolerance, such as internalization of opioid receptors, upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function, or downregulation of glutamate transporter activity, can only partially explain the phenomenon of tolerance. Recent evidence revealing glial activation and upregulation of inflammatory mediators in the rodent central nervous system has confirmed the pivotal role of neuroinflammation in neuropathic pain or opioid tolerance, or both. However, human evidence is still sparse. Based on our clinical practice, we conducted translational research by investigating the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine and chemokine profiles of opioid-tolerant patients after research ethic committee approval. CSF samples from opioid-tolerant patients and opioid-naive subjects were compared. We found CXCL1, CXCL12, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were significantly upregulated among the opioid-tolerant patients and positively correlated with the opioid dosage. We translated these findings back to lab animal experiment; after induction of tolerance by morphine infusion, the spinal cord expression of CXCL1, CXCL12, and LIF were all upregulated. Although CXCL1 and CXCL12 infusion alone did not affect baseline tail-flick latency, morphine analgesic efficacy dropped significantly after intrathecal infusion of CXCL1 and CXCL12. After establishing tolerance by intrathecal continuous infusion of morphine, tolerance development was accelerated by co-administration of CXCL1 and CXCL12. In parallel, the effect was attenuated by co-administration of CXCL1- or CXCL12-neutralizing antibody or concordant receptor antagonists. On the contrary, although chronic morphine administration still induced LIF upregulation in rat spinal cords, intrathecal injection of LIF potentiated the analgesic action of morphine and delayed the development of morphine tolerance. Upregulation of endogenously released LIF by long-term use of opioids might counterbalance the tolerance induction effects of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. CXCL1, CXCL12, and LIF are upregulated in both opioid-tolerant patients and rodents. The onset and extent of opioid tolerance were affected by modulating the intrathecal CXCL1/CXCR2, CXCL12/CXCR4, and LIF signaling and could be novel drug targets for the treatment of opioid tolerance. ? 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Chemokine; Cytokine; Neuroinflammation; Opioid tolerance; Translational research,"CXCL1 chemokine; CXCL1 protein, human; CXCL12 protein, human; leukemia inhibitory factor; LIF protein, human; narcotic analgesic agent; stromal cell derived factor 1; animal; drug effect; drug tolerance; human; inflammation; pathophysiology; physiology; rat; spinal cord; Analgesics, Opioid; Animals; Chemokine CXCL1; Chemokine CXCL12; Drug Tolerance; Humans; Inflammation; Leukemia Inhibitory Factor; Rats; Spinal Cord",2-s2.0-85054772813

Human milk feeding at hospital discharge may encourage breastfeeding at home. This study evaluated the incidence and predictive factors of human milk feeding of preterm infants at discharge. It included all preterm infants with gestational age of less than 37 weeks who were admitted to the Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taiwan from January to December 2010 who survived to discharge. Infants were classified into a human milk group or a formula milk group. Gestational age, birth weight, length of hospital stay, maternal age, maternal educational status, and morbidity of prematurity were compared between the groups. Of the 290 preterm infants, 153 (52.8%) were being fed human milk at hospital discharge. Compared with the formula milk group, the human milk group had lower birth weights, younger gestational age, higher rates of ventilator use, and longer hospital stays. These differences were not statistically significant for very low-birth-weight (birth weight of <1500 g) infants (n = 66). Multivariate analysis indicated that 2 factors, longer hospital stay and neonatal intensive care unit admission, were associated with human milk feeding at hospital discharge. These findings highlight the need for encouraging and helping all mothers, even those with relatively mature and healthy infants, to provide human milk for their infants.

Methods: From January 1996 to December 2013, we retrospectively collected the clinical data of 31 patients with pathologically confirmed RCC and IVC tumor thrombus. All patients received nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy. We examined the clinical outcomes, including cancer-specific survival, progression-free survival, and postoperative complications, during a 90-day period. The associated prognostic factors were also analyzed. This study is registered with the National Taiwan University Hospital Research Ethics Committee (number 201305059RINC). Results: The median follow-up period was 24 months. Of 20 patients with nonmetastatic disease, 15 developed metastases during the study period. The overall 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was 30.8% in the nonmetastatic group versus 12.5% in the metastatic group. The level of IVC thrombus (Levels I-II vs. Levels III-IV) was not significantly associated with the 5-year cancer-specific survival (P = 0.43). The Fuhrman grade and sarcomatoid type were statistically significant predictors of cancer-specific survival (Fuhrman Grades III-IV vs. Grades I-II: Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.11, P = 0.04; sarcomatoid type: HR = 0.136, P = 0.001).

This study was an attempt to investigate the differences in intravesical recurrence between transperitoneal HALNU (TP-HALNU) and RP-HALNU. Patients and Methods: From 1999 to 2011, a total of 197 patients with UTUC were enrolled. After excluding those with a previous history of bladder cancer, 170 patients were analyzed. Sixty-five of these underwent RP-HALNU, and 105 of these underwent TP-HALNU. The median follow-up periods were 39.2 and 46.2 months. Tumor location was divided into three groups: In the renal pelvis, in the ureter, and in both the renal pelvis and ureter. Results: There was no significant difference in the intravesical recurrence rate in relation to the different surgical approaches (P = 0.10), but tumor location in both the renal pelvis and ureter significantly increased the risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.11, P = 0.01). In addition, advanced T stage (HR = 9.63, P < 0.01) was the only significant risk factor related to death. Conclusions: In patients with UTUC, tumor location in both the renal pelvis and ureter determined higher susceptibility to intravesical recurrence. However, different surgical approaches to HALNU were not a significant risk factor for intravesical recurrence. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The patient had higher percentage of CD23+ B cells and CD23 expression level (86.5 % and MFI 371.9, respectively) during the onset of anaphylaxis. With the omalizumab treatment, both CD23+ B cells and CD23 expression level decreased gradually. The basal levels of CD23+ B cells and CD23 expression dropped to 25.1% and 72.6 MFI, respectively when the patient became recovered one year after the last treatment.

Currently, surgery is used as the main approach for the treatment of the early-stage ADCs. However, different histological subtypes of ADC classified by the IASLC/ATS/ERS system may potentially impact on the surgical management, which subsequently influence the prognosis of the surgery. Thus, preoperative determination of ADC subtypes is essential and highly desirable. Nevertheless, the histological subtypes of ADCs may be either unknown or incompletely determined by biopsy before the surgery. Alternatively, the histological subtypes of ADCs may be predicted from the pulmonary computed tomographic (CT) images. However, previous studies showed limitations on the prediction results due to the complex composition of ADC subtypes. One possible reason is the radiomic descriptors used to differentiate different subtypes could be very different. The conventional approaches based on the same set of descriptors to distinguish all subtypes are inherently infeasible. Another possible reason is the complex composition of multiple subtypes in a lung nodule may hinder the extraction of effective radiomic descriptors to characterize each subtype. To overcome these challenges, a competing round-robin prediction model was proposed to predict the histological subtypes of ADCs, which was composed of three key ideas, namely, pair-specific radiomic descriptors for differentiation of every pair of subtypes, inter-regional descriptors for characterization of complex composition of subtypes in a nodule, and a multi-level round-robin classifier. Based on 70 ADCs patients, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 86.3% in predicting five histological subtypes of adenocarcinomas. ? 2018 SPIE.",Heterogeneity; lung adenocarcinoma subtype; radiomic features; texture analysis,Biological organs; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Medical applications; Molecular imaging; Routers; Transplantation (surgical); Complex compositions; Computed tomographic; Conventional approach; Heterogeneity; lung adenocarcinoma subtype; Non small cell lung cancer; radiomic features; Texture analysis; Computerized tomography,2-s2.0-85049567855

With a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided strategy, we assessed the effectiveness of half-a-tablet EFV plus 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-infected Taiwanese who had achieved viral suppression with full-dose (600 mg) EFV. Methods: HIV-infected adults receiving EFV-containing regimens who had plasma mid-dose EFV concentration (C12) ?2.0 mg/L and had plasma HIV RNA load (PVL) <200 copies/mL were enrolled in this single-arm, open-label study by reducing EFV to half-a-tablet daily. The primary endpoint was PVL <50 copies/ml in an intention-to-treat (ITT) population at week 48. The secondary endpoints were the plasma EFV C12, the proportion of patients with plasma EFV C12 <1.0 mg/L, PVL <50 copies/ml at week 96 and week 144. Results: Between April 2013 and September 2016, 203 patients (93.6% male; median age, 39.0 years) were enrolled. The median EFV C12 before switch was 2.80 mg/L (interquartile range (IQR), 2.41–3.73), which decreased to 1.59 mg/L (IQR, 1.23–2.03) after switch with a reduction of 47.4% (IQR, 38.3–55.5%). In ITT analysis, 93.6%, 92.3% and 87.3% of the patients achieved PVL <50 copies/ml at weeks 48, 96 and 144, respectively. More than 70% of the patients reported alleviation of EFV-associated adverse effects following the switch.

The distribution of Chl-related compounds (CRCs) derived from dietary spinach was investigated in human blood. Eight healthy adults, aged from 21 to 61 year-old, consumed 1.2 kg of just-boiled fresh spinach after an 8-h overnight fast. Before and then 3 h after consuming the spinach, blood samples were taken from each participant. Freeze-dried blood samples were prepared, and 80% acetone was added for grinding. Eight peaks were found in the blood using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the main CRCs in the samples were pheophytin (Phe) and pheophorbide (Pho) derivates. Compared to a fasted state, markedly higher levels of blood CRCs were detected in all subjects, except that Pho metabolites were not found in two subjects. No significant differences were seen in most of the peaks between males and females; however, relatively higher CRCs levels were observed in females, particular of Pho derivates. In addition, the blood contained significantly higher levels of Phe in the 36~61-year-old group than in the 21~35-year-old group. These results suggest that the conversion of Chls to CRCs is a rapid process, and Chls obtained by ingestion can be absorbed by the human body. ? 2018 Academic Press.",Chlorophyll; High-performance liquid chromatography; Human bioavailability; Pheophorbide; Pheophytin; Pigments,,2-s2.0-85047663274

Sinus wall thickness and blood eosinophilia, which may represent the depth of inflammation in CRS, are associated with the need for revision surgery. We found that, when the thickness of the postero-lateral maxillary sinus wall is more than 3.03 mm, there is an increased probability for a need for revision surgery.

ANIMALS 9 African grey parrots with no detectable cardiovascular disease. PROCEDURES Each bird was anesthetized and underwent placement of an IV catheter in the left basilic vein and 16-slice CTA scanning (started at peak aortic enhancement) with each of 3 CMI protocols at ? 1-month intervals. Protocol 1 involved catheter flushing with saline (0.9% NaCl) solution and IV infusion of iopamidol (2 mL) followed by saline solution (0.2 mL; total infused volume, 5 mL). Protocol 2 involved IV infusion of iopamidol (2 mL) followed by saline solution (0.4 mL; total infused volume, 2.4 mL). Protocol 3 involved catheter flushing with saline solution and IV administration of iopamidol (2 mL; total infused volume, 4.8 mL). The diameters of 6 major arteries were measured by 2 observers, and intra- and interobserver agreement, time-enhancement variables, and patient factors affecting contrast medium enhancement were assessed. RESULTS Among the 3 CMI protocols, CTA-derived arterial diameters differed significantly. Measurements obtained with protocol 2 were significantly larger than those obtained with the other protocols. Uniformity of the time-enhancement variables differed among CMI protocols. Patient factors had nonsignificant effects on contrast medium enhancement. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Of the CMI protocols assessed, a 2-phase CMI protocol with a post-CMI saline solution flush was the most reliable for CTA-derived measurements of the major thoracic and abdominal arteries in African grey parrots.

The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of CTA and magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) for detection of cortical venous reflux (CVR) in intracranial DAVFs. Methods: The records of patients with angiography-confirmed intracranial DAVFs who also received CTA and MRI/MRA from January 2008 to July 2016 were reviewed. CTA and MRI/MRA were reviewed for signs of CVR, and the diagnostic accuracy of individual signs was evaluated by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. Results: A total 108 patients were included in this study. CTA signs of CVR included abnormal dilatation, early enhancement, and the presence of a medullary or pial vein. MRI/MRA signs of CVR included abnormal dilatation, early enhancement, flow-related enhancement, flow void, and medullary or pial venous collaterals. The sensitivity of individual CTA signs ranged from 62 to 96%, and specificities from 79 to 94%. The sensitivities of individual MRI/MRA signs ranged from 58 to 83%, and specificities from 77 to 93%.

The pull-through resection was used when the mouth opening was ?15 mm; otherwise the mandibular lip-split was used. Results: Fifty-eight patients received pull-through resections and 33 underwent mandibular-lip splits and the mean follow-up periods were 42 and 45 months, respectively. Surgical margin, locoregional recurrence, and 5-year survival were similar between the 2 groups. The pull-through approach had a significantly shorter operation time, lower rates of flap infection, osteoradionecrosis, metal plate exposure, loss of tooth vitality, and better aesthetics. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the pull-through resection does not compromise disease control for advanced tongue/FOM cancers and is superior to the mandibular lip-split in terms of operation time, postoperative complications, and aesthetics. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",mandibular lip-split; oral squamous cell carcinoma; pull-through; surgical approach; tongue/floor of mouth cancers,"adult; aged; Article; bone necrosis; cancer recurrence; cohort analysis; controlled study; esthetics; female; follow up; human; infection; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; mandible resection; mandibular lip split surgery; mouth cancer; mouth floor; operation duration; outcome assessment; postoperative complication; priority journal; pull through operation; retrospective study; surgical margin; surgical technique; survival analysis; tongue cancer; cancer staging; cancer survivor; comparative study; disease free survival; evaluation study; glossectomy; head and neck tumor; mandible osteotomy; middle aged; mortality; mouth floor; nonparametric test; pathology; procedures; risk assessment; squamous cell carcinoma; Taiwan; time factor; tongue tumor; tumor invasion; tumor recurrence; Adult; Aged; Cancer Survivors; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cohort Studies; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glossectomy; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Mandibular Osteotomy; Middle Aged; Mouth Floor; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Statistics, Nonparametric; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Time Factors; Tongue Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85034236805

Method A single-blinded randomized trial was conducted in 26 family medicine clinics. Patients with major depressive disorder were consecutively randomized to either CSCT or treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome was the severity of depression. Secondary outcomes included treatment response, treatment remission, quality of life, and medication adherence. Outcomes were compared using hierarchical linear models (mixed-effects models) from baseline to 26-week follow-up assessments. Results Of the 280 patients, 141 were randomized to TAU and 139 to CSCT. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that the CSCT group displayed significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms over the study period when compared to the TAU group (B = ? 2.60, P < 0.001). The odds of achieving the response, remission, and medication adherence were significantly greater for the CSCT group compared to the TAU group (odds ratio = 4.65, 4.12, and 2.06, respectively; all Ps < 0.05). However, both groups did not differ significantly in quality of life.

An independent life for people with disabilities has gradually become the goal of social promotion. Under the circumstances, the support strategies and facilities for the independency of physically and mentally disabled citizens should be focusing on the design and the goal of exploring the areas needing resources of social welfare by introducing spatial analysis. According to the demographic analysis on the population sizes of physically and mentally disabled citizens in Taiwan between 2008 and 2015, the highest percentage of pathogenesis in different counties/cities was 71.95% caused by illness (organ defects), and the proportion and average life expectancy of people with disabilities in the individual county/city were significantly correlated. That is, the longer average life expectancy, the higher proportion of physically and mentally disabled citizens. Because the demands on healthcare and service are gradually increasing, the establishment of support measures and facilities has become an important topic at present to achieve of the goal of well life independency. The study used a database of disabled persons published by the Taipei City Government in 2015, which was based on the statistics analyzed by the Department of Social Welfare, Taipei City Government. The description of the distribution of physically and mentally disabled citizens and resources was presented by using geographic informatics, and the coverage areas of supportive institutions were calculated based on the information network of route map combining with the statistics of physically and mentally disabled citizens made by Taipei City Government. Hop spots that cannot be covered were explored by applying the Kriging Method. Furthermore, the adequate candidate locations for setting social welfare institutions to support physically and mentally disabled citizens were calculated based on hot spots, minimal statistical areas as well as weighted population center points. Due to the lack of statistical analysis on physically and mentally disabled citizens, the characteristics of demographics were hard to be clarified. This study emphasized the relationships between physically and mentally disabled citizens and their support institutions as well as the analysis on conformity between demands and the resource of social welfare. The aim was to discuss the impacts of policy implementation on the changes in behavior or survival of physically and mentally disabled citizens. ?

The Asian Collaborative Longitudinal Optic Neuritis Epidemiology (ACLONE) is an observational cohort study that assessed the risk of recurrent optic neuritis and/or progression of further neurologic events, either MS or neuromyelitis optica (NMO) in Asian patients with first-ever optic neuritis. Secondary aims were to study the presenting characteristics and visual outcome, and to identify risk factors for development of either MS or NMO. A total of 112 patients (25 men and 87 women) aged from 12 to 61 years were recruited from Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia. Of these, 94 (84%) had unilateral optic neuritis, with the right eye involved in 45 patients and the left eye in 49 patients and the remaining 18 (16%) had bilateral optic neuritis. Follow up data was available for 104 patients, and patients were followed for a median duration of 25.9 months. Of these patients, 6 patients were adjudicated to have reached the primary endpoint (composite of MS/NMO and optic neuritis): 3 patients with recurrent optic neuritis also subsequently experienced neurologic symptoms, and 3 patients without recurrent eye involvement had neurologic symptoms. Only one patient was considered to have prototypical MS, the other 5 were diagnosed with NMO, all with subsequent antibody confirmation. Optic neuritis in Asian patients has significantly different presenting characteristics from the classic description. However, in the majority of the patients it is usually a benign disease, with good visual outcome and no further events. ? 2017, ASEAN Neurological Association.

We investigated the postnatal incidence of acute myocarditis and risk factors for morbidity and mortality. Design: Retrospective derived birth cohort study. Setting: Taiwan National Health Insurance Database for the period 2000-2014. Patients: Children born between 2000 and 2009 with complete postnatal medical care data for at least 5 years. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: From among 2,150,590 live births, we identified 965 patients (54.8% male) admitted with the diagnosis of acute myocarditis, accounting for an overall incidence of 0.45/1,000. The cumulative incidence rates were 0.19/1,000, 0.38/1,000, 0.42/1,000, and 0.48/1,000 by ages 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Male predominance was noted in infants and school age children (age group 6-14 yr). Arrhythmias, including tachyarrhythmia (4.8%) and bradyarrhythmia (1.1%), occurred in 56 patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was provided to 62 patients (6.4%) and additional left ventricular assist devices in six of them. The mortality at discharge was 6.3%. The presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, and an onset at school age (6-14 yr) were associated with increased odds for the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which was the only predictor for mortality at discharge (hazard ratio, 7.85; 95% CI, 3.74-9.29). In patients who survived the acute myocarditis, late mortality was relatively low (36/904 = 4.0%). The overall survival of children with acute myocarditis were 90.9%, 90.3%, and 89.8% by the intervals of 1, 5, and 10 years after the myocarditis, respectively. Conclusions: This birth cohort study determined the cumulative incidence of acute myocarditis for neonates by 15 years old to be one in 2,105. In an era of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the need of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may reflect the severity of acute myocarditis and predict its outcome.

This study compared the construct validity of 2 short-forms of the 12-item-SSQOL (not the 12-domain-SSQOL). Methods: Data were obtained from a previous validation study of the original 49-item SSQOL in 263 patients. Construct validity was tested by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine whether the two-factor structure, including psychosocial and physical domains, was supported in both versions. The CFA tested the data-model fit by indices: chi-square χ2/df ratio, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), nonnormative fit index (NNFI), standard root mean square residual (SRMR), and parsimony normed fit index (PNFI). Item factor loadings (cutoffs: .50) were examined. Model fit was compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC) and consistent AIC (i.e., CAIC) values. Results: All model fit indices for Post’s version fell within expected ranges: χ2/df ratio = 2.02, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.97, NNFI = 0.97, SRMR = 0.06, and PNFI = 0.76. In the psychosocial domain, the item factor loadings ranged from 0.46 to 0.63. In the physical domain, all items (except the language and vision items) had acceptable factor loadings (0.68 to 0.88). However, in Wong’s version, none of the model indices met the criteria for good fit. In model fit comparisons, Post’s version had smaller AIC and CAIC values than did Wong’s version. Conclusions: All fit indices supported Post’s version, but not Wong’s version. The construct validity of Post’s version with a 2-factor structure was confirmed, and this version of the 12-item SSQOL is recommended. ? 2017 Chou et al.

Pfirrmann grading is widely used for grading degeneration of intervertebral discs (IVDs). The criterion to differentiate IVDs of Pfirrmann Grade I from the other grades is NP homogeneity. Pfirrmann grading is qualitative and its assessment may be subjective. Therefore, assessment of quantitative objective measures correlating with early disc degeneration may complement the grading. This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the distance between the center weighted by signal intensity (weighted center) and the geometric center as a parameter of NP homogeneity. Other phenomena related to advancing stages of degeneration were also investigated. Methods: MR images of 65 asymptomatic volunteers with a total of 288 lumbar IVDs with clearly identifiable nucleus pulposus boundary (Pfirrmann Grade I, II and III) were included in this study. A custom-written program was developed to determine the IVD longitudinal axis, define the NP boundary, and to locate the coordinates of geometric and weighted NP centers on the mid-sagittal image of each studied IVD. The distances between the weighted and geometric centers on the longitudinal axis and the perpendicular axis of each IVD were calculated. Results: The weighted center located posterior to the geometric center, which indicated the signal intensity was lower at the anterior portion of the NP, in 85.8% of studied IVDs. The distance between the weighted and geometric center on the longitudinal axis was significantly shorter in homogeneous (Pfirrmann Grade I) than in inhomogeneous (Grade II) IVDs. The distance on the perpendicular axis in Grade III IVDs was significantly larger than that in Grade I and Grade II IVDs. Conclusion: The relationship between the weighted and geometric centers can serve as an indicator for NP homogeneity. The distance between both centers through advancing stages of degeneration demonstrated decrease of signal intensity progressing along the longitudinal axis initially and then along the cranio-caudal direction at later stages. These findings could provide insights of initiation and subsequent progression of degenerative changes in IVDs. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Disc degeneration; Geometric center; Homogeneity; Intervertebral disc; MRI; Nucleus pulposus; Signal intensity,"female; human; lumbar region; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleus pulposus; volunteer; adult; asymptomatic disease; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; intervertebral disk degeneration; lumbar vertebra; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleus pulposus; pathology; retrospective study; young adult; biological marker; proteoglycan; Adult; Asymptomatic Diseases; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Nucleus Pulposus; Proteoglycans; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85034786123

Tomographic diffractive microscopy (TDM) is an emerging technique capable of quantifying three-dimensional (3-D) refractive index (RI) distributions of erythrocytes without labeling. TDM was used to characterize optical and morphological properties of 172 erythrocytes from healthy volunteers and 419 erythrocytes from thalassemic patients. To efficiently extract and analyze the properties of erythrocytes, we developed an adaptive region-growing method for automatically delineating erythrocytes from 3-D RI maps. The thalassemic erythrocytes not only contained lower hemoglobin content but also showed doughnut shape and significantly lower volume, surface area, effective radius, and average thickness. A multi-indices prediction model achieved perfect accuracy of diagnosing thalassemia using four features, including the optical volume, surface-area-to-volume ratio, sphericity index, and surface area. The results demonstrate the ability of TDM to provide quantitative, hematologic measurements and to assess morphological features of erythrocytes to distinguish healthy and thalassemic erythrocytes. ? 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",erythrocyte; thalassemia; three-dimensional adaptive region-growing; tomographic diffractive microscopy,Adaptive optics; Diagnosis; Refractive index; Tomography; Adaptive region growing; Complete blood counts; erythrocyte; Morphological features; Morphological properties; thalassemia; Threedimensional (3-d); Tomographic; Blood; cell shape; cytology; diagnostic imaging; erythrocyte; human; microscopy; thalassemia; tomography; Cell Shape; Erythrocytes; Humans; Microscopy; Thalassemia; Tomography,2-s2.0-85038444355

Untreated OSA will cause lots of potential health problems. Oral appliance therapy is an effective and popular approach for OSA treatment, but making a perfect fit for each patient is time-consuming and decreases its efficiency considerably. This paper proposes a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) enabled sleep monitoring system in a smart oral appliance, which is capable of intelligently collecting the physiological data about tongue movement through the whole therapy. A tunneling sensor array with an ultra-high sensitivity is incorporated to accurately detect the subtle pressure from the tongue. When the device is placed on the wireless platform, the temporary stored data will be retrieved and wirelessly transmitted to personal computers and cloud storages. The battery will be recharged by harvesting external RF power from the platform. A compact prototype module, whose size is 4.5 × 2.5 × 0.9 cm 3 , is implemented and embedded inside the oral appliance to demonstrate the tongue movement detection in continuous time frames. The functions of this design are verified by the presented measurement results. This design aims to increase efficiency and make it a total solution for OSA treatment. ? 2017 by the authors.

However, there are conflicting views in insulin secretory capacity between early clinical observation and recent proposed mathematical model. On the basis of digestive and metabolic similarities with humans, swine have great potential as an animal model to investigate the progressive mechanisms of prediabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the insulin secretory response and tissue-specific insulin resistance in a dietary-induced prediabetic porcine model. Methods: Adult male Taiwan Lee-Sung miniature pigs were randomized into two groups: (1) low-fat diet and (2) high-fat plus high-fructose diet (HFHF; 20.9% crude fat and 17.8% fructose). During the 12-month dietary intervention, body weights and blood glucose levels were measured monthly. Intravenous glucose tolerance test was used for measuring glucose tolerance and insulin secretory capacity. At the end of the experiment, liver and soleus muscle specimens were collected for ex vivo insulin sensitivity testing. Results: The results showed that the HFHF group had obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia, but normal fasting glucose levels. The HFHF pigs exhibited enhanced first- and second-phase insulin secretion and high 2-h postload glucose levels in intravenous glucose tolerance test. Furthermore, the skeletal muscle specimens from the HFHF group were desensitized to insulin stimulation as shown by the lack of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation; however, the liver specimens remained a normal response. Conclusions: In conclusion, the HFHF diet-fed pigs developed isolated impaired glucose tolerance corresponding to prediabetes with an intense insulin secretory response and skeletal muscle insulin resistance. ? 2017 The Author(s).",High fat high fructose diet; Impaired glucose tolerance; Insulin resistance; IVGTT; Miniature pig,fat; fructose; glucose; insulin; protein kinase B; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; dyslipidemia; enzyme phosphorylation; ex vivo study; fat intake; glucose blood level; hyperinsulinemia; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin blood level; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intravenous glucose tolerance test; lipid diet; liver tissue; low fat diet; male; minipig; muscle tissue; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; skeletal muscle; soleus muscle; sugar intake,2-s2.0-85031319580

Methods: Patients who had avoidable ED visit between 2010 and 2013 was selected as the case-group in this study and were matched to patients who had outpatient visits but without any avoidable ED visit in the same year. The continuity of care index (COCI) was used to measure the quality of primary care. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to explore whether avoidable ED visits are associated with patients' characteristics, the continuity of care, and the type of providers as their usual source of primary care. Results: The study found that patient who was male or with lower income class were associated with higher probability of having avoidable ED visits. The result of multivariate analysis further revealed that the odds of avoidable ED visits were higher for patients with lower continuity of care (OR = 1.924 to 3.22), and for whom received primary care from regional hospitals (OR = 3.543) and medical centers (OR = 2.916). Conclusions: Higher continuity of care was found to significantly lower the risk of avoidable ED visits. Health policy stakeholders are therefore encouraged to improve continuity of care.

To decrease the potential risks of transmission of pathogenic bacteria, fungi, or viruses to the transplant recipients, certain issues regarding the management of patients who receive contaminated allografts need to be addressed. We aimed to clarify the incidence and extent of disease transmission from allografts by analyzing the allografting procedures performed in the bone bank of our hospital over the past 20 years. We retrospectively reviewed the data from our allograft registry center on 3979 allografts that were implanted in 3193 recipients throughout a period of two decades, from July 1991 to June 2011. The source of the allografts, results of all screening tests, dates of harvesting and implantation, and recipients of all allografts were checked. With the help of the Center for Infection Control of our hospital, a strict prospective, hospital-wide, on-site surveillance was conducted, and every patient with healthcare-associated infection was identified. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the infection rate between recipients with sterile allografts and those with contaminated allografts. The overall discard and infection rates were, respectively, 23% and 1.3% in the first decade (1991–2001); and 18.4% and 1.25% in the second decade (2001–2011). The infection rate of contaminated allograft recipients was significantly higher than that of sterile allograft recipients (10% vs. 1.15%, P < 0.01) in the second decade. Both infection and discard rates of our bone bank are comparable with those of international bone banks. Strict allograft processing and adequate prophylactic use of antibiotics are critical to prevent infection and disease transmission in such cases. ? 2017 Fu et al.

However, disseminated M. abscessus infection that mimics cancer metastasis with an underlying relatively immunocompetent condition has rarely been reported. Patient concerns: A nonsmoking 73-year-old man with an underlying relatively immunocompetent condition reported a 2-month history of a mass in the region of his right parotid gland that had been steadily increasing in size. Diagnoses: The head and neck computed tomography showed an avidly enhancing tumor with central necrosis in the right parotid region and lymphadenopathy bilaterally at neck levels II-V (<6cm) with a necrotic core. The radiologist and otolaryngologist both suspected a diagnosis of right parotid gland cancer with metastasis. Interventions: The necrotic tissue was removed surgically, and Mycobacterium culture showed M. abscessus. We collected a blood sample and detected anti-interferon-γ autoantibody. Outcomes: After 6 months of anti-M. abscessus treatment, physical examination showed remission of the parotid tumor, and axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Lessons: We report a case of disseminated M. abscessus infection, which involved parotid glands with multiple lymphadenopathies in a person with an underlying relatively immunocompetent condition. Possible underlying mechanisms such as anti-interferon-γ autoantibody-associated immunodeficiency should be considered in a patient with disseminated M. abscessus infection without a known immunocompromised condition.

Methods: We used the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 to retrieve the study sample. This study included 3933 patients with CP/CPPS and 3933 age-matched controls. We designated the date of receiving the first diagnosis of CP/CPPS as the index date for cases. We defined the first an ambulatory care visit occurring in the matched year as the index date for the controls. Conditional logistic regressions was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for having previously received colonoscopy between cases and controls. Results: We found that 349 (4.44%) of the 7866 sampled patients had previously undergone colonoscopy, including 223 (5.67%) cases and 126 (3.20%) controls (p<0.001). A conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that the adjusted OR of receiving a colonoscopy within three years before the index date was 1.77 (95% CI 1.42?2.23) for cases compared to controls. Furthermore, we found that the youngest group of cases (<40 years) had the greatest adjusted OR for having received colonoscopy within three years before the index date compared to controls (OR 2.81; 95% CI 1.45?5.44); however, in contrast, no significant difference in the adjusted odds of having previously received colonoscopy was observed between cases and controls among the oldest age group (?60 years). Conclusions: We concluded that there was an association between antecedent colonoscopy and CP/CPPS. ? 2017 Canadian Urological Association.",,adult; age; aged; ambulatory care; Article; case control study; chronic prostatitis; colonoscopy; controlled study; disease association; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; patient history of colonoscopy; pelvis pain syndrome; population based case control study; prevalence; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85029690275

The Chinese herbal mixture, Tien-Hsien liquid (THL), has been used as an anticancer dietary supplement for more than 20 years. Our previous studies have shown that THL can modulate immune responseand inhibit tumor growth. In this study, we further evaluated the effect of THL on anticancer immune response in mice vaccinated with γ-ray-irradiated tumor cells. Methods. The antitumor effect of THL was determined in mice vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low colon cancer cells or γ-ray-irradiated high-tumorigenic CT-26-high colon cancer cells. The number of natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes in the spleen was analyzed by flow cytometry. The tumor-killing activities of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were analyzed by flow cytometry using YAC-1 and CT-26-high cells, respectively, as target cells. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Results. THL suppressed the growth of CT-26-high tumor in mice previously vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low cells or γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the populations of NK cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes in the spleen and enhanced the tumor-killing activities of NK cells and CTL in mice vaccinated with γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α in mice vaccinated with γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. Conclusion. THL can enhance the antitumor immune responses in mice vaccinated with killed tumor cells. These results suggest that THL may be used as a complementary medicine for cancer patients previously treated with killed tumor cell vaccines, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. ?

Altered structural and proprioceptive function at the PCL-deficient knee may affect the joint motions and the end-point control during functional activities. The current study identified the effects of unilateral PCL deficiency (PCLD) on the end-point control and joint kinematics of the lower limbs during obstacle-crossing. Eighteen patients with unilateral PCLD and eighteen healthy controls were each asked to walk and cross obstacles of heights of 10%, 20% and 30% of their leg lengths, with the affected and the unaffected limb leading, while their kinematic data were measured. Patients with PCLD were found to cross obstacles with significantly increased toe-clearance (p?<?0.01), increased trailing toe-obstacle distance (p?<?0.05) and reduced crossing speed (p?<?0.01) when compared to the controls. Similar end-point control was observed in the PCLD group whether leading with the affected or unaffected limb, which appears to be as a result of bilateral kinematic accommodation to reduce the risk of tripping. To achieve similar toe-clearances, crossing strategies with the unaffected limb leading involved angular changes at more joints than those with the affected limb leading. The PCLD group appeared to adopt a conservative strategy to reduce the risk of tripping over the obstacle during obstacle-crossing, using different joint kinematic changes depending on whether the affected or unaffected limb was leading. It is suggested that monitoring of the kinematic strategies adopted by patients with PCLD during obstacle-crossing may be needed in future rehabilitation programs with the aim of reducing tripping risks during obstacle-crossing. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Gait; Kinematics; Obstacle-crossing; Posterior cruciate ligament deficiency,"adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; kinematics; leg length; ligament disease; male; posterior cruciate ligament deficiency; priority journal; walking; young adult; adaptation; adolescent; biomechanics; case control study; gait; injuries; joint instability; knee; knee injury; lower limb; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; posterior cruciate ligament; Adaptation, Physiological; Adolescent; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Case-Control Studies; Female; Gait; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85019592283

The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the usefulness of traditional sonography to detect hepatic and splenic changes during NUC therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Methods A total of 181 CHB patients receiving NUC treatment were enrolled in this study. The study population was divided into three groups: 72 cirrhotic, 58 noncirrhotic CHB, and 51 nonreplicative hepatitis B virus carriers. All patients had blood chemistries taken and sonography at baseline and during the NUC treatment period. The changes in liver size, liver edge, spleen size, platelet count, and platelet count/spleen diameter (PC/SD) ratio were compared among the three groups of patients. Results CHB Patients with and without cirrhosis have improved clinical features during NUC therapy with lower aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, international normalized ratio, hepatitis B virus DNA, and spleen size and higher platelet, liver edge, liver size, and PC/SD ratio compared with the baseline data (p &lt; 0.05). The differences in liver edge, liver size, spleen size, and PC/SD ratio are higher in the cirrhosis group than in the noncirrhotic group (p &lt; 0.001). A decrease in spleen size exhibited a linear relationship with treatment duration (R2 = 0.905).

Data on Taiwanese MHPs’ views of ITO regime were collected from the National Psychiatric Disease Mandatory Assessment and Community Care Review Committee (N?=?176). A national survey instrument was designed to assess the level of support for ITOs among senior clinicians and to determine their views on the importance of various factors in decision-making, the mechanisms through which coercion may work, impediments to its use, and its perceived impact on patients and therapeutic relationships. A descriptive analysis was carried out with data presented as appropriate for the distribution and a t-test was used to detect any differences by respondents. Risk reduction was ranked the most important factor in use of ITOs and reasons for discharging an order. Female respondents had higher approval ratings, with 85?% of agreeing that ITOs were of benefit to the therapeutic relationship, assured long-term stability, and increased medication compliance. The results suggest that clinicians decide the use of ITOs largely based on the risk management, both in terms of starting and ending an order. However, the use of ITOs vary which reflected in the practice. Given this variation in the use of enabling legislation, multidisciplinary input in decision-making is an essential safety mechanism. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Attitude; Cultural-cultural; Involuntary treatment; Mental healthcare professional; Severe mental illness,"adult; aged; Article; clinical assessment; clinical practice; controlled study; cultural factor; England; female; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; health survey; human; involuntary commitment; involuntary treatment order; law; male; medical decision making; medication compliance; mental health; New Zealand; persuasive communication; risk management; risk reduction; Taiwan; Wales; ethnology; health personnel attitude; mental disease; middle aged; safety; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Cultural Comparison; England; Female; Humans; Involuntary Treatment, Psychiatric; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Safety Management; Taiwan; Wales",2-s2.0-84994761667

We found that COC was a multi-dimensional concept in previous studies; however, the claim-based COC measures describe the concentration or dispersion of physician visits among healthcare providers, and we consider that these quantitative measures might not reflect the multi-dimensional concept of COC. In addition, claim-based COC measures may not reflect the essence of care continuity in different care contexts and the medical care environment. Finally, COC measures from the patient perspective has gradually become more important. We suggest that researchers may develop measurement tools for COC from the patient perspective.

However, its presence and its role in the nasal cavity have not yet been fully studied. Methods: Immunohistology was used to study TRPM8 receptors in both the nasal mucosa tissue and the primary cultures of human nasal cells. Cells from primary cultures were immunostained with antibodies to TRPM8, mucin, cytokeratin (CK)-14, CK-18, and vimentin. Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to determine the physiological role of TRPM8 in mucus production in the nasal cavity, with and without its agonist and antagonist. Results: The TRPM8 is clearly present in the epithelium, mucous glands, and vessels. No obvious TRPM8-immunoreactive cells were detected in the connective tissue. Immunostaining of cytospin preparations showed that epithelial cells test positive for CK-14, CK-18, TRPM8, and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC). Fibroblastic cells are stained negative for TRPM8. Secreted mucins in the cultured supernatant are detected after exposure to menthol and moderate cooling to 24°C. Both induce a statistically significant increase in the level of MUC5AC mRNA and mucin production. BCTC, a TRPM8 antagonist, has a statistically significant inhibitory effect on MUC5AC mRNA expression and MUC5AC protein production that is induced by menthol and moderate cooling to 24°C. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that TRPM8 is present in the nasal epithelium. When it is activated by moderate cooling to 24°C or menthol, TRPM8 induces the secretion of mucin. This study shows that TRPM8 channels are important regulators of mucin production. Therefore, TRPM8 antagonists could be used to treat refractory rhinitis. ? 2017 the Author(s).

There were still no objective methods qualified to detect the early central nervous system involvement in non-criteria antiphospholipid syndrome. We evaluated the effectiveness of Tc-99m ECD SPECT in assessing circulatory insufficiency in the brains of patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and neuropsychiatric symptoms but without thromboembolism. Materials and methods: Patients with a history of positive antiphospholipid antibodies and neuropsychiatric symptoms composed the case group; patients without antiphospholipid antibody served as the control group. Subjects with a history of thromboembolism or autoantibodies to extractable nuclear antigens were excluded. All patients received Tc-99m ECD SPECT studies and were classified by the number of positive antiphospholipid antibodies they carried. The heterogeneity of brain perfusion was defined as the coefficient of variation of the SPECT signals. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to evaluate the differences between the groups. Results: Total 60 adult patients were included in this study. There were 54 patients in the case group and 6 patients in the control group. The mean age was 38.3 ± 11.5 years. There were 52 women and 8 men. There was no significant difference in the mean brain perfusion between groups (P = 0.69). However, Tc-99m ECD SPECT demonstrated significant heterogeneity of brain perfusion in relation to the number of antiphospholipid antibodies (P = 0.01). Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating that Tc-99m ECD SPECT can early detect the increased heterogeneity of brain circulation in non-criteria antiphospholipid antibody carriers. ? 2017 Lin et al.

Thus, it is helpful to identify the contributions of air pollutants from different sources in order to design effective control strategies. Nevertheless, different sampling time schedules for VOCs and PM2.5 result in difficulties for conventional receptor modeling. Additionally, a receptor model is unable to link the retrieved factors directly with actual source locations. To address these gaps, this study integrated back-trajectory data into an improved source apportionment model suitable for multiple time resolution data to estimate the locations of the regional transport-related factor. Within six potential source regions (PSRs) outlined by the above method, PSR 5 was suggested the primary one located near the industrial regions in the northeastern China. Constrained model results showed that the source contribution estimates with back trajectories passing over the PSRs were 3 and 9% of the selected VOCs and PM2.5 mass, respectively. ? 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).",Constrained receptor model; Multilinear engine; Positive matrix factorization; Receptor modeling,Air pollution control; Factorization; Particles (particulate matter); Trajectories; Volatile organic compounds; Adverse health effects; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Positive Matrix Factorization; Potential source regions; Receptor model; Regional transport; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Location; ambient air; industrial location; numerical model; particulate matter; source apportionment; volatile organic compound; China,2-s2.0-85023750135

Administration of ACW significantly reduced serum insulin, leptin, aspartate aminotransferase levels, HOMA-IR index, and hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels. Next, investigation of whether ACW and its polysaccharides (PS) and non-polysaccharides (NPS) subfractions possess anti-adipogenic action was conducted. Evidence showed that ACW, PS and NPS significantly inhibited lipid deposits in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Both ACW and NPS significantly inhibited mitotic clonal expansion process of adipocyte differentiation. ACW and NPS also significantly decreased the expressions of PPARγ, C/EBPα, aP2 and FAS genes, while PS markedly inhibited PPARγ and aP2 gene expression. Our data indicated that ACW inhibits preadipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis.

METHODS. The presence of MCTs in human and rabbit corneal epithelium was determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Intracellular fluorescein uptake experiment was performed using cultured human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). The involvement of MCT in fluorescein uptake was determined by addition of MCT inhibitors to HCECs and acute dry eye model on New Zealand albino rabbits by spectrophotometry, corneal impression cytology, and external eye photographs. RESULTS. MCT-1 and MCT-4 were identified in both human and rabbit corneal epithelia. A longer treatment period and a lower pH value in culture medium increased fluorescein uptake in HCECs. Fluorescein uptake in HCECs was decreased following addition of MCT inhibitors in a concentration-dependent manner. Impression cytology under fluorescent microscopy showed intracellular fluorescein staining in the rabbit cornea with acute dry eye treatment that was decreased following topical treatment of MCT inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS. Fluorescein ingress in corneal epithelial cells is mediated by the MCT family. Further study of MCT-mediated transport on HCECs may potentially benefit differential diagnosis and contribute better understandings of ocular surface disorders. ? 2017 The Authors.",Corneal epithelial cell; Fluorescein staining; Monocarboxylate transporter,"dihydro 4,4' diisothiocyano 2,2' stilbenedisulfonic acid; fluorescein; monocarboxylate transporter; 4,4' diisothiocyanatostilbene 2,2' disulfonic acid; cotransporter; fluorescein; fluorescent dye; monocarboxylate transport protein 1; monocarboxylate transporter; muscle protein; salicylic acid derivative; SLC16A4 protein, human; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cell culture; controlled study; cornea epithelium; cytology; drug uptake; dry eye; fluorescence microscopy; fluorometry; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; spectrophotometry; transepithelial resistance; acute disease; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cornea epithelium; dose response; metabolism; pathology; physiology; rabbits and hares; real time polymerase chain reaction; transport at the cellular level; 4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid; Acute Disease; Animals; Biological Transport; Cells, Cultured; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Dry Eye Syndromes; Epithelium, Corneal; Fluorescein; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Immunohistochemistry; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters; Muscle Proteins; Rabbits; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Salicylates; Symporters",2-s2.0-85026290845

The main components of detergents include surfactants and water. It has been found that certain compounds, which may cause health concerns, appear in food detergents, such as alkylphenols, arsenic, and lead. After applying food detergents is when people may be exposed to various levels of these chemicals when there are residues. In this study, the Taguchi experimental design was performed to determine the possible factors that might affect the residual characteristics of food detergent on dishware, fruits, and vegetables. The results showed that the variety of detergent was found to be the most significant factor affecting the residue amounts of arsenic (62.9%) and lead (71.6%) on fruits and vegetables, whereas the concentration of detergent used affected the amount of lead residue only (10.5%). On the other hand, dishware material, the concentration of analytes, immersion time, and type of surfactant contributed to arsenic residues on dishware, whereas technical nonylphenol isomer residues on dishware increased as the concentration of spiked analyte increased. In addition, the occurrence of 1,4-dioxane, a possible human carcinogen, in household food detergents in Taiwan was also determined in this research by solid-phase microextraction and GC-MS.

It is unknown how long children with these conditions seek medical help before a diagnosis is reached. Methods: During the period 2002 to 2013, 7238 children aged 2-15 years diagnosed with cancer at seven sites, type 1 diabetes, and three other immune diseases were registered in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Catastrophic Illness Database. Their healthcare visit records in the year before diagnosis were extracted and compared to the records of matched controls during comparable periods using mixed-effect models. Results: Except for diabetes, there were substantial increases in healthcare visit rates in the last few months before a diagnosis of cancer or immune conditions, suggesting that some children had been seeking medical help and it had taken months to achieve a diagnosis. Many recorded presentations during this time were consistent with typical manifestations of the underlying condition, such as increasing apparent injuries before the diagnosis of bone cancer (6.6-fold increase in the most recent 4 months, 95% CI 4.9 to 9.0). Comparatively, healthcare visits in the year before the diagnosis of diabetes were less common, but at the time of diagnosis 64% (1504/2335) of children presented with diabetes ketoacidosis. Conclusions: Many children with cancer or immune diseases, even with typical presentations, required a period of time for the diagnosis to be confirmed. By contrast, children with type 1 diabetes typically did not visit a doctor until ketoacidosis had occurred. ?

Only a few articles have provided expert opinions using anesthetic cream for such a problem; however, direct application of the anesthetic cream to a wound may cause infection. A safe alternative can be an anesthetic patch without wound contact. Materials and methods This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Sixty patients who underwent primary total knee replacement were assigned to an experimental group or control group. One lidocaine patch was applied around the surgical wound for each patient in the experimental group. Alternatively, the adhesive sides of the lidocaine patches were shielded with waterproof films in the control group. A resident peeled off the patch before a single nursing practitioner removed the staples. Pain was assessed with the 10-cm visual analog scale, and a face pain scale-revised was performed. The patients and the nursing practitioner were blind to the management. Results Mean visual analog scale and face pain scale-revised scores were significantly lower in the experimental group. The mean pain score was significantly lower in the experimental group if the application time was >47?min; for patients with application time of 47?min or shorter, the score was comparable with the mean pain scores of the control group (P?=?0.215). Conclusions Removal of the metal skin staples after total knee arthroplasty is associated with moderate-to-severe pain. The lidocaine patch applied topically around the surgical wound could effectively reduce the pain during the procedure, without remarkable complications such as systemic adverse effects or wound contamination. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Knee surgery; Lidocaine patch; Pain; Skin staple; Wound,"lidocaine; lidocaine; local anesthetic agent; aged; Article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; device removal; double blind procedure; face pain; female; follow up; human; knee injury; knee osteoarthritis; major clinical study; male; nociception; nonabsorbable suture; pain assessment; pain intensity; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; stapler; surgical wound; topical anesthesia; total knee arthroplasty; visual analog scale; wound infection; adult; devices; knee replacement; local anesthesia; middle aged; outcome assessment; pain measurement; procedures; surgical wound; suture; topical drug administration; very elderly; Administration, Topical; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anesthesia, Local; Anesthetics, Local; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Device Removal; Double-Blind Method; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lidocaine; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pain Measurement; Prospective Studies; Surgical Wound; Sutures",2-s2.0-85018330067

However, whether these drug safety communications have had an immediate and strong impact on codeine use remains in question. Objective: We aimed to investigate the impact of the two implemented safety-related regulations (label changes and reimbursement regulations) on the use of codeine for upper respiratory infection (URI) or cough. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was performed using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Quarterly data of codeine prescription rates for URI/cough visits were reported, and an interrupted time series design was used to assess the impact of the safety regulations on the uses of codeine among children with URI/cough visits. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore patient and provider characteristics associated with the use of codeine. Results: The safety-related regulations were associated with a significant reduction in codeine prescription rates of ?4.24% (95% confidence interval [CI] ?4.78 to ?3.70), and the relative reduction compared with predicted rates based on preregulation projections was 60.4, 56.6, and 53.2% in the first, second, and third year after the regulations began, respectively. In the postregulation period, physicians specializing in otolaryngology (odds ratio [OR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.45–1.49), practicing in district hospitals (OR 6.84, 95% CI 5.82–8.04) or clinics (OR 6.50, 95% CI 5.54–7.62), and practicing in the least urbanized areas (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.55–1.64) were more likely to prescribe codeine to children than their counterparts. Conclusions: Our study provides a successful example of how to effectively reduce the codeine prescriptions in children in the ‘real-world’ settings, and highlights areas where future effort could be made to improve the safety use of codeine. Future research is warranted to explore whether there was a simultaneous decrease in the incidence rates of codeine-related adverse events following the safety-related regulations. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"antitussive agent; benproperine; benzonatate; butamirate; clofedanol; cloperastine; codeine; dextromethorphan; dibunate; dimemorfan; hydropropizine; noscapine; opiate; oxeladin; oxolamine; pentoxyverine; tipepidine; unclassified drug; codeine; adolescent; Article; child; coughing; data base; drug safety; female; groups by age; human; infant; major clinical study; male; national health insurance; newborn; pediatrics; prescription; priority journal; quasi experimental study; reimbursement; retrospective study; Taiwan; time series analysis; upper respiratory tract infection; clinical practice; coughing; drug legislation; drug utilization; factual database; organization and management; preschool child; public health; respiratory tract infection; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Codeine; Cough; Databases, Factual; Drug Utilization; Female; Humans; Infant; Legislation, Drug; Male; National Health Programs; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Respiratory Tract Infections; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85016628884

The FUNDES-Adult was designed to assess the difficulty level of an individual’s activities and participation in daily life. There is a lack of research regarding the profile of activity and participation for the general adult population. The purposes of this study were to establish activity and participation norms for the general adult population in Taiwan and to describe, discuss, and compare the activity and participation profile with other population. Method: A population-based survey was administered in 2013 using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system (CATI system). Using probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling and systematic sampling with random digit dialing (RDD), 1500 adults from Taiwan’s general population were selected to participate in the survey. The FUNDES-Adult with six domains and two dimensions (performance and capability) was used to obtain data on activities and participation levels. A higher domain score indicated higher participation restriction. Results: Approximately 50% of the respondents were male, and the average age of the respondents was 45.23 years. There were no significant differences in the demographic features between the sample and the population. Among the six domains, the self-care domain score was the lowest (least restriction) and the participation domain score was the highest (most restriction). Approximately 90% of the sample scored were less than 15, and only 0.1% scored more than 80. This is the first cross-national population-based survey to assess norms of activity and participation relevant to the general population of Taiwan.

Therefore, stroke prevention is a key goal of AF treatment. In the past, patients were required to take anticoagulants for the remainder of their life, to regularly the monitor international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time (PT), and to avoid possible negative interactions with various drugs and foods. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO), a novel device and technique, was thus developed for AF patients with contraindications to anticoagulants and a high risk of bleeding. When using this technique, the occluder is placed on the left atrial appendage in order to effectively prevent blood stasis and thrombi accumulation. Transesophageal echocardiogram and computed tomography are conducted prior to the LAAO procedure, which is similar to the procedure used for cardiac catheterization. After the LAAO procedure, the patient remains in the intensive care unit (ICU), where vital signs, bleeding at the puncture site, and pericardial tamponade complications are monitored. Health education on daily activities, anticoagulant use, and regular follow-up should be given prior to hospital discharge. While LAAO may not reduce the incidence of stroke, the benefits of this procedure include a significant reduction in bleeding complications as compared to procedures that use oral anticoagulants. Further studies including long-term follow up and in-depth examinations of this procedure are necessary. The present article offers a reference for clinical staffs who are responsible for the care of patients treated using the LAAO procedure.","Atrial fibrillation; Left atrial appendage occlusion; Stroke, oral anticoagulants",atrial fibrillation; complication; heart atrium; heart atrium appendage; human; septal occluder; Stroke; thrombosis; Atrial Appendage; Atrial Fibrillation; Heart Atria; Humans; Septal Occluder Device; Stroke; Thrombosis,2-s2.0-85030614619

In this ethical analysis, we review the transitions of the policy in Taiwan and focus on the lifetime ban on men who have sex with men (MSM). We subject the ban to a public health ethical examination based on three ethical theories. Using overlapping consensus as the methodology of justification, we have found that utilitarianism, Kantianism and communitarianism all support the repeal of the ban. First, we apply the doctrine of necessity and minimal harm and note that the ban cannot widen risk protection from HIV/AIDS. Second, we turn to the principle of maximizing utility and contend that the ban does not improve the quality of the blood, nor does it maximize the quantity of donated blood. Third, we apply Kantian and egalitarian perspectives to contend that the ban is actually a state-sanctioned act of institutional discrimination against MSM. Lastly, we apply liberal communitarianism and point out that virtuous society members would have the capacity to pursue the common good, which is maintaining the quality blood for the needy, if there were no such regulation unjustly targeting MSM. We suggest that if governmental authorities for the blood donor deferral policy cannot provide public justification for this regulation, it should be abolished.",Blood donor deferral policy; Institutional discrimination; Men who have men with men (MSM); Public health ethics; Utilitarianism,,2-s2.0-85026905851

However, the aetiology, pathogenesis and optimal treatment of UC remain unclear. The purpose of this case-control study was to investigate the association between previously diagnosed hyperthyroidism and UC using a large population-based data set in Taiwan. Methods: The data for this population-based case-control study were retrieved from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. We included 2709 patients with UC as cases and 8127 sex- and age-matched patients without UC as controls. A conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted to compute the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between UC and prior hyperthyroidism. Results: We found that, in total, 327 of the 10?836 sampled patients (3.02%) had previously been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. There was a higher proportion of prior hyperthyroidism among cases than controls (4.10% vs 2.66%, P<.001). A conditional logistic regression showed that the OR of prior hyperthyroidism was 1.57 (95% CI=1.24-1.98) compared to controls. Similarly, after adjusting for monthly income, geographic location and urbanization level, cases were still more likely to have previously been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism than controls (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.27-2.05). Furthermore, we analysed the ORs of prior hyperthyroidism between cases and controls according to age group. We found that of the youngest group of sampled patients (18-39?years), cases had the greatest adjusted OR for having previously been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism than controls (OR=1.98, 95% CI=1.04-3.79).

The purpose of this paper is to present our initial experience of laparoscopic percutaneous jejunostomy with unidirectional barbed sutures in esophageal cancer patients and compare it with our early cases using traditional transabdominal sutures. Methods: A total of 118 esophageal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic percutaneous jejunostomy were identified in a single institution in Taiwan from June 2014 to May 2016. The authors’ traditional technique consisted of using transabdominal sutures with bolsters to fix a jejunum loop onto the anterior abdominal wall. A novel technique was introduced using intracorporeal suturing with knotless unidirectional barbed monofilament absorbable sutures (V-Loc) to attain a seal around the feeding catheter. A comparison between these two techniques was performed. Results: Twenty cases with barbed V-Loc sutures and 98 cases with transabdominal sutures were identified. The V-Loc sutures appeared to reduce peristomal skin ulcers (19.4 vs. 0?%, p?=?0.040), postoperative pain scores during the first 24?h (1.8?±?1.4 vs. 0.9?±?1.1, p?=?0.007) and on postoperative day 2 (1.7?±?1.4 vs. 1.0?±?0.8, p?=?0.026) when compared to patients receiving transabdominal sutures. The mean suturing time using V-Loc sutures was 22?min (14–60?min). The mean onset to resumption of enteral feeding was 1.8?±?0.8?days and the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay was 8?±?5.1?days, both of which were comparable in the two groups. There was no surgical mortality in our series. Conclusions: In the study cohort, the use of knotless unidirectional barbed sutures instead of traditional transabdominal sutures had similar outcomes and appears to be a feasible option for intracorporeal jejunopexy when performing laparoscopic jejunostomy in patients with esophageal cancer. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Barbed suture; Esophageal cancer; Laparoscopic jejunostomy; V-Loc,adult; Article; barbed suture; central venous catheter; enteric feeding; esophagus cancer; female; human; jejunostomy; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; postoperative pain; priority journal; skin ulcer; surgical technique; suture technique; abdominal surgery; abdominal wall; aged; cancer staging; cohort analysis; comparative study; esophagus tumor; jejunostomy; jejunum; laparoscopy; pathology; procedures; suture; suture technique; Taiwan; Abdominal Wall; Aged; Cohort Studies; Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Esophageal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Jejunostomy; Jejunum; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Suture Techniques; Sutures; Taiwan,2-s2.0-84991710963

Direct transfer of immune-related genes into skin tissue is a fascinating approach to investigate immune modulation of cutaneous inflammation in mouse models of human diseases. Here we present a cost-effective protocol that delivered naked DNA in mouse skin and leads to transgene expression. The method is coined “acufection”, denoting acupuncture-mediated DNA transfection. To perform acufection, mouse skin was first infused with DNA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then pricked lightly with a bundle of acupuncture needles to facilitate the absorption of DNA and transfection into cells. The plasmid DNA is presumably taken up by the keratinocyte and dendritic cells (DCs) in the skin and expressed into protein. Mechanical prick with the needles per se did not cause skin damage or induce keratinocyte activation. The expression of the transfected genes was detected in the skin at both transcriptional and translational levels following acufection for 2 days and maintained up to 7 days. The primary goal for the development of this acufection method was to investigate a previously undefined isoform of IL-15. Using this method, an alternatively spliced IL-15 isoform with partially deleted exon 7 (IL-15ΔE7) was expressed in the skin and subsequently treated with a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist, imiquimod (IMQ), to induce inflammation. Acufection-delivered IL-15ΔE7 in skin suppressed keratinocyte proliferation, epidermal thickness and neutrophil recruitment in IMQ-induced cutaneous inflammation. With increasing interest in identifying the regulatory mechanisms of cutaneous inflammation, the protocol described here provides a cost effective and versatile alternative to the gene gun system or microseeding for DNA delivery in vivo. It may potentially allow discovery of the function of a novel gene in the skin or for investigating new treatment for cutaneous diseases. ? 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",Animals; DNA transfer; Imiquimod; Immunology; Inflammation; Interleukin-15; Issue 122; Keratinocytes; Protein isoform; Skin,"aminoquinoline derivative; DNA; imiquimod; interleukin 15; membrane protein; Tlr7 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 7; agonists; alternative RNA splicing; animal; C57BL mouse; cell proliferation; cytology; dendritic cell; devices; drug effects; drug eruption; epidermis; female; genetic transfection; genetics; human; immunology; keratinocyte; metabolism; mutant mouse strain; pathology; procedures; skin; transgene; transgenic mouse; Alternative Splicing; Aminoquinolines; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Dendritic Cells; DNA; Drug Eruptions; Epidermis; Female; Humans; Interleukin-15; Keratinocytes; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Mutant Strains; Mice, Transgenic; Skin; Toll-Like Receptor 7; Transfection; Transgenes",2-s2.0-85017633985

This is due to the higher number of potential contaminants released to the water bodies leading to the potential risks to the human health. Raw water resources, including one river and three reservoirs representative of the major raw water resources in northern and central Taiwan, at four locations were selected to measure turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), oxidation and reduction potential (ORP), pH, alkalinity, total organic compounds (TOC), zeta potential, particle size, Al, Fe and heavy metal contents. Natural organic matter (NOM) was also examined using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography to distinguish the different molecular weight distribution of organic compounds, such as humic acids, that might affect the subsequent raw water treatment. TOC is highly related to NOM, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand, and the influent standard is 4 mg/L in Taiwan. EC, ORP, pH, alkalinity, TOC and zeta potential had values of 231.68–350.60 μS/cm, 210.5–271.55 mV, 8.17–8.58, 65.65–86.25 mg/L, 1.54–2.73 mg/L and –16.58 to –22.60 mV, respectively. However, average turbidity (128.24 NTU) and average particle size at the Daiji River (5,067.56 nm) were higher than those at the Shimen, Yongheshan and Liyutan Reservoirs (2.20–6.39 NTU and 1,105.12–1,627.26 nm, respectively). These measured data and metal contents (the latest three years’ data, at least two seasons including summer and autumn) met the regulatory standards in Taiwan. Water quality index (WQI) containing dissolved oxygen solubility, faecal coliforms, pH, BOD5, nitrates, total phosphates, temperature deviation, turbidity and total solids indicated good conditions for three reservoirs and medium condition for Daiji River.

Methods: Using population-based administrative data from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan, we identified 22,696 newly diagnosed migraineurs (mean age 44.5 years) and a matched migraine-free cohort of 90,784 individuals in the period 2000-2008. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted for assessing the ET risk for the migraine cohort compared to the migraine-free cohort. Results: After adjusting for covariates, the migraine cohort had a 1.83-fold increased risk (95% CI 1.50-2.23) of subsequent ET in comparison to the migraine-free cohort (8.97 vs. 4.81 per 10,000 person-years). In the subgroup analysis, patients with migraine were associated with higher risks of ET, regardless of gender, age or the existence of comorbidities. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated an association between migraine and ET, suggesting a possible shared pathophysiology underpinning both disorders. ? 2017 Lau et al.

This study investigated the prevalence and correlates of CSB among psychiatric patients who were given flunitrazepam. Methods: From June 2011 to May 2012, a total of 268 psychiatric outpatients who had received flunitrazepam for at least 3 months were enrolled. Data on occurrence of CSB, demographic characteristics, flunitrazepam dosage and duration of use, psychiatric diagnoses, physical illnesses, and alcohol use were collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the clinical correlates of CSB. Results: Sixty-six participants (24.6%) reported experiencing CSB. Logistic regression analysis showed that a high dosage (>2 mg/day) of flunitrazepam (odds ratio [OR] = 1.941, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.090–3.455, P = 0.024) and alcohol use (OR = 1.948, 95%CI = 1.023–3.709, P = 0.042) were significantly associated with the occurrence of CSB.

However, it is unknown if this procedure confers survival benefits on PMV patients in a post-ICU setting. Methods Patients who were admitted to the specialized weaning unit from 2005 to 2008 and received PMV were included in this study. On admission, data pertaining to patient characteristics, physiologic status, and type of artificial airway (tracheostomy vs. no tracheostomy) were obtained. Outcomes of tracheostomized and nontracheostomized patients were evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards and propensity score-matching models. The primary outcome of interest was 1-year survival. Results A total of 401 patients (mean age 74.4?years, 204 male) were identified. In multivariate analyses, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score [hazard ratio (HR)?=?1.061, 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?1.016–1.107] and presence of comorbidities, including congestive heart failure (HR?=?1.562, 95% CI?=?1.119–2.181), malignancy (HR?=?1.942, 95% CI?=?1.306–2.885), and liver cirrhosis (HR?=?2.373, 95% CI?=?1.015–5.544), were independently associated with 1-year mortality. An association between having tracheostomy and a better 1-year outcome was observed (HR?=?0.625, 95% CI?=?0.453–0.863). The matched cohort study also demonstrated a favorable 1-year survival for tracheostomized patients, and these patients had significantly lower in-hospital mortality (24% vs. 36%, p?=?0.049) and risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (10% vs. 20%, p?=?0.030) than nontracheostomized ones. Conclusion Preadmission tracheostomy may be associated with better outcomes of PMV patients in a post-ICU respiratory care setting. The findings suggest that this procedure should be recommended before PMV patients are transferred to specialized weaning units. ? 2016",outcome; prolonged mechanical ventilation; specialized weaning unit; tracheostomy; weaning,"aged; APACHE; Article; artificial ventilation; cohort analysis; comorbidity; congestive heart failure; controlled study; critical care outcome; diabetes mellitus; female; heart failure; hospital mortality; human; intensive care; length of stay; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mortality; prognosis; respiratory care; respiratory failure; respiratory tract disease; sex difference; tracheostomy; ventilator associated pneumonia; ventilator weaning; hospital mortality; intensive care unit; middle aged; multivariate analysis; Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated; statistical model; survival analysis; Taiwan; time factor; ventilator weaning; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Length of Stay; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Time Factors; Tracheostomy; Ventilator Weaning",2-s2.0-85002688842

Nursing is an applied science and the application of knowledge in practice is the ultimate goal of the nursing profession. The reform of the healthcare delivery model requires that nurses acquire and utilize evidence-based clinical knowledge, critical thinking, effective communication, and team collaboration skills in order to ensure the quality of patient care and safety. Therefore, baccalaureate education has become the minimal requirement for pre-licensure nursing education. Schools of nursing are responsible to cultivate competent nurses to respond to the demands on the nursing workforce from the healthcare system. Attaining a master's education in nursing helps cultivate Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) to further expand the roles and functions of the nursing profession in order to promote the quality of care in clinical practice. Nursing faculty and scholars of higher education institutions generate nursing knowledge and develop professional scholarship through research. Attaining a doctoral education in nursing cultivates faculties and scholars who will continually generate and disseminate nursing knowledge into the future.",baccalaureate education in nursing; nursing education; the advancement of nursing profession,"evidence based nursing; human; nurse; nurse attitude; nursing; nursing education; Education, Nursing; Evidence-Based Nursing; Humans; Nurse's Role; Nurses; Nursing",2-s2.0-85021857399

Methods: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study. All the clinical information of the study participants were acquired from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database for Catastrophic Illness Patients in Taiwan. We extracted data for all the patients newly diagnosed with prostate malignancy (ICD-9-CM 185 or C61 in ICD-10-CM) from 2000 to 2008. The patients were then divided into two groups: 7160 male ADT cohort receiving ADT and 7160 male non-ADT comparison group frequency matched by age and index year of ADT treatment of the ADT group. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the adjusted HR and 95% CIs of the IBS risk. Results: No significant difference was noted in the overall incidence rate for IBS between the ADT and non-ADT cohorts (0.86 and 0.89 per 1000 person-year, respectively, p=0.89). Even after adjusting for potential risk factors, a 1.06-fold risk of IBS (95% CI 0.62 to 1.82, p=0.82) was observed in the ADT cohort relative to the non-ADT cohorts. Moreover, we stratified the ADT cohort by time point of ADT treatment after PC diagnosis. Different IBS incidence rates were observed among the early ADT, late-ADT and non-ADT users at 0.77, 1.23 and 0.89 per 1000 person-years, respectively; nonetheless, the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, no difference was found between the ADT treatment types and IBS risk, including sole orchiectomy, sole luteinising-hormonereleasing hormone and both. Conclusions: Results showed that ADT treatment in patients with PC is not an independent factor for IBS incidence. Large sample sizes for patients with IBS with patients with PC who had received ADT treatment are needed for further study.",,"antiandrogen; bicalutamide; cyproterone; flutamide; goserelin; leuprorelin; triptorelin; antiandrogen; gonadorelin; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cohort analysis; comorbidity; human; intestine ischemia; ischemic bowel syndrome; major clinical study; male; orchiectomy; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; treatment duration; unspecified side effect; very elderly; adult; complication; factual database; incidence; irritable colon; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathology; proportional hazards model; prostate; prostate tumor; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Androgen Antagonists; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Humans; Incidence; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Orchiectomy; Proportional Hazards Models; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85014163493

Amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSCs) have the potential for the regeneration of impaired organs and the recovery of normal physiologic functions of damaged tissues without ethical concerns or risk of tumor formation. In this work, we aimed to examine the therapeutic effects of infusion of porcine AFSCs (pAFSCs) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Treatment with pAFSCs was shown to inhibit the shortening of the colon after induction of colitis and dramatically ameliorated the body weightloss induced by the DSS treatment. In addition, pAFSCs could also reduce the extent of the inflamed area represented by epithelial mesenchymal transformation in the colitis mice. The levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were also reduced in colitis mice transplanted with pAFSCs. In conclusion, pAFSCs can ameliorate experimental colitis in mice, suggesting that they may be a potential treatment for IBD or colitis. ? 2017 by The Chinese Physiological Society and Airiti Press Inc.",Colitis mouse model; Porcine amniotic fluid-derived stem cells,"dextran sulfate; gamma interferon; interleukin 6; amniotic fluid stem cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight loss; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; experimental colitis; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; mouse; nonhuman; pig; stem cell transplantation; amnion fluid; animal; colitis; cytology; disease model; embryonic stem cell; female; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; procedures; stem cell transplantation; transplantation; Amniotic Fluid; Animals; Colitis; Disease Models, Animal; Embryonic Stem Cells; Female; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Stem Cell Transplantation; Swine",2-s2.0-85041133079

This optical metrology system is constructed with shadow Moir? configuration and the fringe analysis algorithm. Developed with the Region of Interested (ROI) capturing technique and the Two-dimensional Wavelet Transform (2D-CWT) method, this algorithm is able to retrieve the height-correlated phase information from the shadow Moir? fringe patterns. Using a commercial video camera or a CMOS image sensor, this system could monitor the skin-vibration induced by the cyclic deformation of inner layered artery. The cross-sectional variation and the rhythm of heart cycle could be continuously measured for health monitoring purposes. The average vibration amplitude of the artery at the wrist ranges between 20 μm and 50 μm, which is quite subtle comparing with the skin surface structure. Having the non-stationary motion of human body, the traditional phase shifting (PS) technique can be very unstable due to the requirement of several frames of images, especially for case that artery is continuously pumping. To bypass this fundamental issue, the shadow Moir? technique is introduced to enhance the surface deformation characteristic. And the phase information is retrieved by the means of spectrum filtering instead of PS technique, which the phase is calculated from intensity maps of multiple images. The instantaneous surface can therefore be reconstructed individually from each frame, enabling the subtle arterial-induced skin vibration measurement. The comparative results of phase reconstruction between different fringe analysis algorithms will be demonstrated numerically and experimentally. And the electrocardiography (ECG) results will used as the reference for the validity of health monitoring potential of the non-contact arterial-induced skin vibration inspection system. ?

Conventional mouse models cannot adequately address the triggering mechanism and immunopathological pathways in GNLY-associated diseases due to lack of the GNLY gene in the mouse genome. Therefore, we generated a humanized immune system (HIS) mouse model by transplanting human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells into NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice after sublethally irradiation. We examined the GNLY expression and its effects on tumor growth using this system. Our HIS mice expressed human CD45+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ cells in the peripheral blood and spleen. A high expression level of human Th1/Th2 and NK cytokines was detected, indicating the activation of both T and NK cells. Importantly, we found an elevated level of GNLY in the serum and it was produced by human CTLs and NK cells obtained from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and spleen cells in the HIS mice. The serum level of GNLY was negatively correlated with the proliferation of transplanted tumor cells in HIS mice. Collectively, our findings strongly supported that HIS mouse as a valuable model for studying human cancer under an intact immune system and the role of GNLY in tumorigenesis. ?

However, the studies about nephroureterectomy (NU) in this high surgical risk group are limited. The aim of this study is to investigate the outcomes of NU in this population. Results: There were total 931 patients enrolled and 218, 582, 131 patients were non-NU, unilateral and one-stage bilateral NU, respectively. NU provided better 5-year overall survival (66% versus 51% in non-NU, P = 0.001). 19.7% of patients with unilateral NU had successive contralateral NU with a mean interval period of 695 days. Even for the elderly, there were no significant difference in duration of hospitalization, 30-and 90-day mortality between unilateral and bilateral NU. Materials and Methods: Patients on dialysis with UTUC between January 1998 and December 2012 were assessed from the nationwide cohort of Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. We classified these patients into non-NU and NU groups. In NU group, we analyzed clinical outcomes of patient groups between different NU types and surgical methods. Conclusions: Although the high surgical risk in patients on dialysis with UTUC, NU provided better 5-year overall survival. One-stage bilateral NU both provides comparable safety profile and avoids 19.7% of successive contralateral NU in less than two years. Even in the elderly, one-stage bilateral NU is safe and feasible. ?

Patients and Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 5468 patients who received a diagnosis of primary gastric cancer at National Taiwan University Hospital between 1980 and 2010. Of these, we identified 18 patients with HCC. Results: Regarding the double cancer cases, six patients received a diagnosis of synchronous cancers, six patients received a diagnosis of HCC during follow-up for gastric cancer, and six patients had undergone HCC treatment before receiving a gastric cancer diagnosis. All the patients who received an HCC diagnosis after gastric cancer underwent curative therapy, except for one patient who had a large hepatic tumor. By contrast, of the patients who received an HCC diagnosis first, only one received an early gastric cancer diagnosis, and the remaining patients received an advanced gastric cancer diagnosis. Despite the presence of double cancers, surgical mortality did not occur in the patients who underwent curative-intended treatment. Conclusion: The study results suggest the necessity of closely following up patients with gastric cancer or HCC for the early diagnosis and treatment of the other malignancy. Aggressive treatments including surgery and radiofrequency ablation are safe and can prolong survival in some patients. ? 2017 Formosan Journal of Surgery.",Double primary cancer; Gastric cancer; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Surgery,alpha fetoprotein; carcinoembryonic antigen; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer therapy; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical practice; early diagnosis; female; follow up; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; medical record; personal experience; postoperative complication; prevalence; primary tumor; priority journal; stomach cancer; subphrenic abscess; surgical mortality; Taiwan; treatment indication; very elderly; wound infection,2-s2.0-85028813949

This study chronologically examined the changing features and research fronts of acupuncture and elucidated the differences among the six most productive countries.METHODS: Bibliographic coupling is a powerful tool for identifying the research fronts of a field. Acupuncture-related publications worldwide and from the six most productive countries during 1983-2012 were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Science Citation Index. To form the research fronts, the 100 most highly cited papers (HCPs) were clustered in terms of references shared.RESULTS: The United States had the highest proportion of HCPs. The effectiveness of acupuncture in areas such as relieving neck and back pain, migraines and headaches, and knee osteoarthritis symptoms was a predominant topic. Initially, the endogenous opioid peptide system was the primary research focus in the acupuncture mechanism research; however, during 1993-2012, researchers focused more on the functional magnetic resonance imaging of brain activity. In addition, acupuncture use and prevalence, the attitudes of health practitioners, and the effects of expectancy and belief were also major topics. Researches from Western countries, including the United States, England, and Germany, showed more interest in clinical trials and economic- and ethics-related studies, whereas those from East Asian countries including China, Japan, and South Korea focused more on mechanism research.CONCLUSION: Western countries dominated the research fronts of acupuncture.

Patients sometimes report these symptoms when undergoing spinal anesthesia for cesarean sections (CSs). We designed a prospective, double-blind study to investigate the effectiveness of tenoxicam in preventing these symptoms of discomfort. Methods:A total of 105 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-II nulliparous pregnant women, who were scheduled for a CS, were enrolled into this prospective, double-blind study. Spinal anesthesia was conducted to reach a peak dermatome level of no more than T3. The 100 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups having completed study course: Group T (N = 50) received a 20 mg dose of tenoxicam in 5 mL of normal saline (NS) immediately after skin incision and Group N (N = 50) only received 5 mL NS. The incidence and severity of the symptoms experienced by the patients were recorded by a nurse anesthetist who was blinded to the injection regimen the patients were receiving. A chi-square test was used for statistical analysis t test and P < .05 was defined as significant. Results:The incidence and degree of severity of nausea and vomiting were same in both the groups. The incidence and degree of severity of bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, tightness of the chest, shoulder discomfort, and abdominal discomfort were lower in Group T than in Group N. Conclusion:Tenoxicam might theoretically block the parasympathetic vagus pathway and decrease the visceral pain or visceral-specific symptoms, alleviating the symptoms caused by vagotonia. However, the prophylactic effect of tenoxicam in reducing the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting was not statistically significant. This could be because nausea and vomiting are not solely caused by vagotonia, but also by other mechanisms. ? 2017 the Author(s).

Antihypertensive drugs often cause various side effects, and improper use of antihypertensive medications can result in irreparable damage. Edible fungi of the Monascus species have been used as traditional Chinese medicines in Southeast Asia for several centuries. The fermented products of Monascus purpureus NTU 568 (ANKASCIN 568) possess a number of functional secondary metabolites including the anti-inflammatory pigments monascin (MS) and ankaflavin (AK). In this study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in which patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to receive placebo or two 500-mg capsules of Ankascin 568 for 8 weeks. The effects of this treatment on the regulation of blood pressure (BP) were then examined. The results showed that systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from 141.6 ± 12.0 to 133.9 ± 14.4 mmHg (P < 0.05), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased from 91.7 ± 8.1 to 84.8 ± 7.4 mmHg (P < 0.05). Moreover, Ankascin 568 treatment effectively reduced serum triglycerides and total cholesterol (TC), increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, thereby improving the serum lipid profile. Additionally, administration of Ankascin 568 did not cause significant rhabdomyolysis nor impaired the metabolic or physiological functions of the liver or kidney. In conclusion, patients administered Ankascin 568 for 8 weeks exhibited significant in reduction of SBP, serum TC and LDL-C levels, which should contribute to better cardiovascular health. ? 2017 by The Chinese Physiological Society and Airiti Press Inc.",Ankaflavin; Ankascin 568; Hypertension; Monascin; Monascus purpureus NTU 568,"alanine aminotransferase; ankascin 568; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; calcium; chloride; cholesterol; creatine kinase; creatinine; gamma glutamyltransferase; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; natural product; placebo; potassium; sodium; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; uric acid; antihypertensive agent; biological factor; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin blood level; blood pressure regulation; calcium blood level; chloride blood level; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; creatine kinase blood level; creatinine blood level; diastolic blood pressure; double blind procedure; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; human; hypertension; male; middle aged; Monascus purpureus; potassium blood level; randomized controlled trial; rhabdomyolysis; side effect; sodium blood level; systolic blood pressure; triacylglycerol blood level; urea nitrogen blood level; uric acid blood level; blood; blood pressure; chemistry; drug effects; hypertension; Monascus; Antihypertensive Agents; Biological Factors; Blood Pressure; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Monascus; Triglycerides",2-s2.0-85024911500

Increasing evidence in neuroscience has indicated that schizophrenia arises from abnormal connections within or between networks, hence called dysconnectvity syndrome. Recently, we established an automatic method to analyze integrity of the white matter tracts over the whole brain based on diffusion MRI data, named tract-based automatic analysis (TBAA), and used this method to study white matter connection in patients with schizophrenia. We found that alteration of tract integrity is hereditary and inherent; it is found in siblings and in patients in the early phase of disease. Moreover, patients with good treatment outcome and those with poor outcome show distinctly different patterns of alterations, suggesting that these two groups of patients might be distinguishable based on the difference in tract alteration. In summary, the altered tracts revealed by TBAA might become potential biomarkers or trait markers for schizophrenia. ? 2017 SPIE.",Diffusion Spectrum Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Schizophrenia; Tract-based automatic analysis; White Matter,Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Patient treatment; Automatic analysis; Biological underpinnings; Diffusion spectrum imaging; Mental disorders; Schizophrenia; Treatment outcomes; White matter; White matter tracts; Diseases,2-s2.0-85023743558

Renal supportive care (RSC) is an important option for elderly individu- als reaching end-stage renal disease; however, the frequency of RSC practice is very low among Asian countries. We evaluated the attitude, the knowledge, and the preference for specific topics concerning RSC among participants who worked in different medical professions in Taiwan. Methods. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was employed. Healthcare personnel (N = 598) who were involved in caring for end-stage renal disease patients at more than 40 facilities in Taiwan participated in this study. Participants were asked about their motivation for learning about RSC, the topics of RSC they were most and least interested in, their willingness to provide RSC, and to rate their knowledge and perceived importance of different topics. Results. The vast majority of respondents (81.9%) were self-motivated about RSC, among whom nephrologists (96.8%) and care facilitators (administrators/volunteers) (45%) exhibited the highest and the least motivation, respectively (p<0:01). Overall, respondents indicated that they had adequate knowledge about the five pre-specified RSC topics between medical professions (p = 0.04). Medical professions and institu- tional size exerted significant influence on the willingness to provide RSC. Conclusions. Our results facilitate the understanding of the knowledge and attitude toward different RSC topics among varied medical professions, and can guide the design of RSC education content for healthcare personnel. ? 2017 Tsai et al.",Allied health occupations; Cross-sectional studies; Dialysis; End-stage renal disease; Medical center; Medical education; Palliative care; Renal supportive care; Taiwan,advance care planning; Article; attitude to health; community hospital; cross-sectional study; dialysis; end stage renal disease; health care; health care facility; health care survey; health personnel attitude; hospital volunteer; human; major clinical study; motivation; nephrologist; questionnaire; renal supportive care,2-s2.0-85021936837

Potential mediators that may link to elderly eating out and depressive symptoms are also discussed. Methods: A unique dataset of 1,184 individuals aged 65 and older was drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Survey in 2008 in Taiwan. A bivariate probit model and an instrumental variable probit model were estimated to account for correlated, unmeasured factors that may be associated with both the decision and frequency of eating out and depressive symptoms in the elderly. An additional analysis is conducted to check whether the nutrient intakes and body weights can been seen as mediators that link the association between eating out and depressive symptoms of the elderly. Results: Elderly people who eat out are 38 percent points more likely to have depressive symptoms than their counterparts who do not eat out, after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and other factors. A positive association between the frequency of eating out and the likelihood of having depressive symptoms of the elderly is also found. It is evident that one addition meal away from home is associated with an increase of the likelihood of being depressed by 3.8 percentage points. With respect to the mediations, we find that nutrient intakes and body weight are likely to serve as mediators for the positive relationship between eating out and depressive symptoms in the elderly. Conclusion: Our results show that elderly who eat out have a higher chance of having depressive symptoms. To prevent depressive symptoms in the elderly, policy makers should be aware of the relationship among psychological status, physical health and nutritional health when assisting the elderly to better manage their food consumption away from home. Limitations and Implications for Future Research: Our study have some caveats. First, the interpretation of our results on the causality issue calls for caution in that our analysis relies on a crosssectional survey. Second, other measures to define elderly depression, such as the Center for Epidemiological Studies- Depression (CES-D) score, can be used to check the robustness of our findings. Finally, the availability of food outlets in the local area and family characteristics are possibly associated with food away from home of the elderly. If data permit, the relationship between eating out and elderly depressive symptoms can be better identified after controlling for variables related to food facilities and family characteristics. ? 2017 ICMPE.",,aged; body weight; Conference Paper; depression; eating; explanatory variable; family size; female; food intake; geriatric care; health; health care survey; human; instrumental variable analysis; male; nutritional health; psychological aspect; Short Form 36; Taiwan; depression; feeding behavior; geriatric assessment; health survey; procedures; psychology; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Depression; Feeding Behavior; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85020920694

This nationwide cohort study clarifies the role of PORT in the survival of pN2 lung adenoCA (WT EGFR) and squCA patients Patients and Methods: We analyzed data of patients with adenoCA (WT EGFR) and squCA collected from the Taiwan Cancer Registry database. The patients were categorized into five groups according to the treatment modality: Group 1 (surgery alone), Group 2 (adjuvant chemotherapy [CT] alone), Group 3 (adjuvant radiotherapy [RT] alone), Group 4 (adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy [CCRT]), and Group 5 (adjuvant sequential CT and intensity-modulated RT [IMRT]). Results: We enrolled 588 lung adenoCA (WT EGFR) and squCA patients without distant metastasis. After adjustments for age at surgery, surgical years, and Charlson comorbidity index scores, the multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that adjusted HRs (aHRs; 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for the overall mortality of female lung adenoCA (WT EGFR) patients were 0.257 (0.111-0.594), 0.530 (0.226- 1.243), 0.192 (0.069-0.534), and 0.399 (0.172-0.928) in Groups 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. For male lung squCA patients, the aHRs (95% CIs) for overall mortality were 0.269 (0.160-0.451), 0.802 (0.458-1.327), 0.597 (0.358-0.998), and 0.456 (0.265-0.783) in Groups 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Conclusions: Adjuvant CCRT or sequential CT and IMRT at ?5000 cGy significantly reduced the mortality rate of female lung adenoCA (WT EGFR) and male squCA pN2 patients. ?

An empirical study of different competition measures comparison in Taiwan,2017,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014440639&doi=10.1177%2f0046958017690289&partnerID=40&md5=d255dd3ef10485f1be92fb4e553c0159,"Different approaches to measure the hospital competition index might lead to inconsistent results of the effects of hospital competition on innovation adoption. The purpose of this study is to adopt a different approach to define market area and measure the level of competition to examine whether hospital competition has a positive effect on hospital behavior, taking quality indicator projects participation as an example. A total of 238 hospitals located in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung were recruited in this study. Competition index was used as the independent variable, and participation lists of Taiwan Clinical Performance Indicator and Taiwan Healthcare Indicator Series in 2012 were used as dependent variables. All data used in this study were retrieved from the 2012 national hospital profiles and the participation list of the 2 quality indicator projects in 2012; these profiles are issued by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare annually. Geopolitical boundaries and 4 kinds of fixed radiuses were used to define market area. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and hospital density were used to measure the level of competition. A total of 12 competition indices were produced in this study by employing the geographic information system, while max-rescaled R2 was used to evaluate and compare the models on goodness of fit. The results show that the effects of hospital competition on quality indicator projects participation were varied, which mean different indicators for market competition might reveal different conclusions. Furthermore, this study also found the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index at 5-km radius was the optimum competition index. ?

Methods: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance program. Women who underwent concurrent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at hysterectomy for benign indications (n=34,509) were compared with those who had hysterectomy only (n=176,305). Separate models were estimated to account for the effect of baseline comorbid condition, age, and hysterectomy approach on the relationship between bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and study outcomes. A secondary analysis was also performed to evaluate the association of inpatient readmission within 30 days and complications among women who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Results: The addition of a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to hysterectomy was associated with a lower risk of surgical complications, a longer length of hospital stay, and an increased risk of inpatient readmission within 30 days. Among women who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, women with complications were also more likely to require inpatient readmission within 30 days than those without complications. Our data also suggested that bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was not associated with an overall risk of medical complications, with the exception of urethral obstruction. The relationships remained even after adjustments by age, surgical indications, hysterectomy approach, and health-related risk factors, such as baseline comorbid condition and status of any prior catastrophic illness. Conclusions: Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at hysterectomy for benign conditions is not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital complications. ? 2016 by The North American Menopause Society.",Complication; Hysterectomy; Laparoscopy; Morbidity; Oophorectomy; Readmission,"abdominal hysterectomy; accidental injury; adult; age; aged; Article; cerebrovascular disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; endometriosis; female; heart infarction; hospital patient; hospital readmission; human; hysterectomy; kidney disease; laceration; length of stay; lung insufficiency; major clinical study; middle aged; ovariectomy; pelvis injury; peroperative complication; population research; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; precancer; retrospective study; risk factor; salpingooophorectomy; secondary analysis; surgical infection; surgical injury; surgical wound; terminal disease; thromboembolism; treatment indication; urethra obstruction; urinary tract injury; uterus myoma; uterus prolapse; vaginal hysterectomy; comparative study; gynecologic disease; hospitalization; hysterectomy; multimodality cancer therapy; postoperative complication; procedures; salpingooophorectomy; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Aged; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Genital Diseases, Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Hysterectomy; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Salpingo-oophorectomy; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84992410827

We evaluated whether acute kidney injury (AKI) in the elderly affected their risk for diagnostic discrepancy. Patients aged ?60 years from the general medical wards were prospectively enrolled and divided according to AKI status upon admission, using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. We compared their discharge and admission diagnoses and identified patients with a diagnostic discrepancy, using multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between initial AKI and the presence of a diagnostic discrepancy. A total of 188 participants (mean age, 77.9 years) were recruited. Regression analysis showed that initial AKI on admission was associated with a higher risk of diagnostic discrepancy upon discharge (odds ratio [OR] 3.3; p < 0.01). In contrast, higher AKI severity was also associated with an increased risk of diagnostic discrepancy (for KDIGO grade 1, 2, and 3; OR 2.92, 3.91, and 4.32; p = 0.04, 0.03, and 0.02, respectively), suggesting that initial AKI upon admission could be an important risk factor for diagnostic discrepancy. Consequently, reducing geriatric AKI might have the potential to reduce diagnostic discrepancy among these patients. ? 2016 The Author(s).",,acute kidney failure; aged; cohort analysis; diagnostic error; female; geriatrics; human; male; pilot study; regression analysis; risk factor; Acute Kidney Injury; Aged; Cohort Studies; Diagnostic Errors; Female; Geriatrics; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85006355848

We further examined how such a policy might affect accessibility to care as well as the potential for financial losses in low-volume hospitals. Methods: The study population included 9530 patients who underwent PTCA or CABG for the first time between 2010 and 2012. We used multilevel logistic regression and G-computation to estimate the number of potentially avoidable adverse outcomes, and we predicted how many patients would have to travel farther to access medical care as a result of a centralization policy. Finally, we predicted the impact that centralization of surgery would have on inpatient revenue in low-volume hospitals by calculating the ratio of revenue from inpatient cardiac procedures to total hospital inpatient revenue. Results: We found that 4,150 of the 9,530 patients who underwent CABG were admitted to low-volume hospitals. We estimated that centralization of PTCA and CABG could reduce the number of deaths by 442 and 127, respectively, and 12% of the patients who underwent PTCA and 18% of patients who underwent CABG would have to travel farther to access medical care. We determined that low-volume hospitals incurred financial losses of approximately 6% and 2%, respectively, by referring PTCA and CABG patients to higher-volume surgical centers. Conclusions: Centralization policies could have a positive impact on healthcare outcomes, only a minor impact on accessibility to care for patients, and minor financial consequences for low-volume hospitals.

Methods: Using reimbursement claims from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database, a nationwide retrospective cohort study was undertaken of patients with diabetes mellitus who participated in the DM-P4P programme from 2006–2008. Glycosylated haemoglobin results were used to evaluate modifications in therapy in response to poor diabetes control. Prescription patterns were used to assign patients to either a therapeutic inertia group or an intensified treatment group. Therapeutic inertia was defined as the failure to act on a known problem. Results: The research sample comprised of 168 876 patients with diabetes mellitus who had undergone 899 135 tests. Of these, 37.4% (336 615 visits) of prescriptions were for a combination of two types of drug and 27.7% (248 788 visits) were for a combination of three types of drug. The proportion of patients in the intensified therapy group who were prescribed more than two types of drug was considerably higher than that in the therapeutic inertia group.

In this study, we attempted to determine the role of NP-59 in identifying APA prior to adrenalectomy, especially when diagnostic computer tomography (CT) is equivocal. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis in patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. The medical records of 36 patients were reviewed, which included 25 patients who had received adrenalectomy. All patients underwent adrenal CT alone or a combination of adrenal CT and NP-59 prior to surgery for the subtyping of primary aldosteronism, based on the protocols established in our institution. The accuracy of the adrenal CT and NP-59 findings was determined by a comparison with the pathologic findings and postoperative outcomes. Results Twenty-three patients received unilateral adrenalectomy under the diagnosis of APA. The diagnoses were based on CT findings in 11 patients and on CT and NP-59 findings in 12 patients. The results of pathology were adrenal cortical adenoma in these 23 patients and the positive predictive value was 100%. Blood pressure and potassium levels significantly improved after surgery in these patients (p?<?0.01). Serum biochemistry and adrenal size of the limbs and bodies of patients with IHA were not significantly different from those of patients with APA. Conclusion For the subtyping of primary aldosteronism, the imaging modality of adrenal CT alone or the combination of adrenal CT and NP-59 adrenal scan has a high positive predictive value for APAs. We suggest that all patients undergo an adrenal CT as their initial study, after confirming the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, and to use NP-59 when adrenal CT findings are atypical or inconclusive. Lateralization by this modality prior to adrenalectomy can reduce unnecessarily invasive examinations such as adrenal venous sampling and also provide excellent treatment outcomes. ? 2015",adrenal adenoma; adrenal venous sampling; idiopathic hyperaldosteronism; NP-59 adrenal scintigraphy; primary aldosteronism,6beta iodomethyl 19 norcholest 5(10) en 3beta ol i 131; potassium; adrenal cortex adenoma; adrenal gland examination; adrenal radiography; adrenal size; adrenalectomy; adult; Article; blood pressure; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; female; histopathology; human; hyperaldosteronism; idiopathic disease; idiopathic hyperaldosteronism; intermethod comparison; male; medical record review; organ size; postoperative period; potassium blood level; predictive value; primary hyperaldosteronism; priority journal; radiodiagnosis; retrospective study,2-s2.0-84924135891

Methods: We conducted a population-based, retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study using data from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance program. Women who were aged 65 years or older with vaginal hysterectomy (n=290) were compared with women who had laparoscopic hysterectomy for nonprolapsed benign indications (n=290). Propensity score was calculated based on both patient- (age, socioeconomic status, residential urbanicity, comorbidity, status of any prior catastrophic illness, surgical diagnosis, and year of hysterectomy) and provider-related characteristics (physician's age and sex, hospital accreditation level, and ownership type). Results: Women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy were not associated with increased risk of inpatient readmission within 30 days, in-hospital mortality, and in-hospital (including intraoperative) complications when compared with those who had vaginal hysterectomy. Women in the laparoscopic group had significantly shorter hospital stays than those in the vaginal group. The bleeding complications were mostly due to blood transfusion (2.1% in vaginal and 0.7% in laparoscopic hysterectomy groups) and urinary tract infection (1.0% in vaginal and 1.7% in laparoscopic hysterectomy groups). The surgical injury (intraoperative) complications included mostly surgical laceration of the urinary tract (0.7% in vaginal and 0.3% in laparoscopic hysterectomy groups). Conclusions: Advanced age alone should not be the limiting factor for surgical referral of laparoscopic hysterectomy. The shorter hospital stay and low in-hospital complications associated with laparoscopic, as opposed to vaginal hysterectomies, are important attributes of a surgical procedure essential to the postoperative care in older women aged 65 years or more. ? 2016 by The North American Menopause Society.",Complication; Hysterectomy; Laparoscopy; Morbidity; Older; Vaginal,"acute kidney failure; acute respiratory failure; aged; Article; bleeding; blood transfusion; brain hemorrhage; brain infarction; brain ischemia; cellulitis; central nervous system disease; cerebrovascular disease; Clostridium difficile infection; cohort analysis; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; female; groups by age; hospital mortality; hospital patient; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; hysterectomy; intermethod comparison; laceration; laparoscopic hysterectomy; lung edema; lung embolism; lung insufficiency; major clinical study; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; outcome assessment; pneumonia; postoperative complication; postoperative infection; propensity score; pyelonephritis; retrospective study; sepsis; seroma; surgical infection; surgical injury; thrombophlebitis; urinary tract infection; urinary tract obstruction; urine retention; vaginal hysterectomy; venous thromboembolism; age; comparative study; hysterectomy; laparoscopy; length of stay; mortality; peroperative complication; postoperative complication; procedures; propensity score; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; vaginal hysterectomy; Age Factors; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Hysterectomy, Vaginal; Intraoperative Complications; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Patient Readmission; Postoperative Complications; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84980043228

Few studies have focused on predicting persistently positive patients who are at high risk of tuberculosis reactivation. We screened dialysis patients, and used QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube (QFT-GIT) to identify LTBI. Of the 157 participants who had initially positive QFT-GIT, 82 had persistently positivity and 75 had negative conversion. The persistently positive group were younger, more were current smokers, and had higher plasma level of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) and QFT-GIT responses than the negative conversion group. Multivariate logistic regression for persistent positivity revealed that high plasma sTREM-1 and QFT-GIT response, young age and TB contact history were independent factors. Currently smoking had borderline significance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using the multi-factor model was 0.878, higher than 0.821 by QFT-GIT response of 0.95 IU/ml. In conclusion, dialysis patients with persistent LTBI status may be associated with a young age, high plasma sTREM-1, strong QFT-GIT response, currently smoking, and TB contact history. If resources are limited, these five predictors can be used to prioritize QFT-GIT-positive dialysis patients for LTBI treatment. ?

DKD is a clinical syndrome, characterized by persistent albuminuria (daily urine protein loss >300 minigram), declined glomerular filtration rate, arterial pressure elevation, increase cardiovascular events and mortality rate. In Taiwan, the major group of incidental dialysis is patients with diabetes mellitus. The number of receiving dialysis patients with diabetes mellitus is still increasing up to date.

Risk factors of DKD include ethics, sex, albuminuria, hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, gene susceptibility, etc. More recent researches have proved that adequate blood sugar control prevents from occurrence of complications and relieve progression of DKD. Although there are many kinds of blood glucose-lowering drugs in the past decades, the number of people achieving goals of blood sugar control is still limited.

Methods: The patients’ QOL was assessed within 14?days and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24?months after injury. In each QOL domain, 4 latent growth curve models (LGMs, including non-growth, linear growth, quadratic growth, and cubic LGM) were adopted to examine the QOL trajectories across the 6 time points. Results: A total of 499 patients completed the 6 assessments. For all 4 QOL domains, the cubic LGM had the best model fitting (root-mean-square error of approximation?<?0.01) revealing that the patients’ 4 QOL domains changed with cubic trajectories: QOL improved in the first 6?months, deteriorated in the second 6?months, and improved smoothly at 12–24?months after injury.

Centralization should improve outcomes and increase the level of care by ensuring that patients are referred to high-quality providers. This article reviews (1) the development of centralization policies and (2) centralization strategies applied in the United States, Canada, and countries in Europe and Asia. We also discuss the impacts that centralization policies have had on surgery outcomes as well as implications for the future of centralization policies in Taiwan. The vast majority of centralization policies focus on rare or high-risk surgeries, such as those performed to treat heart problems or cancer. There are currently two types of intervention: setting minimum volume standards and selecting designated referral centers. A review of relevant literature showed that, for most countries, centralization policies led to better healthcare outcomes; however, some studies noted that centralization can reduce accessibility to care. Nonetheless, we suggest that Taiwan consider adopting centralization as a policy to improve the quality of healthcare. However, future research will be required to estimate the effectiveness of centralization on high-risk surgeries.",Centralization; Quality of healthcare; Regionalization; Volume-outcome studies,Canada; cancer susceptibility; centralization; Europe; heart; human; patient referral; regionalization; scientist; surgery; surgical technique; Taiwan; United States,2-s2.0-85007284605

Methods: Facilitators interviewed residents (age ? 50 years) with the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) for VRQoL and a questionnaire on clinical information, ophthalmic care utilization and satisfaction. Results: A total of 841 participants (response rate 93.4 %, 841/900) completed the questionnaire survey. Mean age was 63.7 (±10. 7) years. The common eye diseases were cataract (44.7 %), dry eye (15.5 %), and glaucoma (8.7 %). Among the participants, 61.0 % sought ophthalmic care under the IDS in the past year and 17.6 % experienced unmet ophthalmic needs in the past 6 months.

SCH is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but convenient risk indicators are lacking. We aimed to identify reliable indicators of cardiovascular risk for determining initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in SCH patients. This is a cross-sectional retrospective study. Medical records of 412 consecutive healthy subjects with SCH who underwent routine health check-ups at National Taiwan University Hospital between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009 were reviewed. Demographic, physical and clinical data were collected, including waist circumference, body mass index, thyroid function tests, fasting blood glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipid profiles. Subjects were divided into three groups by HbA1c level: ? 5.6%, 5.7%-6.4%, and ? 6.5%.

HbA1c levels > 5.7% are associated with cardiovascular risk in SCH patients. HbA1c is an objective, convenient parameter for determining initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in SCH patients with higher cardiovascular risk. Further studies are needed to demonstrate HbA1c capability for predicting cardiovascular risk in SCH patients and whether T4 treatment can improve outcomes. ? 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Results: After Tw-DRGs were implemented, the DRG group had lower medical expenses, a lower inpatient transfer rate, and a lower mortality rate within 180 days after discharge compared to the non-DRG group. In contrast, after Tw-DRGs were implemented, the DRG group had a higher readmission rate within 180 days after discharge compared to the non-DRG group. Conclusions: After implementing the Tw-DRGs payment system, the medical expenses, mortality rate within 180 days after discharge, and inpatient transfer rate had decreased, but the readmission rate within 180 days after discharge had increased.

Cryopreservation of immature oocytes, particularly those at metaphase I (MI), remains a challenge. In the present work, mouse MI oocytes denuded of cumulus cells were vitrified and warmed (V/W) either prior to (V/W-BEFORE-IVM, n = 562) or after (V/W-AFTER-IVM, n = 664) in vitro maturation (IVM). Derivative metaphase II (MII) oocytes were then used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In the control groups, in vivo matured MII oocytes were used freshly (FRESH-MII, n = 517) or after V/W (MII-V/W, n = 617). In vitro and in vivo developmental competencies were compared among groups. Satisfactory blastocyst rates were achieved in V/W-BEFORE-IVM (27.5%) and V/W-AFTER-IVM (32.4%) groups, albeit as expected still lower than those from fresh-MII (56.1%) or MII-V/W (45.6%) oocytes. Similarly, the term development rates from V/W-BEFORE-IVM and V/W-AFTER-IVM were 12.4% and 16.7% respectively, acceptable but lower than those of the fresh-MII (41.2%) and MII-V/W (23.3%) groups. These data demonstrate that oocytes collected at MI stage are amenable to V/W, which can be performed before or after IVM with acceptable development rates including production of healthy pups.

Several safety concerns have emerged after the excessive use of z-hypnotics. This study aims to characterize the z-hypnotics users with a focus on those with overlapping duration of z-hypnotics supply by using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Methods Incident z-hypnotic users who received at least one z-hypnotic prescription from outpatient settings during 2001–2010 were identified and classified into three groups: duplicated users (those who received multiple z-hypnotic prescriptions on the same day), suspected duplicated users (those who received multiple z-hypnotic prescriptions with 7+?days of overlapping supply), and nonduplicated users. We examined the demographic profiles of these z-hypnotic users as well as z-hypnotics prescriptions (duration, daily consumption, and characteristics of providers). Results We identified 242,412 incident users of z-hypnotics with 2.4 million z-hypnotic prescriptions during the 10-year study. Almost 20% of them were duplicated (n?=?29,948) and suspected duplicated users (n?=?16,899). Duplicated and suspected duplicated users were more likely to be male and in their old age compared to the nonduplicated users. Approximately half of the suspected duplicated users (51.8%) and nonduplicated users (47.0%) received their z-hypnotic prescriptions from primary care clinics while duplicated users received their z-hypnotic prescriptions from metropolitan hospitals (29.9%) and academic medical center (26.2%). Duplicated z-hypnotic users were more likely to receive more days’ supply and higher daily dose of z-hypnotics. Up to 31.0% of duplicated z-hypnotics users received > 1 defined daily dose/day if adding all prescriptions they received within 1?day.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of this new policy on smoking cessation services from the physician's perspective. Methods: This was a cross-sectional nationwide survey. Physicians who provided smoking cessation services for more than ten patient encounters in the preceding year of the new policy (February 2011 to March 2012) were recruited. The questionnaire was developed by two experts and was validated by a committee consisting of 11 delegates. Results: We sent a total of 1,319 questionnaires. The response rate was 45.9 %. The majority of respondents were male (88.4 %), middle-aged (65.3 %), and worked as family physicians (56.1 %). Most physicians agreed that the new policy had increased the number of patients seeking smoking cessation, increased patients' willingness to adopt pharmacotherapy, helped physicians to prescribe medications, improved patients' adherence to medications, and improved quality of care. These changes were most prominent in medical centers. Changes in the practice of the 5As (ask, advise, assess, assist, arrange) were moderate. Among different medical settings, the most significant change was an increase in the expenditure on smoking cessation medications. Conclusions: The new subsidization policy in Taiwan has improved smoking cessation services. Overall, physicians reported positive effects of the new policy. Further study is warranted to evaluate the long-term influence of the policy. ? 2016 Wu et al.",Cross-sectional study; Government's subsidization; Smoking cessation services,"adult; clinical article; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; drug therapy; general practitioner; government; human; instrument validation; male; medication compliance; middle aged; questionnaire; smoking cessation; Taiwan; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; economics; female; health care quality; medical care; smoking cessation; statistics and numerical data; nicotine gum; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Assistance; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Quality of Health Care; Smoking Cessation; Taiwan; Tobacco Use Cessation Products",2-s2.0-84971573774

Case Report We reported our experience in monitoring on immunosuppressive drugs for 2 cases. Both of them underwent heart transplantation in 2006 and were 34 and 37 years old at time of pregnancy. For both cases, we frequently monitored the blood level and increased the dosage of immunosuppressive drugs accordingly. Both cases had uneventful pregnancy and delivery to healthy babies at the National Taiwan University Hospital in Taiwan. Their postpartum courses were uneventful as well.

Challenges arise when trying to identify the target genes of lncRNAs. A popular approach is to select possible target genes of specific lncRNAs based on the similarity of their expression patterns. However, such associations have not been validated in the context of the whole human genome. Methods: To address this issue, ten microarray datasets with at least 100 samples from five tissue types were analyzed in this study. All datasets were examined using the Affymetrix u133plus 2.0 platform. Probes targeting lncRNAs were identified by performing re-annotation of the probe sequences, and the link between lncRNAs and their target genes was retrieved from an online database. We manually annotated the link file with information about the regulation mechanism and tissue types. Results: A total of 956 lncRNAs and their target genes were identified as having regulation at the transcriptional level. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated in all datasets, and low correlations were observed. A resampling test demonstrated that the expression levels of lncRNAs and their target genes showed similar correlations in the pairs obtained by real data and random selection. Further investigations were performed by identifying lncRNAs with differential expression and tissue specificity; however, low correlations were still observed. Conclusions: In conclusion, gene expression microarray data are not a valid way to identify possible target genes of lncRNAs. ? Translational Cancer Research.

The enrichment design is an efficient design that enrolls only the patients testing positive for specific molecular targets and randomly assigns them for the targeted treatment or the concurrent control. However there is no diagnostic device with perfect accuracy and precision for detecting molecular targets. In particular, the positive predictive value (PPV) can be quite low for rare diseases with low prevalence. Under the enrichment design, some patients testing positive for specific molecular targets may not have the molecular targets. The efficacy of the targeted therapy may be underestimated in the patients that actually do have the molecular targets. To address the loss of efficiency due to misclassification error, we apply the discrete mixture modeling for time-to-event data proposed by Eng and Hanlon [8] to develop an inferential procedure, based on the Cox proportional hazard model, for treatment effects of the targeted treatment effect for the true-positive patients with the molecular targets. Our proposed procedure incorporates both inaccuracy of diagnostic devices and uncertainty of estimated accuracy measures. We employed the expectation-maximization algorithm in conjunction with the bootstrap technique for estimation of the hazard ratio and its estimated variance. We report the results of simulation studies which empirically investigated the performance of the proposed method. Our proposed method is illustrated by a numerical example. ? 2016 Tsai et al.

This study investigated the common characteristics of electrocardiographic (ECG) and nostril airflow signals in COPD patients using cross-spectral analysis. Heart rate variability (HRV) measures and cross-spectral (cs) measures of ECG and nostril airflow were compared in COPD patients and normal subjects, and correlated with their clinical characteristics. We found that cross-spectral analysis can lead to a significant increase in normalized high-frequency power (nHFPcs) and a significant decrease in normalized very low-frequency power (nVLFPcs), normalized low-frequency power (nLFPcs), and low-/high-frequency power ratio (LHRcs) in both normal subjects and COPD patients, as compared with their corresponding HRV measures. Further analysis showed that the percentage increase in nHFP (%nHFP) and the percentage decrease in LHR (%LHR) due to cross-spectral analysis in COPD patients were significantly smaller than those of normal subjects. All cross-spectral measures of ECG and nostril airflow in COPD patients did not significantly correlate with their pulmonary function characteristics. However, the nHFPcs correlated significantly and negatively with body mass index (BMI) in both normal subjects and COPD patients, and the %nHFP correlated significantly and negatively with BMI in COPD patients. We conclude that cross-spectral analysis of ECG and nostril airflow signals could lead to reduced enhancement in the high-frequency component in the cross spectrum of COPD patients. The magnitude of reduced enhancement in the high-frequency component in the cross-spectrum was related to the BMI of the patients. Cross-spectral analysis of ECG and nostril airflow might be used to assess the cardiovascular-related functions of COPD patients. ? 2016 Published by the American Physiological Society and The Physiological Society.",Body mass index; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Cross-spectral analysis; Electrocardiogram; Heart rate variability; Respiration,"aged; airway resistance; breathing; breathing rate; case control study; electrocardiography; female; forced expiratory volume; Fourier analysis; heart rate; human; male; nose; pathophysiology; predictive value; prospective study; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; signal processing; time factor; very elderly; vital capacity; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Airway Resistance; Case-Control Studies; Electrocardiography; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Fourier Analysis; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Nose; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiration; Respiratory Rate; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Time Factors; Vital Capacity",2-s2.0-84962920392

Materials and Methods: Data from 8 eyes of 7 patients receiving excision of subtenon TA plaques for uncontrolled ocular hypertension after PSTA in 1 hospital from June 2010 to December 2012 were retrospectively collected. The percentage of IOP lowering on postoperative day 1 and the time to IOP normalization after subtenon TA removal were reported. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the factors for rapid IOP normalization after subtenon TA removal. Results: The IOP lowering on postoperative day 1 ranged from 12% to 75%. All cases achieved IOP normalization within a mean of 2.5±1.9 days (range, 1 to 5 d) after subtenon TA removal. Fewer kinds of antiglaucoma agents used before subtenon TA removal was associated with greater IOP lowering on postoperative day 1 (P=0.01) and more rapid return to normal IOP (P=0.01). Older age and more time from PSTA to ocular hypertension were both correlated with shorter time to achieve IOP normalization after operation (P=0.01 and 0.02, respectively). Conclusions: In medically uncontrolled ocular hypertension after PSTA, excision of subtenon TA plaques provided IOP normalization as rapidly as 1 to 5 days. Fewer preoperative antiglaucoma agents, older age, and more time from PSTA to ocular hypertension were correlated with more rapid IOP normalization after subtenon TA removal.

The relationship between viral reactivation and drug eruptions has been widely observed and has provided a new direction for researchers to explore. In recent years, a number of studies have focused in particular on sequential human herpes virus (HHV) reactivation in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and these studies have provided crucial evidence demonstrating that clinical presentations can be closely related to the dynamics of viral activity. The DRESS patients with long-term sequelae tended to present with viral activation, including sequential changes in serum cytokines, chemokines, and immune cells. Moreover, other cADRs might also be influenced by the reactivation of different viruses. In this study, we discuss recent progress in understanding the role of viral reactivation in cADRs and the possible pathomechanism underlying the drug-induced immune response. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",DIHS; DRESS; HHV; Hypersensitivity; Stevens–Johnson syndrome,chemokine; cytokine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor alpha; autoimmune thyroiditis; clinical feature; DRESS syndrome; Herpesviridae; human; Human herpesvirus 6; immune response; immunocompetent cell; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; skin disease; Stevens Johnson syndrome; virus reactivation,2-s2.0-85069328070

Nursing home residents with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not been identified yet in Taiwan, along with associated risk factors. The objective of this study is to investigate the risk factors of CKD in long-term care facilities in Taiwan and those significantly associated with the presence of CKD. Methods: The nursing home residents who received health examination between January and June 2012, age = 55 years, were enrolled in this study. They were categorized into two subgroups ac-cording to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): < 60 and ? 60 mL/min. Risk factors were evaluated per recommendations from the National Kidney Foundation: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipid profile. Metabolic syndrome among the residents was also identified.Results: Fifty-three nursing home residents were enrolled in the final study; 16 (30%) had eGFR be-low 60 mL/min, and nine (56%) of them had BMI higher than 25 kg/m2. The residents with advanced CKD had significantly higher BMI, triglyceride and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Twelve (75%) had metabolic syndrome. Central obesity was observed in 10 (63%) with advanced CKD. Conclusion: Most of the nursing home elderly with advanced CKD have poor control of associ-ated risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia.

Previous studies focused on Caucasian population, and most did not use a comprehensive assessment tool. This study used an appropriate assessment tool to evaluate these infants in a Taiwanese population. Methods: The study proceeded from July 2006 to March 2010 in a large teaching psychiatric hospital in Taiwan. Three domains of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development, 3rd edition (Bayley-III) was used to evaluate the development of infants with histories of prenatal exposure to methadone. The evaluations were performed together by the same child psychiatrist and psychologist at the same month but the social-emotional rating relied on reports of the caregivers. Results: Eight children and their mothers participated. Five of eight children showed significant developmental delay; three had developmental delay in language composition, three had developmental delay in cognitive composition, but no developmental delay was seen for the social-emotional portion. Parental neglect was noticed in most cases. Conclusions: A substantial number of infants showed developmental delay. The use of methadone and a chaotic life-style associated with illicit drugs use during pregnancy both contributed to this developmental delay. Large studies are needed to clarify the risk of methadone for developmental delay in infants. ? 2016 Neuropsychiatry (London).",Developmental delay; Infant; Methadone; Pregnancy; Taiwan,methadone; Article; Bayley Scales of Infant Development; caregiver; child; child development; child neglect; clinical article; cognitive defect; developmental disorder; emotion; female; human; infant; language disability; male; maternal treatment; medical history; mental hospital; methadone treatment; opiate addiction; patient compliance; pilot study; pregnancy; prenatal drug exposure; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; psychiatrist; psychologist; social behavior; Taiwan; teaching hospital,2-s2.0-85018509431

However, the radio-resistance of malignant tumor cells is the major cause of radiation treatment failure. Although several biochemical pathways are disturbed in response to radiation, the metabolite profiles related to radio-resistance have not been well investigated in malignant non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). Malignant lung cancer cells, CL1-5, were more resistant to radiation than were the parental CL1-0 cells. Therefore, the two cell lines provide a suitable cell model to investigate changes in metabolite profiles related to radiation exposure. Methods: Two human lung cancer cell lines, CL1-5 and CL1-0, with differential radiation sensitivities, were irradiated at a dosage of 10 Gy and harvested at 1, 4, and 24 hr after radiation treatment. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) was used to analyze the metabolic profiles of the CL1-0 and CL1-5 cell lines. The metabolite profiles of the cell extracts were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). Both PCA and specific metabolite data were used to examine metabolic differences between the two cell lines. Results: The colony formation assay results demonstrate that CL1-5 cells are more sensitive than CL1-0 cells to irradiation. The PCA score plots for NMR spectra of CL1-0 and CL1-5 cells identified metabolites such as glutathione, creatine phosphate, glutamate, o-phosphocholine, pyroglutamate, taurine, and trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO) as key molecules with high correlation in response to different irradiation tolerance. The metabolite profiles of the cell lines were inherent different, but following 24-hr irradiation, common metabolite alterations were induced in both cell lines. Moreover, CL1-0 cells showed a larger difference in the elevation of glutathione levels than CL1-5 cells. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a clear difference in metabolite profiles between irradiation-resistant and irradiation-sensitive cells. These metabolite profile changes could be used to elucidate the possible mechanism of radio-resistance. ? Translational Cancer Research.

Although HIV/HCV coinfection is not uncommon, the prevalence rates vary significantly across different studies and regions. In Taiwan, injection drug users have become the major contributors to the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 2005. Because the prevalence of HCV infection is high in injection drug users, this HIV epidemic is also associated with a significant increase of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan. To control Taiwan’s HIV epidemic, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a harm-reduction program in 2006. The HIV epidemic, the percentage attributed to injection drug users, and the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection gradually declined thereafter. In this article, we aimed to thoroughly examine the current literatures of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan and hope to provide a better understanding of the needs for the management of this coinfection. We conducted a narrative review and searched for literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library database untill August 2015.

MMC-based chemotherapeutic regimens are still under consideration owing to the efficacy and low cost as compared with other second-line regimens in patients with advanced NSCLC. Hence, it is important to investigate whether MMC induces potential negative effects in NSCLC. Here, we found that the malignant lung cancer cells, CL1-2 and CL1-5, were more resistant to MMC than were the parental CL1-0 cells and pre-malignant CL1-1 cells. CL1-2 and CL1-5 cells consistently showed lower sub-G1 fractions post MMC treatment. DNA repair-related proteins were not induced more in CL1-5 than in CL1-0 cells, but the levels of endogenous and MMC-induced phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) were higher in CL1-5 cells. Administering a p-Akt inhibitor reduced the MMC resistance, demonstrating that p-Akt is important in the MMC resistance of CL1-5 cells. Furthermore, we revealed that cell migration was enhanced by MMC but lowered by a p-Akt inhibitor in CL1-5 cells. This study suggests that in CL1-5 cells, the activity of p-Akt, rather than DNA repair mechanisms, may underlie the resistance to MMC and enhance the cells' migration abilities after MMC treatment.",Cell migration; CL1-0; CL1-5; Mitomycin C; Phosphorylated Akt,"8 [4 (1 aminocyclobutyl)phenyl] 9 phenyl 1,2,4 triazolo[3,4 f][1,6]naphthyridin 3(2h) one; ATM protein; caspase 3; cell protein; checkpoint kinase 2; damage specific DNA binding protein 2; Fanconi anemia group D2 protein; mitomycin; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein; mitomycin; protein kinase B; protein kinase inhibitor; Article; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell viability; cellular distribution; CL1 0 cell line; CL1 1 cell line; CL1 2 cell line; CL1 5 cell line; concentration response; controlled study; DNA end joining repair; DNA repair; drug cytotoxicity; drug resistance; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; Fanconi anemia repair; flow cytometry; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; intracellular signaling; lung cancer cell line; molecular dynamics; protein analysis; protein cleavage; protein function; time series analysis; ubiquitination; cell motion; drug effects; drug potentiation; drug resistance; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; phosphorylation; signal transduction; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; upregulation; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Drug Synergism; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mitomycin; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Phosphorylation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-84999018464

However, conventional optical imaging methods such as confocal microscopy and two-photon microscopy cannot accurately depict cellular processing in 3D models due to limited penetration of photons. We developed a dualwavelength optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM), which provides sufficient penetration depth and spatial resolution, for studying CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) trafficking in an in vitro 3D tumor microenvironment. CTLs play a cardinal role in host defense against tumor. Efficient trafficking of CTLs to the tumor microenvironment is a critical step for cancer immunotherapy. For the proposed system, gold nanospheres and indocyanine green (ICG) have been remarkable choices for contrast agents for photoacoustic signals due to their excellent biocompatibility and high optical absorption. With distinct absorption spectrums, targeted cells with gold nanospheres and ICG respectively can be identified by switching 523-nm and 800-nm laser irradiation. Moreover, we use an x-y galvanometer scanner to obtain high scanning rate. In the developed system, lateral and axial resolutions were designed at 1.6 μm and 5 μm, respectively. We successfully showed that dual-spectral OR-PAM can map either the distribution of CTLs with gold nanospheres at a visible wavelength of 523 nm or the 3D structure of tumor spheres with ICG in an in vitro 3D microenvironment. Our OR-PAM can provide better biological relevant information in cellular interaction and is potential for preclinical screening of anti-cancer drugs. ? 2016 SPIE.",3D cell culture; gold nanoparticles; indocyanine green; Photoacoustic microscopy,Absorption spectroscopy; Biocompatibility; Cell culture; Diagnosis; Diseases; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Gold; Light absorption; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Nanospheres; Photons; Tumors; 3-D cell culture; Cytotoxic T lymphocytes; Gold Nanoparticles; Indocyanine Green; Optical imaging method; Three-dimensional culture; Threedimensional (3-d); Tumor microenvironment; Photoacoustic microscopy,2-s2.0-84975048849

Our research team focused on two important functions in designing nano-sized agents, controlled drug release and targeting functions. Thus, targeting functional micelles which entrapped chemotherapeutic drug, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38) were designed in nano-size and possessed disulfide bonds in this study. In particular, Self-Breakable SN38-loaded micelles (SN/38 micelles), Non-Breakable micelles SN38-loaded (NB/38 micelles) and Folate-targeting Self- Breakable SN38-loaded micelles (FSB/38 micelles) were prepared and tested to the designed agents.

Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) is a low-cost, food-based intervention that can play a vital role in the treatment and prevention of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. To provide evidencebased dietary recommendations for bitter gourd, a consortium of scientists and experts from Germany, India, Taiwan, Tanzania and Thailand participated in the design and implementation of a three-year research project from 2011 to 2014. This paper gives an overview of the project approach and some preliminary results. The project aims to (1) optimize production and utilization of antidiabetic compounds in bitter gourd through varietal selection, postharvest practices and preparation methods; (2) determine optimal dosage through in vitro, mice, and human studies; and (3) develop dietary strategies for diabetes management and prevention in Asia and Africa. Currently, the project has undertaken bitter gourd surveys among diabetic patients, medical experts, general consumers, sellers, and producers in Taiwan, India and Tanzania; horticultural evaluations and phytochemical analyses of 53 bitter gourd germplasm accessions and 20 commercial hybrids; animal studies on bitter gourd's antidiabetic properties; placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over studies on human subjects in India and Tanzania; and research on the effects of cooking and storage on bitter gourd's antidiabetic properties. Project-related communications and promotions are published in print and web-based platforms (www.Bitter-Gourd.org).

However, the sex-stratified smoking trajectories of older adults are not often examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the smoking trajectories of older adults and their associated factors by sex. Methods Data were drawn from a nationally representative longitudinal study of a sample of Taiwanese adults aged 50-66 years (n = 2097). The samples were followed from 1996 to 2007. Group-based trajectory analysis was performed. Results Three smoking trajectories were identified in men: non/rare smokers (42.6%), quitting smokers (16.5%), and chronic smokers (40.9%). Among men, quitting smokers were more likely to be lower educated than non/rare smokers. The male chronic smokers were more likely to be older, lower educated, and living in rural areas than the male non/rare smokers. Two smoking trajectories were identified for females: non/rare smokers (95.9%) and smokers (4.1%). Women of mainlander ethnic groups were more likely to be smokers. Conclusion There are sex differences in the smoking trajectories and related factors among older adults.

This could further worsen the cardiopulmonary function. This study aimed to compare the changes in patient exercise cardiopulmonary test and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and consider the implication of these changes. Methods: Our study examined repaired TOF patients who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to obtain maximal (peak oxygen consumption, peak VO2) and submaximal parameters (oxygen uptake efficiency plateau, oxygen uptake efficiency plateau (OUEP), and ratio of minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production, VE/VCO2 slope). Additionally, the hemodynamic statuswas assessed by using cardiacmagnetic resonance. Criteria for exclusion included TOF patients with pulmonary atresia, atrioventricular septal defect, or absence of pulmonary valve syndrome. Results: We enrolled 158 patients whose mean age at repair was 7.8 ± 9.1 years (range 0.1-49.2 years) and the mean patient age at CPETwas 29.5 ± 12.2 years (range 7.0-57.0 years). Severe PR (PR fraction 40%) in 53 patients, moderate in 55, and mild (PR fraction &gt; 20%) in 50 patients were noted. The mean RV end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVi) was 113 ± 35 ml/m2,with 7 patients observed to have a RVEDVi &lt; 163ml/m2. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 63 ± 8%, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi) was 65 ± 12 ml/m2, and LVESVi was 25 ± 14 ml/m2. CPET revealed significantly decreased peak VO2 (68.5 ± 14.4% of predicted), and fair OUEP (90.3 ± 14.1% of predicted) and VE/VCO2 slope (27.1 ± 5.3). PR fraction and age at repair were negatively correlated with maximal and submaximal exercise indicators (peak VO2 and OUEP). Left ventricular (LV) function and size were positively correlated with peak VO2 and OUEP. Conclusions: The results of CPET showed that patients with repaired TOF had a lowmaximal exercise capacity (peak VO2), but a fair submaximal exercise capacity (OUEP and VE/VCO2 slope), suggesting limited exercise capability in high intensity circumstances. PR, LV function and age at total repair were the most important determinants of CPET performance.",Cardiac magnetic resonance; Cardiopulmonary exercise function; Pulmonary regurgitation; Surgical age; Tetralogy of Fallot,carbon dioxide; Article; atrioventricular septal defect; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiopulmonary function; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; dyspnea; Fallot tetralogy; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart right ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart right ventricle endsystolic volume; human; major clinical study; oxygen consumption; pulmonary valve atresia; pulmonary valve disease; pulmonary valve replacement; QRS interval,2-s2.0-84958183710

Methods: We first carried out an electronic search of three databases: Pubmed, Medline, Embase, to examine the relation between glucose and periodontal disease. In total, 517 studies were identified. After screening titles and abstracts, we retrieved the full texts of 147 articles, with 23 articles included in the meta-analysis. We first undertook a traditional meta-analysis on the risk of developing periodontal disease between subjects with high or low glucose levels. The generalized least squares method proposed by Greenland and Longnecker was then used for the dose-response meta-analysis. Results: People with a high glucose level were more likely to have suffered periodontal diseases than those with a low glucose level (odds ratio 2.61, Confidence interval: 2.00 to 3.41). The dose-response meta-analysis showed that glucose level had a nonlinear relation with the risk of periodontal disease. When glucose level reached 160 mg/dl, the risk of developing periodontal disease gradually reached a plateau. Our meta-analysis suggested that there is no safe level of glucose for periodontal disease. Conclusions: Our dose-response metaanalysis found a nonlinear relation between glucose level and an increased risk of periodontal disease.

Recent advancement in bioengineering technologies to generate micro- and nanoscale materials as biotransporters and therapeutics has led to a variety of new approaches to treat cardiovascular diseases. Although these strategies are still in their initial stage of research, developing effective alternate therapies to treat life-threatening diseases such as myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis can potentially improve patient outcomes and longterm economic costs imposed on the healthcare system. Over the last decade, a wide array of materials with tunable biophysical and chemical properties has been developed to successfully deliver therapeutic agents such as nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules, and even stem cells in combination with nanomaterials for advanced cardiovascular treatments.

Under such a disease etiology, assuming one disease locus in linkage disequilibrium mapping is likely to induce bias and lead to efficiency loss in disease locus estimation. An approach is needed for simultaneously localizing multiple functional loci within the same region. However, due to the increasing number of parameters accompanying disease loci, these estimates can be computationally infeasible. To circumvent this problem, we propose to estimate the main and two-adjacent-locus joint effects and a nuisance parameter at the disease loci separately through a linear approximation. Estimates of the genetic effects are entered into a generalized estimating equation to estimate disease loci, and the procedure is conducted iteratively until convergence. The proposed method provides estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) for the disease loci, the genetic main effects, and the joint effects of two adjacent disease loci, with the CIs for the disease loci providing useful regions for further fine-mapping. We apply the proposed approach to a data example of case-control studies. Results of the simulations and data example suggest that the developed method performs well in terms of bias, variance, and coverage probability under scenarios with up to three disease loci. ? 2014 The Author.

The goals of reconstruction are both functional and cosmetic. Sialorrhea, or drooling, is a major problem after flap reconstruction and influences the quality of life of the patient. In this article, we report on our experience performing a dermal sling operation to treat postoperative sialorrhea in patients with oral cancer. Materials and Methods: Preoperative and postoperative levels of sialorrhea were evaluated based on the Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale. Dermal sling operations were performed on 27 patients from January 2000 to December 2013. In these patients, 12 cases were reviewed and followed up over 1 year. Results: Of the 12 patients, 11 were men and one was a woman, with the mean age of 58 years (range, 40-79 years). There were no operative complications. The mean preoperative score was 4.75 (range, 3-7), and the mean postoperative score was 3.83 (range, 2-5). This change was significant (P = 0.005), with valuation with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The mean time of follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 1.1-7.7 years). Conclusions: The dermal sling operation is an acceptable treatment for postoperative sialorrhea in patients with commissure-involved oral cancer. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Here, we report a successful treatment of a 30-year-old patient with treatment-resistant catatonic schizophrenia in 10 years by augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We present a 30-year-old man with treatment-resistant catatonic schizophrenia who failed to respond to the treatment of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics for 10 years. He markedly improved after taking SSRIs. Now, he does not hold odd postures and begins to talk and show more facial expressions. We postulate that the therapeutic effect is related to the enhancement of 5-HT neurotransmission. SSRIs can be a considerable choice to treat chronic catatonia.

Although both common and rare variants might exert their independent effects on the risk for the trait of interest, previous methods to detect the association effects rarely consider them simultaneously. We proposed a class of test statistics, the generalized weighted-sum statistic (GWSS), to detect disease associations in the presence of common and rare variants with a case-control study design. Information of rare variants was aggregated using a weighted sum method, while signal directions and strength of the variants were considered at the same time. Permutations were performed to obtain the empirical p-values of the test statistics. Our simulation showed that, compared to the existing methods, the GWSS method had better performance in most of the scenarios. The GWSS (in particular VDWSS-t) method is particularly robust for opposite association directions, association strength, and varying distributions of minor-allele frequencies. It is therefore promising for detecting disease-associated loci. For empirical data application, we also applied our GWSS method to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data, and the results were consistent with the simulation, suggesting good performance of our method. As re-sequencing studies become more popular to identify putative disease loci, we recommend the use of this newly developed GWSS to detect associations with both common and rare variants. ? 2015 Kao et al.",,algorithm; Article; disease association; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; gene sequence; generalized weighted sum statistic; genetic analysis; genetic variability; signal noise ratio; simulation; statistical analysis; statistical model; study design; genetics; human; Rare Diseases; Gene Frequency; Humans; Rare Diseases,2-s2.0-84928137578

At present, medical treatment for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and repeat pancreatitis attacks is not adequate. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of laparoscopic bariatric surgery in these patients. Methods A review of 20 morbidly obese patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (a triglyceride level of &gt;1000 mg/dL) who received laparoscopic bariatric surgery was performed. The study population comprised 14 males and six females, with an average age of 35.0 years (range 24-52 years), and the mean body mass index was 38.2 kg/m2 (range 25-53 kg/m2). The preoperative mean plasma triglyceride level was 1782.7 mg/dL (range 1043-3884 mg/dL). Four patients had a history of hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis and 13 patients had associated diabetes. Results Of the 20 patients, 17 (85%) received gastric bypass, whereas three (15%) received restrictive-type surgery. Laparoscopic access was used in all of the patients. Hypertriglyceridemia in morbidly obese patients was more commonly associated with male sex and a poorly controlled diabetic state. The mean weight reduction was 25.5% 1 year after surgery, with a marked improvement in diabetes management. As early as 1 month following surgery, the plasma mean triglyceride levels had decreased to 254 mg/dL (range 153-519 mg/dL), and this was further reduced to mean levels of 192 mg/dL (range 73-385 mg/dL) 1 year after surgery. One patient developed acute pancreatitis during the perioperative period, but none of the patients suffered an episode of pancreatitis in the follow-up period (from 6 months to 13 years). Conclusion Bariatric surgery can be successfully used as a metabolic surgery in severe hypertriglyceridemia patients at risk of acute pancreatitis. However, control of triglyceride levels prior to bariatric surgery is indicated.. ? 2014, Asian Surgical Association. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

Here, we report brain isoform glycogen phosphorylase (GPBB) as a novel liver progenitor cell marker. GPBB was identified in a protein complex precipitated by a monoclonal antibody Ligab generated from a rat liver progenitor cell line Lig-8. Immunoblotting results show that GPBB was expressed in two liver progenitor cell lines Lig-8 and WB-F344. The levels of GPBB expression decreased in the WB-F344 cells under sodium butyrate (SB)-induced cell differentiation, consistent with roles of GPBB as a liver progenitor cell marker. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated GPBB knockdown followed by glucose deprivation test shows that GPBB aids in liver progenitor cell survival under low glucose conditions. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated GPBB knockdown followed by SB-induced cell differentiation shows that reducing GPBB expression delayed liver progenitor cell differentiation. We conclude that GPBB is a novel liver progenitor cell marker, which facilitates liver progenitor cell survival under low glucose conditions and cell differentiation. ? 2015 Huang et al.",,"butyric acid; glucose; glycogen phosphorylase; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody Ligab; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; butyric acid; glycogen phosphorylase; animal cell; Article; cell differentiation; cell level; cell specificity; cell survival; complex formation; controlled study; enzyme activity; functional proteomics; gene silencing; growth regulation; hepatic progenitor cell; immunoblotting; nonhuman; protein expression; rat; animal; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell line; cytology; drug effects; enzymology; Fischer 344 rat; genetics; immunoprecipitation; liver; metabolism; stem cell; Rattus; Animals; Butyric Acid; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Cells, Cultured; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Glycogen Phosphorylase; Glycogen Phosphorylase, Brain Form; Immunoprecipitation; Liver; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Stem Cells",2-s2.0-84926639380

In vivo porcine studies showed a multiple-electrode switching system could create larger necrotic areas than single-electrode or cluster-electrode ablations. Some recent studies demonstrated a multiple-electrode RFA system could achieve local control of medium-sized HCCs. This study aimed to evaluate the treatment results of monopolar RFA with either single-electrode overlapping ablations or a multiple-electrode switching system in treating medium-sized (3-5 cm) HCC. Methods: A total of 20 patients with medium-sized hepatocellular carcinomas were included in this study. Nine patients (6 males and 3 females) were treated with single- electrode monopolar RFA. Eleven patients (4 males and 7 females) were treated with multiple- electrode switching monopolar RFA. Twelve patients (60%) included in this study had multi- nodular HCCs at the time of treatment. The tumor size was slightly larger in the multiple- electrode group (4.6 ± 0.3 cm) compared to that in the single-electrode group (3.6 ± 0.6 cm). CT or MR imaging studies were performed at 1 month after RFA to evaluate treatment effectiveness. Thereafter, local tumor progression, treatment effectiveness and survival after RFA were evaluated. Results: Overall, 18 of 20 patients (90%) showed satisfactory ablation of HCCs 1 month after their RFA procedures. Treatment effectiveness was achieved in 8 patients (88.9%) with single-electrode overlapping ablation and 10 (90.9%) patients with multiple-electrode switching system. The mean follow-up periods were 14.9 (range, 2-26) months in the single-electrode group, and 20.2 (range 4-41) months in the multiple-electrode group. Among the 18 patients who achieved primary tumor control, 2 patients (1 in the single-electrode group and 1 in the multiple-electrode group) had local progression noted during follow-up examinations. Conclusions: Medium-sized hepatocellular carcinoma can be effectively ablated with monopolar radiofrequency ablation by either single-electrode overlapping ablation or a multiple-electrode switching system. Regarding mid-term treatment responses, both RFA approaches can achieve similar treatment effectiveness, local tumor progression rate, and survival probabilities. Multiple-electrode switching RFA can treat larger medium-sized HCC with comparable mid-term efficacy as smaller medium-sized HCC treated with single-electrode overlapping RFA. ? 2015 The Chinese Oncology Society.",Monopolar RFA; Overlapping ablations; Switching system; Thermoablation,adult; aged; Article; cancer growth; cancer size; cancer survival; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; electrode; female; follow up; generator; human; liver cell carcinoma; male; mechanical probe; multiple electrode switching system; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; radiofrequency ablation; radiofrequency ablation device; radiofrequency electrode; real time echography; retrospective study; single electrode overlapping ablation system; therapy effect; treatment response,2-s2.0-85042894703

The Merkel cell polyomavirus has recently been documented to cause Merkel cell carcinoma. No causal specifi city is observed for many oncogenic viruses. Some of them may cause different cancers, while some cancers may be caused by different viruses. However, only a proportion of infected persons will actually develop cancers, indicating that oncogenic viruses may be necessary but not suffi cient to cause specifi c cancers. Viral, host and environmental cofactors have been assessed for the EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, HBV/HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and HPV-associated cervical carcinoma. Persistent infection, high viral load, and genetic/acquired susceptibility factors are important risk predictors for these virus-caused cancers. Risk calculators have been developed for the prediction of the long-term risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients affected with chronic hepatitis B and C. Both clinical trials and national programs of immunization or anti-viral therapy have demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of cancers caused by HBV, HCV and HPV.

However, whether the use of antithyroid drugs in hyperthyroidism patients can reduce the occurrence of ischaemic stroke remains unclear. Methods A total of 36,510 newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism patients during 2003-2006 were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research database. Each patient was individually tracked for 5 years from their index date (beginning the antithyroid drugs) to identify those who suffered from new episode of ischaemic stroke. Medication possession ratio (MPR) was used to represent the antithyroid drug compliance. The association between the MPR and the risk of stroke was examined. Results The stroke incidence rates for hyperthyroidism patients with age < 45 years and age ? 45 years were 0.42 and 3.76 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The patients aged < 45 years with MPR < 0.2 (adjusted hazard ratio, HR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.13-4.70; p = 0.02) and 0.2 ? MPR < 0.4 (adjusted HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.06-4.72; p = 0.035) had a significantly increased risk of ischaemic stroke as compared to those with ? 0.6. In patients of the age ? 45 years, only the patients with MPR < 0.2 (adjusted HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03-2.01; p = 0.036) had a significantly higher risk of ischaemic stroke as compared to those with MPR ? 0.6. In hyperthyroidism patients without AF, good antithyroid drugs compliance also reduced the incidence of stroke significantly (adjusted HR, range: 1.52-1.61; p = 0.02); but not in hyperthyroidism with AF.

The results show that as a group, patients with schizophrenia had impaired FOK ability and evidenced a disposition to underestimate their memory performance. However, patient's FOK ability was variable, with 42.5% of patients exhibited a below chance level performance. There were marked relationships between FOK and set formation and visual recognition abilities in healthy controls, while such feature was not evident in patient group. These findings are in line with the prefrontal cortex dysfunction, reduced intrapsychic monitoring ability, and impaired utilization of mental resources noticed in patients with schizophrenia. A routine evaluation of metamemory function by FOK might be helpful for designing customized cognitive rehabilitation programs considering their missed estimation of memory capacity. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Feeling-of-knowing; Insight; Metacognition; Metamemory; Neurocognition; Schizophrenia,"adult; association; cross-sectional study; decision making; episodic memory; female; human; learning; male; Memory Disorders; metacognition; neuropsychological test; paired associate learning; pattern recognition; psychology; recognition; schizophrenia; young adult; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cues; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Memory Disorders; Memory, Episodic; Metacognition; Neuropsychological Tests; Paired-Associate Learning; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Recognition (Psychology); Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Set (Psychology); Young Adult",2-s2.0-84947093134

Although some regulatory factors of glutamine consumption are known, the actual cell-type specific regulatory mechanism hasn’t been explored yet. In breast tumors, there are two types of tumor cells that may be malignantly transformed from different cellular origins with dramatically different gene expression. We found distinct glutamine requirement in these two types of cells: luminal epithelial cells, as well as their corresponding transformed tumor cells, are more independent to extracellular glutamine than basal cells. This luminal-specific glutamine independent is regulated by its specific expression of glutamine synthetase, which can produce glutamine by combing glutamate and amine group. In response to glutamine deprivation, the expression of glutamine synthetase in luminal cells allow them to produce and export glutamine to the extracellular space to support the survival of glutamine addicted basal cells in a mechanism of metabolic symbiosis. By these observations, the glutamine deprivation therapy should be performed more efficiently with the help of glutamine synthetase inhibition. ?

One such AMP is the shrimp antilipopolysaccharide factor (SALF), an AMP isolated from Penaeus monodon; the SALF was previously reported to induce tumor cell death. However, the mechanism by which the SALF regulates these pathways remains unclear. In this study, we identified that the SALF modulates mitochondria-and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways in human cervical cancer cells. The SALF was found to inhibit the growth of four cervical cancer cell lines: HeLa, HeLa 299, C33A, and Ca ski. In addition, a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that the SALF induced death and G2/M phase arrest in HeLa and HeLa 299 cells. The SALF itself was found to be localized to the cytosol and nuclei of HeLa cells by confocal imaging. Staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide and analysis of DNA fragmentation confirmed that the SALF induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Moreover, caspases-3 and-9 were found to be involved in SALF-induced apoptosis, through the use of various caspase inhibitors in vitro and immunohistochemistry in vivo. Finally, the SALF was found to induce depolarization of mitochondrial membranes with associated translocation of the AIF to nuclei, and to affect levels of Bcl-2 family proteins in HeLa cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that the SALF induces mitochondria-and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways in HeLa cells. We suggest that the SALF may be an effective treatment for cervical cancer, either alone or in combination with traditional therapies.",AMPs; Antitumor activity; Apoptotic pathway; Cervical cancer; SALF,Cell culture; Cell death; Cell membranes; Diseases; Drug products; Flow cytometry; Mitochondria; Proteins; AMPs; Anti-tumor activities; Apoptotic pathways; Cervical cancers; SALF; Cytology,2-s2.0-84939139799

In addition, inhibition of mitochondrial enzymes due to an accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide has been related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore the association between sequence variants of the CISD2 gene and risk for AD, which has not been explored previously. Methods: This was a case-control study involving a total of 276 patients with AD who were recruitedfrom three teaching hospitals in Taiwan from 2007 to 2010; 460 controls were recruitedfrom elderly individuals attending for health check-ups and volunteers in the hospital during the same period of time. All participants were aged 60 years or older. Two haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs), rs223330 and rs223331, were selected from the CISD2 gene to test the association between their polymorphisms and the risk for dementia, and how ApoE e4 status, sex, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus might modify this association. Results: rs223330 variant carriage was not associated with risk for AD [TT versus CC: adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.59-1.62; TC versus CC: AOR=0.72, 95% CI=0.47-1.11]. Similar findings were observed for rs223331 (AA versus TT: AOR=1.12; AT versus TT: AOR=0.99). In addition, hypertension significantly modified the association between rs223331 and risk for AD (p=0.005).Three common haplotypes (with a frequency of 99.8%) were observed for CISD2. Common CISD2 haplotypes were not associated with the risk for AD. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that CISD2 htSNPs are not associated with AD risk. ? 2013.",Alzheimer's disease; CISD2; Haplotype; Single nucleotide polymorphism,"apolipoprotein E; nucleotide; ERIS protein, human; membrane protein; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; Article; case control study; CISD2 gene; confidence interval; dementia; female; gene; gene frequency; gene sequence; genetic risk; genetic variability; haplotype; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; risk factor; sex; single nucleotide polymorphism; teaching hospital; volunteer; Alzheimer disease; clinical trial; complication; genetic predisposition; genetics; multicenter study; odds ratio; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical model; Taiwan; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Haplotypes; Humans; Hypertension; Logistic Models; Male; Membrane Proteins; Odds Ratio; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84937251955

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a novel valve-replacement technique for patients with multiple chronic diseases who are at high risk of requiring aortic valve replacement surgery. Most of the time, the indicators of TAVI are detected during an echocardiographic exam. The femoral artery is the primary insertion site. The complications of TAVI include stroke, vascular dissection, bleeding, aortic valve regurgitation, and arrhythmia. In terms of clinical effectiveness, the mortality rate of TAVI is lower than percutaneous ballon valvuloplasty but similar to AVR. The unplanned cardiac-related re-admission rate within 30 days of discharge is lower for TAVI than for AVR. In terms of activity tolerance, TAVI is significantly better than both percutaneous ballon valvuloplasty and AVR. Comprehensive nursing care may reduce the incidence of complications associated with TAVI. Nursing care of TAVI includes explaining and providing instructions regarding TAVI prior to the procedure. After the TAVI procedure and while the patient is in the ICU, remove the endotracheal tube as soon as possible, monitor his /her neuro-cognitive status, monitor for early detection of a stroke event, record urine output to assess renal function, observe bleeding in the puncture site, and evaluate cardiac arrhythmia and pain. While in the general ward, resume early physical activities and educate the patient regarding the risks and the prevention of bleeding.

This condition typically necessitates the use of a jejunal feeding tube to provide the patient with adequate nutrition. Obstruction of the jejunal feeding tube is common in clinical practice and results in malnutrition in most patients and mortality in the most serious cases. An analysis of the status of jejunostomy-tube use in our unit found that these tubes were obstructed in 27.6% of the cases. The causes of this obstruction were: tube bending due to tight suturing, small inner-tube diameter, the absence of adequate jejunal-feeding standards, and failure to implement relevant training strategies. These findings motivated us to attempt to reduce the incidence of jejunostomy-tube obstruction at our center. Purpose: This project was designed to reduce the incidence of jejunostomy-tube obstruction in esophageal cancer patients from 27.6% to ? 3%. Resolutions: Clear strategies, including modification of the stitching method used at the implantation end of the central venous catheter-type jejunostomy tube, establishment of feeding standards, creation of educational guidelines and leaflets, classroom teaching, and technical examinations, were used to reduce the prevalence of obstruction incidents. Results: The jejunostomy-tube obstruction rate was reduced from 27.6% to 6.7%. While the study objective was not achieved, the magnitude of the reduction was still significant at 75.7%. Conclusions: Cross-disciplinary collaboration, continuous education and training, and the promotion of standards of practice were used to significantly reduce the jejunostomy tube obstruction rate in esophageal cancer patients.

This study investigated the intensity of cigarette consumption and its correlates in China among urban male factory workers, a cohort especially vulnerable to tobacco exposure, one that appears to have benefitted little from recent public health efforts to reduce smoking rates. Methods. Data were collected from men working in factories of Kunming city, Yunnan, China, who are current daily smokers (N = 490). A multinomial logistic regression was conducted to examine the factors in association with smoking intensity in light, moderate, and heavy levels. Results. Light smoking correlated with social smoking, smoking the first cigarette later in the day, self-reported health condition, and quit intention. Heavy smoking was associated with purchase of lower priced cigarettes, difficulty refraining from smoking, and prehypertensive blood pressure. Conclusion. Even in regions where smoking is highly prevalent, even among cohorts who smoke heavily, variation exists in how cigarettes are consumed. Analyses of this consumption, with special consideration given to smoking intensity and its correlates, can help guide tobacco-control strategists in developing more effective interventions. ? 2013 APJPH.",pro-tobacco environment; smoking intensity; tobacco control in China,adult; aged; China; commercial phenomena; health status; human; male; mental health; middle aged; prevalence; smoking; statistical model; Tobacco Use Disorder; urban population; young adult; Adult; Aged; China; Commerce; Health Status; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Smoking; Tobacco Use Disorder; Urban Population; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84926303976

The manufacture of Biodegradable stents is an challenging issue because of the features, like geometry design, machine processing way and the material select of stents. An improved manufacturing process of biodegradable stents is presented. The proposed processes consist of the following steps: tube drawing (is use tube sinking manufacture), laser cutting and surface modification (annealing and ultrasonic cleaning). The precision injection and drawing operation is used to obtain the required wall thickness for seamless tube. The laser cutting is performed to change the shape of the stent, and the finishing operations are selected to modify the surface features, like smoothness and texture of stents. The smoothness of surface finish is one of the properties that determine the performance of a stent. Therefore, the surface modification process (vacuum annealing and ultrasonic cleaning) is important in the production of stents and in clinical treatments involving stents. Annealing is the key technology that affects the material's final crystal grain size. Ultrasonic clean was of the stents to remove the slag (oxides) and burrs formed in laser production. Poly Lactic Acid material sample with an outside-diameter of 1.5 mm, a wall thickness of 0.08 mm, and a length of 10 mm, had been manufactured and demonstrated the proposed manufacture technology. The surface roughness of a stent manufactured is the value of Ra 13.7 nm which basically meets the design requirement for further performance evaluation. It is hoped that the above finding can be used for future study of stents. ?

Methods: For this investigation, 30 142 patients with US were set as the research group, and 121 768 randomly selected patients were set as the comparison group through frequency matching by age, sex, and index year. Each patient was individually tracked to identify those who developed ACS during the follow-up period. Cox proportional hazards regression and the Kaplan-Meier method were adopted to calculate the hazard ratios of ACS risk and plot the survival curve. Results: Overall, 275 (13.4 per 10 000 person-y) and 736 events (9.1 per 10 000 person-y) were observed among patients in the research and comparison cohorts, respectively. The patients with US had a substantially lower ACS-free survival rate compared with that of the patients in the comparison cohort (P<.001). After adjusting for potential risk factors, the patients with US were observed to have a 1.22-fold higher risk of ACS compared with patients in the comparison cohort (95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.40, P<.001), particularly among younger patients. Conclusions: The results indicate that US is associated with increased risk of developing ACS, particularly among young (? 49 years) and male adults. Future studies should examine the possible mechanisms of US-related ACS morbidity by conducting multicenter recruitment and measurements of laboratory data. ? 2014 Hung et al.",,acute coronary syndrome; adult; age distribution; article; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; follow up; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; prevalence; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; survival rate; urolithiasis; acute coronary syndrome; age; aged; complication; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; pathology; proportional hazards model; risk factor; Urinary Calculi; uric acid; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Uric Acid; Urinary Calculi,2-s2.0-84904248671

However, these methods with the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) model do not always work. Therefore, we used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to understand dog owners' behavior and distinguished the knowledge effect as objective knowledge (OK) and subjective knowledge (SK). A total of 310 dog owners completed a questionnaire based on our model. We employed structural equation modeling to verify the structural relationships and found three main results. First, our model was fit, and each path was significant. People with better attitudes, stronger subjective norms, and more perceptive behavioral control have stronger behavioral intention. Second, perceived behavioral control, not attitude, was the best predictive index in this model. Finally, on perceived behavioral control, subjective knowledge showed more influence than objective knowledge. We successfully extended TPB to explain the behavioral intention of dog owners and presented more workable recommendations. To reduce the latent social risk of disease, the government should not only address dog owners' attitudes, but also their subjective norms and perceptive behavioral control. Indeed, perceptive behavioral control and SK showed the most influence in this model. It is implied that the self-efficacy of dog owners is the most important factor in such a behavior. Therefore, the government should focus on enhancing dog owners' self-efficacy first while devoted to prevention activities. ? 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Rabies; Social risk; The theory of planned behavior; Vaccination,"disease control; public attitude; rabies; risk assessment; vaccination; article; behavior; behavior change; behavioral intention; health behavior; human; knowledge; objective knowledge; perceived behavioral control; rabies; risk reduction; self concept; subjective knowledge; subjective norm; Theory of Planned Behavior; vaccination; adolescent; adult; aged; animal; attitude to health; dog; Dog Diseases; female; health behavior; male; middle aged; preventive health service; questionnaire; rabies; statistical model; Taiwan; theoretical model; utilization; veterinary; young adult; Taiwan; rabies vaccine; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Attitude to Health; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Immunization Programs; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Questionnaires; Rabies; Rabies Vaccines; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84901928237

Although sorafenib, an antiangiogenic targeted compound, has demonstrated survival benefits as a first-line therapy, the response rate and time to progression are not optimal. Metronomic chemotherapy has demonstrated antiangiogenic effects, and its reduced potential for toxicity renders it more tolerable to most advanced HCC patients. Clinical trials and retrospective studies have examined the use of metronomic chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with other antiangiogenic therapies, for treating advanced HCC. These studies have confirmed the feasibility and safety of metronomic therapy in patients with advanced HCC. Although objective responses were achieved using metronomic chemotherapy alone, it is difficult to discern the actual clinical benefits because of the small sample sizes of these studies. Nevertheless, metronomic chemotherapy can serve as a treatment option for advanced HCC patients who have progressed on or are intolerable to the standard therapy, sorafenib. In single-arm phase II clinical trials, combining metronomic chemotherapy with antiangiogenic targeted therapy has demonstrated improved efficacy for treating advanced HCC without increasing toxicities. Further research is warranted to confirm the benefits of combining metronomic chemotherapy with antiangiogenic targeted therapy for treating advanced HCC. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The purpose of this study was to examine the nature of parental-child discussions of G6PD deficiency self-care and their relationship to child health. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional survey of 178 Taiwanese parents of children with G6PD deficiency was conducted. The extent of parental-child self-care discussions was assessed in regards to coverage of nine key topics. Parent's G6PD deficiency status, knowledge of haemolytic anaemia symptoms and reported G6PD deficiency education from providers were examined as correlates of parental discussion. Child health was assessed with the child health questionnaire-parent form (Chinese version) and a 13-item haemolytic anaemia symptom list. Results Self-care discussions were positively correlated with parental G6PD deficiency status (β=2.08, p=0.03), accurate identification of haemolytic anaemia symptoms (β=0.18, p=0.01), the thoroughness and clarity of patient education (β=0.14, p<0.001) and child age (β=1.04, p<0.001). Among children reported to have experienced significant symptoms of acute haemolytic anaemia (35%), the extent of self-care discussions was positively associated with reported physical and psychosocial child health (β=1.18, p<0.001).

The histological distribution of cancers in infants is different from that in older children. The five most common types of cancer occurring in infants in Taiwan are leukemia, neuroblastoma, germ cell tumors, central nervous system neoplasms, and retinoblastomas. Cancer in infants represents a unique situation in which to study cancer etiology. A significant number of infants with cancer have a genetic susceptibility to the disease; however, some emerging studies suggest a potential role for environmental, dietary, and drug exposures in the etiology of infant cancers. Further definitive trials will be necessary to establish clear associations, however. Because of their very young age and the immaturity of many of their physiological systems, the approach to treatment in young infants differs from that in older children. The infant's response to treatment also differs from older children, indicating the unique biological properties of cancer in infants that may explain different clinical outcomes in this unique population. Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia has a much inferior outcome compared with the outcome in older children. In contrast, neuroblastoma in infants has a superior outcome to that seen in older children. The care of infants with cancer is extremely challenging as a result of their increased vulnerability to the acute complications associated with intensive, multimodal treatment and to the long-term sequelae of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on the rapidly growing and developing infant. The chemotherapy-related toxicity seen in very young infants of less than 3 months of age may be due to a lower total body water content, lower P450 enzyme activity, lower serum protein binding, and immature renal function. The high susceptibility of immature tissues to radiotherapy-induced damage has led to the delivery of radiotherapy being limited in this age group. Protocols specific to the characteristics of this population are currently yielding promising results. ? 2014.",Cancer; Epidemiology; Infants; Leukemia; Solid tumors,cytochrome P450; acute granulocytic leukemia; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; brain tumor; cancer chemotherapy; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer radiotherapy; cancer susceptibility; central nervous system tumor; child development; child growth; childhood cancer; childhood leukemia; congenital disorder; diet; disease association; drug exposure; drug toxicity; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; genetic susceptibility; germ cell tumor; hepatoblastoma; human; incidence; infant; infant disease; infant welfare; kidney function; nephroblastoma; neuroblastoma; priority journal; protein binding; radiation injury; retinoblastoma; review; sarcoma; solid tumor; Taiwan; total body water; treatment response,2-s2.0-84896706834

Through analyzing the phone call records, we are able to understand more about the needs of patients and track their problems. The data of 188 patients were collected. And the frequencies of the phone calls were compared to patient demographic variables and diagnosis. The result shows that the older the patient is, the more they use phone call services; the longer a patient entered the telehealthcare program, the fewer calls they make.

Four patients (2.4%) also had underlying autoimmune disease and received immunomodulatory therapy which resulted in HBV reactivation and acute liver failure, which manifested as progressive hyperbilirubinemia and coagulopathy. The median time of survival of these patients was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results: All four patients were previously healthy HBV carriers with e antigen seroconversion. The mean peak alanine aminotransferase level was 3194.5±937.7 U/L. Entecavir was administered for an average of 39.8±10.5 days after the onset of the symptomatic hepatic dysfunction. Three patients who were experienced complications such as hepatic encephalopathy died. Only one patient survived liver failure. The median survival time after HBV reactivation and acute liver failure was 74.0 days (95% confidence interval, 31.9 to 116.1 days). The cumulative survival rate after HBV reactivation within three months was 25%.Conclusion: Prophylactic anti-HBV medication is recommended for HBV carriers with autoimmune diseases who are prescribed immunomodulatory agents for preventing catastrophic consequences such as acute liver failure caused by HBV reactivation. ? 2014, Turkish League Against Rheumatism.

But IOP is not easy and consistence to be measured under different measure conditions. Besides, diabetes is associated with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN). Pupil size response might provide an indirect means about neuronal pathways, so the abnormal pupil size may relate with DAN. Hence an infrared videopupillography is needed for tracking glaucoma and exploring the relation between pupil size and DAN. Our previous research proposed an infrared videopupillography to monitoring the pupil size of different light stimulus in dark room. And this portable infrared videopupillography contains a camera, a beam splitter, the visible-light LEDs for stimulating the eyes, and the infrared LEDs for lighting the eyes. It can be mounted on any eyeglass frame. But it can modulate only two dimensions, we cannot zoom in/out the eyes. Moreover, the eye diameter curves were not smooth and jagged because of the light spots, lone eyelashes, and blink. Therefore, we redesign the optical path of our device to have three dimension modulation. Then we can zoom in the eye to increase the eye resolution and to avoid the LED light spots. The light spot could be solved by defining the distance between IR LED and CCD. This device smaller volume and less prices of our previous videopupillography.

Such records rapidly accumulate and update over time, so that an efficient and scalable algorithm is demanded to mine the useful travel patterns from the big check-in data. However, discovering travel patterns under efficiency and scalability concerns from large-scaled location data had not ever carefully tackled yet. In this paper, we propose to mine the Time-aware Transit Patterns (TTP), which capture the representative traveling behaviors over consecutive locations, from the big check-in data. We model the travel behaviors among different locations into a Route Transit Graph (RTG), in which nodes represents locations, and edges denotes the transit behaviors of users between locations with certain time intervals. The time-aware transit patterns, which are required to satisfy frequent, closed, and connected requirements due to respectively physical meanings, are mined based on the RTG transaction database. To achieve such goal, we propose a novel TTPM-algorithm, which is devised to only need to scan the database once and generate no unnecessary candidates, and thus guarantee better time efficiency lower and memory usage. Experiments conducted on different cities demonstrate the promising performance of our TTPM-algorithm, comparing to a modified Apriori method. ?

The empowerment effect had a greater impact on patients who had a better economic status. Therefore, a powerful total cancer care strategy should be based on the empowerment plan, while taking long-term economic risks of cancer survivors and social disparities into consideration. Not only should empowerment-oriented services be offered, but additional financial care should be arranged for the vulnerable population.Results: The economic status of cancer survivors and empowerment were shown to be two main predictors of the quality of life among the other variables. The level of survivor empowerment has a positive and direct effect on promoting the quality of life in all domains. Moreover, the level of survivor empowerment can moderate the economic effect on the quality of life within the environment domain.Objectives: In recent years the cancer survival rate has followed a steady upward curve. Indeed, a cancer diagnosis is no longer a death sentence. Rather, cancer is a chronic disease for which patients are in need of long-term care. With respect to whole person care, the quality of life amongst cancer survivors has become one of the major intervention targets to promote wellbeing. The current study determined how empowerment dynamics impact cancer survivor quality of life.Methods: A structured questionnaire was used to determine the relationship between empowerment and quality of life amongst cancer survivors. Three scales (the Chinese version of the WHOQOL-BREF, empowerment scale, and MSPSS) were used to measure the main variables. Cancer survivors at least 1 year post-treatment were invited to participate in the interview. Block regression and simultaneous regions of significance methods were used to test the specification model and mediating effect on the variable relationship.",Cancer survivor; Empowerment; Moderating effect; Quality of life,,2-s2.0-84913587628

Related cases were also compared with the amoebic dysentery cases obtained from the NNDSS.Results: Amoebiasis-related diseases were more common in men than in women. Most cases occurred in the 25-44 age group. Amoebic skin ulcerations were the most common amoebiasis-related diseases. A comparison of the number of cases of amoebic dysentery without abscess, amoebic lung abscess and other amoebiasis-related diseases in 2008-2010 showed a significantly increasing trend. Geographically, most amoebiasis cases were found in Taipei City with the exception of amoebic skin ulcerations, which were concentrated in Taoyuan County. Forty-two percent of the amoebic dysentery cases identified in the NNDSS were imported.Conclusions: Although amoebic skin ulceration is a rare amoebic disease, our study found a high number of cases concentrated in Taoyuan County. Future studies that consider social and demographic variables may clarify the reasons for such a geographic distribution. To address the importation of amoebic dysentery and its geographic distribution, health screening of returning travelers and foreign workers as well as routine inspection and environmental disinfection to prevent cluster infections should be considered.

A GT-repeat polymorphism in the HO-1 gene promoter can inversely modulate the levels of HO-1 induction. Long-term digestion of arsenic-contaminated drinking water may cause cancers of anatomic variety. We carried out this study to examine the correlation of HO-1 GT-repeat polymorphism with cancer risk in arsenic-exposed individuals during a 10-year follow-up. A total of 1,004 participants who had HO-1 genotyping available from two arsenicosis-endemic areas in Taiwan were included. Baseline characteristics derived from questionnaire interview were collected in 1988-1990 for the subjects of the BFD-endemic area and in 1996-1998 the subjects of the Lanyang Basin area. Allelic GT-repeats were categorized into short (S, <27 GT-repeats) and long (L, ?27 GT-repeats). Analysis results showed that there were no significant differences in the risk of urinary tract cancer among the three genotype groups after accounting for age, gender, average arsenic exposure, smoking status, and alcohol intake. However, for cancer of trachea bronchus and lung, carriers of L/S genotype versus L/L group had significantly reduced risk [HR 0.34 (95% CI, 0.13-0.95), P = 0.039] while restricting subgroup of study subjects to arsenic levels >150 μg/L-year. Carriers of S/S genotype had a significantly increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer [HR 3.05 (95% CI, 1.24-7.48), P = 0.015] as compared to those who carried L/L genotype for the entire subjects. Regarding liver and intrahepatic bile ducts cancer, carriers of S/S genotype also had a significantly increased risk [HR 4.14 (95% CI, 1.30-13.21), P = 0.016] when compared to those carried L/S genotype.

Objective: The aim of this study was to improve the problem of loop formation and shorten the cecal intubation time of colonoscopy by using a magnetic control system (MCS). Methods: Two experienced gastroenterologists, three trainees, and a novice repeated colonoscopy without or with MCS on three colonoscopy training model simulator cases. These cases were divided into introductory (case 2) and challenging levels (cases 4 and 5). The cecal intubation times were recorded. Results: For all cases, the average cecal intubation times for the experienced gastroenterologists with MCS were significantly shorter than without MCS (case 2: 52.45 vs. 27.65 s, p < 0.001; case 4: 166.7 vs. 120.55 s, p < 0.01; case 5: 130.35 vs. 100.2 s, p < 0.05). Those of the trainees also revealed significantly shorter times with MCS (case 2: 67.27 vs. 51 s, p < 0.01; case 4: 253.27 vs. 170.97 s, p < 0.001; case 5: 144.1 vs. 85.57 s, p < 0.001).

The development includes novel methodologies in conventional B-mode and modern ultrasound modalities such as elastography and automated breast ultrasound. For B-mode images, gray-scale invariant texture features were proposed to solve the changing of echogenicities from various ultrasound systems. Speckle patterns were analyzed to show the properties of tiny scatterers with microstructure contained in breast tissues for tissue characterization. Using quantified sonographic findings in tumor classification can achieve better diagnostic result than combining all features together. Elastography CAD systems use automatic tumor segmentation and clustering method to reduce operator-dependence. Dynamic sequence features were extracted from a sequence of elastograms to provide tumor stiffness without selecting slices. Another approach was selecting slices with quality evaluation methods. Both approaches reduced the overloads of physicians in slice selection. Automated breast ultrasound system is developed to automatically scan the whole breast and build the volumetric breast structure. Three-dimensional morphology, texture, and speckle features were proposed and combined to provide more diagnostic information than two-dimensional features. These CAD systems for B-mode, elastography, and automated breast ultrasound are good at malignancy evaluation and would be helpful in clinic use. ? 2014 Springer International Publishing.",breast cancer; Computer-aided diagnosis; ultrasound,Automation; Cluster analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Quality control; Speckle; Textures; Tissue engineering; Tumors; Ultrasonic equipment; Ultrasonics; Breast Cancer; Invariant texture features; Quality evaluation method; Sonographic findings; Three dimensional morphology; Tissue characterization; Tumor classification; Two-dimensional features; Medical imaging,2-s2.0-84903941158

This study qualitatively and quantitatively evaluates the imaging of transition into driven equilibrium of the balanced steady-state free precession (TIDE) compared with TSE and turbo gradient spin-echo on T2-weighted MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty healthy volunteers were examined with T2-weighted images by using TIDE, TSE, and turbo gradient spin-echo sequences. Imaging was evaluated qualitatively by 2 independent observers on the basis of a 4-point rating scale regarding contrast characteristics and artifacts behavior. Image SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio were quantitatively assessed. RESULTS: TIDE provided T2-weighted contrast similar to that in TSE and turbo gradient spin-echo with only one-eighth of the scan time. TIDE showed gray-white matter differentiation and iron-load sensitivity inferior that of TSE and turbo gradient spin-echo, but with improved motion artifacts reduction on qualitative scores. Nonmotion ghosting artifacts were uniquely found in TIDE images. The overall SNRs of TSE were 1.9 -2.0 times those of turbo gradient spin-echo and 1.7-2.2 times of those of TIDE for brain tissue (P <.0001). TIDE had a higher contrast-to-noise ratio than TSE (P = .169) and turbo gradient spin-echo (P <.0001) regarding non-iron-containing gray matter versus white matter. TIDE had a lower contrast-to-noise ratio than turbo gradient spin-echo and TSE (P <.0001) between iron-containing gray matter and white matter. CONCLUSIONS: TIDE provides T2-weighted images with reduced scan times and reduced motion artifacts compared with TSE and turbo gradient spin-echo with the trade-off of reduced SNR and poorer gray-white matter differentiation.",,"adult; article; brain tissue; caudate nucleus; contrast to noise ratio; controlled study; female; functional neuroimaging; gray matter; human; imaging and display; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prospective study; rating scale; steady state; T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging; transition into driven equilibrium; white matter; algorithm; anatomy and histology; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-84902334033

Methods: Two hundred and fifty-five new patients (130 were younger than 65 years and 125 were older than 65 years) who had received conventional HD for at least 1 year were reviewed. Results: Older patients had significantly more arteriovenous (AV) shunt failures (0.7 ± 0.1 vs 0.4 ± 0.07, P = 0.006) and hospitalisations (0.8 ± 0.1 vs 0.4 ± 0.09, P = 0.03) than younger ones. Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis showed that AV shunt failure was an independent risk factor for hospitalisation. Conclusions: The relatively high risk of AV shunt failures and hospitalisation in older patients highlights the additional expenditure on HD required in terms of health insurance. ? 2012 The Authors.",Arteriovenous access failure; Haemodialysis; Health insurance; Hospitalisation; Older people,"age; aged; aging; arteriovenous shunt; chi square distribution; comparative study; economics; female; health care cost; health insurance; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; renal replacement therapy; retrospective study; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; treatment failure; Age Factors; Aged; Aging; Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Health Care Costs; Hospitalization; Humans; Insurance, Health; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Renal Dialysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Treatment Failure",2-s2.0-84902010419

Pressure ulcers are a skin-integrity-related care issue and an important clinical indicator of care quality, especially for lung cancer inpatients who face rapidly deteriorating health conditions due to multiple symptoms and the side effects of treatment. Treating severe pressure ulcers may consume considerable manpower, time, and medical resources. Pressure ulcers may be avoided or effectively treated when nurses conduct proper skin assessments and care for wounds properly.Purpose: This project evaluates the effcacy of skin care bundles in terms of reducing the incidence density of pressure ulcers in lung cancer inpatients.Resolution: Data gathered between January 2010 and March 2011 showed unstable incidence density for pressure ulcers. The average pressure-ulcer incidence density in lung cancer inpatients was 2.09%, which was 8-times higher than the average for all patients. Using evidence-based care bundles for pressure ulcer prevention, we trained nurse staffs to incorporate these bundles into their clinical daily care of lung cancer patients in our hospital.Results: During the study period between November 2011 and January 2012, the pressure-ulcer incidence density gradually fell to 0.55%. The incidence density continued to fall to 0.33% over the subsequent 8 months.Conclusions: We used the concept of ""care bundles"" to establish a standard skin-care protocol for advanced lung cancer inpatients.

Methods A qualitative design was used, with a purposive sample of OTHP including OT surgeons (OTS) and nursing groups. Data were collected by thorough face-to-face interviews and were analyzed using content analysis. Results Fifty-five subjects (39 female, 16 male) participated in this project. They included 15 OTS and 40 nurses. The nurses included registered nurses (n = 27), nurse practitioners (n = 5), and assistant or head nurses (n = 8). Their ages ranged from 25 to 66 (mean = 38.4) years old. Thirty-eight (69%) had college education, and 17 (31%) had graduate education. Their OT careers ranged from between 3 to 40 (mean = 23.8) years for OTS, and 0.5 to 15 (mean = 4.10) years for the OT nursing group. Five types of caring difficulties were reported: (1) threat of OT failure, (2) work overload, (3) insufficient collaboration within interdisciplinary teams due to incongruent surgical and nursing opinions, (4) poor communication between OTHP and POTR, and (5) lack of competent professional OT care. Conclusions The following suggestions were made to help relieve the OTHPs' stress in providing holistic care for POTR and their families during DRE: (1) increasing the amount of experienced OT manpower and professional communication liaisons, (2) providing systematic on-the-job interdisciplinary case seminars and OT workshops, and (3) enhancing the POTR's mental health care and helping manage their distress of DRE. ? 2014 by Elsevier Inc.

The elevated cytokine levels likely contribute to the increased incidence of inflammatory diseases after menopause, such as osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative cardiovascular diseases and visual disease. To determine the role of 17β-estradiol and involvement of its receptors in the prevention of light-induced corneal disorders, we performed oxidative UVB-induced corneal injury model following surgically ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. Effects of UVB-induced damage on corneal tissues in OVX were compared to that in no OVX female animals. Methods: Fifteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups. Corneal oxidative injury was induced by exposure to UVB irradiation at 560 μW/cm2 for five days, followed surgical menopause induced by bilaterally OVX. The experimental animals without surgically OVX were used as surgical treatment controls and animals without UVB irradiation as blank controls. Leukocyte accumulation and central corneal epithelial thickness after injury were examined by histopathology analysis, respectively. Results: UVB irradiation caused substantial damage to the corneas, including thinning of corneal epithelial layer, induction of neovasculazation. After surgical menopause by bilaterally ovariectomy, corneal disorders were significantly enhanced compared with UVB and blank control groups. Studies showed that increased central corneal epithelial disorders and corneal neovasculazation after ovariectomy in vivo in terms of change in corneal epithelial thickness and vessel length (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The studies demonstrated that surgical menopause intensity effects on UVB radiation-induced corneal oxidative disorders in female rats, including decreased central corneal epithelial thickness and increased corneal neovasculazation.",Menopause; Ovariectomy; UVB-induced damage,,2-s2.0-84899131234
