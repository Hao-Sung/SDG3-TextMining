"Recurrent corneal erosion caused by retained sutures in blepharoplasty","2019","Purpose: To present recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) caused by late suture exposure after blepharoplasty. Methods: Four patients who have unilateral RCE were found to have previous blepharoplasty. The RCE was associated with late suture exposure. The clinical courses, characteristics, methods to identify the suture exposure and treatment were presented. Results: The clinical presentations including local erosion of upper bulbar conjunctiva, corneal abrasion lines, local corneal epithelial defects with rough border, and subepithelial opacity were noticed in all four patients. RCE symptoms exaggerated in eye blinking and did not respond to artificial tears treatment. Erosion recurred soon after the removal of therapeutic contact lenses. They underwent blepharoplasty 1–10?years before RCE emerged, and the RCE lasted 1–8?months before suture exposure was found. RCE healed within 1?week after suture removal. Conclusions: Suture exposure may occur several years after blepharoplasty and could cause RCE. Thorough exploration of the fornix by double eyelid eversion can identify the hidden sutures in such patients. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","artificial tear; gamma interferon; abrasion; adult; aged; Article; biomicroscopy; blurred vision; clinical article; clinical feature; conjunctiva disease; conjunctiva erosion; conjunctival maceration; cornea disease; cornea erosion; cornea opacity; cornea tumor; corneal abrasion; corneal epithelial defect; corneal intraepithelial neoplasm; erosion; exaggerated eye blinking; exposure; eye movement disorder; eye pain; eye redness; eyelid reconstruction; female; human; intraocular foreign body; middle aged; recurrent disease; reoperation; suture removal; young adult; adverse device effect; case report; complication; cornea disease; eyelid reconstruction; postoperative complication; suture; Adult; Aged; Blepharoplasty; Corneal Diseases; Eye Foreign Bodies; Female; Humans; Postoperative Complications; Sutures; Young Adult"
"The protective effect of non-invasive low intensity pulsed electric field and fucoidan in preventing oxidative stress-induced motor neuron death via ROCK/Akt pathway","2019","With the expansion of the aged population, it is predicted that neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) will become a major threat to public health worldwide. However, existing therapies can control the symptoms of the diseases at best, rather than offering a fundamental cure. As for the complex pathogenesis, clinical and preclinical researches have indicated that oxidative stress, a central role in neuronal degeneration, is a possible therapeutic target in the development of novel remedies. In this study, the motor neuron-like cell line NSC-34 was employed as an experimental model in probing the effects induced by the combination of non-invasive low intensity pulsed electric field (LIPEF) and fucoidan on the H 2 O 2 -induced neuron damage. It was found that single treatment of the LIPEF could protect the NSC-34 cells from oxidative stress, and the protective effect was enhanced by combining the LIPEF and fucoidan. Notably, it was observed that single treatment of the LIPEF obviously suppressed the H 2 O 2 -enhanced expression of ROCK protein and increased the phosphorylation of Akt in the H 2 O 2 -treated NSC-34 cells. Moreover, the LIPEF can be easily modified to concentrate on a specific area. Accordingly, this technique can be used as an advanced remedy for ROCK inhibition without the drawback of drug metabolism. Therefore, we suggest the LIPEF would be a promising strategy as a treatment for motor neurodegeneration and warrant further probe into its potential in treating other neuronal degenerations. ? 2019 Hsieh et al.

"Reduction of healthcare costs by implementing palliative family conference with the decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatments","2020","Background: Evidence regarding the impact of early palliative family conferences (PFCs) and decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment (DTW) on healthcare costs in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting is inconsistent. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients who died in an ICU from 2013 to 2016. PFCs held within 7 days after ICU admission and DTWs were verified by reviewing medical records and claims data. Comparisons were first made between patients with and without DTWs, and secondly, between DTW patients with and without PFCs within 7 days. Propensity score matching methods were used to examine the difference in costs between patients with and without DTWs and PFCs within 7 days. Results: Of the 579 patients included, those with DTWs (n = 73) had a longer ICU stay than those without (n = 506) (12.9 ± 7.1 vs. 8.4 ± 9.6 days, p < 0.001). The DTW patients were more likely to have a “do-not-resuscitate” order (p < 0.001) and PFCs within 7 days (p < 0.001) and had lower healthcare costs (USD 7358 ± 4116 vs. 8669 ± 9,535, p = 0.038). After matching, healthcare cost reduction for patients with DTWs, compared with those without DTWs, was USD 3467 [95% CI, 915–6019] (p < 0.001). Compared with DTW patients without PFCs within 7 days, the costs for DTW patients with PFCs within 7 days further reduced to USD 3042 [95%CI, 1358–4725] (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Palliative family conferences held within 7 days after ICU admission with decisions to withdraw life-sustaining treatments significantly lowered healthcare costs. ? 2019","adult; conference paper; controlled study; do not resuscitate order; drug withdrawal; female; health care cost; human; intensive care unit; life sustaining treatment; major clinical study; male; medical record; propensity score; retrospective study; article"
"ZNF479 downregulates metallothionein-1 expression by regulating ASH2L and DNMT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma","2019","Decreased expression of metallothionein-1 (MT-1) is associated with a poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we found that MT-1 expression was suppressed by 14-3-3ε, and MT-1 overexpression abolished 14-3-3ε-induced cell proliferation and tumor growth. We identified that 14-3-3ε induced expression of ZNF479, a novel potential transcriptional regulator by gene expression profiling and ZNF479 contributed to 14-3-3ε-suppressed MT-1 expression. ZNF479 induced the expression of DNMT1, UHRF1, and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex proteins (ASH2L and Menin), and increased tri-methylated histone H3 (H3K4me3) levels, but suppressed H3K4 (H3K4me2) di-methylation. ZNF479-suppressed MT-1 expression was restored by silencing of ASH2L and DNMT1. Furthermore, ZNF479 expression was higher in HCC tissues than that in the non-cancerous tissues. Expression analyses revealed a positive correlation between the expression of ZNF479 and DNMT1, UHRF1, ASH2L, and Menin, and an inverse correlation with that of ZNF479, ASH2L, Menin, and MT-1 isoforms. Moreover, correlations between the expression of ZNF479 and its downstream factors were more pronounced in HCC patients with hepatitis B. Here, we found that ZNF479 regulates MT-1 expression by modulating ASH2L in HCC. Approaches that target ZNF479/MLL complex/MT-1 or related epigenetic regulatory factors are potential therapeutic strategies for HCC. ? 2019, The Author(s).","DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; histone H3; metallothionein I; methionine; mixed lineage leukemia protein; protein 14 3 3; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; ash2l gene; cancer chemotherapy; carcinogenesis; cell function; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene; gene control; gene expression; gene silencing; histone methylation; human; human cell; human tissue; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; tumor growth; tumor volume; uhrf1 gene; znf479 gene"
"Improved prognosis with induction chemotherapy in pathological complete responders after trimodality treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: Hypothesis generating for adjuvant treatment","2019","Purpose: To compare the locations of recurrences and survival outcomes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients with pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without preceding induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by esophagectomy. Methods: Among 276 patients with locally advanced ESCC undergoing trimodality treatment during 2004–2014, 94 (34.1%) with pCR were eligible. The cohort included 26 patients undergoing IC before CCRT (IC group), and 68 patients who did not receive IC (non-IC group). Results: At a median follow-up of 51.4 months (95% confidence interval; 42.9–62.1), 19 patients experienced recurrences. There was a trend toward fewer distant failures in the IC group (0% vs.14.7%, p = 0.057), while locoregional recurrence was similar (7.7% vs. 7.4%). IC was associated with significantly improved survivals with the 5-year RFS and OS rates for the IC group of 85.1% and 90.5%, respectively, compared to of 46.2% and 48.1% for the non-IC group (p = 0.008 for RFS, and p = 0.015 for OS). By multivariable analyses, IC remained the only significant factor associated with survivals (HR:0.18 for RFS, p = 0.020 and HR:0.18 for OS, p = 0.025). The effect of IC in the whole cohort, irrespective of pathological response, was also assessed. Patients with non-pCR in the IC group had a trend toward worse survivals compared to the non-IC group Conclusions: In ESCC patients with pCR after trimodality treatment, IC was associated with favorable survivals. The benefits of IC might be a hypothesis generation for adjuvant treatment for patients with pCR. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology","cisplatin; fluorouracil; folinic acid; paclitaxel; adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer surgery; continuous infusion; controlled study; distant metastasis; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus resection; female; follow up; human; induction chemotherapy; intensity modulated radiation therapy; lung metastasis; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; male; mediastinum metastasis; multimodality cancer therapy; overall survival; pneumonia; postoperative complication; priority journal; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; second cancer; surgical mortality; treatment response"
"Clinical characteristics of glaucoma patients with disc hemorrhage in different locations","2019","Purpose: To compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of eyes with unilateral disc hemorrhage (DH) in different locations. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. DHs were classified by locations: the superior, superotemporal, inferotemporal, or inferior sectors of optic disc were classified as the susceptible area, while other sectors were defined as the less susceptible area. Structural and functional outcomes were analyzed by the Humphrey field analyzer and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Results: Forty-three eyes with DHs in the susceptible area were less myopic and had more peripapillary-type DH, larger cup-to-disc ratio, cup volume, and disc area. Thirty-three eyes with DHs in the less susceptible area had less association with RNFL defects, greater tilted ratio, and less torsion of the disc. Follow-up revealed that the change in sectoral RNFL (μm) thickness was significantly greater for DHs in the susceptible area within one?year (? 6.0 ± 14.0 vs. 0.7 ± 13.0, p = 0.035) and two years (? 10.0 ± 17.4 vs. ? 1.1 ± 7.6, p = 0.012), while the change in average RNFL thickness was not different. Eyes with DHs in the susceptible area had faster MD deterioration (dB/year) than those in the less susceptible area within four years (? 0.32 ± 0.51 vs. ? 0.05 ± 0.45, p = 0.047). A total of 16.9% of eyes, all in the susceptible area, had localized VF progression at DH corresponding area. Conclusion: Disc hemorrhage in the superotemporal and inferotemporal regions had more subsequent structural and functional deterioration compared with the eyes with DHs in the temporal quadrant and nasal area. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; cohort analysis; disc hemorrhage; disease classification; female; follow up; human; intraocular hemorrhage; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; optic disk; priority journal; retinal nerve fiber layer thickness; retrospective study; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; visual field; comparative study; complication; glaucoma; nerve fiber; optic nerve disease; optical coherence tomography; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; retina ganglion cell; retina hemorrhage; vascularization; visual acuity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glaucoma; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Fibers; Optic Disk; Optic Nerve Diseases; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Retinal Hemorrhage; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity; Visual Fields"
"Fracture types affect clinical outcomes of patients managed within the fracture liaison and osteoporosis medication management services","2019","Osteoporosis medication in fragility fracture patients is associated with better outcomes. However, limited studies have investigated whether fracture types affect outcomes among patients undergoing treatment. We performed a secondary data analysis on participants from a fracture liaison service and an osteoporosis medication management service. Participants (n = 974) were regrouped into hip fracture (HF), vertebral fracture (VF), HF + VF, and NO HF/VF groups at baseline. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify baseline correlates on one-year mortality, incident refractures, and falls. Baseline characteristics were different among fracture groups. The HF group was oldest, with the lowest body mass index (BMI), lowest FRAX? T-score and had the highest 10-year fracture risk. After intervention, the HF group still had the highest mortality, but the HF + VF group had the highest refracture and incident fall rates. In the multivariate regression analysis, prevalent HF and VF, lower BMI and albumin level, and having chronic kidney disease or cancer were associated with higher mortality rates. HF + VF patients had the highest refracture risk. Prevalent HF and VF, older age and higher BMI, and having cancer or osteoarthritis were associated with a greater fall risk. HF and VF are associated with adverse outcomes, even under an optimal fracture care. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The relationship between androgen deprivation therapy and depression symptoms in patients with prostate cancer","2019","Aim: In this study, we administered a questionnaire to consecutive prostate cancer patients who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for understanding the prevalence of depression symptoms. Materials and methods: We retrospectively identified patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who received ADT between January 2015 and February 2018 at Mackay Memorial Hospital. The patients were then asked to complete the Chinese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during an interview. The patients were divided into two groups according to PHQ-9 score: those with depression symptoms (PHQ-9 ? 6, depression group), and those without depression symptoms (PHQ-9 < 6, non-depression group). Two groups were compared using t-tests and correlation coefficients, as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p <.05. Results: There were no significant correlations between PHQ-9 scores and any of the parameters in the patients overall. In subgroup analysis, a positive correlation was found between the duration of ADT and PHQ-9 score in the patients with depression symptoms (p =.03). In addition, univariate analysis showed a positive association between the duration of ADT and PHQ-9 score, and a longer duration of ADT was further independently associated with increased PHQ-9 score in multivariate analysis in the patients with depression symptoms. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that in patients with prostate cancer and depression symptoms, the severity of the depression symptoms was positively correlated with the duration of ADT. In contrast, this association was not found in patients without depression symptoms. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Paradoxical relationship between glycated hemoglobin and longitudinal change in physical functioning in older adults: A prospective cohort study","2019","Background: Hyperglycemia with high hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels is associated with significant health risks. However, the relationship between HbA1c levels and the physical functioning status in later life remains uncertain and so is the possible underlying mechanism. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 2,565 initially well-functioning community-dwelling older adult aged 55 years and older from the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan. Each participant received baseline measurements of blood HbA1c and inflammatory markers levels and repeated assessments of physical functioning over a mean follow-up period of 5.3 years. We used generalized linear mixed-effects regression to estimate the adjusted changes in the odds ratio for self-reported physical functioning impairment and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score according to baseline HbA1c levels (categorized into 0.5% increments from &lt;5.5% to ?7.0%). Results: HbA1c levels showed a U-shaped relationship with changes in the odds ratio for physical functioning impairment and SPPB score (p for quadratic term &lt; .001). Compared with participants with an HbA1c of 5.5% to &lt;6.0%, those with an HbA1c of &lt;5.5% or ?7.0% had a higher annual increase in the odds ratio for physical functioning impairment (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] per year, 1.25 [1.04–1.50] and 1.21 [1.04–1.41]) and a higher annualized decrease in SPPB score (coefficient [95% confidence interval], ?0.05 [?0.10 to 0.00] and ?0.04 [?0.08 to 0.00]). These relationships were nonlinear only in participants with high soluble interleukin-6 receptor levels (&gt;48,124 pg/mL; p for interaction &lt; .05). Conclusions: High and low HbA1c levels at baseline are associated with faster physical functioning decline, particularly among individuals with elevated circulating soluble interleukin-6 receptor, a sign of enhanced interleukin-6 trans-signaling. ?

"Diversity of nasal microbiota and its interaction with surface microbiota among residents in healthcare institutes","2019","Nasal microbial communities may have crucial implications for human health, including for residents of healthcare institutes (HCIs). Factors that determine the diversity of nasal microbiota in HCIs remain unclear. Herein, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to investigate the relationship between nasal and surface microbiota in three HCIs. Participants were classified into a hospitalised or nonhospitalised group based on their most recent date of hospitalisation. A total of 88 nasal samples and 83 surface samples were analysed. Dysgonomonas and Corynebacterium were the most abundant taxa in the surface and nasal samples, respectively. Significant differences were discovered in microbiota diversity among HCIs when comparing the surface and nasal samples. Fifteen taxa were identified as present in all the surface and nasal samples. SourceTracker analysis revealed that the ventilation conditions of environment might be associated with the proportion of shared microbial communities between nasal and surface. Additionally, as compared with the nonhospitalised group, the hospitalised group had a higher proportion of surface microbiota in their nasal samples, which might lead to a higher risk of human-related microorganisms or pathogens colonising the nasal cavity. The data suggest that nasal bacterial diversity could be influenced by both health status and living environment. Our results therefore highlight the importance of the indoor environment for HCI residents. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Chinese Martial Art Training Failed to Improve Balance or Inhibit Falls in Older Adults","2019","This randomized controlled trial explored the effects of a Ving Tsun (VT) Chinese martial art training program on reactive standing balance performance, postural muscle reflex contraction latency, leg muscle performance, balance confidence and falls in community-dwelling older adults. We randomly assigned 33 healthy older adults to either a VT group (mean age = 67.5 years) or a control group (mean age = 72.1 years). The VT group received two 1-hour VT training sessions per week for three months (24 sessions). Primary outcome measures collected before and after the intervention period were electromyographic muscle activation onset latencies of the hamstring and gastrocnemius and the center of pressure path, length and movement velocity in standing (reactive balance performance). Secondary outcome measures included isometric peak force and time to isometric peak force of the knee extensors and flexors, the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale score, and fall history. Results revealed that the mean gastrocnemius muscle activation onset latency was significantly longer (22.53 ms) in the VT group after the intervention. The peak force of the knee flexors significantly increased (by 1.58 kg) in the control group over time but not in the VT group. The time to reach peak force in the knee flexors was significantly longer (by 0.51 s) in the control group (but not the VT group) at posttest compared with the pretest value. No other significant group, time, or group-by-time interaction effects were noted. We discussed possible reasons for the failure of three months of martial art training to benefit fall risks among these older adults. ?

"The influence of breastfeeding in breast-fed infants with atopic dermatitis","2019","Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether breastfeeding should be discontinued for exclusively breast-fed infants with atopic dermatitis (AD). Methods: Eighty-seven exclusively breast-fed infants with AD were enrolled in a prospective observational study. The infants were divided into 3 groups: breastfeeding only (BM group), partial breastfeeding and partial partially hydrolyzed whey formula (pHF-W) (Partial group) and pHF-W only (DC group). The extent and severity of AD were evaluated with the Patient-Oriented SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (PO-SCORAD) index at enrollment and 3 and 6 months later. Results: There were no significant differences in parental atopy history, PO-SCORAD scores, and medication scores at baseline. At month 3 and 6, the PO-SCORAD scores were significantly decreased in all groups. PO-SCORAD scores at month 3 and 6 and at the last time point when topical corticosteroids were given were significantly different among the groups. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that baseline PO-SCORAD scores and stopping breastfeeding were significantly associated with month 3 PO-SCORAD scores (p < 0.001), after adjusting for sex, age, baseline medication scores, partial breastfeeding and parental atopy history. In addition to baseline PO-SCORAD scores and stopping breastfeeding, partial breastfeeding was significantly associated with month 6 PO-SCORAD scores. Long-term follow-up showed that only stopping breastfeeding was significantly associated with the last time point when topical corticosteroids were given (p = 0.014). Conclusion: For exclusively breast-fed infants with AD, discontinuing breastfeeding and shifting to pHF-W might help to improve symptoms and shorten the duration of AD regardless of sex, age and parental atopy history. ? 2017","antibiotic agent; antihistaminic agent; corticosteroid; emollient agent; fluticasone propionate; prednisolone; corticosteroid; age; Article; artificial milk; atopic dermatitis; atopy; breast feeding; breast feeding education; child; child parent relation; disease severity; family history; female; follow up; human; infant; major clinical study; male; milk; observational study; patient oriented scoring atopic dermatitis score; preschool child; prospective study; questionnaire; self evaluation; atopic dermatitis; pathology; risk factor; severity of illness index; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Breast Feeding; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Self-Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Resurgence of pertussis in Taiwan during 2009–2015 and its impact on infants","2019","Background/purpose: Pertussis incidence markedly decreased due to universal vaccination, but outbreaks had been noted worldwide in recent decade. This study was conducted to know the epidemiology of pertussis and its impact on infants in Taiwan. Methods: Epidemiologic parameters for confirmed pertussis cases were collected from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The incidence of each age group over years was calculated using population data. We also did retrospective reviews of laboratory-confirmed pertussis cases in NTUH to analyze clinical characteristics and disease severity. Results: A total of 668 confirmed pertussis cases were obtained from the Taiwan CDC open database between 2003 and 2017. There was higher incidence during the period 2009–2015, with a mean incidence of 0.27 cases per 100,000 population, about 2-fold increase compared with mean incidence of 0.12 cases per 100,000 population during the period 2003–2008. Infants accounted for the highest proportion of all cases (49.8%), with mean incidence of 16.1 cases per 100,000 people per year during 2009–2015, and a trend of increase was found from 2003 to 2015. In NTUH, a total of 17 laboratory-confirmed pertussis cases were diagnosed during 2012–2016, and 14 cases were young infants. Among them, 9 infants had been admitted to intensive care unit and 2 infant needed invasive ventilator support. Conclusion: There was a resurgence of pertussis during 2009–2015 and it had significant impact on infants. Young infants with pertussis may be severe and need intensive care, so preventive strategy may be advocated for them. ? 2019","C reactive protein; virus antigen; Article; artificial ventilation; body weight; bronchiolitis; comorbidity; comparative study; coughing; cyanosis; disease burden; disease severity; epidemiological data; female; gestational age; groups by age; heart ventricle septum defect; hospital admission; household; human; Human respiratory syncytial virus; incidence; infant; intensive care unit; laboratory test; lung dysplasia; lymphocytosis; major clinical study; male; medical history; pertussis; pneumonia; population; prematurity; retrospective study; tachypnea; Taiwan; thorax radiography; vaccination; vomiting; adolescent; adult; child; complication; epidemic; health survey; newborn; pertussis; preschool child; season; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Population Surveillance; Retrospective Studies; Seasons; Taiwan; Vaccination; Whooping Cough; Young Adult"
"Rates and trends of psychiatric inpatient and postdischarge suicides in Taiwan, 2002–2013: a national register-based study","2019","Purpose: In contrast to the downsizing trend of psychiatric beds in the Western world, the psychiatric bed capacity in Taiwan has steadily increased in recent decades. This study aimed to assess the suicide rates and their variations over time among psychiatric inpatients and recently discharged patients. Methods: Data on psychiatric inpatients admitted from 2002 to 2013 were extracted from the psychiatric inpatient registry of the National Health Insurance and merged with information from the Cause of Death data by means of unique identified numbers. Suicides occurring during admission and within 90?days after discharge were defined as inpatient and postdischarge suicides, respectively. Calendar year was fitted as a continuous variable in multivariate Poisson regression models to evaluate these rates over time. The analyses were adjusted for sex, age, primary psychiatric diagnosis, and number of admissions in the preceding year. Results: The overall inpatient suicide rate was very low (81 per 100,000 person-years). It decreased significantly from 146 to 74 per 100,000 person-years over the study period. This fall was observed among both genders and across all psychiatric diagnoses. The postdischarge suicide rate was comparatively high (1108 per 100,000 person-years) and did not show statistically significant change over the study period. Conclusions: Our results suggest that efforts to increase public awareness of mental disorders and efficient utilization of psychiatric inpatient care are essential for suicide prevention despite the comparatively high bed capacity. The discharge plans of inpatients should be bridged with population suicide prevention programs for continuity of care after discharge. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; female; hospital discharge; hospital patient; human; male; mental disease; mental hospital; middle aged; psychology; register; statistics and numerical data; suicide; Taiwan; Adult; Female; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Inpatients; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Patient Discharge; Registries; Suicide; Taiwan"
"Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A overexpression promotes liver cancer development in transgenic zebrafish via activation of ERK and β-catenin pathways","2019","Dysregulation of the enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is known to promote tumorigenesis. Our recent study demonstrated that ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPIA), a key regulator of the PPP, regulates hepatoma cell proliferation and colony formation. Our studies in zebrafish reveal that RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and β-catenin signaling. To further investigate RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis, two independent lines of transgenic zebrafish expressing human RPIA in the liver were generated. These studies reveal that RPIA overexpression triggers lipogenic factor/enzyme expression, steatosis, fibrosis and proliferation of the liver. In addition, the severity of fibrosis and the extent of proliferation are positively correlated with RPIA expression levels. Furthermore, RPIA-mediated induction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires the ERK and β-catenin signaling pathway but is not dependent upon transaldolase levels. Our study presents a mechanism for RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis and suggests that RPIA represents a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","beta catenin; isomerase; mitogen activated protein kinase; ribose 5 phosphate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; enzyme activation; fatty liver; human; human cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transgenic zebrafish; xenotransplantation"
"Randomized phase III study (ADMYRE) of plitidepsin in combination with dexamethasone vs. dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma","2019","The randomized phase III ADMYRE trial evaluated plitidepsin plus dexamethasone (DXM) versus DXM alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma after at least three but not more than six prior regimens, including at least bortezomib and lenalidomide or thalidomide. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive plitidepsin 5?mg/m2 on D1 and D15 plus DXM 40?mg on D1, D8, D15, and D22 (arm A, n = 171) or DXM 40?mg on D1, D8, D15, and D22 (arm B, n = 84) q4wk. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS without disease progression (PD) confirmation (IRC assessment) was 2.6?months (arm A) and 1.7?months (arm B) (HR = 0.650; p = 0.0054). Median PFS with PD confirmation (investigator’s assessment) was 3.8?months (arm A) and 1.9?months (arm B) (HR = 0.611; p = 0.0040). Median overall survival (OS, intention-to-treat analysis) was 11.6?months (arm A) and 8.9?months (arm B) (HR = 0.797; p = 0.1261). OS improvement favoring arm A was found when discounting a crossover effect (37 patients crossed over from arm B to arm A) (two-stage method; HR = 0.622; p = 0.0015). The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (% of patients arm A/arm B) were fatigue (10.8%/1.2%), myalgia (5.4%/0%), and nausea (3.6%/1.2%), being usually transient and reversible. The safety profile does not overlap with the toxicity observed with other agents used in multiple myeloma. In conclusion, efficacy data, the reassuring safety profile, and the novel mechanism of action of plitidepsin suggest that this combination can be an alternative option in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma after at least three prior therapy lines. ? 2019, The Author(s).","dehydrodidemnin B; dexamethasone; antineoplastic agent; bortezomib; dehydrodidemnin B; depsipeptide; dexamethasone; lenalidomide; thalidomide; adult; aged; Article; cancer survival; clinical evaluation; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug safety; fatigue; female; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; male; multiple myeloma; myalgia; nausea; overall survival; priority journal; prognosis; progression free survival; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; treatment duration; clinical trial; disease free survival; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; multiple myeloma; phase 3 clinical trial; survival rate; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Bortezomib; Depsipeptides; Dexamethasone; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Lenalidomide; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Survival Rate; Thalidomide"
"The effect of a 12-week home-based walking program on reducing fatigue in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy: A randomized controlled study","2019","Background: Fatigue is the most common symptom experienced by cancer patients during treatment and can last long after completing treatment. Fatigue in cancer patients who have completed treatment is well known to be reduced by exercise, but the effect of exercise on reducing fatigue in patients under treatment has been inconsistent. Objectives: The purposes of this study were to examine short-term and long-term effects of an individually tailored, home-based brisk walking program on reducing fatigue in breast cancer patients under chemotherapy. Design, setting, participants: For this randomized controlled trial, women were recruited from a medical center in northern Taiwan if they were diagnosed with stages I-III breast cancer and experienced insomnia, fatigue, pain, or depressive symptoms after their first cycle of chemotherapy. Consenting participants (N = 159) were randomly assigned to either an exercise (12-week home-based walking program) group (n = 81) or an attention-control group (n = 78). Methods: The 12-week, home-based brisk walking program started on the first day of the third chemotherapy cycle. Fatigue was measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory. Covariates, i.e., functional performance, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and exercise-related variables, were also measured. Data were collected at baseline, two times during the exercise intervention, and five times after the exercise intervention (eight times in total). The effects of time-varying and time-invariant predictors on fatigue were analyzed by multilevel modeling. Results: Fatigue levels increased over time for both groups, even after completing treatment. At the end of the 12-week exercise program, the exercise group had less fatigue than the attention-control group, and this group difference was maintained for the whole study period. At the end of exercise program, women who had spent more time exercising before diagnosis had less fatigue than those who had exercised less often. In addition, patients' fatigue levels at various time points fluctuated along with their functional performance, sleep disturbance, and depression. Conclusions: Our tailored, home-based brisk walking program effectively reduced fatigue in breast cancer patients under chemotherapy, and this effect lasted after completing treatment. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",""
"Risk Factors for Poor Functional Recovery, Mortality, Recurrent Fractures, and Falls Among Patients Participating in a Fracture Liaison Service Program","2019","Objective: A fracture liaison service (FLS) for patients with fractures is a promising approach for improving outcomes, but barriers to the successful implementation of an FLS remain. The factors influencing the outcomes of patients already receiving FLS care are unclear. Design: A prospective multicenter cohort study. Settings and participants: Patients with incident hip and clinical vertebral fractures treated at 2 institutions between January 2014 and June 2016 were prospectively enrolled. Demographic profiles, comorbidities, prior fracture experiences, T scores, Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) scores, and serum markers were examined. Measures: Self-reported functional status (at the 4th month), mortality, recurrent fractures, and falls (at the 2-year follow-up). Results: Of 712 patients screened for eligibility, 600 (84%) participants (age 78 ± 10 years) were enrolled in the FLS program. At 4 months, 58%, 53%, and 60% of the participants reported improved mobility, self-care, and daily activities after FLS care, respectively. After 2 years, 85 (14%) died, 36 (6%) developed recurrent fractures, and 199 (33%) had 1 or more fall episodes. Multivariate logistic regression showed that neurologic disorders, heart disease, and diabetes were associated with a decreased probability of functional recovery. Cox regression showed that older age and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were predictive of increased mortality, whereas heart disease was correlated with an increased refracture risk. Older age and cancer or osteoarthritis were associated with a higher risk of falls. Importantly, a higher body mass index predicted a lower risk of mortality and a higher probability of improved self-care but a higher risk of fall at follow-up. Conclusions/Implications: We discovered that comorbidities including CKD, heart disease, cancer, and osteoarthritis could influence short-term functional changes, survival, and the risk of refractures or falls among patients participating in FLSs. These factors are expected to aid in prognosis estimation and management planning for those with fractures. ? 2018 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","albumin; alkaline phosphatase; calcium; creatinine; aged; albumin blood level; alcohol consumption; Article; body mass; bone density; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; convalescence; creatinine blood level; daily life activity; diabetes mellitus; falling; female; follow up; fracture liaison service; fragility fracture; functional status; health service; heart disease; hip fracture; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mortality; mortality risk; multicenter study; neurologic disease; osteoarthritis; osteoporosis; prospective study; risk factor; self care; spine fracture; very elderly"
"Impact of dysplastic surgical margins for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma","2019","Objectives: Dysplastic changes at the surgical margin of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) could be encountered frequently. However, the impact of a dysplastic surgical margin on patients with OSCC remains unclear. Materials and methods: Retrospectively, we reviewed patients with OSCC who were diagnosed and treated at the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2015. Patients were divided into four groups: clear (?5 mm), close (<5 mm), positive, and dysplastic margins. Results: Of 1642 patients, 596 had clear margin, 169 had positive margin, 707 had close margin, and 170 had dysplastic margin. The mean age at diagnosis was 55 ± 11 years (range, 16-97 years). Dysplastic margins were frequently present in patients with primary T1/T2 OSCC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, p = 0.009), tumor without perineural invasion (OR = 1.48, p = 0.04), and tumor thickness ?10 mm (OR = 1.94, p = 0.001). In patients with clear, close, positive, and dysplastic margins, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 63.1%, 51%, 37.2%, and 54.7%, respectively; overall survival (OS) rates were 71.1%, 61.9%, 49%, and 72%, respectively. Disease-free and overall survival were not significantly different in patients with dysplastic and clear margins (p = 0.37 and p = 0.38, respectively). Adjuvant radiotherapy had no significant benefit for patients with dysplastic margins. Finally, a multivariate analysis showed that the presence of a dysplastic margin was not an independent risk factor for disease-free (p = 0.43) and overall survival (p = 0.71). Conclusions: The survival rates of the patients with OSCC who had dysplastic margin were significantly better than those with positive margin. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adjuvant radiotherapy; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer radiotherapy; disease free survival; dysplasia; female; human; major clinical study; male; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; overall survival; perineural invasion; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; surgical margin"
"The Relationship Between Air Pollution and Lung Cancer in Nonsmokers in Taiwan","2019","Introduction: For never-smokers (smoked &lt;100 lifetime cigarettes), lung cancer (LC) has emerged as an important issue. We aimed to investigate the effects of prevalence changes in tobacco smoking and particulate matter (PM) 2.5 (PM 2.5 ) levels on LC in Taiwan, in relation to contrasting PM 2.5 levels, between Northern Taiwan (NT) and Southern Taiwan (ST). Methods: We reviewed 371,084 patients with LC to assess smoking prevalence and correlations between the incidence of adenocarcinoma lung cancer (AdLC) and non-AdLC. Two subsets were selected to assess different AdLC stage trends and the effect of PM 2.5 on survival of patients with AdLC. Results: From 1995 to 2015, the proportion of male adult ever-smokers decreased from 59.4% to 29.9% whereas the female smoking rate remained low (3.2% to 5.3%). AdLC incidence in males and females increased from 9.06 to 23.25 and 7.05 to 24.22 per 100,000 population, respectively. Since 1993, atmospheric visibility in NT improved (from 7.6 to 11.5 km), but deteriorated in ST (from 16.3 to 4.2 km). The annual percent change in AdLC stages IB to IV was 0.3% since 2009 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.9%–2.6%) in NT, and 4.6% since 2007 (95% CI: 3.3%–5.8%) in ST; 53% patients with LC had never smoked. Five-year survival rates for never-smokers, those with EGFR wild-type genes, and female patients with AdLC were 12.6% in NT and 4.5% in ST (hazard ratio: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70–0.90). Conclusions: In Taiwan, greater than 50% of patients with LC had never smoked. PM 2.5 level changes can affect AdLC incidence and patient survival. ? 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","adult; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; geographic distribution; human; human tissue; incidence; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; population research; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; sex difference; smoking; survival rate; Taiwan"
"Quantification of Serum Matrix Metallopeptide 7 Levels May Assist in the Diagnosis and Predict the Outcome for Patients with Biliary Atresia","2019","Objective: To assess the diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of the serum matrix metallopeptidase-7 (MMP-7) level for biliary atresia in infants with cholestasis after hepatoportoenterostomy. Study design: We enrolled 100 infants with cholestasis (age, 43.56 ± 1.97 days; 62 males) with a direct bilirubin level of >1 mg/dL, of whom 36 (36%) were diagnosed with biliary atresisa. The MMP-7 levels in serum samples collected during the cholestasis workup and 6 months after hepatoportoenterostomy were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We quantified liver fibrosis by Picro Sirius red staining of collagen in specimens from the 81 infants with cholestasis. Results: Infants with biliary atresisa had a significantly higher serum MMP-7 level than that of non–biliary atresisa infants with cholestasis of equivalent age (P <.0001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that a serum MMP-7 level of >1.43 ng/mL was predictive of biliary atresisa in infants with cholestasis (diagnostic accuracy, 88%). There was a positive correlation between the serum MMP-7 level and the severity of liver fibrosis (P =.0002). Survival analysis showed that the frequency of liver transplantation was significantly higher in infants with biliary atresisa with a serum MMP-7 level of >10.30 ng/mL compared with a serum MMP-7 level of ?10.30 ng/mL after hepatoportoenterostomy (hazard ratio, 4.22; P =.02). Conclusions: The serum MMP-7 level, which reflects the severity of liver fibrosis and can be determined noninvasively, may facilitate the diagnosis of biliary atresisa among infants with cholestasis. Moreover, the serum MMP-7 level after hepatoportoenterostomy is associated with a need for liver transplantation in infants with biliary atresisa. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; collagen; matrilysin; age; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bile duct atresia; bilirubin blood level; cholestasis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; esophagus varices; female; human; infant; jaundice; liver fibrosis; liver transplantation; major clinical study; male; portoenterostomy; priority journal; prognosis; protein blood level; splenomegaly; thrombocytopenia"

Here we report a case of tarsal navicular osteonecrosis with a complete course of treatment and comprehensive imaging studies starting at an early stage. A 37-year-old female diagnosed with tarsal navicular osteonecrosis was first treated with percutaneous decompression, but her symptoms persisted postoperatively. The tarsal navicular showed no further collapse, but follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 6 months postoperatively revealed persistent osteonecrotic changes. Debridement of the necrotic bone with preservation of the cortical shell and bone substitute packing for the defect (light bulb procedure) were performed. The symptoms resolved by 3 months postoperatively, and the patient could return to work. At a 6-year follow-up visit, the patient was free of symptoms, and MRI showed remodeling of the tarsal navicular without further collapse. ? 2018","calcium sulfate; adult; American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot scale score; ankle pain; arthroscopic surgery; Article; bone lesion; bone necrosis; case report; cast application; clinical article; conservative treatment; female; fluoroscopy; foot disease; foot pain; foot surgery; human; intraoperative period; light bulb procedure; musculoskeletal system parameters; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; percutaneous decompression; postoperative period; scoring system; talus osteochondral lesion; tarsal navicular osteonecrosis; weight bearing; bone necrosis; bone prosthesis; debridement; decompression surgery; diagnostic imaging; drug therapy; pathology; tarsal bone; Adult; Bone Substitutes; Debridement; Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Osteonecrosis; Tarsal Bones"
"Blood and seminal plasma mercury levels and predatory fish intake in relation to low semen quality","2019","Declining human sperm quality has been demonstrated in several recent studies. Age, environmental factors, and nutritional factors can affect semen quality. Mercury (Hg) is considered a male reproductive toxicant. Animal studies indicated that exposure to Hg can cause DNA damage, sperm dysfunction, and decreased sperm motility. Some previous studies also revealed that blood Hg levels in infertile or subfertile males were higher than those in normal males. In this study, we recruited 84 male participants from a reproductive medical center and investigated the Hg, lead, and selenium levels in blood and seminal plasma. Participants were divided into two groups, low- and high-quality semen groups, according to the World Health Organization reference values for human semen characteristics. The distribution of blood reproductive hormones and information on participants’ lifestyle and medical history were collected from structured questionnaires. Average Hg levels in blood were 9.3±5.9 versus 8.9±5.9 and in seminal plasma were 1.26±0.61 versus 1.05±0.52 μg/L in the low- and high-quality semen groups, respectively. There was a dose-dependent relationship between blood Hg levels and normal sperm morphology (p=0.02). Participants with predatory fish intake and high blood Hg level had lower sperm with a normal morphology. Therefore, predatory fish intake may be a critical risk factor for elevated Hg levels in males and cause low semen quality. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","bioaccumulation; blood; concentration (composition); DNA; dose-response relationship; food intake; lifestyle; mercury (element); morphology; risk factor; selenium; sperm; World Health Organization; Animalia; mercury; adult; analysis; animal; blood; chemistry; dietary exposure; drug effect; female; food chain; human; male; metabolism; pathology; pregnancy; sea food; semen analysis; sperm; spermatozoon; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon motility; water pollutant; young adult; Adult; Animals; Dietary Exposure; Female; Food Chain; Humans; Male; Mercury; Pregnancy; Seafood; Semen; Semen Analysis; Sperm Count; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Young Adult"
"Clinical outcomes of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed rhabdomyosarcoma treated by two consecutive protocols – A single institution report in Taiwan","2019","Background: Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group (TPOG) initiated two consecutive protocols for treating pediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma since 1995. However, the results have not been analyzed and reported yet. The aim of this study is to investigate the treatment results of these two protocols in our hospital and to assess whether the results are comparable to other large-scaled studies. Methods: Treatment of pediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma according to TPOG protocols at National Taiwan University Hospital began in 1995. Between 1995 and 2006, patients were treated by TPOG RMS 95 protocol, which was based on IRS-III/IV. After 2007, patients were treated by TPOG RMS 2007 protocol which was adapted from IRS-V study. The clinical data of patients were obtained retrospectively by reviewing medical records. The date of the latest follow-up was December 31, 2016. Results: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled in this study. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival rates of them were 54.7 ± 8.8% and 48.5 ± 8.6%, respectively. The 5-year OS rates for patients treated by TPOG RMS 95 and TPOG RMS 2007 protocols were 55.0 ± 11.1% and 55.9 ± 14.0%, respectively. Age at diagnosis of less than ten years old and receiving operation with gross total or subtotal tumor resection were identified as independent prognostic factors that predicted better outcomes in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion: The clinical outcomes of pediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma in Taiwan improved dramatically after incorporating two consecutive protocols from TPOG. In addition, the treatment results of these two protocols were comparable to large-scale studies of other countries. ? 2018","age; Article; cancer surgery; cancer survival; child; clinical article; clinical outcome; clinical protocol; event free survival; female; follow up; human; male; medical record; overall survival; pediatric patient; retrospective study; rhabdomyosarcoma; survival rate; Taiwan; adolescent; epidemiology; infant; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; multivariate analysis; newborn; pathology; preschool child; procedures; prognosis; rhabdomyosarcoma; survival analysis; antineoplastic agent; Adolescent; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Child; Child, Preschool; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Rhabdomyosarcoma; Survival Analysis; Taiwan"
"Wearable-based mobile health app in gastric cancer patients for postoperative physical activity monitoring: Focus group study","2019","Background: Surgical cancer patients often have deteriorated physical activity (PA), which in turn, contributes to poor outcomes and early recurrence of cancer. Mobile health (mHealth) platforms are progressively used for monitoring clinical conditions in medical subjects. Despite prevalent enthusiasm for the use of mHealth, limited studies have applied these platforms to surgical patients who are in much need of care because of acutely significant loss of physical function during the postoperative period. Objective: The aim of our study was to determine the feasibility and clinical value of using 1 wearable device connected with the mHealth platform to record PA among patients with gastric cancer (GC) who had undergone gastrectomy. Methods: We enrolled surgical GC patients during their inpatient stay and trained them to use the app and wearable device, enabling them to automatically monitor their walking steps. The patients continued to transmit data until postoperative day 28. The primary aim of this study was to validate the feasibility of this system, which was defined as the proportion of participants using each element of the system (wearing the device and uploading step counts) for at least 70% of the 28-day study. ""Definitely feasible,"" ""possibly feasible,"" and ""not feasible"" were defined as ?70%, 50%-69%, and <50% of participants meeting the criteria, respectively. Moreover, the secondary aim was to evaluate the clinical value of measuring walking steps by examining whether they were associated with early discharge (length of hospital stay <9 days). Results: We enrolled 43 GC inpatients for the analysis. The weekly submission rate at the first, second, third, and fourth week was 100%, 93%, 91%, and 86%, respectively. The overall daily submission rate was 95.5% (1150 days, with 43 subjects submitting data for 28 days). These data showed that this system met the definition of ""definitely feasible."" Of the 54 missed transmission days, 6 occurred in week 2, 12 occurred in week 3, and 36 occurred in week 4. The primary reason for not sending data was that patients or caregivers forgot to charge the wearable devices (>90%). Furthermore, we used a multivariable-adjusted model to predict early discharge, which demonstrated that every 1000-step increment of walking on postoperative day 5 was associated with early discharge (odds ratio 2.72, 95% CI 1.17-6.32; P=.02). Conclusions: Incorporating the use of mobile phone apps with wearable devices to record PA in patients of postoperative GC was feasible in patients undergoing gastrectomy in this study. With the support of the mHealth platform, this app offers seamless tracing of patients' recovery with a little extra burden and turns subjective PA into an objective, measurable parameter. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

"Alcohol use pattern, alcohol dependence, and their correlation with driving under the influence in adult first-time DUI offenders in Taipei City","2019","Objectives: This study investigated alcohol use problems in first-time offenders of driving under the influence (DUI) in Taipei City and the risk factors for a high frequency of DUI. Methods: We conducted an anonymous survey for first-time DUI offenders who attended the mandatory educational program held by Taiwan Taipei District Prosecutors Office. Participants completed the following self-rated questionnaires: the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test for screening alcohol use disorder (AUD); the C-CAGE questionnaire for screening alcohol dependence (AD); and the Brief Symptom Rating Scale for screening psychological symptoms, alcohol drinking, and DUI variables. We defined a high frequency of DUI as occurrence of 2 or more DUI behaviors per month. Results: Among 597 participants, 52.3% and 34.4% had AUD and AD, respectively. Offenders with AUD or AD had higher risks of binge-drinking behavior, consuming a high alcohol concentration, and psychological and sleep problems. AUD, AD, and drinking at the workplace were potential risk factors for a high frequency of DUI. Notably, compared with offenders without AUD and AD, offenders with AUD and AD respectively had 5 and 2 times higher likelihoods of having a high frequency of DUI. Conclusions: AUD or its more severe form, AD, is relatively common in first-time DUI offenders. In particular, having AUD or AD is associated with an increased risk of a high frequency of DUI. Routine screening for alcohol use problems and ensuing intervention programs or referral to treatment are warranted for all DUI offenders to reduce the recidivism rate and alcohol-related harm. ? 2019 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

"Decreased Colorectal Adenoma Risk after Helicobacter pylori Eradication: A Retrospective Cohort Study","2019","Background: Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with colorectal adenoma and confers a 1.3- to 2.26-fold increased risk. We evaluated the association between H. pylori and the progression of colorectal adenoma. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 615 adults with no history of colorectal adenoma or cancer at baseline who participated in a repeated, regular health screening examination, which included a bidirectional gastrointestinal endoscopy, between July 2006 and June 2015. A gastric biopsy specimen from each subject was tested for H. pylori. Results: During follow-up, the incidence rates of colorectal adenoma progression in participants with persistent H. pylori infections (persistent group) and those whose infections had previously been successfully eradicated (eradication group) were 160.52 and 51.60 per 1000 person-years, respectively (P =. 0003). After adjustment for confounding factors, the persistent group exhibited a higher risk of colorectal adenoma than the eradication group (hazard ratio = 3.04, 95% CI 1.899, 5.864). The colorectal adenoma ratio of patients uninfected with H. pylori was similar to that of the eradication group (23.93% vs 20.12%, P =. 328). Conclusions: Persistent H. pylori infection was associated significantly with the independent development of colorectal adenoma. H. pylori infection may have a pathophysiological role in colorectal adenoma development and, after successful eradication of H. pylori, the colorectal adenoma ratio might decrease. ? 2018 The Author(s) 2018.",""
"Association of chronic hepatitis B virus infection with age-related macular degeneration","2019","Purpose: To study the association between chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: Data used in this retrospective, frequency-matched cohort study were acquired from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000, which includes medical claims and registration files for 1?000?000 enrolees in the Taiwan National Health Insurance programme. The HBV cohort contained 17?796 patients who received a diagnosis of chronic HBV infection between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012. The non-HBV cohort contained 71?184 participants who were frequency-matched by age, sex and year of index date for comparison. Participants were followed until the end of 2013, and those who developed AMD during the study period were identified. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare the risk of AMD between cohorts. Results: The incidence of any type of AMD in all participants was 3.88 per 1000 person-years (PY; 2.27 per 1000 PY in the HBV cohort; 1.61 per 1000 PY in the non-HBV cohort). Compared with the non-HBV cohort, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for any type of AMD in the HBV cohort was 1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–1.63; p?<?0.001]. This significant positive association was stronger among patients who exhibited disease progression from nonexudative to exudative AMD (adjusted HR?=?1.74, 95% CI: 1.01–2.99). Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients with chronic HBV infection in Taiwan have a significantly elevated risk of developing any type of AMD and that HBV infection may accelerate the progression of AMD. ? 2019 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

"Do Hospital and Physician Volume Thresholds for the Volume-Outcome Relationship in Heart Failure Exist?","2019","Background: Although volume-outcome relationships have been explored for various procedures and interventions, limited information is available concerning the effect of hospital and physician volume on heart failure mortality. Most importantly, little is known about whether there are optimal hospital and physician volume thresholds to reduce heart failure mortality. Objectives: We used nationwide population-based data to identify the optimal hospital and physician volume thresholds to achieve optimum mortality and to examine the relative and combined effects of the volume thresholds on heart failure mortality. Methods: We analyzed all 20,178 heart failure patients admitted in 2012 through Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Restricted cubic splines and multilevel logistic regression were used to identify whether there are optimal hospital and physician volume thresholds and to assess the relative and combined relationships of the volume thresholds to 30-day mortality, adjusted for patient, physician, and hospital characteristics. Results: Hospital and physician volume thresholds of 40 cases and 15 cases a year, respectively, were identified, under which there was an increased risk of 30-day mortality. Patients treated by physicians with previous annual volumes <15 cases had higher 30-day mortality compared with those with previous annual volumes ?15 cases, and the relationship was stronger in hospitals with previous annual volumes <40 cases. Conclusions: This is the first study to identify both the hospital and physician volume thresholds that lead to decreases in heart failure mortality. Identifying the hospital and physician volume thresholds could be applied to quality improvement and physician training. ? Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, the mechanisms underlying POF are difficult to study due to the lack of suitable disease models. Herein, we have generated a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a female patient with Turner's syndrome mosaicism via integration-free Sendai-virus system. The hiPSCs were confirmed with a 45, X karyotype and the acquisition of pluripotency. It's likely that hiPSCs can serve as a feasible cellular model for further pathophysiological studies of POF cases, especially for those originating in TS. ? 2019 The Authors","Article; female; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; karyotype 45,X; mosaicism; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; pluripotent stem cell line; premature ovarian failure; priority journal; Turner syndrome"
"Traffic-related particulate matter exposure induces nephrotoxicity in vitro and in vivo","2019","Traffic emission is responsible for most small-sized particulate matter (PM) air pollution in urban areas. Several recent studies have indicated that traffic-related PM may aggravate kidney disease. Furthermore, exposure to particulate air pollution may be related to the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been adequately addressed. In the present study, we studied the mechanisms of renal damage that might be associated with exposure to PM. In a real world of whole-body exposure to traffic-related PM model for 3–6 months, PM in urban ambient air can affect kidney function and induce autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in kidney tissues. Exposure to traffic-related diesel particulate matter (DPM) led to a reduction in cell viability in human kidney tubular epithelial cells HK-2. DPM increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, DPM induced ER stress and activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Eventually, DPM exposure induced caspase pathways and triggered apoptosis. In addition, DPM induced autophagy through the inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Autophagy inhibition resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis.

This study investigates the characteristics of diabetic patients, with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), according to the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy and determines the influence of retinopathy in the deterioration of renal function. We conduct a multicenter, longitudinal cohort study based on the Epidemiology and Risk Factors Surveillance of the CKD project (2008–2013) and the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (2001–2013). A total of 4050 diabetic patients with CKD, 20–85 years of age, from 14 hospitals and the community are included in this study. As compared to CKD patients without DR, CKD patients with DR have a lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (39.17 ± 30.36 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 vs. 54.38 ± 33.67 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ); poorer glycemic control (higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.85 ± 4.97 vs. 7.29 ± 4.02, p &lt; 0.01); higher proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR)1.94 ± 2.96 g/dL vs. 0.91 ± 2.11 g/dL, p &lt; 0.01); more anemia (Hb 11.22 ± 2.43 g/dL vs. 12.39 ± 3.85 g/dL, p &lt; 0.01), and more hypoalbuminemia (3.88 ± 0.95 g/dL vs. 4.16 ± 1.74 g/dL, p &lt; 0.01). Later stage (stage 3b–5) CKD patients with DR had significantly higher CKD progression compared with patients without DR (OR (odds ratio) 1.66 (1.36–2.02)). Patients with proliferative DR had significantly higher CKD progression events compared to patients with non-proliferative DR (OR 2.18 (1.71–2.78)). The presence and severity of DR is a risk factor for CKD progression among our Taiwanese CKD patients with diabetes. Prevention and early detection of DR are important and DR should be routinely screened as early as possible among diabetic CKD patients. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Microbiota and gastrointestinal cancer","2019","Gut microbiota plays important roles in many diseases, including cancer. It may promote carcinogenesis by inducing oxidative stress, genotoxicity, host immune response disturbance, and chronic inflammation. Colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer are the major gastrointestinal tract cancers in Taiwan. The microbiota detected in patients with tubular adenoma and villous/tubulovillous polyps is different from that in healthy controls and patients with hyperplastic polyps. Normalization of the microbiota is observed in patients after colorectal cancer treatment. Furthermore, the liver is exposed to microbiota-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), bacterial metabolites, and toxins, as it is anatomically connected to the gut via the portal vein. Patients with cirrhosis have significantly higher plasma endotoxin levels than healthy controls. Helicobacter pylori is a well-established risk factor for gastric cancer. Some nitrosating bacteria convert nitrogen compounds in gastric fluid to potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds, which also contribute to gastric cancer development. Growing evidence demonstrates that gut microbiota promotes carcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms and types of microbiota changes involved in these gastrointestinal cancers and the future treatment choices. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","colorectal cancer; digestive system cancer; human; intestine flora; liver cell carcinoma; nonhuman; Review; carcinogenesis; fecal microbiota transplantation; gastrointestinal tract; gastrointestinal tumor; microbiology; risk factor; synbiotic agent; Carcinogenesis; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Risk Factors; Synbiotics"
"Epstein-Barr virus-coded miR-BART13 promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell growth and metastasis via targeting of the NKIRAS2/NF-κB pathway","2019","Based on analysis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BART microRNA expression profiles, we previously reported that EBV-encoded miR-BART13 is upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) plasma specimens. However, the effects and molecular mechanisms of miR-BART13 in NPC remain largely unknown. We found that miR-BART13 was significantly upregulated in NPC tissue specimens. Ectopic expression of miR-BART13 promoted NPC cell proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and metastasis in vitro, and facilitated xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Molecularly, NF-κB inhibitor interacting Ras-like 2 (NKIRAS2), a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling, was identified to be a direct target of miR-BART13 in NPC cells, and NKIRAS2 mRNA and protein expression was inversely correlated with miR-BART13 in NPC tissues, respecitvely. Furthermore, the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by miR-BART13. By rescued experiments, reconstitution of NKIRAS2 expression abrogated all the phenotypes upregulated by miR-BART13, and attenuated activity of NF-κB signaling pathway activated by miR-BART13 in NPC cells. Our findings indicated the newly identified miR-BART13/NKIRAS2/NF-κB signaling axis may provide further insights into better understanding of NPC initiation and development, and targeting of this pathway could be further studied as a therapeutic strategy for NPC patients. ? 2019","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; microRNA; NKIRAS2 protein; regulator protein; unclassified drug; carrier protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; microRNA; virus RNA; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; BART13 gene; cancer growth; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell proliferation; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; Epstein Barr virus; female; gene expression; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung metastasis; metastasis; mouse; nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line; nasopharynx carcinoma; NKIRAS2 gene; nonhuman; oncogene; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; tumor growth; upregulation; animal; Bagg albino mouse; drug screening; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metastasis; nasopharynx carcinoma; nasopharynx tumor; nude mouse; procedures; signal transduction; tumor cell line; virology; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HEK293 Cells; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Neoplasm Metastasis; NF-kappa B; RNA, Viral; Signal Transduction; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Postural adjustments in adolescent idiopathic thoracic scoliosis during walking","2019","Introduction: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common type of three-dimensional spinal deformity. Identifying the postural adjustments or changes for different phases and events is needed for developing programs to improve the AIS gait, but such information has been limited. The current study aimed to fill the gap via three-dimensional motion analysis of quiet standing and level walking in patients with severe thoracic AIS. Materials and Methods: Sixteen female adolescents with AIS (Lenke 1 or 2, age: 14.9 ± 1.7 years, height: 154.7 ± 5.0 cm, mass: 41.7 ± 7.2 kg) and sixteen sex-, age- and BMI-matched healthy controls (age: 14.8 ± 2.7 years, height: 154.9 ± 5.6 cm, mass: 44.7 ± 6.3 kg) participated in the current study with informed written consent. The kinematic and kinetic changes between the trunk, pelvis, and lower limb segments, and at the lumbosacral level at different gait events were measured during quiet standing and level walking. Results: The homogeneity of the current patient group helped reduce the effects of the level and severity of spinal deformity on inter-subject variability that has been associated with controversies over reported gait variables in AIS. The current results support the hypothesis that postural adjustments involving the trunk, pelvis and lower limb segments were needed in severe thoracic AIS during both quiet standing and level walking, and differed between concave and convex sides at different key gait events during level walking. Conclusions: Although scoliotic spinal deformity occurred mainly in the frontal plane, postural adjustments in all three planes were present at key events during level walking with associated joint loading changes in patients with severe thoracic AIS. Monitoring of such adjustments and the associated joint kinetic changes will be helpful for assessing the disease and treatment outcomes. ? 2018","adduction; adolescent; adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; Article; clinical article; disease severity; female; human; joint mobility; kinematics; pelvis; priority journal; standing; step length; thorax disease; trunk; walking; walking speed; biomechanics; body equilibrium; body position; child; gait; kinetics; lower limb; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; scoliosis; spatiotemporal analysis; three dimensional imaging; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Biomechanical Phenomena; Child; Female; Gait Analysis; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Kinetics; Lower Extremity; Pelvis; Postural Balance; Posture; Scoliosis; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Torso; Treatment Outcome; Walking"
"Early detection of superior mesenteric artery dissection by ultrasound: Two case reports","2019","Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection is a rare disease. Most of the cases are diagnosed through contrast-enhanced computed tomography. The use of emergent bedside ultrasound has been described to diagnose aortic dissection. However, evidence is limited regarding the use of bedside ultrasound for diagnosing SMA dissection, which is a known risk factor for aortic dissection. We present two case reports: one case of isolated SMA dissection and one case of SMA dissection complicated with aortic dissection. Both cases were initially diagnosed through bedside ultrasound and confirmed through contrast-enhanced computed tomography. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Ultrasound.","anticoagulant agent; adult; anticoagulant therapy; aortic dissection; artery diameter; artery dissection; Article; blood pressure measurement; brain ischemia; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; disease duration; echography; epigastric pain; Glasgow coma scale; heart rate; human; hypertension; limb weakness; male; medical history; middle aged; physical examination; superior mesenteric artery; superior mesenteric artery dissection; superior mesenteric artery dissection; systolic blood pressure"
"Expression of Metastatic Tumor Antigen 1 Splice Variant Correlates With Early Recurrence and Aggressive Features of Hepatitis B Virus–Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma","2019","Overexpression of metastatic tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) was correlated with poor prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC). The aim of this study was to examine the clinical significance of the expression of MTA1 and its exon 4-excluded form (MTA1dE4), the most abundant spliced variant of MTA1, in patients receiving curative resection for HBV-HCC. We collected 102 patients with?HBV-HCC and received curative resection retrospectively and examined the expressions level of total MTA1/MTA1dE4 in their paired nontumor and tumor liver tissues by using RT-qPCR. The association between MTA1/MTA1dE4 expression and various tumor features as well as tumor recurrence was analyzed. During the median follow-up period of 4 years, 25 patients (24.5%) showed early recurrence (within 12 months postresection) and 42 (54.5%) showed late recurrence. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, MTA1dE4 overexpression in tumor, but not MTA1, was associated with early recurrence (P = 0.0365), but not late recurrence. In multivariate analysis, only alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ?200 ng/mL (P = 0.006) and large tumor size (P = 0.027) were correlated with early recurrence. In the subgroup of patients with AFP <200 ng/mL, high MTA1dE4, but not total MTA1, expression could help predict early recurrence (P = 0.0195). In vitro, wound healing and invasion assays were performed in HCC cells, and MTA1dE4 was found to exhibit a higher ability in promoting migration and invasion of hepatoma cells than full-length MTA1. Conclusion: MTA1dE4 expression is correlated with more aggressive tumor characteristics and might serve as a more sensitive marker for early recurrence of HBV-HCC, especially for low-AFP patients. ? 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","alpha fetoprotein; biological marker; lamivudine; metastatic tumor antigen 1; mta1de4 protein; tumor antigen; unclassified drug; adult; antigen expression; Article; cancer prognosis; cell invasion; cell migration; chronic hepatitis B; clinical outcome; controlled study; female; gene overexpression; Hepatitis B virus; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; liver tissue; major clinical study; male; middle aged; predictive value; priority journal; protein expression level; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; recurrence risk; retrospective study; risk factor; SK-HEP-1 cell line; tumor number; tumor recurrence; tumor volume; wound healing assay"
"Breast Tumor Detection and Classification Using Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Hyperspectral Imaging Techniques","2019","Breast cancer is a main cause of disease and death for women globally. Because of the limitations of traditional mammography and ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has gradually become an important radiological method for breast cancer assessment over the past decades. MRI is free of the problems related to radiation exposure and provides excellent image resolution and contrast. However, a disadvantage is the injection of contrast agent, which is toxic for some patients (such as patients with chronic renal disease or pregnant and lactating women). Recent findings of gadolinium deposits in the brain are also a concern. To address these issues, this paper develops an intravoxel incoherent motion- (IVIM-) MRI-based histogram analysis approach, which takes advantage of several hyperspectral techniques, such as the band expansion process (BEP), to expand a multispectral image to hyperspectral images and create an automatic target generation process (ATGP). After automatically finding suspected targets, further detection was attained by using kernel constrained energy minimization (KCEM). A decision tree and histogram analysis were applied to classify breast tissue via quantitative analysis for detected lesions, which were used to distinguish between three categories of breast tissue: malignant tumors (i.e., central and peripheral zone), cysts, and normal breast tissues. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed IVIM-MRI-based histogram analysis approach can effectively differentiate between these three breast tissue types. ? 2019 Si-Wa Chan et al.","Article; breast cancer; breast cyst; breast tissue; decision tree; diffusion weighted imaging; histogram; image analysis; image processing; intravoxel incoherent motion magnetic resonance imagin histogram; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative analysis; radiological parameters; tumor classification"
"Garcinol Reduces Obesity in High-Fat-Diet-Fed Mice by Modulating Gut Microbiota Composition","2019","Scope: Obesity has become a major health problem worldwide and is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis. This study is conducted to investigate the chemopreventive effects of garcinol, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone derivative isolated from the fruit rind of Garcinia indica. How garcinol protects against obesity in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice is delineated and whether its anti-obesity effects are related to gut microbiota has been determined. Methods and results: The results show that garcinol reduces HFD-fed mice body weight gain and relative visceral adipose tissue fat weight in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, garcinol markedly reduces the plasma levels of glutamate pyruvate transaminase, total cholesterol, and triacylglycerol. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data indicate that garcinol not only reverses HFD-induced gut dysbiosis—as indicated by the decreased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios—but also controls inflammation by increasing the intestinal commensal bacteria, Akkermansia. In addition, the AMP-activated protein kinase α signaling pathway involved in adipocyte adipogenesis is also affected by garcinol. Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that garcinol can prevent HFD-induced obesity and may be used as a novel gut microbiota modulator to prevent HFD-induced gut dysbiosis and obesity-related metabolic disorders. ? 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Serum vascular adhesion protein-1 is up-regulated in hyperglycemia and is associated with incident diabetes negatively","2019","Background/objectives: Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) can enhance tissue glucose uptake in cell studies and normalize hyperglycemia in animal studies. However, serum VAP-1 concentration (sVAP-1) is higher in subjects with diabetes in cross-sectional studies. In this cohort study, we test our hypothesis that sVAP-1 is increased in prediabetes to counteract hyperglycemia and is associated with incident diabetes negatively. Subjects/methods: From 2006 to 2012, 600 subjects without diabetes from Taiwan Lifestyle Study were included and followed regularly. Diabetes was diagnosed if FPG ? 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L), 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) ? 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ? 6.5%, or if the subject received anti-diabetic medications. Abdominal fat areas were measured by abdominal computed tomography and sVAP-1 was analyzed by ELISA. Results: sVAP-1 was higher in subjects with prediabetes (p < 0.05) and increased during an OGTT (p < 0.001). Fasting sVAP-1 was associated with the response of sVAP-1 during an OGTT (p < 0.001). Besides, sVAP-1 was associated negatively with body mass index (BMI, r = ?0.1449, p = 0.003), waist circumference (r = ?0.1425, p = 0.004), abdominal visceral (r = ?0.1457, p = 0.003), and subcutaneous (r = ?0.1025, p = 0.035) fat areas, and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration (r = ?0.2035, p < 0.0001), and positively with plasma adiponectin concentration (r = 0.2086, p < 0.0001), adjusted for age and gender. After 4.7 ± 2.6 years, 73 subjects (12.2%) developed incident diabetes. High sVAP-1 predicted a lower incidence of diabetes, adjusted for age, gender, BMI, family history of diabetes, HbA1c, HOMA2-%B and HOMA2-IR (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.50–0.88, p < 0.01). Conclusions: sVAP-1 is increased in response to hyperglycemia. It is associated with obesity and serum hsCRP concentration negatively, and plasma adiponectin concentration positively. Besides, a high sVAP-1 is associated with a lower incidence of diabetes in human. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","adiponectin; C reactive protein; vascular adhesion protein 1; abdominal fat; adult; Article; body mass; cohort analysis; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; family history; fasting; female; glucose blood level; glucose transport; human; hyperglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; intra-abdominal fat; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oral glucose tolerance test; priority journal; protein blood level; retrospective study; subcutaneous fat; upregulation; waist circumference"
"Public knowledge, attitudes and willingness regarding bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A nationwide survey in Taiwan","2019","Background: A low bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate is one of the factors associated with low cardiac arrest survival. This study aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and willingness towards performing CPR and the barriers for implementation of bystander-initiated CPR. Methods: Telephone interviews were conducted using an author-designed and validated structured questionnaire in Taiwan. After obtaining a stratified random sample from the census, the results were weighted to match population data. The factors affecting bystander-initiated CPR were analysed using logistic regression. Results: Of the 1073 respondents, half of them stated that they knew how to perform CPR correctly, although 86.7% indicated a willingness to perform CPR on strangers. The barriers to CPR performance reported by the respondents included fear of legal consequences (44%) and concern about harming patients (36.5%). Most participants expressed a willingness to attend only an hour-long CPR course. Respondents who were less likely to indicate a willingness to perform CPR were female, healthcare providers, those who had no cohabiting family members older than 65 years, those who had a history of a stroke, and those who expressed a negative attitude toward CPR. Conclusion: The expressed willingness to perform bystander CPR was high if the respondents possessed the required skills. Attempts should be made to recruit potential bystanders for CPR courses or education, targeting those respondent subgroups less likely to express willingness to perform CPR. The reason for lower bystander CPR willingness among healthcare providers deserves further investigation. ? 2018","adult; Article; association; attitude to health; cerebrovascular accident; cross-sectional study; female; health care personnel; health education; heart arrest; human; knowledge; major clinical study; male; resuscitation; skill; structured questionnaire; Taiwan; telephone interview; training; education; emergency health service; interview; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; out of hospital cardiac arrest; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; resuscitation; socioeconomics; statistical model; young adult; Adult; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Effects of different pharmacologic smoking cessation treatments on body weight changes and success rates in patients with nicotine dependence: A network meta-analysis","2019","Smoking cessation is a public health priority to reduce smoking-related morbidity and mortality. However, weight gain is a known primary reason for not trying to quit smoking. The aim of the current study was to investigate differences in weight gain associated with different pharmacological smoking cessation interventions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported weight gain related to pharmacologic treatments for smoking cessation were analysed using network meta-analysis with a random effects model. Thirty-one RCTs with 5650 participants were included. Ten drugs and 22 regimens were identified. Nicotine patches plus fluoxetine, topiramate with/without nicotine patches, nicotine patches plus methylphenidate, nicotine spray/gum/lozenges, high-dose nicotine patches (42?mg/21?mg), naltrexone with/without nicotine patches, or bupropion with/without nicotine patches were associated with less weight gain than the placebo/control arm. Nicotine patches plus fluoxetine were associated with the least weight gain of all smoking cessation treatments. In addition, the nicotine patch plus topiramate and nicotine inhaler was associated with the best success rate and the least dropout rate, respectively. Overall, the nicotine patch 14?mg plus fluoxetine 40?mg, nicotine patch 14?mg plus fluoxetine 20?mg, and topiramate 200?mg would be the three best pharmacologic treatments based upon both weight gain effect and success rate. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation","amfebutamone; fluoxetine; lorcaserin; methylphenidate; naltrexone; nicotine patch; topiramate; varenicline; body weight change; body weight gain; Cochrane Library; drug delivery system; Embase; human; Medline; network meta-analysis; pharmacological parameters; publication bias; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; smoking cessation; smoking prevention; systematic review; tobacco dependence; Web of Science"
"Differential impact of physical activity type on depression in adults with congenital heart disease: A multi-center international study","2019","Objective: This study aimed to examine the association between physical activity (PA) and depression in a large international cohort of adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) as data about the differential impact of PA type on depression in this population are lacking. Methods: In 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional assessment of 3908 ACHD recruited from 24 ACHD-specialized centers in 15 countries between April 2013 to March 2015. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess self-reported depressive symptoms and the Health-Behavior Scale-Congenital Heart Disease was used to collect PA information. Cochran-Armitage tests were performed to assess trends between depressive symptom levels and PA participation. Chi-Square and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were utilized to examine relations between depressive symptom levels and patient characteristics. Stepwise multivariable models were then constructed to understand the independent impact of PA on depressive symptoms. Results: The overall prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms in this sample was 12% with significant differences in rates between countries (p <.001). Physically active individuals were less likely to be depressed than those who were sedentary. Of the 2 PA domains examined, sport participation rather than active commute was significantly associated with reduced symptoms of depression. After adjustment in multivariable analysis, sport participation was still significantly associated with 38% decreased probability of depressive symptoms (p <.001). Conclusions: Sport participation is independently associated with reduced depressive symptoms. The development and promotion of sport-related exercise prescriptions uniquely designed for ACHD may improve depression status in this unique population. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; Article; cohort analysis; congenital heart disease; cross-sectional study; depression; health behavior; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; major clinical study; multicenter study; patient-reported outcome; physical activity; prevalence; rank sum test; statistical analysis"

"Second repair of pediatric inguinal hernia: A longitudinal cohort study","2019","Background: The objective of this nationwide observational study was to report the rate and risk factors for the second repair after pediatric inguinal herniorrhaphy. Materials and Methods: Children born from 1998 to 2005 were chosen from a cohort of 1,000,000 cases, which were randomly selected from an insured population of 23 million people in Taiwan (Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005). We identified all hernia repairs in the period of 1998-2012 for the sample population and then used a Cox proportional hazards regression model to analyze the risk factors for the second repair after pediatric inguinal herniorrhaphy. Results: The total sample population comprised 79,820 children, with a male-To-female ratio of 4.27:1. During a mean observation period of 11.4 ± 2.2 years, 3339 (4.18%) of the children in the sample population received primary inguinal hernia repair. Of the 251 children (7.52%) who underwent a second repair, 220 were boys (8.13%) and 31 were girls (4.9%); 244 (8.62%) underwent primary unilateral hernia repair, and 7 (1.38%) underwent primary bilateral hernia repair. Considering that bilateral hernia involves unilateral hernia on two sides, the expected recurrence rate after primary unilateral hernia repair was calculated as 0.69%. The calculated rates for late occurrence of contralateral hernia after primary unilateral hernia repair were 11.04%, 7.73%, and 3.28% for children aged 0-1, 1-4, and >4 years, respectively. Significant risk factors for second hernia repair were age at first primary hernia repair and unilateral hernia (P < 0.001). Gender and prematurity were not risk factors for second hernia repair. Conclusions: The second repair rate after primary unilateral or bilateral hernia repair was 7.52%. The only risk factor that predicted the second repair was age of <4 years at the time of operation. The expected recurrence rate after any hernia was estimated as 0.69%. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved..

"Itraconazole in the Treatment of Nonfungal Cutaneous Diseases: A Review","2019","Introduction: The anti-inflammatory and pro-kinetic properties of antibiotics have been widely reported. However, the non-antifungal properties of antifungal agents are less well known and less explored in clinical practice. The purpose of this review was to survey the literature on the non-antifungal use of itraconazole in dermatological practice and the possible modes of action of this agent. Methods: The PubMed database was searched for relevant articles published up to January 2017. The references in the articles identified by the search were then hand-searched for additional relevant publications. Results: Itraconazole displays a great diversity of non-antifungal activity and has been used to treat a broad spectrum of diseases. The results of our survey reveal that itraconazole has the potential to be an alternative agent for treating patients with advanced cancer (either alone or in combination with other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs), especially those refractory to traditional treatments. Moreover, itraconazole acts as an anti-angiogenesis agent, induces nail growth, and modulates inflammatory or immune diseases. Conclusion: Oral antifungal agents have many non-antifungal properties. However, the body of evidence on individual agents often remains limited due to the lack of large-scale randomized controlled studies. Although some of the findings published to date seem promising, pharmacological vigilance should be taken for off-label use in real-world practice. ? 2019, The Author(s).","calcipotriol; itraconazole; sonic hedgehog protein; allergic reaction; antiangiogenic activity; atopic dermatitis; basal cell carcinoma; capillary hemangioma; dermatitis; eosinophilic folliculitis; folliculitis; head and neck dermatitis; hedgehog signaling; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; hypertrophic scar; keloid; lichen planus; mycosis fungoides; nonfungal cutaneous disease; nonfungal cutaneous disease; nonhuman; priority journal; pustulosis palmoplantaris; refractory atopic dermatitis; Review; sarcoidosis; scalp psoriasis; skin disease; systematic review; yellow nail syndrome"
"Increasing age- and gender-specific burden and complexity of multimorbidity in Taiwan, 2003-2013: A cross-sectional study based on nationwide claims data","2019","Objective Although there is accumulating evidence regarding multimorbidity in Western countries, this information is very limited in Asian countries. This study aimed to estimate population-based, age-specific and gender-specific prevalence and trends of multimorbidity in the Taiwanese population. Design This was a cross-sectional study based on claims data (National Health Insurance Research Database, Taiwan). Participants The participants included a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database, which contains claims data for two million randomly selected beneficiaries (?10% of the total population) under Taiwan's mandatory National Health Insurance system. Outcome measurements The prevalence of multimorbidity in different age groups and in both sexes in 2003 and 2013 was reported. We analysed data on the prevalence of 20 common diseases in each age group and for both sexes. To investigate the clustering effect, we used graphical displays to analyse the likelihood of co-occurrence with one, two, three, and four or more other diseases for each selected disease in 2003 and 2013. Results The prevalence of multimorbidity (two or more diseases) was 20.07% in 2003 and 30.44% in 2013. In 2013, the prevalence varied between 5.21% in patients aged 20-29 years and 80.96% in those aged 80-89 years. In patients aged 50-79 years, the prevalence of multimorbidity was higher in women than in men. In men, the prevalence of chronic pulmonary disease and cardiovascular-related diseases was predominant, while in women the prevalence of osteoporosis, arthritis, cancer and psychosomatic disorders was predominant. Co-occurring diseases varied across different age and gender groups. Conclusions The burden of multimorbidity is increasing and becoming more complex in Taiwan, and it was found to vary across different age and gender groups. Fulfilling the needs of individuals with multimorbidity requires collaborative work between healthcare providers and needs to take the age and gender disparities of multimorbidity into account. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

"High Glucose Triggers Nucleotide Imbalance through O-GlcNAcylation of Key Enzymes and Induces KRAS Mutation in Pancreatic Cells","2019","KRAS mutations are the earliest events found in approximately 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). However, little is known as to why KRAS mutations preferentially occur in PDACs and what processes/factors generate these mutations. While abnormal carbohydrate metabolism is associated with a high risk of pancreatic cancer, it remains elusive whether a direct relationship between KRAS mutations and sugar metabolism exists. Here, we show that under high-glucose conditions, cellular O-GlcNAcylation is significantly elevated in pancreatic cells that exhibit lower phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity than other cell types. This post-translational modification specifically compromises the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity, leading to deficiency in dNTP pools, genomic DNA alterations with KRAS mutations, and cellular transformation. These results establish a mechanistic link between a perturbed sugar metabolism and genomic instability that induces de novo oncogenic KRAS mutations preferentially in pancreatic cells. Most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas contain activated KRAS mutations required for cancer initiation and maintenance. Here, Hu et al. show that high glucose promotes O-GlcNAcylation on ribonucleotide reductase, leading to nucleotide pool imbalance and KRAS mutations preferentially in pancreatic cells. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","6 phosphofructokinase; DNA; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; genomic DNA; glucose; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; glutamine; hemoglobin A1c; K ras protein; messenger RNA; nucleotide; ribonucleotide reductase; short hairpin RNA; acinar cell; acylation; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; body weight gain; cell growth assay; cell transformation; chow diet; colony formation; comparative study; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; enzyme activity; fasting; genomic instability; glucose blood level; glucose transport; hemoglobin blood level; human; human tissue; immunoprecipitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; metabolic disorder; mouse; mutation; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; pancreas cell; priority journal; protein processing; Sanger sequencing; single nucleotide polymorphism; Western blotting"
"Incidence and risk factors of osteomyelitis in adult and pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus: a nationwide, population-based cohort study","2019","Objective: The objective of this paper is to investigate the incidence rate, risk factors and outcome of osteomyelitis among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Materials and methods: We conducted a cohort study using data for patients enrolled in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database from 2000 to 2012. Patients with SLE and age- and sex-matched controls without SLE were enrolled. Primary endpoint was the first occurrence of osteomyelitis. Risks of osteomyelitis in SLE patients were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression models, including age, sex, comorbidities and medications. Results: Among 24,705 SLE patients (88.4% women, mean age 35.8 years) with a median follow-up of 9.1 years, 386 patients had osteomyelitis. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of osteomyelitis in the SLE group vs the control group was 8.52 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.24–10.05). The SLE group had higher incidence rates of osteomyelitis than the control group, especially in pediatric subgroups (IRR 41.1 95% CI 18.57–107.35). Compared to controls, SLE patients experienced osteomyelitis at a younger age (42.3 vs 58.1 years) but did not have an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio 0.7; 95% CI 0.21–2.38). Age >60 years, male gender, malignancy within five years, prior bone fracture and higher daily prednisolone dose (>7.5 mg) cumulatively for >180 days increased risk for osteomyelitis. Conclusions: SLE patients have a higher IRR of osteomyelitis than controls. Pediatric and elder SLE patients, patients with a history of bone fracture, malignancy within five years and higher-dose glucocorticoid use have a higher risk of osteomyelitis and should be carefully monitored. ?

"Outcomes of necrotic immature open-apex central incisors treated by MTA apexification using poly(ε-caprolactone) fiber mesh as an apical barrier","2019","Background/purpose: Although unset mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has some cytotoxicity, MTA is still a biocompatible material suitable for doing apexification. This study assessed the outcomes for 8 necrotic immature open-apex permanent maxillary central incisors treated by MTA apexification using poly(ε-caprolactone) fiber mesh (PCL-FM) as an apical barrier (so-called PCL-FM/MTA apexification) to prevent extrusion of MTA materials into the periapical tissues of open-apex teeth. Methods: Eight necrotic immature open-apex permanent maxillary central incisors with the open apices measuring 2.5 mm–3.5 mm in diameter in 8 patients (6 boys and 2 girls; age range, 8–10 years) were first cleaned using ultrasonic activated irrigation with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution and then treated by PCL-FM/MTA apexification procedure. Results: All the 8 permanent maxillary central incisors showed successful outcomes after PCL-FM/MTA apexification procedure. The mean duration for apical hard tissue barrier formation of the 8 incisors was 6.8 ± 0.5 weeks (range 6–7 weeks). The mean increased root length was 1.8 ± 0.7 mm (range 1–3 mm) at 7 weeks and 3.1 ± 0.6 mm (range 2–4 mm) at 3 months. The mean increased dentinal wall thickness at the most apical portion of the root was 1.3 ± 0.5 mm (range 1–2 mm) at 7 weeks and 2.4 ± 0.6 mm (range 1.5–3 mm) at 3 months. None of the teeth treated by PCL-FM/MTA apexification showed tooth discoloration after a follow-up period of 3 months. Conclusion: PCL-FM/MTA apexification is an excellent technique for treatment of necrotic immature open-apex permanent maxillary central incisors. ? 2018","hypochlorite sodium; mineral; mineral trioxide aggregate; polycaprolactone; root canal filling material; unclassified drug; aluminum derivative; calcium derivative; mineral trioxide aggregate; oxide; polycaprolactone; polyester; root canal filling material; silicate; apexification; Article; cementoenamel junction; child; clinical article; female; follow up; human; immature open apex permanent maxillary central incisor; male; maxillary central incisor; outcome assessment; periapical tissue; prospective study; school child; Taiwan; tooth discoloration; tooth root canal; drug combination; incisor; procedures; root canal preparation; tooth pulp disease; treatment outcome; Aluminum Compounds; Apexification; Calcium Compounds; Child; Dental Pulp Necrosis; Drug Combinations; Female; Humans; Incisor; Male; Oxides; Polyesters; Root Canal Filling Materials; Root Canal Preparation; Silicates; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"Long-term exposure to high temperature associated with the incidence of major depressive disorder","2019","Temperature was reported to have acute effects on mental disorders. However, the effect of long-term temperature exposure is unclear, especially in warmer regions. This research aimed to evaluate the association between long-term exposure to temperature and the incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD). A retrospective population-based study was conducted using Taiwan nationwide Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. Subjects without MDD diagnosis were followed from 2003 to 2013 for MDD occurrence. Weather factors including temperature (°C), sunshine duration (hrs/day), and precipitation (mm/day) were 11-year average of daily data collected from weather monitoring stations of Taiwan Central Weather Bureau. Cox proportional hazard model was performed to examine the association between MDD incidence and weather factors. Covariates including age, gender, and insurance amount were adjusted. A total of 9,539,752 person-years were followed. People residing in regions with long-term temperature of 20–23 °C had the lowest risk of developing MDD. Risk for MDD incidence was higher among residents in regions with average temperature > 23 °C, at 7% increase per 1 °C increment (95% CI = 2–12%). The elderly was more vulnerable to such impact of heat exposure. For the elderly, males were more susceptible to heat-related MDD than females (HR = 1.18 vs. 1.14). However, the younger group showed a reverse finding (i.e. females 1.07 > males 1.04). Long-term residence in regions with extreme cold or heat may increase the risk of MDD incidence, especially higher temperature. Under global warming, these findings have great health implications and warrant further confirmation. ? 2018","Global warming; Temperature; Central weather bureaux; Cohort studies; Cox proportional hazard model; Long term exposure; Major depressive disorder (MDD); Major depressive disorders; Non linear; Temperature exposure; Health insurance; climate conditions; cohort analysis; elderly population; gender; health risk; high temperature; mental health; weather station; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; disease association; disease predisposition; environmental temperature; female; follow up; groups by age; health insurance; high risk population; high temperature; human; incidence; long term exposure; low risk population; major clinical study; major depression; male; population research; precipitation; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; sex difference; sun exposure; thermal exposure; vulnerable population; weather; young adult; environmental exposure; heat; incidence; major depression; middle aged; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Taiwan; Aged; Depressive Disorder, Major; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan"
"Heart Rhythm Complexity Impairment in Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension","2019","Pulmonary hypertension is a fatal disease, however reliable prognostic tools are lacking. Heart rhythm complexity analysis is derived from non-linear heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and has shown excellent performance in predicting clinical outcomes in several cardiovascular diseases. However, heart rhythm complexity has not previously been studied in pulmonary hypertension patients. We prospectively analyzed 57 patients with pulmonary hypertension (31 with pulmonary arterial hypertension and 26 with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) and compared them to 57 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Heart rhythm complexity including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and multiscale entropy (MSE) and linear HRV parameters were analyzed. The patients with pulmonary hypertension had significantly lower mean RR, SDRR, pNN20, VLF, LF, LF/HF ratio, DFAα1, MSE slope 5, scale 5, area 1–5 and area 6–20 compared to the controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that heart rhythm complexity parameters were better than traditional HRV parameters to predict pulmonary hypertension. Among all parameters, scale 5 had the greatest power to differentiate the pulmonary hypertension patients from controls (AUC: 0.845, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, adding heart rhythm complexity parameters significantly improved the discriminatory power of the traditional HRV parameters in both net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement models. In conclusion, the patients with pulmonary hypertension had worse heart rhythm complexity. MSE parameters, especially scale 5, had excellent single discriminatory power to predict whether or not patients had pulmonary hypertension. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

"Compromised chondrocyte differentiation capacity in terc knockout mouse embryonic stem cells derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer","2019","Mammalian telomere lengths are primarily regulated by telomerase, consisting of a reverse transcriptase protein (TERT) and an RNA subunit (TERC). We previously reported the generation of mouse Terc+/? and Terc?/? embryonic stem cells (ntESCs) by somatic cell nuclear transfer. In the present work, we investigated the germ layer development competence of Terc?/?, Terc+/? and wild-type (Terc+/+) ntESCs. The telomere lengths are longest in wild-type but shortest in Terc?/? ntESCs, and correlate reversely with the population doubling time. Interestingly, while in vitro embryoid body (EB) differentiation assay reveals EB size difference among ntESCs of different genotypes, the more stringent in vivo teratoma assay demonstrates that Terc?/? ntESCs are severely defective in differentiating into the mesodermal lineage cartilage. Consistently, in a directed in vitro chondrocyte differentiation assay, the Terc?/? cells failed in forming Collagen II expressing cells. These findings underscore the significance in maintaining proper telomere lengths in stem cells and their derivatives for regenerative medicine. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

"Fine particulate matter exposure during pregnancy and infancy and incident asthma","2019","Background: Lung development is a multistage process from conception to the postnatal period, disruption of which by air pollutants can trigger later respiratory morbidity. Objective: We sought to evaluate the effects of weekly average fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm [PM2.5]) exposure during pregnancy and infancy on asthma and identify vulnerable times to help elucidate possible mechanisms of the effects of PM2.5 on asthma symptoms. Methods: A birth cohort study including 184,604 children born during 2004-2011 in Taichung City was retrieved from the Taiwan Maternal and Child Health Database and followed until 2014. A daily satellite-based hybrid model was applied to estimate PM2.5 exposure for each subject. A Cox proportional hazard model combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to evaluate the associations of asthma with PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and infancy. Results: The birth cohort contained 34,336 asthmatic patients, and the mean age of children given a diagnosis of asthma was 3.39 ± 1.78 years. Increased exposure to PM2.5 during gestational weeks 6 to 22 and 9 to 46 weeks after birth were significantly associated with an increased incidence of asthma. The exposure-response relationship indicated that the hazard ratio (HR) of asthma increased steeply at PM2.5 exposure of greater than 93 μg/m3 during pregnancy. Additionally, the HRs remained significant with postnatal exposure to PM2.5 between 26 and 72 μg/m3 (range, 1.01-1.07 μg/m3), followed by a sharp increase in HRs at PM2.5 exposure of greater than 73 μg/m3. Conclusion: Both prenatal and postnatal exposures to PM2.5 were associated with later development of asthma. The vulnerable time windows might be within early gestation and midgestation and infancy. ? 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","immunoglobulin E; adult; air pollutant; allergic asthma; Article; asthma; child health; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; gestational age; human; ICD-9; incidence; infant; lung development; major clinical study; male; maternal exposure; maternal smoking; particulate matter; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; prenatal period; priority journal; sex difference; Taiwan"
"Late acute pancreatitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy: incidence, outcome, and risk factors","2019","Background: The pancreatoenteric anastomotic stricture (PEAS) is a common long-term complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), some of which present as acute pancreatitis requiring emergency care. This important topic has never been reported. In this study, we focus on the incidence, radiological features, clinical outcome, and risk factors of late-occurring acute pancreatitis (LAP) after PD. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of 539 patients who underwent PD at a single tertiary referral center between June 2005 and December 2014. Only patients with at least 3?years of follow-up and available pre- and post-operative images were included. Results: Of the 539 patients, 23 (15 [65%] with and eight [35%] without PEAS) were diagnosed with LAP after PD. The cumulative incidence of LAP was 3.6% (1-year), 4.4% (2-year), and 5.1% (5-year). The median time to the first LAP episode was 22?months (range 8–38?months) after PD. All the first and recurrent LAP events were mild in severity and resolved after conservative treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that a history of acute pancreatitis before PD (P?=?0.001, HR?5.24, 95% CI?1.95–14.10) and PEAS (P?=?0.047, HR?2.75, 95% CI?1.01–7.49) were two significant risk factors.

"A Tangeretin Derivative Inhibits the Growth of Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cells by Epigenetically Restoring p21 Gene Expression and Inhibiting Cancer Stem-like Cell Proliferation","2019","Prostate cancer ranks the second in incidence and the fifth in mortality cancer in male globally. Citrus polymethoxyflavonoids (PMFs), such as tangeretin (PMF1), have been found to exhibit various biological activities. Here, we evaluated the inhibitory effects and mechanism of synthetic 5,4′-didemethyltangeretin (PMF2) on human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. We found that PMF2 inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells (GI50 14.6?μM) more strongly than PMF1, and it was less cytotoxic against the normal human prostate RWPE-1 cells. PMF2 upregulated Bad and Bax, downregulated Bcl-2, and activated caspase-3 and PARP in the LNCaP cells, thereby inducing apoptosis. PMF2 also suppressed the anchorage-independent growth of the LNCaP cells. It triggered p21 gene expression by demethylation of the p21 promoter region, and inhibited the protein expressions of DNMT 3B and HDACs 1, 2, and 4/5/9 by epigenetic regulations. We further found that PMF2 showed interactions with DNMTs 1, 2, and 3A ex vivo, which might inhibit DNMT activity. Additionally, PMF2 decreased the anchorage-independent growth of isolated LNCaP cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) with high CD166 mRNA expression. These results indicated that PMF2 might inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer cells through different mechanisms, suggesting that PMF2 could be an innovative agent for prostate cancer therapy and prevention. ? 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.","5,4' didemethyltangeretin; activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; caspase 3; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; DNA methyltransferase; DNA methyltransferase 2; DNA methyltransferase 3A; DNA methyltransferase 3B; flavonoid; histone deacetylase 1; histone deacetylase 2; histone deacetylase 4; histone deacetylase 5; histone deacetylase 9; messenger RNA; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein BAD; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; protein p21; tangeretin; unclassified drug; anchorage independent growth; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer prevention; cancer stem cell; cancer therapy; controlled study; DNA demethylation; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug protein binding; drug selectivity; drug structure; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; epigenetics; ex vivo study; gene expression; GI50; human; human cell; in vitro study; LNCaP cell line; proapoptotic activity; promoter region; prostate cancer; protein analysis; protein expression; protein protein interaction; RWPE-1 cell line; upregulation"
"Macroeconomic conditions and Internet search for end-of-life care: An analysis using Google Trends","2019","Objectives: End-of-life (EOL) care imposes a significant financial burden on most caregivers, but the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and people's EOL care awareness remains unknown. This study employed Google Trends (GT) to explore the association between Internet search for EOL care and macroeconomic conditions. Methods: The weekly average Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) weighted index from January 2008 to December 2013 was used as the macroeconomic index. Local Google searches for EOL care-related keywords from January 2008 to December 2015 were downloaded from GT. A series of correlation analyses was performed on the TWSE and the GT for each keyword at the concurrent time and at 3, 6, and 9 months later to ascertain the nowcasting and forecasting effect. Results: The GT indices for EOL care-related keywords were negatively correlated with the concurrent and previous TWSE indices. For each keyword, either the 6-month or 9-month forecasting effect was higher than the concurrent nowcasting effect, suggesting that worse economic conditions (1ower TWSE) might be a factor associated with people's awareness of advanced EOL care. Conclusions: To better understand how people may be more sensitive to circumstances related to EOL care decisions, macroeconomic conditions and the implications of Internet search behavior should be further considered. ? 2019 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

"The core pattern of Chinese herbal formulae and drug-herb concurrent usage in patients with dementia","2019","More than 40% dementia patients received traditional Chinese Medicine treatment. However, the prescription pattern of Chinese herbal formulae (CHF) for treating neurocognitive or behavioral disorders in patients with dementia has not been elucidated. This large-scale survey aimed is to evaluate core patterns of CHF and drug-herb concurrent use in patients with dementia.We analyzed patients with a diagnosis of dementia from one million cohorts of the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in the National Health Insurance Research Database, between 1997 and 2008. Of 18,141 newly diagnosed dementia patients, 3471 patients received CHF for mental and nervous system diseases. There were 13,254 outpatient visits, with 60,968 formulae prescriptions. We calculate the frequency and proportion of combined use, identify drug-herb concurrent usage, and determine core prescription patterns. Also, we drew network graphs of co-prescription pairs which occurred more than 200 times.Chinese medicine prescription patterns changed as dementia progressed.During the first 3 years after the diagnosis of dementia, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Gan-Mai-Da-Zao-Tang, and Ban-Xia-Bai-Zhu-Tian-Ma-Tang were the core CHF prescribed for mental and nervous system disorders. However, during the later stages of dementia, Suan-Zao-Ren-Tang, Gui-Pi-Tang, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, and Wen-Dan-Tang were the core CHF prescribed. Benzodiazepines were the most common sedative drugs combined with traditional Chinese formulae.The results of this study suggest that TCM prescription were different in various stages of dementia, and indicated the frequently combined use of the TCM formulae and Benzodiazepines in dementia care.","antidepressant agent; anxiolytic agent; central nervous system agents; herbaceous agent; kamisyoyo san; neuroleptic agent; nootropic agent; suanzaoren; dementia; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; human; public health; severity of illness index; Taiwan; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Antidepressive Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Central Nervous System Agents; Dementia; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; Humans; National Health Programs; Nootropic Agents; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan"
"Programmed death-1 and programmed death ligand-1 blockade for advanced urothelial carcinoma","2019","Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has changed the paradigm of anticancer therapy in many cancer types, including advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). Two anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) and three anti-PD ligand-1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have demonstrated their efficacy in the treatment of advanced UC. The response rate of the above ICIs in unselected patients with advanced UC is about 20%. Several on-going large-scale phase III studies explore whether different combinations with ICIs improve the efficacy. To date, there have been several phase I, II, and III studies that examined the efficacy of single-Agent PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 blockade in platinum-failed advanced UC patients, and two phase II studies demonstrated the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade as the first-line therapy in cisplatin-ineligible advanced UC patients.

"WW domain-containing proteins YAP and TAZ in the hippo pathway as key regulators in stemness maintenance, tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis","2019","The Hippo pathway is a conserved signaling pathway originally defined in Drosophila melanogaster two decades ago. Deregulation of the Hippo pathway leads to significant overgrowth in phenotypes and ultimately initiation of tumorigenesis in various tissues. The major WW domain proteins in the Hippo pathway are YAP and TAZ, which regulate embryonic development, organ growth, tissue regeneration, stem cell pluripotency, and tumorigenesis. Recent reports reveal the novel roles of YAP/TAZ in establishing the precise balance of stem cell niches, promoting the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and provoking signals for regeneration and cancer initiation. Activation of YAP/TAZ, for example, results in the expansion of progenitor cells, which promotes regeneration after tissue damage. YAP is highly expressed in self-renewing pluripotent stem cells. Overexpression of YAP halts stem cell differentiation and yet maintains the inherent stem cell properties. A success in reprograming iPSCs by the transfection of cells with Oct3/4, Sox2, and Yap expression constructs has recently been shown. In this review, we update the current knowledge and the latest progress in the WW domain proteins of the Hippo pathway in relevance to stem cell biology, and provide a thorough understanding in the tissue homeostasis and identification of potential targets to block tumor development. We also provide the regulatory role of tumor suppressor WWOX in the upstream of TGF-β, Hyal-2, and Wnt signaling that cross talks with the Hippo pathway.

"Optimizing esthetic outcomes in graded full-thickness anterior blepharotomy for Graves’ ophthalmopathy","2019","Purpose: Current outcome measures do not adequately address the esthetic aspect of the surgical outcome of anterior blepharotomy for Graves’ ophthalmopathy. This study aims to highlight the role of tarsal platform show (TPS) in optimizing the esthetic outcome of graded full-thickness anterior blepharotomy for dysthyroid upper eyelid retraction in an ethnic Chinese population. Methods: The records of patients with Graves’ ophthalmopathy who underwent anterior blepharotomy for upper eyelid retraction over a period of 30?months were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Fifty-five patients (77 eyelids) with upper eyelid retraction underwent anterior blepharotomy. A statistically significant decrease in marginal reflex distance (MRD 1 ) and lagophthalmos and significant increase in TPS following anterior blepharotomy was observed. A significantly higher proportion of patients who underwent unilateral anterior blepharotomy had TPS asymmetry post-operatively as compared to the bilateral group (p?&lt; 0.001). Using logistic regression, the study found that for every 1-mm change in MRD 1 , there was approximately a 1.045-mm change in TPS. The mean percentage increase in TPS observed in our study was 303.1 ± 191% due to the low pre-operative TPS seen in Asian patients. Conclusions: To achieve the most ideal surgical outcome in graded full-thickness anterior blepharotomy, the surgeon will need to consider not only eyelid height but also the subsequent TPS change. The surgeon needs to be mindful of the relationship between MRD 1 change and TPS change to optimize esthetic outcome as well as symmetry. Special considerations need to be taken in unilateral cases as well as patients with low pre-operative TPS. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","complication; endocrine ophthalmopathy; esthetics; eyelid; eyelid disease; eyelid reconstruction; female; human; male; middle aged; patient satisfaction; postoperative period; procedures; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Blepharoplasty; Esthetics; Eyelid Diseases; Eyelids; Female; Graves Ophthalmopathy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Postoperative Period; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome"
"Mycoplasma pneumoniae in pediatric patients: Do macrolide-resistance and/or delayed treatment matter?","2019","Background: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen for pneumonia in children, especially in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination era. Though self-limited disease was found in the majority of the patients, severe diseases occurred occasionally. The emergence of macrolide resistance was reported worldwide. It is important to delineate whether macrolide resistance or delayed treatment affects outcome. Methods: We retrospectively collected pediatric patients with M. pneumoniae infection confirmed by positive PCR in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan from 2010 to 2017. Patients’ clinical characteristics, bacterial load, macrolide resistance and treatment outcome were analyzed. Results: Among 471 children with positive M. pneumoniae PCR, 95% were diagnosed with pneumonia. Seventeen percent of patients had extrapulmonary complications, and 1.5% had respiratory failure. Delayed treatment was associated with prolonged fever after appropriate treatment, fulminant disease, and extrapulmonary manifestations (p < 0.05). The mean rate of macrolide resistance was 24% and macrolide resistance was related to longer febrile duration, longer hospital stay, lung consolidation and impaired liver function tests (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Macrolide resistance was fairly common and might lead to delayed appropriate antibiotic treatment. Delayed appropriate antimicrobial treatment, no matter macrolide resistance or not, was associated with more severe and/or prolonged diseases. Early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae as well as the awareness of macrolide resistance make early effective antibiotic treatment possible and may improve clinical outcomes. ? 2018","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; C reactive protein; macrolide; quinolone derivative; RNA 23S; tetracycline; antiinfective agent; macrolide; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacterial load; child; clinical feature; disease association; disease duration; female; fever; hospitalization; human; length of stay; liver function test; lung complication; macrolide resistance; major clinical study; male; Mycoplasma pneumonia; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; pediatric patient; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; respiratory failure; retrospective study; Taiwan; tertiary health care; therapy delay; treatment indication; treatment outcome; adolescent; antibiotic resistance; drug effect; genetics; hospital; infant; microbiology; mixed infection; Mycoplasma pneumonia; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; newborn; pathogenicity; pneumonia; preschool child; tertiary care center; time to treatment; Adolescent; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Load; Child; Child, Preschool; Coinfection; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Female; Fever; Hospitals; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Macrolides; Male; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Mycoplasma; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Tertiary Care Centers; Time-to-Treatment; Treatment Outcome"
"Advances in cerebral amyloid angiopathy imaging","2019","Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a cerebral small vessel disease caused by β -amyloid (Aβ) deposition at the leptomeningeal vessel walls. It is a common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and a frequent comorbidity in Alzheimer’s disease. The high recurrent hemorrhage rate in CAA makes it very important to recognize this disease to avoid potential harmful medication. Imaging studies play an important role in diagnosis and research of CAA. Conventional computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods reveal anatomical alterations, and remains as the most reliable tool in identifying CAA according to modified Boston criteria. The vascular injuries of CAA result in both hemorrhagic and ischemic manifestations and related structural changes on MRI, including cerebral microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis, white matter hyperintensity, MRI-visible perivascular spaces, and cortical microinfarcts. As imaging techniques advance, not only does the resolution of conventional imaging improve, but novel skills in functional and molecular imaging studies also enable in vivo analysis of vessel physiological changes and underlying pathology. These modern tools help in early detection of CAA and may potentially serve as sensitive outcome markers in future clinical trials. In this article, we reviewed past studies of CAA focusing on utilization of various conventional and novel imaging techniques in both research and clinical aspects. ?

"Thermopneumatic suction integrated microfluidic blood analysis system","2019","Blood tests provide crucial diagnostic information regarding several diseases. A key factor that affects the precision and accuracy of blood tests is the interference of red blood cells; however, the conventional methods of blood separation are often complicated and time consuming. In this study, we devised a simple but high-efficiency blood separation system on a self-strained microfluidic device that separates 99.7 ± 0.3% of the plasma in only 6 min. Parameters, such as flow rate, design of the filter trench, and the relative positions of the filter trench and channel, were optimized through microscopic monitoring. Moreover, this air-difference-driven device uses a cost-effective and easy-to-use heater device that creates a low-pressure environment in the microchannel within minutes. With the aforementioned advantages, this blood separation device could be another platform choice for point-of-care testing. ? 2019 Yang et al.

"Simultaneous integrated boost with helical arc radiotherapy of total skin (HEARTS) to treat cutaneous manifestations of advanced, therapy-refractory cutaneous lymphoma and leukemia - Dosimetry comparison of different regimens and clinical application","2019","Background: Helical irradiation of the total skin (HITS) was modified as simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)-helical arc radiotherapy of total skin (HEARTS) technique and applied to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with disseminated leukemia cutis. Methods: The original HITS plan was revised for different regimens, i.e. HEARTS, low-dose HEARTS and SIB-HEARTS. The uniformity index (UI), conformity index (CI), and dose of organs at risk (OARs) were used to evaluate the plans. Additionally, the SIB-HEART (21/15 Gy) was delivered to the total skin and chloromas. Results: No significant differences were observed for the CI and UI between HITS and HEARTS regimens. Compared with HITS, the reduced mean doses to various bone marrows ranged from 17 to 88%. The mean OARs doses for the head, chest and abdomen of a patient with AML treated with SIB-HEARTS (21/15 Gy) were 2.1 to 21.9 Gy, 1.8 to 7.8 Gy and 1.7 to 3.3 Gy, respectively. No severe adverse effects were noted except for grade 4 leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Conclusion: HEARTS and different regimens reduced the dose to OARs and bone marrow while maintaining the uniformity and conformity. SIB-HEARTS deliveries different doses to the total skin and enlarged tumors simultaneously.

"Expression and the molecular forms of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and matrix metalloproteinase 9 in canine mammary tumours","2019","Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a new biomarker for renal injury. It is also involved in tumorigenesis of different human cancer types. The oncogenic role of NGAL is related to its molecular forms, and heterodimer formation with matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promotes human breast cancer (HBC) invasion and metastasis. To date, the levels of NGAL and NGAL/MMP9 complex have not yet been explored in canine mammary tumours (CMTs). Hence, this study aimed to investigate whether NGAL and its molecular forms could be the biomarker for CMT diagnosis. To this end, expression profile of NGAL and MMP9 in mammary epithelial cells as well as in urine samples were detected. By immunohistochemistry staining, NGAL was expressed at variable levels. Unlike HBC, a significant reduction in NGAL expression was demonstrated in benign and malignant CMTs as compared with normal controls. Additionally, NGAL expression was significantly reduced in dogs with metastatic CMTs. By contrast, the mean score of MMP9 expression in ascending order was normal groups, benign, and malignant CMTs. Interestingly, analysis of the molecular form revealed the NGAL/MMP9 complex presents in most mammary tissues and urine of dogs with benign or malignant CMTs, whereas the complex was absent in samples from dogs without CMTs. In conclusion, NGAL and MMP9 are ubiquitously expressed in canine mammary epithelial cells in normal and cancerous status. However, the NGAL/MMP9 complex exclusively presents in mammary tissues and urine of dogs with tumours. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","gelatinase B; heterodimer; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; tumor marker; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; benign breast tumor; breast adenoma; breast cancer; breast carcinoma; breast epithelium cell; breast tumor; cell infiltration; complex formation; controlled study; dog; female; immunocompetent cell; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; inflammation; inflammatory cell; malignant neoplasm; mixed tumor; nonhuman; protein expression; tumor invasion; urine sampling"

"Positive association between small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and biomarkers of inflammation, thrombosis, and prediabetes in non-diabetic adults","2019","Aims: Recent studies suggest elevated levels of small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) can predict the risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD), even in individuals considered to be at low risk for cardiovascular disease(CVD) based on their LDL-C levels. This study aims to prospectively investigate the association between sdLDL-C concentration and traditional and nontraditional CHD risk markers to explore the underlying roles of sdLDL-C in atherogenic processes. Methods: Between 2009 and 2011, 594 healthy volunteers aged 35 – 65 years were recruited as control subjects in a study of work-related risk factors and acute CHD. All participants fasted for 12 – 14 h, and venous blood samples were collected in the morning to measure serum lipid profiles and other CHD-related markers. A standard oral glucose tolerance test was performed on all participants to assess their subclinical diabetes and predia-betes status. Results: There were significantly positive associations between sdLDL-C concentration and traditional (age, smoking and alcohol drinking habit, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), serum lipid profiles, and diabetes status) and nontraditional risk factors (complete blood counts, (CBC), fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and subclinical diabetes status) for CVD. After adjusting for confounding variables which include age, gender, BMI, hypertension, household income, and smoking and alcohol drinking habits, all atherosclerotic risk markers except D-dimer were significantly and positively associated with sdLDL-C. Conclusions: Our data indicated sdLDL-C is strongly associated with atherosclerotic risk markers, such as inflammation, thrombosis, hematological markers, and prediabetes. This study supports the hypothesis that sdLDL-C is a promising CVD risk biomarker. ? 2019 Japan Atherosclerosis Society.","biological marker; high density lipoprotein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; inflammatory marker; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; thrombotic markers; unclassified drug; C reactive protein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; area under the curve; Article; atherosclerosis; blood pressure; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; drinking behavior; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; estimated glomerular filtration rate; fibrinogen blood level; flow cytometry; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; hematocrit; homeostasis model assessment; household income; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; leukocyte count; leukocyte differential count; lipid blood level; lipid composition; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; oral glucose tolerance test; pulse pressure; receiver operating characteristic; sex difference; small dense low density lipoprotein cholesterol; smoking; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; adult; blood; coronary artery disease; female; human; impaired glucose tolerance; inflammation; male; metabolism; middle aged; risk factor; thrombosis; Adult; Biomarkers; Body Mass Index; C-Reactive Protein; Cholesterol, LDL; Coronary Disease; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; Prediabetic State; Risk Factors; Thrombosis"
"Treating HR+/HER2? breast cancer in premenopausal Asian women: Asian Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 2019 Consensus and position on ovarian suppression","2019","Purpose: Breast cancer in young Asian women has distinctive clinicopathological characteristics; hence, we question the universal generalizability of treatment recommendations based on data from predominantly non-Asian postmenopausal women. Methods: The Asian Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (ABCCG) reviewed current ESO-ESMO and St. Gallen recommendations for treating hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+/HER2?) breast cancer in premenopausal women. Points disputed by ? 3/12 members were discussed, and statements on contentious issues formulated for anonymous voting; consensus required a ? 75% majority. Results: The ABCCG contends that: (1) Trials in premenopausal women are not only necessary, but also worthwhile if performed separately from others that also enroll postmenopausal participants. (2) Not all premenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer need adjuvant ovarian function suppression (OFS). (3) Certain clinical factors might influence decision-making about prescribing OFS. (4) For early HR+/HER2? breast cancer in premenopausal patients with OFS, tamoxifen is preferred for intermediate-risk cases; for high risk, near-consensus supported aromatase inhibitor, despite no clear overall survival benefit versus tamoxifen. (5) Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score? has different treatment implications in patients aged ? 50 versus &gt; 50?years. (6) High-risk patients (if premenopausal after chemotherapy) should receive adjuvant chemotherapy and OFS plus aromatase inhibitor. (7) For patients with advanced disease receiving OFS on a backbone of tamoxifen, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists may be given 12-weekly. (8) For premenopausal women who decline OFS or oophorectomy, tamoxifen alone is still an option but is considered less effective; other monotherapies are also less effective than OFS plus such treatments. Conclusion: Premenopausal Asian women with breast cancer have unique disease characteristics and may benefit from treatment that differs somewhat from international guidelines. Given the great diversity of patients and clinical settings worldwide, the ABCCG advocates evidence-based yet flexible and individualized use of all potential options to improve breast cancer outcomes. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","aromatase inhibitor; cyclin dependent kinase 4 inhibitor; cyclin dependent kinase 6 inhibitor; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor; gonadorelin agonist; mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase inhibitor; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor; tamoxifen; unclassified drug; advanced cancer; Asian; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer inhibition; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; clinical decision making; clinical trial (topic); consensus; disease free survival; early cancer; female; high risk patient; hormonal therapy; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; intermediate risk patient; monotherapy; ovariectomy; ovary function; overall survival; premenopause; prescription; priority journal; Review; treatment outcome"
"Multi-wavelength quantitative differential phase contrast imaging by radially asymmetric illumination","2019","A new approach for achieving isotropic differential phase contrast imaging by applying multi-wavelength asymmetric illumination is demonstrated. Multi-wavelength isotropic differential phase contrast scheme (MW-iDPC) can be implemented using an add-on module in any commercial inverted microscope. Isotropy of intensity transfer function is achieved using three axis measurements. The expression for MW-iDPC imaging is presented, and detailed mathematical analysis is performed for transfer function. By applying color leakage correction, image sensor responses can be calibrated. Asymmetric illumination masks are designed, and simulation studies for intensity of the transfer function are performed. We utilize the MW-iDPC system to reconstruct quantitative phase images of standard microspheres and live breast cancer cells. The optical thickness of cells can be measured with high accuracy and image acquisition time is reduced significantly. ? 2019 Optical Society of America","Medical imaging; Breast cancer cells; Differential phase contrast; Differential phase contrast imaging; Illumination mask; Image acquisition time; Mathematical analysis; Multi-wavelengths; Simulation studies; Transfer functions"
"Characterization and Management of Arrhythmic Events in Young Patients With Brugada Syndrome","2019","Background: Information on young patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and arrhythmic events (AEs) is limited. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe their characteristics and management as well as risk factors for AE recurrence. Methods: A total of 57 patients (age ?20 years), all with BrS and AEs, were divided into pediatric (age ?12 years; n = 26) and adolescents (age 13 to 20 years; n = 31). Results: Patients’ median age at time of first AE was 14 years, with a majority of males (74%), Caucasians (70%), and probands (79%) who presented as aborted cardiac arrest (84%). A significant proportion of patients (28%) exhibited fever-related AE. Family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD), prior syncope, spontaneous type 1 Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG), inducible ventricular fibrillation at electrophysiological study, and SCN5A mutations were present in 26%, 49%, 65%, 28%, and 58% of patients, respectively. The pediatric group differed from the adolescents, with a greater proportion of females, Caucasians, fever-related AEs, and spontaneous type-1 ECG. During follow-up, 68% of pediatric and 64% of adolescents had recurrent AE, with median time of 9.9 and 27.0 months, respectively. Approximately one-third of recurrent AEs occurred on quinidine therapy, and among the pediatric group, 60% of recurrent AEs were fever-related. Risk factors for recurrent AE included sinus node dysfunction, atrial arrhythmias, intraventricular conduction delay, or large S-wave on ECG lead I in the pediatric group and the presence of SCN5A mutation among adolescents. Conclusions: Young BrS patients with AE represent a very arrhythmogenic group. Current management after first arrhythmia episode is associated with high recurrence rate. Alternative therapies, besides defibrillator implantation, should be considered. ? 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation","quinidine; adolescent; adult; Article; Brugada syndrome; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; child; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; electrocardiogram; faintness; family history; female; fever; follow up; gene; gene mutation; groups by age; heart arrest; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium arrhythmia; heart electrophysiology; heart ventricle conduction; heart ventricle fibrillation; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; recurrent disease; SCN5A gene; sinus node disease; sudden cardiac death"
"Using Google Maps to display the pattern of coauthor collaborations on the topic of schizophrenia: A systematic review between 1937 and 2017","2019","Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder affecting more than 21 million people worldwide. Scientific collaborations are required to research schizophrenia. However, there have been limited publications to date investigating scientific collaborations in schizophrenia research or reporting individual researchers’ achievements(IRA) for authors. This study aimed to investigate the pattern of coauthor collaborations in schizophrenia research. We conducted a bibliometric study of international scientific publications on schizophrenia. About 57,964 abstracts were identified and downloaded from MEDLINE. All were examined using social network analysis (SNA) on February 20, 2018. The clusters of author nationalities, the authors, and the medical subject headings (MESH) terms were presented on Google Maps. A total of 36,934 articles met the inclusion criteria. The mean number of authors per article increased from 4.5 in 2008 to 6.4 in 2017. The proportion of published articles decreased in North America from 46.7% in 2008, to 32.3% in 2017. In contrast, the proportion of published articles in Asia increased from 14.5% in 1998 to 23.9% in 2017. Among the countries generating schizophrenia research the most prominent is China (corr. = 0.98), followed by India (corr. = 0.94), and France (corr. = 0.93). The representative of the biggest cluster is the author Michael F Green from the United States. The top three MESH terms are physiopathology, schizophrenic psychology, and complications. The scientific interest in schizophrenia remains significant. The application of bibliometric indicators of production is evident in the growth of scientific literature on the topic of schizophrenia. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","access to information; Article; author; bibliometrics; China; cluster analysis; complication; France; geographic mapping; India; North America; online analysis; online social network; pathophysiology; priority journal; psychology; publication; schizophrenia; United States"
"Trajectories of functional exercise capacity in patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation","2019","Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is now considered fundamental when managing patients with chronic respiratory disease. The individual variation in functional exercise capacity (FEC) response to PR within the cohort is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify FEC patterns in response to PR in patients with chronic respiratory disease using the trajectory modeling method. Methods: The data of 67 patients with the chronic respiratory disease were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed in this study. All patients received once-weekly supervised training for 8 weeks. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) was used to measure FEC. Muscle strength and 6MWD were assessed at baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and monthly for two months after PR completion. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was used to identify patterns in 6MWD in response to PR. The generalized estimating equation method was then used to detect the differences within and between the trajectories of identified groups across time. Results: Patients were grouped into low-(n=13), moderate-(n=34) and high-(n=20) FEC group based on GBTM analysis. All groups demonstrated significant improvements in 6MWD and leg muscle strength after 8-week PR. Compared to the high-FEC group, a greater proportion of the patients in the low-FEC group required oxygen supplementation during training and had worse baseline leg muscle strength. Conclusions: Patients showed distinct patterns of 6MWD changes in response to 8-week PR. Distinct characteristics for the low-FEC group included poor lower extremity strength and a greater proportion of required oxygen use at home and during training. ? 2019 Lee et al.","beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; corticosteroid; long acting drug; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; aged; Article; body mass; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic respiratory tract disease; controlled study; disease severity; exercise; female; forced expiratory volume; functional assessment; group based trajectory modeling; hand grip; human; leg muscle; major clinical study; male; mathematical analysis; muscle strength; oxygen therapy; pulmonary rehabilitation; retrospective study; six minute walk test; Taiwan; treatment duration; treatment response; chronic disease; convalescence; exercise tolerance; kinesiotherapy; lung; lung disease; middle aged; pathophysiology; skeletal muscle; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; walk test; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chronic Disease; Exercise Therapy; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Humans; Lung; Lung Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Walk Test"
"Establishing competencies for a global health workforce: Recommendations from the association of pacific rim universities","2019","Background: The Association of Pacific Rim Universities Global Health Program facilitates exchange of information, knowledge and experiences in global health education and research among its 50 member universities. Despite the proliferation of global health educational programs worldwide, a lack of consensus exists regarding core competencies in global health training and how these are best taught. Methods: A workshop was convened with 30 faculty, university administrators, students, and NGO workers representing both the Global North and South to gain consensus on core competencies in masters’-level global health training. The co-authors then collaborated to refine the list of competencies, categorize them into domains, and develop a plan for how academic institutions can ensure that these competencies are effectively taught. Findings: Nineteen competencies across five domains were identified: knowledge of trends and determinants of global disease patterns; cultural competency; global health governance, diplomacy and leadership; project management; and ethics and human rights. The plan for how academic institutions can best train students on these competencies outlined five key opportunities: coursework; practicums; research opportunities; mentorship; and evaluation. The plan recommended additional institutional strategies such as maximizing collaborative research opportunities, international partnerships, capacity-building grants, and use of educational technology to support these goals. Conclusions and Recommendations: While further research on the implementation of competency-based training is warranted, this work offers a step forward in advancing competency-based global health masters’ education as identified by a globally diverse group of expert stakeholders and economies. Given the challenges facing the current global health landscape, comparable competency-based training across institutions is critical to ensure the training of competent global health professionals. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; Australia; awareness; capacity building; China; clinical evaluation; communicable disease; consensus; cultural competence; cultural factor; diplomacy; disease burden; economic aspect; education program; educational technology; financial management; framework convention on tobacco control; global health; grey literature; health behavior; health care management; health care organization; health care policy; health care quality; health disparity; health education; health equity; health insurance; health program; health status; high income country; Hong Kong; human; human rights; human rights abuse; Indonesia; international cooperation; Japan; leadership; learning environment; lifestyle; low income country; medical education; medical ethics; Medline; mentor; middle income country; needs assessment; non communicable disease; Philippines; physician; private sector; racism; school; Singapore; South Korea; sustainable development goal; Taiwan; Thailand; training; United States; university; workforce; workshop"
"Urinary phthalate metabolites, coronary heart disease, and atherothrombotic markers","2019","Cross-sectional studies have described an association between exposure to phthalate esters and cardiovascular risk factors. However, the association with coronary heart disease (CHD) is still unclear. A total of 180 subjects randomly selected from 336 CHD patients, and 360 age- and sex-matched non-CHD controls were included from 2008 to 2011. Urinary metabolites of phthalate esters were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The geometric means of urinary phthalates metabolites were significantly higher for the three Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, mono?2?ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono?(2?ethyl?5?hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono?(2?ethyl?5?oxohexyl) phthalate among CHD patients in-hospital than those of being discharged. Excluding 89 CHD patients of in-hospital and hospital discharge within 2 days, we found the urinary concentrations of MEHP, mono?n?butyl phthalate (MnBP), and mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) of 91 CHD patients discharged ? 3 days were higher than those of controls. Among 451 participants, those with higher tertile levels of urinary MEHP, MnBP, and MiBP showed an increased risk for CHD compared to those with lowest tertile levels; the corresponding odds ratios (95% CI) were 2.77 (1.22–6.28), 2.90 (1.32–6.4), and 3.19 (1.41–7.21), respectively, after adjustment for confounders. Higher levels of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were linked with increased levels of all DEHP metabolites in CHD patients.

Here we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the two-dose (2D) AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine (2D-AS04-HPV-16/18v)+screening compared with a screening programme alone, with 2D human papillomavirus 6/11/16/18 vaccine (2D-4vHPVv)+screening, and with 2D/three-dose (3D) human papillomavirus 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 vaccine (9vHPVv)+screening, for Taiwan universal mass vaccination. Methods: A static Markov cohort model simulated the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and CC screening for a 12-year-old cohort of Taiwanese girls (N=120,000). The model ran in 1-year cycles over the cohort's lifetime. Vaccine efficacy irrespective of HPV type was considered in the analysis for each vaccine. Input data were obtained from published literature, local databases, government reports and websites, and expert opinion. The analysis incorporated direct medical costs only, with an annual discount rate of 3.0%. The threshold was determined as 1 Gross Domestic Product per capita (New Taiwan dollar [NT$] 727,818; year 2016). Results: The 2D-AS04-HPV-16/18v+screening yielded 0.0365 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained at an additional cost of NT$ 5,770 per person compared with the screening programme alone. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio well below the threshold. Compared with 2D-4vHPVv+screening and 2D/3D-9vHPVv+screening, discounted results demonstrated additional QALYs gained at lower cost for 2D-AS04-HPV-16/18v+screening, making it dominant over both 2D-4vHPVv+screening and 2D/3D-9vHPVv+screening. Conclusions: Vaccinating Taiwanese girls with 2D-AS04-HPV-16/18v in addition to screening to prevent CC is cost-effective compared with using a screening programme alone and the dominant option compared with 2D-4vHPVv+screening and 2D/3D-9vHPVv+screening. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention.","Wart virus vaccine; adolescent; adult; aged; child; classification; cohort analysis; cost benefit analysis; early cancer diagnosis; economics; female; follow up; human; incidence; isolation and purification; Markov chain; middle aged; Papillomaviridae; papillomavirus infection; prognosis; quality adjusted life year; survival rate; Taiwan; uterine cervix tumor; vaccination; very elderly; virology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Cohort Studies; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Markov Chains; Middle Aged; Papillomaviridae; Papillomavirus Infections; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Prognosis; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Survival Rate; Taiwan; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaccination; Young Adult"
"Intracranial aneurysms formation after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer: A 10-year nationwide follow-up study","2019","Background: Intracranial aneurysms after radiotherapy (RT) have previously been reported. However, the majority of studies were case reports. Therefore, we performed a nationwide study to explore the risk of radiation-induced intracranial aneurysms. Methods: This study included patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer (ICD9: 140-149, 161). Intracranial aneurysms formation was identified using the following ICD9 codes: nonruptured cerebral aneurysm (ICD9:4373), aneurysm clipping (ICD9:3951). Patients who did not receive curative treatment and those with intracranial aneurysms before the diagnosis of head and neck cancer were excluded. Results: In total, 70,691 patients were included in the final analysis; they were categorized into the following three groups: nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with RT, non-NPC with RT, and non-NPC without RT. Patients in the NPC with RT group had the highest risk of developing intracranial aneurysms (hazard ratio (HR) 2.57; P < 0.001). In addition, hypertension was also a risk factor of developing intracranial aneurysms (HR 2.14; P < 0.01). The mean time interval from cancer diagnosis to intracranial aneurysm formation in the NPC with RT group was 4.3 ± 3.1 years. Conclusions: Compared with the non-NPC with RT and the non-NPC without RT groups, patients with NPC who received RT had a higher risk of developing intracranial aneurysms. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; aneurysm clipping; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer risk; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; controlled study; disease course; female; follow up; head and neck cancer; high risk patient; human; hypertension; ICD-9; intracranial aneurysm; major clinical study; male; nasopharynx carcinoma; radiation hazard; risk assessment; risk factor; adverse event; complication; incidence; intracranial aneurysm; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; proportional hazards model; radiation dose; sex factor; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Intracranial Aneurysm; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Proportional Hazards Models; Radiation Dosage; Radiotherapy; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Taiwan"
"Microbiological and clinical characteristics of Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia: Implications of sequence type for prognosis","2019","Objectives: Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) provides a highly discriminative typing method. We aimed to determine the clinical impact of Ab sequence types (ST) in patients with bloodstream infection (BSI). Methods: Patients with Ab-BSI were followed prospectively from 2009 to 2014. We randomly selected one-third of non-duplicate bacteremic isolates for MLST and correlated the Ab ST with the clinical course. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Results: We enrolled 148 patients. Seventy-seven (52.0%) of the isolates were ST2. Patients with ST2-BSI were less likely to be treated with appropriate empirical antimicrobial agents (31.1% vs. 60.6%; P < 0.001). They had greater mortality (66.2% vs. 40.8%; P = 0.003) than patients with non-ST2-BSI. In the multivariable analysis, ST2 independently predicted greater severity of infection (Pitt bacteremia score) (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 3.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.75–6.54; P < 0.001). Mediated by a higher Pitt bacteremia score (Sobel test P < 0.001), ST2 is an independent prognostic factor that predict mortality (aOR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.07–5.11; P = 0.03). Conclusions: ST2 was associated with high rates of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, severe infection and mortality. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and explore the potential of role of the virulence. ? 2018 The British Infection Association","colistin; imipenem; levofloxacin; sulbactam; tigecycline; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter infection; adult; aged; all cause mortality; antimicrobial therapy; Article; bacterium isolate; bloodstream infection; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease course; disease severity assessment; female; hospital mortality; human; human cell; major clinical study; male; minimum inhibitory concentration; mortality rate; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; observational study; Pitt bacteremia score; prognosis; prospective study"
"Long-term safety and efficacy of deferasirox in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia and other rare anemia in Taiwan","2019","Objective: Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), aplastic anemia (AA) or other rare anemia require chronic blood transfusions which can lead to iron overload and subsequent excess iron-mediated complications. Intensive iron chelation with deferasirox could remove excess iron and can alleviate these events; however, the long-term safety and efficacy in Chinese population are not clearly characterized. This study examined the long-term efficacy and safety of deferasirox in a real-world setting in Taiwan. Methods: This observational, non-interventional, single-arm, multi-center, phase IV study was designed to collect the safety and clinical information about patients who were treated with deferasirox according to investigator’s judgment and in accordance with the general clinical practice. Results: From 2009 to 2011, patients with MDS (N = 38), AA (N = 23), and other rare anemias (N = 18) were enrolled. The mean deferasirox exposure was 17.7 ± 4.02 mg/kg/day. The most common drug-related AEs were skin disorders (32.9%) and gastrointestinal disorders (30.4%), while grade 3–4 AEs were rare (5.1%). In the overall patient population, deferasirox effectively decreased serum ferritin levels at 1 year (P = 0.0154) and 3 years (P = 0.0424) from the baseline. Upon the use of deferasirox, 32.9% patients showed erythroid response and 16.7% patients had platelet response. Conclusions: For patients with MDS, AA, and other rare anemias, the AEs observed in this 3-year surveillance study with deferasirox were mostly mild or moderate. In addition, the hematological response rate was higher than that in the EPIC study, which primarily enrolled Caucasian patients. ? 2018, ? 2018 The Author(s).

"Subjective wellbeing, suicide and socioeconomic factors: An ecological analysis in Hong Kong","2019","Aims. There has recently been an increased interest in mental health indicators for the monitoring of population wellbeing, which is among the targets of Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations. Levels of subjective wellbeing and suicide rates have been proposed as indicators of population mental health, but prior research is limited.Methods. Data on individual happiness and life satisfaction were sourced from a population-based survey in Hong Kong (2011). Suicide data were extracted from Coroner's Court files (2005-2013). Area characteristic variables included local poverty rate and four factors derived from a factor analysis of 21 variables extracted from the 2011 census. The associations between mean happiness and life satisfaction scores and suicide rates were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient at two area levels: 18 districts and 30 quantiles of large street blocks (LSBs; n = 1620). LSB is a small area unit with a higher level of within-unit homogeneity compared with districts. Partial correlations were used to control for area characteristics.Results. Happiness and life satisfaction demonstrated weak inverse associations with suicide rate at the district level (r =-0.32 and-0.36, respectively) but very strong associations at the LSB quantile level (r =-0.83 and-0.84, respectively). There were generally very weak or weak negative correlations across sex/age groups at the district level but generally moderate to strong correlations at the LSB quantile level. The associations were markedly attenuated or became null after controlling for area characteristics.Conclusions. Subjective wellbeing is strongly associated with suicide at a small area level; socioeconomic factors can largely explain this association. Socioeconomic factors could play an important role in determining the wellbeing of the population, and this could inform policies aimed at enhancing population wellbeing. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press.","adolescent; Article; ecology; female; geography; happiness; Hong Kong; human; life satisfaction; major clinical study; male; population research; poverty; prevalence; psychological well-being; socioeconomics; suicide; adult; age distribution; aged; demography; happiness; health survey; mental disease; mental health; middle aged; poverty; psychology; quality of life; satisfaction; sex ratio; socioeconomics; suicide; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Female; Happiness; Health Surveys; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Population Surveillance; Poverty; Quality of Life; Residence Characteristics; Sex Distribution; Socioeconomic Factors; Suicide; Young Adult"
"Performance of fracture risk assessment tool in HIV-positive male individuals aged ?45?years on suppressive antiretroviral therapy","2019","Introduction: An age-specific evaluation and management algorithm for reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is suggested for HIV-positive patients without major risk factors. Whether combination of BMD and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) may detect more individuals for therapeutic interventions remains unclear. We aimed to determine the prevalence of middle-aged or older HIV-positive males fitting the criteria of therapeutic interventions with different approaches. Methods: From July 2016 to February 2018, HIV-positive male patients aged ?45?years receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy were recruited in a cross-sectional study, at two designated hospitals for HIV care in northern Taiwan. Patients with malignancy, AIDS, pre-existing bone disease or immobilization were excluded. Information on clinical and demographic characteristics, FRAX questionnaire, activity questionnaire, BMD and serum 25(OH)D was obtained. FRAX scores combined with BMD (FRAX/BMD) and without BMD (FRAX) were calculated. The data were analysed on the basis of major risk factors for fragility fracture and age stratification, FRAX score and BMD results respectively. Results: We enrolled 330 patients with a mean age of 51.6?years and CD4 610?cells/μL, in whom 98.1% (n?=?324) underwent BMD assessment of one site or more. By FRAX, 6.7% (n?=?22) reached treatment thresholds (10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture ?20% and/or hip fracture ?3%). The prevalence of osteopenia (?2.5 &lt;T-score &lt;?1) and osteoporosis (T-score ??2.5) was 50.3% and 10.8% respectively. Compared with FRAX, FRAX/BMD identified 17.4% (95% CI 12.0% to 22.8%) more individuals who reached treatment thresholds (24.1% vs. 6.7%); even in the low-risk group (without major risks for fragility fracture, 45 to 49?years, n?=?129), FRAX/BMD identified 12.6% (95% CI 7.9% to 19.7%) more candidates (12.6% vs. 0%). Patients with BMI&lt;22?kg/m2 (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.86, 95% CI 1.62 to 5.05) and aged ?50?years (aOR 3.57, 95% CI 1.92 to 6.66) were more likely not to be identified as requiring treatment by FRAX but would be identified as requiring treatment by FRAX/BMD. The sensitivity and specificity of FRAX to detect candidates for interventions was 18.2% (95% CI 10.3% to 28.6%) and 97.9% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.3%) respectively. Conclusions: With FRAX as a screening approach among HIV-positive male patients aged ?45?years, addition of BMD assessment may detect more candidates for therapeutic management. ? 2019 The Authors.

"A Hybrid Key Item Locating Method to Assist Elderly Daily Life Using Internet of Things","2019","With the advancement of medical technology and the rise of medical awareness, the average life expectancy has risen. Advanced countries have stepped into the aged society successively. Building a senior citizen-friendly environment has become an important issue. On one hand, senior citizens are likely to forget where key items are placed due to hypomnesia. Life is inconvenient for them. On the other hand, the proportion of elderly living alone or living only with spouse increases. Without children’s accompany, a senior citizen’s life could be in danger if he or she suddenly feels uncomfortable, and cannot find the therapeutic drugs instantly. As the information and communication technology has improved in recent years, the Internet of Things technology has gradually become more mature. The arisen of IoT is not only helpful to our daily life in terms of traffic and shopping, but also with clinical knowledge and experience is applicable to build the environment of health care and increase the quality of home care service for senior citizens. In this paper, we attempt to build a life supporting mechanism in the home environment of senior citizens based on the architecture of Internet of Things. This work proposes a new type of hybrid calculation algorithm which combines xBeacon sensing equipment, Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) positioning, event analysis method and intelligent cutting algorithm to cut the possible range where the object may be placed into sections, so as to estimate the location of the key items. By tracking key items, elderly people can reduce anxiety and uncomfortable feeling caused by missing key items. To effectively record and analyze routine behavior pattern, this proposed mechanism can support the mobility of the elderly to maintain independent daily life and is helpful for the implementation of “home-based care for the aged” and “aging in place”. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Assisted living; Biomedical engineering; Cutting equipment; Home health care; Indoor positioning systems; Assisted living technologies; Average life expectancy; Information and Communication Technologies; Internet of Things (IOT); Internet of things technologies; Received signal strength indication; Senior living; Supporting mechanisms; Internet of things"
"Is dialysis vintage a perioperative risk for end-stage renal disease patients receiving total knee and hip arthroplasty","2019","Background: End-stage renal disease is an independent risk factor for postoperative mortality and cardiovascular events, but dialysis vintage and its relationship with perioperative complication is not well studied. We did a population-based study to investigate this issue. Materials and methods: We identified patients who had total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) surgeries during 1999–2010 from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Patients who had regular dialysis before surgery were recruited in our analysis. The outcome of interest was mortality, morbidities, intensive care unit admission rate, hospitalization duration, readmission rate, and medical costs. We did multivariate regression to adjust for age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and to analyze the relationship of dialysis vintage and clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 518 patients were enrolled for analysis. A total of 286 patients had TKA surgeries and 232 patients had THA surgeries. Patients who had TKA surgery were older and had more medical comorbidities than patients who had THA. After adjustment for age, sex, and CCI, TKA patients who had dialysis vintage <3 years had significantly higher medical costs (p < 0.05). For THA patients, dialysis vintage is not an independent risk factor for outcomes of interest. Conclusion: Perioperative complication is associated with age and medical comorbidities. Longer dialysis vintage is not related to perioperative morbidities and mortalities or higher medical costs in either TKA or THA patients. ?

"MicroRNA-125b in vascular diseases: An updated systematic review of pathogenetic implications and clinical applications","2019","Epigenetic changes, particularly non-coding RNAs, have been implicated extensively in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Specific miRNAs are involved in the differentiation, phenotypic switch, proliferation, apoptosis, cytokine production and matrix deposition of endothelial cells and/or vascular smooth muscle cells. MicroRNA-125b has been studied in depth for its role in carcinogenesis with a double-edged role; that is, it can act as an oncogene in some cancer types and as a tumour suppressor gene in others. However, cumulative evidence from the use of advanced miRNA profiling techniques and bioinformatics analysis suggests that miR-125b can be a potential mediator and useful marker of vascular diseases. Currently, the exact role of miR-125b in vascular diseases is not known. In this systematic review, we intend to provide an updated compilation of all the recent findings of miR-125b in vascular diseases, using a systematic approach of retrieving data from all available reports followed by data summarization. MiR-125b serves as a pathogenic player in multiple vascular pathologies involving endothelia and vascular smooth muscle cells and also serves as a diagnostic marker for vascular diseases. We further provide a computational biologic presentation of the complex network of miR-125b and its target genes within the scope of vascular diseases. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Comparative Efficacy of Noninvasive Neurostimulation Therapies for Acute and Subacute Poststroke Dysphagia: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis","2019","Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of noninvasive neurostimulation therapies in patients with poststroke dysphagia. Data Sources: Electronic databases, including Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, were searched up to May 31, 2018. Study Selection: All published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing neurostimulation therapies, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (sNMES), and pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES), in patients with acute and subacute poststroke dysphagia were included. Nineteen RCTs were enrolled in the meta-analysis. Data Extraction: Full texts were independently reviewed. Two independent raters assessed the risk of bias of RCTs with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The primary outcome measure was swallowing function evaluated before and after neurostimulation therapy. Data Synthesis: Both pairwise and network meta-analysis revealed that rTMS, tDCS, and sNMES significantly improved poststroke dysphagia compared with placebo. Differences in functional improvement between PES and placebo were not significant. Based on probability ranking, rTMS seemed the best treatment among the 4 neurostimulation therapies. In the network meta-analysis, rTMS showed the best efficacy compared with placebo (standardized mean difference=1.02, 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.43). Conclusions: Among the 4 noninvasive neurostimulation therapies, rTMS, tDCS, and sNMES were effective for treating poststroke dysphagia; furthermore, rTMS may be the most effective therapy according to probability ranking. ? 2018 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","adverse event; cerebrovascular accident; comparative effectiveness; dysphagia; human; meta analysis; nerve stimulation; network meta-analysis; neuromuscular electrical stimulation; non invasive procedure; outcome assessment; pharyngeal electrical stimulation; randomized controlled trial (topic); repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; Review; sensory stimulation; swallowing; systematic review; transcranial direct current stimulation; aged; cerebrovascular accident; complication; dysphagia; electrotherapy; female; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; stroke rehabilitation; treatment outcome; Aged; Deglutition Disorders; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Network Meta-Analysis; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Treatment Outcome"
"Single step and mask-free 3D wax printing of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for glucose and nitrite assays","2019","Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have recently emerged as a simple, portable, user-friendly, and affordable alternative to more instrument-intensive analytical approaches for point-of-care testing (POCT), food safety analysis, and environmental monitoring. However, most of the existing methods for the fabrication of μPADs still face a great challenge because of different trade-offs among cost, convenience, and the pattern resolution. In this work, we report a facile one-step approach to prepare a μPAD using an affordable, easy-to-build 3D printer to generate patterns of solid wax on laboratory filter paper. The presented wax printing method did not require the use of predesigned masks and an external heat source to form complete hydrophobic wax barrier through the use of a custom-made extruder. The results revealed a strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.985) between the nominal and the printed widths of the wax barriers. The achievable resolution of the wax barrier printed on filter paper was 468 ± 72 ?m, which was lower than previously reported minimum barrier feature sizes achieved by wax printing and other wax patterning techniques, such as stamping and screen-printing. The analytical utility of the fabricated μPADs was evaluated for colorimetric nitrite and glucose detection in artificial solutions. It was found that the fabricated μPADs provided adequate accuracy and reproducibility for quantitative determination of nitrite and glucose within concentration ranges relevant to the disease detection in human saliva and urine. The wax printing approach reported here provides a simple, rapid, and cost-effective fabrication method for paper-based microfluidics and may bring benefits to medical diagnostics in the developing world. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Analytic equipment; Body fluids; Colorimetry; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Economic and social effects; Fabrication; Glucose; Instrument testing; Microfluidics; Paper; Safety testing; Screen printing; 3-D printing; Colorimetric assays; Cost-effective fabrication; Low cost fabrication; Micro-fluidic devices; Paper-based analytical devices; Paper-based microfluidics; Quantitative determinations; 3D printers; glucose; nitrite; wax; chemistry; colorimetry; devices; lab on a chip; paper; three dimensional printing; Colorimetry; Glucose; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Nitrites; Paper; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Waxes"
"Antiviral Therapy in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Is Associated With a Reduced Risk of Parkinsonism","2019","Background: The risk of parkinsonism after antiviral treatment against chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is unclear. Objectives: To investigate the association between CHC and parkinsonism and the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Methods: Using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 2004 to 2012, patients with and without CHC, patients receiving pegylated interferon-based antiviral therapy, and those without such therapy were matched by age, gender, and comorbidities by propensity scores and followed for new diagnoses of parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease (PD). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed. Results: Overall, 49,342 patients with CHC were matched with 49,342 non-CHC patients. After adjustment for confounding factors, there was a significantly increased risk (31%) of parkinsonism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.306; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.208–1.412) in those with CHC and the risk of parkinsonism requiring anti-Parkinson medication (HR 1.323; 95% CI, 1.214–1.441). Furthermore, 23,647 untreated CHC patients were matched with 23,647 patients receiving antiviral therapy. Patients receiving antiviral therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing parkinsonism (38%; HR 0.618; 95% CI, 0.498–0.765) and a reduced risk of parkinsonism requiring anti-Parkinson medication (HR 0.651; 95% CI, 0.515–0.823). In sensitivity analyses, antiviral therapy significantly reduced the risk of parkinsonism and PD after adjustment for detection, selection, disease latency biases, and competing mortality. Our results suggest successful antiviral therapy associates with a reduced risk of hepatitis C virus–related parkinsonism compared with those with treatment failure. Conclusions: CHC infection is associated with an increased risk of parkinsonism or PD. Antiviral therapy against CHC is associated with a reduced risk of parkinsonism or PD. ? 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. ? 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",""
"Second harmonic generation imaging of chick corneal development","2019","The cornea is a transparent tissue with significant refractive and barrier functions. The adult cornea has five layers: an outer epithelium layer, a Bowman's layer which forms the transition between the corneal epithelium and the underlying stroma, a middle stromal layer of collagen-rich extracellular matrix between stromal keratocytes, a Descemet's membrane which separates the stroma from the underlying endothelial layer of the cornea and an inner layer of endothelial cells. Early studies showed that the that collagen fibrils of chick cornea display orthogonal-like pattern. Moreover, primary and secondary stroma have been identified in developing cornea. The primary stroma of the developing avian cornea is a highly organized extracellular matrix composed largely of striated collagen fibrils synthesized by the epithelium. Previous studies have found at least two different fibrillar collagen types, such as type I and II, are shown during the development. Other type of collagen, such as type IX, also appears to be involved in the collagen assembly process. This matrix is subsequently invaded by periocular mesenchymal cells which secrete a secondary cornea stroma to gradually replace the primary one. This indicates that the development of embryonic cornea involves many important biological events and exhibits highly dynamic characteristics. Since second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a nonlinear second order optical process which occurs in noncentrosymmetric systems with a large hyperpolarizability, it has emerged as a powerful modality for imaging fibrillar collagen in a diverse range of tissues. It is highly sensitive to the collagen fibril/fiber structure, and to changes that occur in diseases such as cancer, fibrosis and connective tissue disorders. To explore the structural variation of embryonic cornea, we use Fast Fourier Transform second harmonic generation microscopy as a tool in our study. ? COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Methods: Physicians from different hospitals attended the GMFTPs. Since 2010, we have been using quick tests to assess trainees' familiarity of core competencies. Knowledge improvement (KI) was defined as the difference between post-BT and pre-BT test scores. Since 2013, we have been annually mailing questionnaires to assess trainees' teaching confidence (TC) of core competencies. We analyzed the correlations between trainees' characteristics, KIs, and TCs. Results: Between year 2009 and 2017, a total of 319 attending physicians (257 male, 62 female), with a mean age of 39.1 ± 6.2 years, completed the GMFTPs. Significant KI (32.6–55.4) was noted. There were no correlations between trainees' characteristics and KIs. The mean TCs for the 6 core competences were all above 4.0 (based on a 5-point Likert scale). TCs were positively correlated with age during GMFTP training, age when responding to the questionnaire, and duration between training and the last time responding to the questionnaire. TC showed no correlation with sex, hospitals, departments, or KI. Conclusion: Knowledge of teaching core competencies improved immediately after BT, but KIs did not correlate with TCs in long-term follow-up. After the training program, physicians' teaching confidence increased over time. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","accreditation; adult; age; article; controlled study; female; follow up; general practice; human; human experiment; Likert scale; male; medical education; physician; questionnaire; student"
"EpiRank: Modeling Bidirectional Disease Spread in Asymmetric Commuting Networks","2019","Commuting network flows are generally asymmetrical, with commuting behaviors bi-directionally balanced between home and work locations, and with weekday commutes providing many opportunities for the spread of infectious diseases via direct and indirect physical contact. The authors use a Markov chain model and PageRank-like algorithm to construct a novel algorithm called EpiRank to measure infection risk in a spatially confined commuting network on Taiwan island. Data from the country’s 2000 census were used to map epidemic risk distribution as a commuting network function. A daytime parameter was used to integrate forward and backward movement in order to analyze daily commuting patterns. EpiRank algorithm results were tested by comparing calculations with actual disease distributions for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak and enterovirus cases between 2000 and 2008. Results suggest that the bidirectional movement model outperformed models that considered forward or backward direction only in terms of capturing spatial epidemic risk distribution. EpiRank also outperformed models based on network indexes such as PageRank and HITS. According to a sensitivity analysis of the daytime parameter, the backward movement effect is more important than the forward movement effect for understanding a commuting network’s disease diffusion structure. Our evidence supports the use of EpiRank as an alternative network measure for analyzing disease diffusion in a commuting network. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"A nationwide survey of the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of internet addictive disorders in Taiwan","2019","Background and purpose: The American Psychiatric Association has published the diagnostic criteria of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) in the 5th Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) for further studies to clarify IGD and related concepts of internet addiction. The study aims to investigate the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of internet addictive disorder (IAD) in the general population using the framework of IGD criteria. Methods: A nationwide survey was conducted using a computer-assisted telephone interview of residents aged 15 and older selected by a stratified proportional randomizing method. The questionnaire comprised socio-demographic information, 9-items IAD (IAD-9) for identification of IGD and non-gaming IAD, the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale, and questions about internet use and suicidal ideation. Results: Among 2147 respondents (50.4% females), the one-year prevalence of IAD was 1.9% (1.2% for IGD and 0.7% for non-gaming IAD). People with IAD were characterized as: younger, unemployed or students, under recent psychological distress, with recent and lifetime suicidal ideation, and engaging in regular multiple online activities including gaming, shopping or video-watching. Logistic regression revealed that age and psychopathology including insomnia, depression and inferiority were significant predictors of IAD. High prevalence of psychiatric morbidity (27.5%) and lifetime suicidal ideation (34.2%) accompanied with very low psychiatric treatment rate were also identified. Conclusion: Age and psychopathology were identified as major determinants of IAD. The IGD criteria in DMS-5 is applicable to identify the internet addictive problems that enhances early engagement for high-risk populations across the ages. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; Brief Symptom Rating Scale; controlled study; correlation analysis; demography; depression; distress syndrome; DSM-5; female; game addiction; health survey; human; insomnia; internet addiction; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; morbidity; population research; prevalence; psychiatric treatment; psychosocial disorder; questionnaire; rating scale; shopping; social status; student; suicidal ideation; Taiwan; telephone interview; unemployment; video game; young adult; addiction; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Internet; mental disease; multivariate analysis; prevalence; psychology; statistical model; Taiwan; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Behavior, Addictive; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Humans; Internet; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prevalence; Psychopathology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Increasing risk of diabetes mellitus in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed primary breast cancer","2019","Aims/Introduction: We sought to determine if postmenopausal women who develop breast cancer are at increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Materials and Methods: The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was searched from 2001 to 2015 for women aged ?55?years (postmenopausal) with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Participants were age-matched with women without breast cancer in a 1:5 ratio. Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to examine associations between breast cancer, risk factors and the development of diabetes mellitus. Results: A total of 4,607 women with primary breast cancer and 23,035 age-matched controls without breast cancer were included (mean age 58.6?±?9.1?years). Adjusting for age, income, urbanization, Charlson Comorbidity Index and medical conditions, the risk of diabetes mellitus for participants with breast cancer at 1, 5, 10 and 15?years was 1.70-, 1.34-, 1.27- and 1.24-fold higher, respectively, than for participants without breast cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40–2.05; aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.17–1.54; aHR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13–1.44; aHR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11–1.40). The risk of diabetes mellitus at 1?year for breast cancer patients receiving hormone therapy was 1.22-fold higher than in those not receiving hormone therapy (aHR 1.22, 95% CI 0.86–1.74), but without statistical significance. Conclusions: Postmenopausal women with breast cancer are at increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus, independent of receiving hormone therapy, and should be closely monitored to establish an early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for improving related outcomes. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Current status of congregate meal services for elderly people and self-perceived benefits of the participants by using Taipei City as an example","2019","Objectives: To investigate the status of congregate meal services and understand the benefits of participation on congregate meal services and the associated factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The participants were the providers and users at congregate meal service sites. We collected data by using stratified proportionate cluster sampling and face-to-face interviews using self-developed structured questionnaire as a tool. Hierarchical linear models were used to identify factors associated with participation. Results: We obtained questionnaire responses from 35 provider (response rate, 94.6%) and 613 user questionnaire (response rate, 69.6%); 89% sites provided services less than 3 days per week. The average scores of self-perceived benefits of users on psychological and social dimensions were higher than the physiological dimensions. Those with higher participation frequency had higher self-perceived benefit scores. In addition, users at the sites providing services more than 3 days per week had higher self-perceived benefit scores. Conclusions: The frequency of participation and that of providing congregate meal services per week are associated with participation benefits. We suggest that Taiwan government to encourage and subsidize congregate meal service sites to increase the service frequency to up to 5 days a week and thus improve the self-perceived benefits of the users. ? 2019 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

"Protein arginine methyltransferases: insights into the enzyme structure and mechanism at the atomic level","2019","Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze the methyl transfer to the arginine residues of protein substrates and are classified into three major types based on the final form of the methylated arginine. Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between PRMT expression level and the prognosis of cancer patients. Currently, crystal structures of eight PRMT members have been determined. Kinetic and structural studies have shown that all PRMTs share similar, but unique catalytic and substrate recognition mechanism. In this review, we discuss the structural similarities and differences of different PRMT members, focusing on their overall structure, S-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding pocket, substrate arginine recognition and catalytic mechanisms. Since PRMTs are valuable targets for drug discovery, we also rationally classify the known PRMT inhibitors into five classes and discuss their mechanisms of action at the atomic level. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","epz 015666; epz 0220411; lly 283; methyltransferase inhibitor; PRMT1 protein; PRMT2 protein; PRMT3 protein; PRMT4 protein; PRMT5 protein; PRMT6 protein; PRMT7 protein; PRMT8 protein; PRMT9 protein; protein arginine methyltransferase; s adenosylmethionine; unclassified drug; arginine; enzyme inhibitor; isoprotein; protein arginine methyltransferase; alpha helix; amino terminal sequence; beta sheet; binding site; cancer prognosis; complex formation; conformational transition; crystal structure; deprotonation; dimerization; human; hydrogen bond; mantle cell lymphoma; nonhuman; oligomerization; protein binding; protein methylation; protein motif; protein secondary structure; Review; sequence alignment; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; enzyme active site; enzyme specificity; metabolism; methylation; Arginine; Binding Sites; Catalytic Domain; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Methylation; Protein Isoforms; Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases; Substrate Specificity"
"Assessing human exposure risk and lung disease burden posed by airborne silver nanoparticles emitted by consumer spray products","2019","Background: No systematic investigations have been conducted to assess the lung burden imposed by the chronic inhalation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) emitted by spray products. Objective: The objective of this study was to formulate a study framework that integrates a probabilistic risk assessment scheme with a mechanistic lung burden model for the estimation of health risks associated with the long-term inhalation of AgNP-containing spray products. Materials and methods: A compartmentalized physiologically based alveolar deposition (PBAD) model was used to estimate AgNP lung burden. Dose-response relationships were established using nanotoxicity data sets obtained from rats (as a model organism). Weibull model-based thresholds of AgNP lung burden based on neutrophil-elevated inflammation biomarkers were estimated from Hill-based exposure-response relationships. Finally, the risks of lung disease posed by various AgNP-containing spray products were assessed. Results: Conservative thresholds for the prevention of pulmonary disease were estimated as follows (mean ± SE): 34 nm AgNPs (0.32±0.22 mg) and 60 nm AgNPs (1.08±0.64 mg). Our results indicate that the risk probability was ~0.5 that the hazard quotient (HQ) estimates of deodorant with a count median diameter (CMD) ?30 nm exceeded 1. The primary risk posed by AgNPs is transferred from the interstitial region to lymph nodes. Under the condition of 50% risk probability, the 97.5 percentile of HQ for the spray products were as follows: CMD ?30 nm (~3.4) and CMD ?60 nm (~1.1). Conclusion: Our application of the proposed risk assessment scheme to the results obtained in an in vivo animal model proved highly effective in elucidating the relationship between the characteristics of metallic NP-containing spray products and their corresponding toxicity. The integration of the proposed PBAD model with a risk assessment framework enables the rapid assessment of risk posed by spray products containing metallic NPs over various time scales. ? 2019 Yang et al.","deodorant agent; silver nanoparticle; metal nanoparticle; silver; airborne particle; animal experiment; animal model; Article; disease association; hazard assessment; human; human cell; human tissue; inflammation; inhalation; lung burden; lung interstitium; lymph node; male; nanotoxicology; neutrophil; nonhuman; patient risk; rat; risk assessment; toxicity testing; aerosol; analysis; animal; environmental exposure; inhalational drug administration; lung; lung disease; metabolism; particle size; theoretical model; Administration, Inhalation; Aerosols; Animals; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Lung; Lung Diseases; Metal Nanoparticles; Models, Theoretical; Particle Size; Rats; Risk Assessment; Silver"
"An Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase I, Dose Escalation Study with Phase II Expansion Cohort to Determine the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Antitumor Activity of Intravenous TKM-080301 in Subjects with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma","2019","Lessons Learned: TKM-080301 showed a favorable toxicity profile at the studied dose. TKM-080301 targeting PLK1 through small interfering RNA mechanism did not demonstrate improved overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma compared with historical control. Preliminary antitumor activity as shown in this early-phase study does not support further evaluation as a single agent. Background: Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Knockdown of PLK1 expression by PLK1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) in an HCC cell line showed reduced expression in RNA-induced silencing complex and a reduction in cell proliferation. Methods: A 3 + 3 dose escalation plus expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was implemented. Patients with HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ?2, and Child-Pugh score A received TKM-080301 as an intravenous infusion once every week for 3 consecutive weeks, repeated every 28 days. Results: The study enrolled 43 patients. The starting dose of TKM-080301 was 0.3 mg/kg, and MTD was declared at 0.75 mg/kg. Following the development of grade 4 thrombocytopenia in two subjects on the expansion cohort, the MTD was redefined at 0.6 mg/kg. Four patients did not have any evaluable postbaseline scan. Of the other 39 subjects who had received at least 0.3 mg/kg, 18 subjects (46.2%) had stable disease (SD) by independent RECIST 1.1 criteria. By Choi criteria, eight subjects (23.1%) had a partial response (PR). For 37 assessable subjects, with 2 subjects censored, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.04 months. Median survival for the whole study population was 7.5 months. Conclusion: TKM-080301 was generally well tolerated. In this early-phase study, antitumor effect for TKM 080301 was limited.

"Prediction of pneumoconiosis by serum and urinary biomarkers in workers exposed to asbestos-contaminated minerals","2019","Workers processing nephrite, antigorite, or talc may be exposed to paragenetic asbestos minerals. An effective screening method for pneumoconiosis in workers exposed to asbestos-contaminated minerals is still lacking. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of serum and urinary biomarkers for pneumoconiosis in workers exposed to asbestos-contaminated minerals. We conducted a case-control study in a cohort of stone craft workers in Hualien, where asbestos, nephrite, antigorite, and talc are produced. A total of 140 subjects were screened between March 2013 and July 2014. All subjects received a questionnaire survey and a health examination that included a physical examination; chest X-ray; and tests for standard pulmonary function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, serum soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP), fibulin-3, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and urinary 8-Oxo-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)/creatinine. After excluding subjects with uraemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we included 48 subjects with pneumoconiosis and 90 control subjects without pneumoconiosis for analysis. In terms of occupational history, 43/48 (90%) case subjects and 68% (61/90) of the control subjects had processed asbestos-contaminated minerals, including nephrite, antigorite, and talc. The case group had decreased pulmonary function in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC. The levels of SMRP, fibulin-3, urinary 8-OHdG/creatinine, and CEA were higher in the case group than in the control group. Subjects exposed to nephrite had significantly higher SMRP levels (0.84 ± 0.52 nM) than subjects exposed to other types of minerals (0.60 ± 0.30 nM). A dose-response relationship was observed between the SMRP level and the severity of pneumoconiosis. Machine learning algorithms, including variables of sex, age, SMRP, fibu-lin-3, CEA, and 8-OHdG/creatinine, can predict pneumoconiosis with high accuracy. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.7 to 1.0. We suggest that SMRP and fibulin-3 could be used as biomarkers of pneumoconiosis in workers exposed to asbestos-contaminated minerals. ? 2019 Hsiao-Yu Yang.

"A performance guide for major risk factors control in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in Taiwan","2019","Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease, carries a high morbidity and mortality. Risk factor control is especially important for patients with ASCVD to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines have been developed by the Taiwan Society of Cardiology, Taiwan Society of Lipids and Atherosclerosis, and Diabetes Association of Republic of China (Taiwan)to assist health care professionals in Taiwan about the control of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus. This article is to highlight the recommendations about blood pressure, cholesterol, and sugar control for ASCVD. Some medications that are beneficial for ASCVD were also reviewed. We hope the clinical outcomes of ASCVD can be improved in Taiwan through the implementation of these recommendations. ? 2019",""
"Hypoxia-induced H19/YB-1 cascade modulates cardiac remodeling after infarction","2019","Rationale: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) has been identified as a pivotal novel regulators in cardiac development as well as cardiac pathogenesis. lncRNA H19 is known as a fetal gene but it is exclusively abundant in the heart and skeletal muscles in adulthood, and is evolutionarily conserved in humans and mice. It has been reported to possess a significant correlation with the risk of coronary artery diseases. However, the function of H19 is not well characterized in heart. Methods: Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mouse models with left anterior descending coronary artery-ligation surgery were utilized to evaluate the functionality of H19 in vivo. For mechanistic studies, hypoxia condition were exerted in in vitro models to mimic cardiac ischemic injury. Chromatin isolation by RNA immunoprecipitation (ChIRP) was performed to reveal the interacting protein of lncRNA H19. Results: lncRNA H19 was significantly upregulated in the infarct area post-surgery day 4 in mouse model. Ectopic expression of H19 in the mouse heart resulted in severe cardiac dilation and fibrosis. Several extracellular matrix (ECM) genes were significantly upregulated. While genetic ablation of H19 by CRISPR-Cas9 ameliorated post-MI cardiac remodeling with reduced expression in ECM genes. Through chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP), we identified Y-box-binding protein (YB)-1, a suppressor of Collagen 1A1, as an interacting protein of H19. Furthermore, H19 acted to antagonize YB-1 through direct interaction under hypoxia, which resulted in de-repression of Collagen 1A1 expression and cardiac fibrosis. Conclusions: Together these results demonstrate that lncRNA H19 and its interacting protein YB-1 are crucial for ECM regulation during cardiac remodeling. ?

"Evaluation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant 56-kDa type-specific antigens derived from multiple orientia tsutsugamushi strains for detection of scrub typhus infection","2019","Scrub typhus is caused by the intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi. The 56-kDa type-specific antigen (TSA) displays a significant antigenic variation across different O. tsutsugamushi strains. To minimize the influence of the antigenic diversity of TSA on assay sensitivity, we developed a mixed-TSA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (mixed-TSA ELISA) using a mixture of recombinant TSAs of prototype (Karp, Gilliam, and Kato) and local (TW-1, TW-10, TW-19, and TW-22) O. tsutsugamushi strains as antigens to detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against O. tsutsugamushi. These four local strains covered a major part of the total genetic diversity of TSA gene of O. tsutsugamushi in Taiwan. A total of 109 acute-phase serum samples from O. tsutsugamushi polymerase chain reaction–positive, scrub typhus patients, and 82 negative control serum samples from non-scrub typhus cases were used for evaluation of the recombinant TSA-based ELISA. We compared the performance of the mixed-TSA ELISA with immunofluorescence assay (IFA), which is considered the gold standard method for the serological diagnosis of scrub typhus. The results indicated that the sensitivity of IgM mixed-TSA ELISA (80.7%) was significantly higher than that of IgM IFA (68.8%). We demonstrated that the mixed-TSA ELISA had a high sensitivity and specificity and can be used for screening of scrub typhus patient in the early phase of the disease.

"Mixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma of the lung: A case report of a novel mutation in the BRAF gene and coexistent HPV infection, possible relationship to ciliated muconodular papillary tumor","2019","Mixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma (mixed papilloma) is a very rare tumor, with fewer than 25 cases having been reported in the literature. Although a scattering of cases of p16 Ink4a overexpression have been described to date, no human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA has been detected in these tumors, either by in situ hybridization (ISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This is the first case of mixed papilloma with PCR-confirmed HPV genotype 16, 35, 51 infections in an 18-year-old non-smoking male, coexisting with multiple atypical adenomatous hyperplasias (AAHs). Histologically, this tumor shows a predominant papillary architecture, covered by a mixture of stratified squamous cells, ciliated or non-ciliated cuboidal to columnar cells, mucous cells, and scattered goblet cells. Immunohistochemically, the squamous component was positive for p40, and the glandular cells were focally positive for TTF-1. Both components were diffusely immunoreactive to CK7. In addition, BRAF V600E mutation was also first demonstrated in mixed papilloma, but not in the AAHs. These findings suggest that HPV infection and the BRAF mutation may be important in the pathogenetic role in young non-smoking patients. ? 2019 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","B Raf kinase; cytokeratin 7; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; homeobox protein Nkx 2.1; mucin; protein p16; protein p40; virus DNA; B Raf kinase; BRAF protein, human; acute disease; adult; Article; case report; cellular distribution; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; cross reaction; disease association; follow up; gastritis; gene mutation; human; Human papillomavirus type 16; Human papillomavirus type 35; Human papillomavirus type 51; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; incidental finding; left lung; lung adenoma; lung carcinogenesis; lung infection; male; mixed squamous cell glandular papilloma; mixed tumor; molecular pathology; papilloma; papillomavirus infection; postoperative period; priority journal; squamous cell; squamous cell lung carcinoma; thorax radiography; tumor volume; virus detection; wedge resection; young adult; adolescent; complication; genetics; lung tumor; mutation; papilloma; papillomavirus infection; pathology; squamous cell carcinoma; virology; Adolescent; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mutation; Papilloma; Papillomavirus Infections; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf"
"Crosssectional Assessment of Bone Mass Density in Adults with Hepatitis B Virus and Hepatitis C Virus Infection","2019","Osteoporosis is one of the major complications in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) infection. However, few studies had examined the relationship between hepatic viral infection with bone loss. Our aim was to investigate the association between hepatic viral infection with bone mineral density (BMD) in a cross-sectional study. Participants who attended the health examinations at the Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH), Taiwan, were enrolled in the study. Diagnosis of viral hepatitis was confirmed by the serum viral markers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV, and BMD measurement was performed by the bone densitometry. Subjects were divided into four groups by the presence of viral markers. The association between hepatic viral infection and BMD was examined by a multivariate linear regression model. HBV infection was inversely associated with BMD after full adjusting with β values of ?0.17 (95% CI: ?0.29, ?0.05) (p < 0.05). The relationship remained significant in males (β = ?0.16, 95% CI = ?0.31, ?0.01) (p < 0.05). In subjects with body mass index less than 30 HBV infection was associated with reduced BMD (β = ?0.16, 95% CI = ?0.29, ?0.02) (p < 0.05). However, HCV infection was only associated with an increase in BMD in patients with BMI less than 30 (β = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.21, 0.32) (p < 0.05). Chronic HBV infection was significantly associated with reduced BMD in males. The impact of viral hepatitis on bone health deserves further investigation for the potential pathophysiological mechanisms. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Effects of clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors on cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after bare metal stent implantation: A nationwide cohort study","2019","Background: To investigate whether there is an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with diabetes associated with adding proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to clopidogrel (CLO) therapy after bare-metal stent (BMS) deployment. Methods: We used the National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct this retrospective cohort study. We enrolled 6,757 patients with diabetes who underwent BMS deployment and received CLO with/without PPIs for 90 days (6,243 in the CLO subgroup and 514 in the CLO plus PPI subgroup). The endpoints were acute coronary syndrome and re-admission for revascularization (PCI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery) after 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: The patients who received CLO with PPIs had no significant increase in adverse CV events compared to those without PPIs within 1 year after BMS deployment [3-month hazard ratio (HR) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65-1.15; 6 months, HR = 0.95, 95% CI, 0.78-1.15; 1 year, HR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.81-1.12]. Conclusions: In patients with diabetes undergoing BMS deployment, there was no evidence of an increased risk of CV events among concomitant users of CLO and PPIs. Our results indicate that the use of PPIs may not modify the protective effect of CLO after BMS implantation. ? 2019, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

Metabolic health criteria were derived from the Harmonized criteria (unhealthy if showing abnormality in one or two MetS components) and the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG-i; unhealthy if TyG-i was in the >75th percentile). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimations for having ?1 MetS component and for having each MetS component in 5 years were assessed using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. We observed a significantly increased likelihood of the presence of ?1 MetS component in the unhealthy group by using the Harmonized criteria and TyG-i (adjusted OR (aOR); 95%CI: 2.64; 2.02-3.45 and 2.1; 1.57–2.82, respectively). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristics curves were 0.679 and 0.652 for the final models using Harmonized and TyG-i criteria, respectively. These findings support the recommendation of treating any metabolic component abnormality, even in young adults without a MetS diagnosis. View Full-Text ? 2019 by the authors.

"Inadequate prenatal care utilization among women with and without methadone-treated opioid use disorders in Taiwan","2019","Aims: The present study aims to investigate the utilization pattern of prenatal care and correlates for women with opioid use disorders (OUD) in Taiwan. Method: Using the data linkage between the Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) register with national health insurance, national birth notification system, and birth registration system, we identified 1712 pregnancies with 20 or more gestational weeks from women enrolled in the MMT (heroin-exposed: receiving no methadone treatment during pregnancy, n = 1053 by 882 women; methadone-treated: receiving methadone for at least one day during pregnancy, n = 659 by 574 women) and their 1:10 matched pregnancies from 17,060 women without substance use disorder in the period of 2004-2013. The generalized linear mixed models with negative binomial and logit distributions were performed to evaluate the relationship between individual sociodemographic, health, and addiction treatment characteristics with the number of prenatal visits and receiving prenatal care in the first trimester (i.e., early entry). Findings: Eighteen percent of pregnancies by women with OUD received no prenatal services and 21% had started prenatal care in the first trimester as compared with 1% and 46% in pregnancies by women without substance use disorders. For pregnancies by women with OUD, methadone treatment was not linked associated with prenatal care visits (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.02; 95% = 0.92, 1.12). For methadone-treated pregnancies, treatment enrollment before pregnancy and spousal methadone treatment elevated prenatal visits by 8% and 18% (0.48 and 1.08 visits, respectively). Additionally, HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.10, 0.83) and prior delivery (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.19) significantly reduced the odds of early entry into prenatal care. Conclusion: Integrating addiction treatment programs with prenatal care is urgently needed to increase adequate prenatal care for pregnant women with OUD, especially the multiparous ones. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","methadone; adult; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlational study; female; first trimester pregnancy; health care utilization; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; marriage; maternal age; obstetric delivery; opiate addiction; outpatient; prenatal care; priority journal; retrospective study; risk; Taiwan; unemployment; urban area"
"In vivo imaging of insulin-secreting human pancreatic ductal cells using MRI reporter gene technique: A feasibility study","2019","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of in vivo imaging of human pancreatic ductal cells by OATP1B3 reporter gene under MRI. Methods: A human cell line (PANC-1) derived from the pancreatic ductal epithelium was used in this study. After transduction of OATP1B3, the cellular physiological functions and the ability of intracellular uptake of the MRI contrast medium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) were examined. Induced differentiation of the PANC-1 cells into hormone-secreting cells were performed to simulate pancreatic β-like cells. The hormone-secreting cells were implanted into rats and in vivo MRI was evaluated. Results: The mRNA and proteins of OATP1B3 were highly expressed. No significant change of cellular physiological functions was found after the expression. After induced differentiation, the hormone secretion capacities of the OATP1B3-expressing PANC-1 cells were confirmed. Intra-cellular uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA was determined in vitro by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and MRI. In vivo MRI of the OATP1B3-expressing xenograft revealed an increased signal intensity after contrast enhancement. Conclusion: OATP1B3 can be used as a safe and feasible in vivo MRI gene reporter for human pancreatic ductal cells. ? 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","gadoxetic acid; messenger RNA; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B3; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell differentiation; cell function; contrast enhancement; controlled study; feasibility study; female; gene expression; genetic transduction; hormone release; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; OATP1B3 gene; PANC-1 cell line; protein expression; reporter gene; tumor xenograft"
"Gender Variance and the Autism Spectrum: An Examination of Children Ages 6–12 Years","2019","Gender variance (GV) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently co-occur in clinical populations. We investigated GV in association with ASD characteristics in nonclinical children and in children with developmental/mental health diagnoses. In 6–12-year-olds (N = 2445; 51% birth-assigned boys), the Gender Identity Questionnaire for Children measured GV and the Children’s Social Behavior Questionnaire measured six subdomains of ASD characteristics. Among nonclinical children, GV was associated with parent-reported difficulties orienting socially and stereotyped behaviors. GV was also associated with parent-reported clinical diagnoses of ASD, sensory processing disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder. These findings suggest associations between specific ASD characteristics and GV in nonclinical children. Also, childhood GV should be further examined in a range of clinical populations, including ASD individuals. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","academic achievement; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit disorder; auditory processing disorder; autism; child; developmental coordination disorder; developmental delay; female; fetal alcohol syndrome; gender identity; Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; human; learning disorder; major clinical study; male; mood disorder; obsessive compulsive disorder; oppositional defiant disorder; preschool child; priority journal; school child; sex difference; sexual orientation; social behavior; speech sound disorder; stereotypy; wellbeing; attention deficit disorder; autism; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; physiology; psychology; questionnaire; sensory dysfunction; transgender; Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Parents; Sensation Disorders; Stereotyped Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transgender Persons"
"Prophage excision in streptococcus pneumoniaeserotype 19A ST320 promote colonization: Insight into its evolution from the ancestral clone Taiwan 19F-14 (ST236)","2019","Streptococcus pneumoniae 19A ST320, a multidrug-resistant strain with high disease severity that notoriously spread before the use of expanded pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, was derived from a capsular switching event between an international strain Taiwan 19F-14 (ST236) and a serotype 19A strain. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive evolution of 19F ST236 to 19A ST320 are unknown. In this study, we compared 19A ST320 to its ancestral clone, 19F ST236, in terms of adherence to respiratory epithelial cells, whole transcriptome, and ability to colonize a young mouse model. Serotype 19A ST320 showed five-fold higher adherence to A549 cells than serotype 19F ST236. High-throughput mRNA sequencing identified a prophage region located between dnaN and ychF in both strains; however, the genes in this region were expressed at significantly higher levels in 19A ST320 than in 19F ST236. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that the prophage is able to spontaneously excise from the chromosome and form a circular episome in 19A ST320, but not in 19F ST236. Deletion of the integrase in the prophage of 19A ST320 decreased spontaneous excision and cell adherence, which were restored by complementation. Competition experiments in mice showed that the integrase mutant was six-fold less competitive than the 19A ST320 parent (competitive index [CI]: 0.16; p = 0.02). The 19A ST320 prophage-deleted strain did not change cell adherence capacity, whereas prophage integration strains (integrase mutant and 19F) had decreased expression of the down-stream ychF gene compared to that of 19A ST320. Further deletion of ychF significantly reduced cell adherence. In conclusions, these findings suggest that spontaneous prophage induction confers a competitive advantage to virulent pneumococci. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Trends in pesticide suicide in South Korea, 1983-2014","2019","AimsSelf-poisoning using pesticides is among the major methods of suicide worldwide, and accounts for one-fifth of suicides in 2006-2010 in South Korea. We investigated long-term trends in pesticide suicide rates in South Korea and factors related to these trends.MethodsWe calculated age-standardised rates of pesticide suicide in South Korea (1983-2014) using registered death data. We used graphical approach and joinpoint regression analysis to examine secular trends in pesticide suicide by sex, age and area, and a time-series analysis to investigate association of pesticide suicide rate with socioeconomic and agriculture-related factors. Age, period and cohort effects were examined using the intrinsic estimator method.ResultsAge-standardised rate of pesticide suicide fluctuated between 1983 and 2000 before it markedly increased in 2000-2003 (annual percent change 29.7%), followed by a gradual fall (annual percent change ?'6.3%) in 2003-2011. Following the paraquat ban (2011-2012), there was a marked reduction (annual percent change ?'28.2%) in 2011-2014. Trend in pesticide suicide was associated with divorce rate but not with other factors studied. Declines in pesticide suicide in 2003-2011 were most noticeable in younger groups and metropolises; by contrast, elderly adults aged 70+ living in rural areas showed an upward trend until after the 2011-2012 paraquat ban, when it turned downward. In the age-period-cohort modelling, having been born between 1938 and 1947 was associated with higher pesticide suicide rates.ConclusionsPesticide suicide trend changed substantially in South Korea over the last three decades. Effective prevention should include close monitoring of trends and strong regulations of toxic pesticides. ? 2019 Cambridge University Press.",""
"Comparison of two-and three-dimensional nuclear to cytoplasm ratios in analyzing lung cancer cell lines","2019","Histological examination has been the primary imaging modality in the diagnosis of eases such as cancer. However, since cells are three-dimensional in nature, the use of traditional nucleus to cytoplasm ratio (N/C) in two dimensions does not represent their three-dimensional structures. In this study, we used two-photon microscopy to acquired threedimensional images of normal human lung cell line Beas2B, human lung adenocarcinoma CL1-0 and CL1-5 cell lines. We determined N/C ratios in two-and three-dimensions and found that 2D N/C-ratio is more precise than 3D N/C-ratio in discriminating normal and cancer cells. ? 2019 SPIE.","Biological organs; Biomolecules; Cell culture; Diseases; Histology; Photons; Respiratory system; Tissue; Histological examination; Lung adecarcinoma; Lung cancer cells; Nucleus to cytoplasm ration; Three dimensional images; Three-dimensional structure; Two photon; Two photon microscopy; Cells"
"Outcomes of Kawasaki disease children with spontaneous defervescence within 10 days","2019","Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is one of the most common vasculitis in childhood. Intravenous γ-immunoglobulin (IVIG) is recommended to be administrated within 10 days after fever onset. However, some patients didn't have IVIG therapies because of atypical disease presentations or spontaneous defervescence. We aimed to evaluate the coronary outcomes of the KD patients who didn't receive IVIG and had defervescence within 10 days. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the KD patients in NTUCH between 2008 and 2015. The patients with a diagnosis of KD and had a febrile length between 5 to 10 days were enrolled. Days of fever, clinical symptoms, laboratory data at the acute stage and series of coronary artery measurements within a minimum of 3 months after disease onset were recorded. Risk factors associated with coronary lesions one month after KD onset were also analyzed. Results 293 eligible KD patients were enrolled (Male: 55.1%, mean age of onset: 1.8 years old). 37 patients had spontaneous defervescence without IVIG treatment. The incidence of coronary aneurysms at the 4th week after disease onset was higher in spontaneously defervesced KD patients than those treated with IVIG (18.9% vs. 20.3%, p = 0.002). Interestingly, of the 238 KD patients without coronary lesions at their acute phase, percentages of emerging coronary aneurysms became significantly higher if they didn't have IVIG therapies due to spontaneous defervescence (4/31), compared with those who received IVIG (3/208). Further analysis showed the development of coronary lesions at one month after disease onset was associated with younger age (< 12 months old, p = 0.024), and leukocytosis (WBC > 17,000/cumm, p = 0.031). Conclusions: 18.9% of KD patients with spontaneous defervescence had coronary aneurysms. Even without initial coronary lesions, such patients were still riskier to develop coronary aneurysms, compared with KD patients who received IVIG therapies. Such findings address the importance of refining the strategy for use of IVIG in the spontaneously defervesced KD patients within 10 days after fever onset, at least in those with age younger than one year and those with leukocytosis. ? 2019 Hu, Liu, Lin, Chen, Chiu, Lu, Chang, Wang and Wu.","aspartate aminotransferase; C reactive protein; hemoglobin; immunoglobulin; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; child; clinical feature; clinical outcome; comparative study; controlled study; coronary artery; coronary artery aneurysm; coronary artery disease; female; fever; hemoglobin blood level; human; incidence; left anterior descending coronary artery; left coronary artery; leukocytosis; major clinical study; male; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; onset age; preschool child; retrospective study; risk factor"
"Reduction in MnSOD promotes the migration and invasion of squamous carcinoma cells","2019","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis is maintained at a higher level in cancer cells, which promotes tumorigenesis. Oxidative stress induced by anticancer drugs may further increase ROS to promote apoptosis, but can also enhance the metastasis of cancer cells. The effects of ROS homeostasis on cancer cells remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the effect of a reduction in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) on the migration and invasion of A431 cells was investigated. Our previous micro-assay data revealed that the mRNA expression of MnSOD was higher in the invasive A431-III cell line compared with that in the parental A431 cell line (A431-P). In the present study, high protein levels of MnSOD and H 2 O 2 production were observed in A431-III cells; however, catalase protein levels were significantly lower in A431-III cells compared with those in the A431-P cell line. The knockdown of MnSOD increased H 2 O 2 levels, enzyme activity, the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1, -2 and -9, and the migratory and invasive abilities of the cells. Inducing a reduction in H 2 O 2 using diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and N.acetyl-l-cysteine decreased the migratory abilities of the cell lines, and DPI attenuated the migratory ability that had been increased by MnSOD small interfering RNA knockdown. Luteolin (Lu) and quercetin (Qu) increased the expression of catalase and reduced H 2 O 2 levels, but without an observed change in the protein levels of MnSOD. Taken together, these data suggest that reduced MnSOD may induce ROS imbalance in cells and promote the metastatic ability of cancer cells. Lu and Qu may attenuate these processes and may be promising potential anticancer agents. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"The effect of radial pulse spectrum on the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes","2019","Radial pulse spectrum has been shown to correlate with coronary stenosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In academia, it has not been demonstrated that the radial artery pulse spectrum is an independent risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality. The primary objective of this study is to assess the risk of MACE, in patients with T2DM and to determine if an increase in MACE would be associated with a first harmonic (C1) increase in the radial artery pulse. 1972 consecutive patients with T2DM were enrolled. All subjects received measurements of radial pulse waves at baseline. Harmonic analysis of radial pressure wave was performed. The hazard ratios for MACE and its 95% confident interval were estimated using Cox proportional hazard model. The follow-up period lasted for one year. MACE was detected in 232 (11.8%) of those with T2DM. The log-rank test demonstrated that the cumulative incidence of patients with C1 above 0.96 was greater than those with C1 bellow 0.96. Comparing the patients with C1 smaller than first quartile to the patients with C1 greater than third quartile, higher C1 increased the cardiovascular risks as follows: MACE (Hazard ratio,1.93; 95% CI,1.31–2.86), stroke (Hazard ratio, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.90–2.90), myocardial infarction (Hazard ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.33–3.74). The risk for the composite MACE increased continuously as C1 increased (P < 0.001 for trend). The hazard ratio and trend for all-cause mortality were not significant. Increased C1 resulted in increased risk for nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal myocardial infarction among patients with T2DM. Our results indicate that the degree of C1 is a risk factor for nonfatal MACE. Therefore, the radial pulse spectrum could identify patients with T2DM at high risk of nonfatal MACE. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cardiac patient; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; coronary artery obstruction; correlational study; diabetic patient; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; disease severity; female; follow up; heart infarction; human; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; medical history; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; physical examination; priority journal; proportional hazards model; pulse rate; pulse wave; radial artery; radial pulse spectrum; systolic blood pressure"
"Crohn's disease initiated with extraintestinal features","2019","Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial, chronic immune-mediated disorder. The oral cavity is involved in 0.5% to 20% of the patients with CD. Oral manifestations of CD are sometimes nonspecific and can be overlooked by the clinicians. These manifestations may precede intestinal symptoms and can serve as indicators for early diagnosis. To increase awareness and to contribute to the standard intervention, here we report a paediatric case with persistent idiopathic swelling of the lower lip and perianal fistula. Microscopic examinations revealed multiple non-necrotising granulomas with chronic inflammation, oedema and lymphangiectasia. The patient was treated with metronidazole 500 mg and ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for one month. The perioral lesions were managed with topical 0.03% tacrolimus and oral prednisone 10 mgtwice a day for one month, followed by a tapered regimen of 10 mg/day for another month.

"Effectiveness of Treatments for Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer With Exon 20 Insertion Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations","2019","Background: Two main categories of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are deletions in exon 19 and L858R in exon 21. Treatments of advanced NSCLC patients with these mutations are well documented, and clinical responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are favorable. However, effective treatments for patients with exon 20 insertion mutations are not well verified. We investigated the clinical response to various treatments (chemotherapy and TKIs) of advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions. Patients and Methods: In this study, specimens from 3805 NSCLC patients were examined for EGFR mutations. Different first-line treatments and their effectiveness in NSCLC patients with exon 20 insertion EGFR mutations were investigated. Results: In the cohort of the 3805 patients, 2112 (55.5%) had EGFR mutations, including 84 patients (4.0%) with exon 20 insertion mutations. Efficacy of different first-line chemotherapy or TKIs were evaluated. Pemetrexed-containing therapies were related to better progression-free survival (6.2 vs. 2.7 months; P < .001) and overall survival (28.0 vs. 15.4 months; P = .009) than regimens without pemetrexed. Patients with exon 20 insertions had a poor response to TKIs. However, the mutation Ala763_Tyr764insPheGlnGluAla (A763_Y764 insFQEA) was related to a favorable response to TKIs. Conclusion: Exon 20 insertion EGFR mutations comprised a considerable group of the entire population of patients with EGFR mutations. Different first-line treatments and variants of the exon 20 insertions might be related to different outcomes in advanced NSCLC patients. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.There are no approved effective treatments in advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with exon 20 insertion epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.

"Cardiac characteristics and natural progression in Taiwanese patients with mucopolysaccharidosis III","2019","Background: Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), or Sanfilippo syndrome, is caused by a deficiency in one of the four enzymes involved in the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate. Cardiac abnormalities have been observed in patients with all types of MPS except MPS IX, however few studies have focused on cardiac alterations in patients with MPS III. Methods: We reviewed medical records, echocardiograms, and electrocardiograms of 26 Taiwanese patients with MPS III (five with IIIA, 20 with IIIB, and one with IIIC; 14 males and 12 females; median age, 7.4 years; age range, 1.8-26.5 years). The relationships between age and each echocardiographic parameter were analyzed. Results: Echocardiographic examinations (n = 26) revealed that 10 patients (38%) had valvular heart disease. Four (15%) and eight (31%) patients had valvular stenosis or regurgitation, respectively. The most prevalent cardiac valve abnormality was mitral regurgitation (31%), followed by aortic regurgitation (19%). However, most of the cases of valvular heart disease were mild. Three (12%), five (19%) and five (19%) patients had mitral valve prolapse, a thickened interventricular septum, and asymmetric septal hypertrophy, respectively. The severity of aortic regurgitation and the existence of valvular heart disease, aortic valve abnormalities and valvular stenosis were all positively correlated with increasing age (p < 0.05). Z scores > 2 were identified in 0, 38, 8, and 27% of left ventricular mass index, interventricular septal end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular posterior wall end-diastolic dimension, and aortic diameter, respectively. Electrocardiograms in 11 patients revealed the presence of sinus arrhythmia (n = 3), sinus bradycardia (n = 2), and sinus tachycardia (n = 1). Six patients with MPS IIIB had follow-up echocardiographic data at 1.9-18.1 years to compare with the baseline data, which showed some patients had increased thickness of the interventricular septum, as well as more patients had valvular abnormalities at follow-up. Conclusions: Cardiac involvement in MPS III is less common and milder compared with other types of MPS. The existence of valvular heart disease, aortic valve abnormalities and valvular stenosis in the patients worsened with increasing age, reinforcing the concept of the progressive nature of this disease. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; adult; age distribution; aging; aorta; aortic regurgitation; Article; cardiovascular parameters; child; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; disease course; disease severity; echocardiography; electrocardiography; female; follow up; heart disease; heart hypertrophy; heart left ventricle mass; heart left ventricle posterior wall enddiastolic dimension; heart valve stenosis; heart ventricle septum defect; human; interventricular septum end diastolic dimension; interventricular septum hypertrophy; male; medical record review; mitral valve prolapse; mitral valve regurgitation; preschool child; retrospective study; Sanfilippo syndrome; school child; sinus arrhythmia; sinus bradycardia; sinus tachycardia; Taiwanese; valvular heart disease; young adult"
"Muscle radiodensity loss during cancer therapy is predictive for poor survival in advanced endometrial cancer","2019","Background: Treatment-related toxicities and decreased levels of patient performance during cancer therapy might contribute to body composition changes and thereby impact outcomes. However, the effect of longitudinal body composition changes on outcomes in patients with advanced endometrial cancer is unknown. This study investigated the association between body composition changes during staging surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and outcomes in patients with stage III endometrial cancer. Methods: Pretreatment and post-treatment computed tomography (CT) images of 131 patients with stage III endometrial cancer who were treated between 2008 and 2016 were analysed. All CT images were contrast enhanced and acquired according to the standardized protocol. The skeletal muscle index (SMI), skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD), and total adipose tissue index were measured from two sets of CT images obtained at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. The skeletal muscle gauge was calculated by multiplying SMI by SMD (SMI × SMD). Predictors of overall survival and progression-free survival were identified using Cox regression models. Results: The median follow-up was 50.6 (range 12.1–117.0) months. Overall, body mass index (BMI) changes during treatment were 0.4% per 210 days (95% confidence interval: ?0.6 to 1.4; P = 0.41), and patients experienced an average SMD loss of 2.1% per 210 days (95% confidence interval: ?4.0 to ?0.2; P = 0.03). Weight loss and SMD loss ?5% were observed in 23 (17.6%) and 54 (41.2%) patients, respectively. The changes in SMD did not correlate with those in BMI (Spearman's ρ for SMD, ?0.13; P = 0.13). SMD change (per 1 Hounsfield unit/210 days decrease) was independently associated with poorer overall survival (hazard ratio: 1.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.14–1.52; P < 0.001) and progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.12–1.43; P < 0.001). Our results did not show association between survival and pretreatment myosteatosis and sarcopenia or changes in SMI and total adipose tissue index during treatment. The pretreatment skeletal muscle gauge was associated with treatment modifications such as delays, dose reductions, and discontinuation of chemotherapy.

"Adlay (Coix lachryma-jobi L. Var. Ma-yuen Stapf.) hull extract and active compounds inhibit proliferation of primary human leiomyoma cells and protect against sexual hormone-induced mice smooth muscle hyperproliferation","2019","Uterine leiomyomas, also known as fibroids, are benign neoplasms of the uterus and have a high incidence rate in women of reproductive age. Hysterectomy or myomectomy is the initial treatment, but fibroids will recur if the patient is still exposed to similar risk factors. Therefore, developing new therapeutic strategies are urgently necessary. In this study, the anti-proliferation effects of each fraction of adlay seeds were evaluated in uterine leiomyomas, and we identified the potential phytochemical compounds. We found that the ethyl acetate fraction of adlay hull (AHE-ea) appeared to be highly efficient in the anti-proliferation of rat uterine leiomyoma ELT3 cells and primary human uterine leiomyoma (hUL) cells. The proliferation of primary human normal uterine smooth muscle (UtSMC) and normal uterine myometrial (hUM) cells were also suppressed by AHE-ea. Two phytosterols, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol, were identified from AHE-ea fraction. Mice treated with AHE-ea and stigmasterol alone demonstrated reduced diethylstilbestrol/medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate (DES/MPA)-induced uterine myometrial hyperplasia, which is the critical step for the development of leiomyoma. Taken together, our results suggest that the AHE-ea fraction could be considered as a natural plant-based medicine in the prevention or treatment of uterine leiomyoma growth. ? 2019 by the authors.","diethylstilbestrol; medroxyprogesterone acetate; plant extract; animal; cell proliferation; chemically induced; chemistry; Coix; drug effect; female; human; leiomyoma; mouse; phosphorylation; rat; tumor cell line; uterus cancer; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Coix; Diethylstilbestrol; Female; Humans; Leiomyoma; Medroxyprogesterone Acetate; Mice; Phosphorylation; Plant Extracts; Rats; Uterine Neoplasms"
"Prevention of Vascular Inflammation by Pterostilbene via Trimethylamine-N-Oxide Reduction and Mechanism of Microbiota Regulation","2019","Scope: A gut-microbiota-dependent metabolite of L-carnitine, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), has been recently discovered as an independent and dose-dependent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aims to investigate the effects of pterostilbene on reducing TMAO formation and on decreasing vascular inflammation in carnitine-feeding mice. Methods and results: C57BL/6 mice are treated with 1.3% carnitine in drinking water with or without pterostilbene supplementation. Using LC-MS/MS, the result shows that mice treated with 1.3% carnitine only significantly increased the plasma TMAO and pterostilbene supplementation group can reverse it. Additionally, pterostilbene decreases hepatic flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) mRNA levels compared to carnitine only group. It appears that pterostilbene can alter host physiology and create an intestinal microenvironment favorable for certain gut microbiota. Gut microbiota analysis reveals that pterostilbene increases the abundance of Bacteroides. Further, pterostilbene decreases mRNA levels of vascular inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin). Conclusion: These data suggest that amelioration of carnitine-induced vascular inflammation after consumption of pterostilbene is partially mediated via modulation of gut microbiota composition and hepatic enzyme FMO3 gene expression. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Obliquely-arranged double skin paddles: A novel design to reconstruct extensive head and neck defects with a single fibula or peroneal flap","2019","Objective: To reconstruct extensive head and neck defects usually necessitates double free flaps, which require a time-and-manpower-consuming surgical procedure. We present using a single fibula or peroneal flap with the novel design of obliquely-arranged double skin paddles to reconstruct an extensive head and neck defect. Methods: From 1998 to 2016, eight patients with the age of 52.25 (35–71) years old had extensive head and neck defects after oral cancer ablation. All of the defects were through and through with the size of 16.25 (12–24) cm × 8.8 (4.5–11) cm. Six of the defects were due to buccal cancer. One was due to tongue cancer, and another one was due to gingiva cancer. All the defects were reconstructed with obliquely-arranged double-paddle free fibula or peroneal flaps. The long axis of the skin paddles was arranged at certain angle (30–45 degrees) to the long axis of lower leg, and the two separate skin paddles were used as the form of island flaps by isolating the cutaneous perforators to create a true chimeric flap. Results: The skin paddle sizes were 14 cm × 3 cm–24 cm × 11 cm and 9.5 cm × 4.5 cm–13 cm × 8 cm. The average length of harvested fibula was 19 (10–30) cm. All of the eight flaps survived without obvious donor site morbidity. One patient had partial skin necrosis over recipient site, requiring surgical debridements and closure. One patient had superficial necrosis over the edge of outer skin paddle, which healed spontaneously. After the follow-up periods of 1 month to 3 year and 8 months, two patients died of sepsis. Six of them could resume soft diet and had no saliva drooling. The remaining two remained nasogastric diet and had saliva drooling. Conclusion: With the design of obliquely-arranged double paddles, we may maximize the harvested skin area of lateral lower leg to reconstruct an extensive head and neck defect with a single free flap. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; aged; Article; cause of death; chimeric flap; clinical article; debridement; donor site; fibula graft; follow up; gingiva tumor; graft recipient; head and neck malformation; head and neck surgery; human; hypersalivation; male; mandible resection; medical history; middle aged; morbidity; mouth cancer; mouth cavity; myocutaneous flap; obliquely arranged double skin paddle; peroneal flap; peroneus muscle; priority journal; sepsis; skin island flap; skin necrosis; soft diet; surgical technique; tongue cancer; wide excision; wound closure; cohort analysis; convalescence; esthetics; female; fibula; free tissue graft; head and neck tumor; mortality; neck dissection; pathology; physiology; procedures; quality of life; reconstructive surgery; retrospective study; risk assessment; skin transplantation; surgery; survival rate; transplantation; treatment outcome; vascularization; wound healing; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Esthetics; Female; Fibula; Free Tissue Flaps; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neck Dissection; Quality of Life; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Skin Transplantation; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; Wound Healing"
"Determinants of satisfactory patient communication and shared decision making in patients with multiple myeloma","2019","Objective: To identify determinants of shared decision making in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) to facilitate the design of a program to maximize the effects of shared decision making. Methods: This prospective longitudinal study recruited 276 adult patients (52% male, mean age 62.86 y, SD 15.45). Each patient completed the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS), Multidimensional Trust in Health Care Systems Scale (MTHCSS), Patient Communication Pattern Scale (PCPS), and 9-Item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) at baseline and the SDM-Q-9 again 6 months later. One family member of the patient completed the Family Decision-Making Self-Efficacy (FDMSE) at baseline. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the associations between eHealth literacy (eHEALS), trust in the health care system (MTHCSS), self-efficacy in family decision making (FDMSE), patient communication pattern (PCPS), and shared decision making (SDM-Q-9). Results: SEM showed satisfactory fit (comparative fit index = 0.988) and significant correlations between the following: eHealth literacy and trust in the health care system (β = 0.723, P < 0.001); eHealth literacy and patient communication pattern (β = 0.242, P < 0.001); trust in the health care system and patient communication pattern (β = 0.397, P < 0.001); self-efficacy in family decision making and patient communication pattern (β = 0.264, P < 0.001); eHealth literacy and shared decision making (β = 0.267, P < 0.001); and patient communication pattern and shared decision making (β = 0.349, P < 0.001).

"Rasch analysis of the 9-item shared decision making questionnaire in women with breast cancer","2019","Background Shared decision making (SDM) is a best practice to help patients make optimal decisions by a process of healthcare, especially for women diagnosed with breast cancer and having heavy burden in long-term treatments. To promote successful SDM, it is crucial to assess the level of perceived involvement in SDM in women with breast cancer. Objective The aims of this study were to apply Rasch analysis to examine the construct validity and person reliability of the 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) in women with breast cancer. Methods The construct validity of SDM-Q-9 was confirmed when the items fit the Rasch model's assumptions of unidimensionality: (1) infit and outfit mean square ranged from 0.6 to 1.4; (2) the unexplained variance of the first dimension of the principal component analysis was less than 20%. Person reliability was calculated. Results A total of 212 participants were recruited in this study. Item 1 did not fit the model's assumptions and was deleted. The unidimensionality of the remaining 8 items (SDM-Q-8) was supported with good item fit (infit and outfit mean square ranging from 0.6 to 1.3) and very low unexplained variance of the first dimension (5.3%) of the principal component analysis. The person reliability of the SDM-Q-8 was 0.90. Conclusions The SDM-Q-8 was unidimensional and had good person reliability in women with breast cancer. Implications for Practice The SDM-Q-8 has shown its potential for assessing the level of perceived involvement in SDM in women with breast cancer for both research and clinical purposes. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Phase I Study of the Focal Adhesion Kinase Inhibitor BI?853520 in Japanese and Taiwanese Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors","2019","Background: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitors have demonstrated anti-tumor activity preclinically and are currently being evaluated in humans. A first-in-human study evaluating the novel FAK inhibitor BI?853520 in a predominantly Caucasian population with advanced or metastatic non-hematologic malignancies demonstrated acceptable tolerability and favorable pharmacokinetics. Objective: This study was undertaken to investigate the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI?853520 in Japanese and Taiwanese patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients and Methods: In this open-label, phase?I, dose-finding study, BI?853520 was administered once daily (QD) in a continuous daily dosing regimen with 28-day cycles and escalating doses to sequential cohorts of patients. Twenty-one patients (62% male; median age 65?years) were treated at two sites in Japan and Taiwan. Results: The median duration of treatment was 1.2?months (range 0.2–7.7). As no dose-limiting toxicities were observed during cycle 1 in the 50, 100, or 200?mg cohorts, the MTD of BI?853520 was determined to be 200?mg QD. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 19 patients (90%), and all except one were of grade?1 or 2. Pharmacokinetic parameters were supportive of a once-daily dosing schedule. A confirmed objective response rate of 5% and disease control rate of 29% were achieved; median duration of disease control was 3.7?months. Conclusions: This trial demonstrated a manageable and acceptable safety profile, favorable pharmacokinetics, and potential anti-tumor activity of BI?853520 in pretreated Japanese and Taiwanese patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

"Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and systemic lupus erythematosus in Taiwan: A cohort study","2019","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-systemic chronic autoimmune disease, the etiology of SLE is still unclear. Only a few studies evaluated the associations between air pollution and SLE. We conducted a population-based cohort study in Taiwan to examine the associations of air pollution with SLE. A total of 682,208 individuals aged 18–70 years were retrieved from National Health Insurance Research Database. We applied 1-km resolution land use regression and satellite-based models to estimate air pollutant concentrations during 2001–2010. The mixed effect Cox models with time-dependent variables were performed to estimate the associations between air pollution and SLE, as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We identified 1292 newly diagnosed SLE patients with average age of 43.26 ± 13.64 years, most of them were female. There were positive associations of SLE with exposure to a 9.76 ppb increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), a 0.20 ppm increase in carbon monoxide (CO), and a 10.2 μg/m 3 increase in fine particles (PM 2.5 ) (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08–1.36, HR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.31–1.59, and HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02–1.23, respectively). Additionally, we observed negative associations with ozone (O 3 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ). According to the exposure-response relationships, exposure to NO 2 between 28 and 38 ppb, exposure to CO above 0.6 ppm, and exposure to PM 2.5 between 18 and 46 μg/m 3 were positively associated with SLE. The results suggested that long-term exposure to traffic-related gaseous air pollutants (NO 2 and CO) less than current National Ambient Air Quality Standards and PM 2.5 are significantly associated with the risk of SLE. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Air quality standards; Carbon monoxide; Health insurance; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollutants; Exposure-response relationships; Land use regression; National ambient air quality standards; Particulate Matter; Systemic lupus erythematosus; Time-dependent variables; Air quality; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; cohort analysis; concentration (composition); health risk; land use; particulate matter; pollution exposure; regression analysis; satellite imagery; adult; aged; air pollution; air quality standard; ambient air; Article; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; female; human; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; pathogenesis; priority journal; systemic lupus erythematosus; Taiwan; traffic; adolescent; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; statistics and numerical data; systemic lupus erythematosus; young adult; Taiwan; Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Taiwan; Traffic-Related Pollution; Vehicle Emissions; Young Adult"
"Glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: Role of health literacy and shared decision-making","2019","Background: Improving glycemic control requires that patients actively participate in decisions about how to best live with the disease and adapt to the realities of self-care. Limited health literacy (HL) is related to poorer health outcomes and may make it difficult for patients to participate in shared decision-making (SDM). As such, understanding the relationship between HL and SDM and its impact on diabetes control is an urgent issue. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among outpatients with type 2 diabetes in a regional teaching hospital. Purposive sampling was used to recruit eligible 372 patients via self-administered questionnaires. HbA1C values were obtained from each patient’s laboratory assay. Results: Among the 372 participants, 50.4% of patients preferred physician decision-making, 39.3% preferred SDM, and 10.3% preferred patient decision-making. The physician explaining the illness in colloquial language, having adequate time for discussion, and encouragement from the healthcare provider were the major factors influencing patients’ involvement in SDM. Interactive HL and critical HL had positive correlations with patients’ perceived involvement in SDM. Educational attainment and HL were positively related. The HbA1C values for patient decision-making and physician decision-making were approximately 1.4 times and 1.24 times higher than those of SDM, respectively. Conclusion: SDM led to better glycemic control. HL increased patients’ perceived involvement in SDM. Therefore, it is necessary to improve levels of HL based on the educational attainment of patients. Physicians explaining illness in colloquial language is the key factor in promoting patients’ perceived involvement in SDM. ? 2019 Wang et al.","hemoglobin A1c; insulin; adult; aged; Article; cross-sectional study; educational status; female; glycemic control; health literacy; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outpatient; patient decision making; perception; physician decision making; shared decision making; teaching hospital; time"
"Clinical course and treatment response of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease: An 8-year experience","2019","Purpose: To report the clinical course and treatment response in a cohort of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) from a single referral center in Taiwan. Design: Case series. Methods: All NMOSD patients who received treatment and follow-up checks at National Taiwan University Hospital for at least 2 years between January 2008 and December 2016 were recruited. Demographic data and detailed characteristics of clinical course including acute episodes, maintenance therapies, and visual outcome were collected. Patients were examined every 6 months and during each episode of relapse. Results: A total of 96 patients were identified; of them, 68 (70.8%) had optic neuritis. Optic neuritis was the initial presentation of NMOSD in 44 patients. Among the patients with optic neuritis, 32.4% had recurrent optic neuritis within 1 year from the first episode. Compared with the group without optic neuritis, the group with optic neuritis had a younger age of presentation (34.4 ± 15.9 vs 42.4 ± 14.8 years, P = 0.02) and a higher 1-year recurrence rate (64.7% vs 17.9%, P < 0.001). Among the patients with optic neuritis, 51.5% had a final visual acuity of worse than 20/200. Multiple regression analysis showed that the presence of aquaporin-4-IgG antibodies and poor initial visual acuity were the risk factors for worse visual outcome. Conclusions: In this study, patients with optic neuritis were younger and had a higher 1-year recurrence rate. Despite using steroid therapy during the acute phase and immunosuppressive agents as long-term treatment, visual prognosis was poor. Aquaporin-4-IgG antibodies and initial visual acuity were associated with final visual outcome.

"Klebsiella pneumoniae Type VI Secretion System Contributes to Bacterial Competition, Cell Invasion, Type-1 Fimbriae Expression, and in Vivo Colonization","2019","Background We previously isolated a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, NTUH-K2044, from a community-acquired pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) patient. Analysis of the NTUH-K2044 genome revealed that this strain harbors 2 putative type VI secretion system (T6SS)-encoding gene clusters. Methods The distribution of T6SS genes in the PLA and intestinal-colonizing K pneumoniae clinical isolates was examined. icmF1-, icmF2-, icmF1/icmF2-, and hcp-deficient K pneumoniae strains were constructed using an unmarked deletion method. The roles of T6SSs in antibacterial activity, type-1 fimbriae expression, cell adhesion, and invasion and intestinal colonization were determined. Results The prevalence of T6SSs is higher in the PLA strains than in the intestinal-colonizing strains (37 of 42 vs 54 of 130). Deletion of icmF1/icmF2 and hcp genes significantly reduced interbacterial and intrabacterial killing. Strain deleted for icmF1 and icmF2 exhibited decreased transcriptional expression of type-1 fimbriae and reduced adherence to and invasion of human colorectal epithelial cells and was attenuated for in vivo competition to enable colonization of the host gut. Finally, Hcp expression in K pneumoniae was silenced by the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein via direct binding. Conclusions These results provide new insights into T6SS-mediated bacterial competition and attachment in K pneumoniae and could facilitate the prevention of K pneumoniae infection. ?

"Application of time-lapse ion exchange resin sachets (TIERS) for detecting illegal effluent discharge in mixed industrial and agricultural areas, Taiwan","2019","Many factories were built and scattered around the farmlands in Taiwan due to inappropriate land use planning. Illegal effluent discharge of high concentration of metals from the nearby factories has been threatening the farmlands, causing damages to agricultural production, food safety, and human health. Sampling was mostly responsible for monitoring the water quality of the agricultural environment; however, the analysis is of high cost and time consuming. Due to uneasy controlled environmental factors (i.e., illegal effluents) and time-consuming and expensive traditional analysis techniques (i.e., atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)), we develop a fast-screening method, which is the combination of ion exchange resins and the portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy to identify the source of contaminants in a mixed industrial and agricultural area in Taoyuan County, Taiwan. The time-lapse ion exchange resin sachet (TIERS) is a non-woven bag that is filled with resins and placed in the irrigation channels for continuously absorbing the metal and trace elements in water. The standardization ratios of Cu/Sr and Zn/Sr were calculated as the pollutant indicators for fast-screening the highly polluted sites of exceedance probability of 2.27% in the monitoring area. The TIERS is verified to detect the metal and trace element concentration in an efficient and sufficient way. ? 2019 by the authors.","agricultural land; concentration (composition); detection method; effluent; spectroscopy; trace element; Taiwan; Taoyuan [Taiwan]"
"Enzymatic hydrolysates obtained from Trametes versicolor polysaccharopeptides protect human skin keratinocyte against AAPH?induced oxidative stress and inflammatory","2019","Background: Polysaccharopeptides (PSPs) extracted from Trametes versicolor show antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulation effects. According to our previous report, the enzymatic hydrolysates obtained from T?versicolor PSPs by 80?U/mL β-1,3-D-glucanase (PSPs-EH80) did not change the functional groups of PSPs but enhanced their antioxidative activities. However, the mechanism elevating the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of PSPs-EH80 is not clear. Aims: This research focused on the protective mechanism(s) of PSPs-EH80 against free radical and 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative damage in human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. Methods: We evaluated the anti-inflammatory potential of PSPs-EH80 by assessing its free radical-induced oxidative damage. Using the HaCaT cell as the experimental system, we tested the protective effects of PSPs-EH80 on a model of AAPH-induced cellular oxidative damage through the assessment of cell survival rate. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were determined using MTT assays and Western blotting. Results: We demonstrated that PSPs-EH80 significantly enhanced keratinocyte viability, and augmented the antioxidant HO-1 expressions through upregulation of the Nrf2, compared with PSPs. Furthermore, PSPs-EH80 significantly reduced AAPH-induced COX-2 expressions through downregulation of the ERK, p38, and NF-κB signaling pathways. Conclusion: The PSPs-EH80 exhibits a stronger antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity than PSPs. Therefore, PSPs-EH80 could be effective for attenuating free radical-induced oxidative damage in human skin and can be applied widely in the fields of cosmetics and medicine. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2,2' azobis(2 amidinopropane); antiinflammatory agent; heme oxygenase 1; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; plant extract; polysaccharopeptide; stress activated protein kinase; Trametes versicolor extract; transcription factor Nrf2; transcription factor RelA; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; Article; cell damage; cell protection; cell survival; controlled study; down regulation; electrophoresis; enzymatic hydrolysis; enzyme activation; HaCat cell line; human; human cell; inflammation; keratinocyte; MTT assay; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; Trametes versicolor; upregulation; Western blotting"
"Combination treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer involving the novel HDAC inhibitor MPT0E028 with a MEK inhibitor beyond K-Ras status","2019","Background: Oncogenic K-Ras signaling highly relies on the canonical Ras/MEK/ERK pathway to contribute to pancreatic cancer progression. However, numerous efforts of MEK inhibitors have failed to provide an optimal antitumor effect for pancreatic cancer in practice. The aim of the present work was to develop a more efficacious therapeutic intervention for MEK inhibitors through combination with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MPT0E028. Methods: The effects of combined therapy on cell viability, apoptosis, protein, and RNA expressions were determined by MTT assay, flow cytometry, western blotting, and quantitative PCR analysis. The AsPC-1 xenograft was used to assess antitumor effects in vivo. Results: The co-administration of MPT0E028 and MEK inhibitor yielded synergistic effects on cell viability suppression both in K-Ras mutated and wild-type pancreatic cancer cells and also markedly triggered cell apoptosis. Surprisingly, ERK and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were activated by the long-term and low-concentration treatment of MPT0E028 or another HDAC inhibitor alone. Whereas, the pharmacological attenuation of ERK signaling dramatically abolished the MPTE028-induced p-ERK and EGFR expression. Overexpression of HDAC4, HDAC6, and MEK, respectively, reversed the cell death induced by the combined treatment. Finally, the combined treatment decreased the tumor volume in an AsPC-1 xenograft model compared to each individual treatment alone. Conclusions: The synergistic anti-survival effect of the combination was suggested to occur via compensation of the MEK inhibitor for activated ERK. Our results indicate that this combination strategy could benefit patients with pancreatic cancer beyond K-Ras status. ? 2019 The Author(s).","2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor; histone deacetylase 4; histone deacetylase 6; histone deacetylase inhibitor; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase; mpt 0e028; trametinib; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug potentiation; enzyme inhibition; flow cytometry; human; human cell; in vivo study; male; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; upregulation; Western blotting"
"Enhanced uropathogenic Escherichia coli-induced infection in uroepithelial cells by sugar through TLR-4 and JAK/STAT1 signaling pathways","2019","Background: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have higher incidence and more severe urinary tract infections (UTIs) for longer duration than those of the patients without DM. It causes more complicated etiologies during uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infection. However, studies regarding the molecular mechanism are scarce. Methods: The present study (1) aimed to verify if sugar influences the process of UPEC-induced cystitis and invasion into the uroepithelial cells and (2) illustrated the mechanism of effects for sugar enhanced the UPEC infection into uroepithelial cells is related to TLR-4-mediated and JAK/STAT1-dependent pathway. Results: The results of the present study indicated that sugar can enhance UPEC infection in uroepithelial cells by up-regulating the transduced circuit between TLR-4-mediated UPEC interaction and JAK/STAT-1 signal pathways. The results of the inhibitor-co-incubating experiments demonstrated that the mechanism involved in the synergistic amplification of TLR-4-mediated UPEC interaction and JAK/STAT1 signaling pathways is responsible for the increased UPEC infection in uroepithelial cells. Conclusion: The results also proved that STAT-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of UPEC invasion and infection in the uroepithelial cells, especially those pretreated with glucose. The present study suggests a possible therapeutic approach to preferentially suppress UPEC infection during UTIs in the patients with diabetes. ? 2019",""
"A Higher Preoperative Glycemic Profile Is Associated with Rapid Gastric Emptying After Sleeve Gastrectomy for Obese Subjects","2019","Background: Recent reports have shown that sleeve gastrectomy (SG) accelerates gastric emptying (GE), but the etiology remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting GE before and after SG. Methods: We enrolled 35 normal weight healthy subjects and 23 obese patients receiving SG. The normal individuals and obese patients before and 3?months after SG received oatmeal-based scintigraphy to measure GE. Gastrointestinal symptoms and circulating levels of peptide YY (PYY) were also measured. Results: There were no differences in the GE parameters, including simple half-time at 3?h and percentage of gastric retention at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3?h between healthy controls and pre-SG obese subjects. SG led to accelerated GE, more gastrointestinal symptoms, and increased fasting PYY levels postoperatively. Based on our previously established normal GE values, 18 (78.3%) obese patients with rapid postoperative GE had higher levels of preoperative fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin, and homeostasis model assessment of the insulin resistance index than those with normal postoperative GE. Twelve (52.2%) obese patients had preoperative diabetes mellitus (DM), and only four (17.4%) remained diabetic after SG. The post-SG gastric retention at 0.5 and 1?h was lower in patients with preoperative DM than in those without preoperative DM. Neither severity of gastrointestinal symptoms nor fasting PYY levels were associated with postoperative GE alterations. Conclusion: Most of the obese patients had accelerated GE after SG. A higher preoperative glycemic profile was associated with rapid post-SG GE. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","glucose; glycosylated hemoglobin; oatmeal; peptide YY; glycosylated hemoglobin; adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; disease association; fasting; female; gastrointestinal symptom; homeostasis model assessment; human; male; obese patient; obesity; preoperative period; priority journal; sleeve gastrectomy; stomach emptying; stomach paresis; stomach scintiscanning; surgical technique; blood; complication; diet restriction; gastrectomy; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; insulin resistance; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative period; procedures; stomach emptying; stomach paresis; Adult; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fasting; Female; Gastrectomy; Gastric Emptying; Gastroparesis; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Insulin Resistance; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Postoperative Period; Preoperative Period"
"Bovine Serum Albumin-Templated Synthesis of Manganese-Doped Copper Selenide Nanoparticles for Boosting Targeted Delivery and Synergistic Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapy","2019","Multifunctional nanohybrids integrating diagnostic imaging with photodynamic or photothermal therapy in a single agent feature the next generation of on-demand nanomedicine to meet the challenges in cancer therapy. In the present study, bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein through one pot biomimetic mineralization at its metal binding site synthesized and stabilized manganese-doped copper selenide nanoparticles (Mn:CuSe) with excellent biocompatibility, near-infrared absorption, water solubility, and rich functional groups for further bioconjugation. Mn doping not only imparted the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) function to the Mn:CuSe@BSA but also enhanced its heat generation ability. By taking advantage of BSA's extraordinary ligand binding capacity, folic acid (FA) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) were then conjugated onto the BSA corona to construct the Mn:CuSe@BSA-FA-Ce6 nanohybrid for specific targeting of overexpressed folate receptor cancer cells. The obtained theranostic agent exhibited dual MRI signal enhancement and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) effect, which was demonstrated in vitro on HeLa cells. As a consequence, dual modal therapy with 1 min PDT laser irradiation doubled cell killing efficiency compared to the single PDT treatment. Having better efficacy regarding biocompatibility and synergistic light-activation therapy, the Mn:CuSe@BSA-FA-Ce6 nanohybrid holds the promise for image-guided cancer therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Biocompatibility; Biomimetics; Biosynthesis; Copper compounds; Diseases; Infrared devices; Lanthanum compounds; Light absorption; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mammals; Manganese compounds; Manganese removal (water treatment); Medical nanotechnology; Metal nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Oncology; Signal systems; Surface plasmon resonance; Water absorption; Biomimetic mineralization; Bovine serum albumin proteins (BSA); Bovine serum albumins; Copper selenide; Ligand binding capacity; Near-infrared absorption; Photothermal therapy; Templated synthesis; Photodynamic therapy"
"Predisposing factors of necrotizing fasciitis with comparison to cellulitis in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based case–control study","2020","Background: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a life-threatening soft tissue infection with low incidence that requires prompt surgery. In the initial stage, it is difficult to distinguish NF and cellulitis, and limited population-based reports are available. Methods: We queried inpatient data sets of National Health Institute Research Database in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011 for all patients with diagnoses of NF. Of them, only patients who underwent surgeries and had been admitted to intensive care units were included as the study group. Age and gender-matched patients with admission diagnoses of cellulitis were enrolled in a ratio of 1:4 as the control group. We calculated annual incidence, mortality rate, risk factors and predictors of mortality of NF. Results: The study group consisted of 7391 NF patients. Among them, 4715 patients (64%) were man and 2676 (36%) were women. The overall annual incidence of NF was 3.26 hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years, which rose with age with male predominance. The in-hospital mortality rate, which also rose with age, was 32.2%. Diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio, 2.93; 95% confidence interval, 2.77-3.11; P value < 0.0001), alcoholism (2.64; 2.27-3.08; P < .0001), and chronic kidney disease (1.98; 1.84-2.14; P < .001) were identified as risk factors. Chronic kidney disease (1.86; 1.64-2.10; P < .001) and liver cirrhosis (1.68; 1.50-1.88; P < .001) were identified as predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: Age and the presence of chronic diseases are major risk factors as well as prognostic factors of NF in Taiwan. Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of NF, but does not adversely affect the outcome. ? 2019","adult; age; alcoholism; amputation; Article; case control study; cellulitis; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; controlled study; debridement; diabetes mellitus; disease predisposition; female; hospital admission; hospital mortality; hospitalization; human; incidence; intensive care; intensive care unit; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; necrotizing fasciitis; population based case control study; risk factor; Taiwan"
"Hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents","2019","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of acute and chronic liver disease and associated morbidity and mortality worldwide. Vertical (mother-to-child) and horizontal early childhood transmission are the main routes of HBV transmission and are responsible for most chronic infections, including among adults who bear the greatest burden of morbidity and mortality. Universal hepatitis B immunisation at birth and in infancy is the key strategy for global elimination of HBV infection, and has been highly effective in reducing new vertical infections. However, global progress in scale-up of HBV testing and treatment has been slow in adults and children. In this Series paper, we summarise knowledge on the epidemiology, natural history, and treatment of chronic HBV infection in adolescents and children, and we highlight key differences from HBV infection in adults. The estimated global prevalence of HBV infection in children aged 5 years or younger is 1·3%. Most children are in the high-replication, low-inflammation phase of infection, with normal or only slightly raised aminotransferases; cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are rare. Although entecavir is approved and recommended for children aged 2–17 years, and tenofovir for those aged 12–18 years, a conservative approach to treatment initiation in children is recommended. Key actions to address current policy gaps include: validation of non-invasive tests for liver disease staging; additional immunopathogenesis studies in children with HBV infection; long-term follow-up of children on nucleoside or nucleotide analogue regimens to inform guidance on when to start treatment; evaluation of different treatment strategies for children with high rates of HBV replication; and establishment of paediatric treatment registries and international consortia to promote collaborative research. ? 2019 World Health Organization.

"Fat-to-muscle ratio is a useful index for cardiometabolic risks: A population-based observational study","2019","Metabolic disorders are prevalent worldwide and have recently become public health problems recently. Previous studies have proposed different body composition indices for predicting future cardiovascular risks. We hypothesized an association among fat-to-muscle ratio (FMR), metabolic syndrome (MetS), hypertension (HTN), prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular risk in an adult population. A total of 66829 eligible subjects composed of 34182 males and 32647 females aged 20 years or older were obtained from health examinations in the Tri-Service General Hospital from 2011 to 2017. The body composition indices included fat and muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. A multivariable regression model was performed in a large population-based cross-sectional study. FMR was significantly associated with MetS, prediabetes, DM and HTN in all models of both genders. Based on quartile analysis, higher FMR had higher predictive ability for adverse health outcomes. The association between different definitions of MetS and the Framingham risk score was analyzed, and FMR-incorporated MetS was more useful for predicting higher Framingham risk scores than traditional definitions. FMR was a useful indicator for the presence of adverse cardiometabolic risks. Compared to traditional definition of MetS, FMR-incorporated MetS had a greater ability to predict incident cardiovascular risks. FMR seemed to be a simple and effective index for the early prevention and management of cardiometabolic events. ? 2019 Chen et al.

"Effect of black tea and green tea on the radial pulse spectrum in healthy humans","2019","The consumption of black tea and green tea has been shown to be beneficial for cardiovascular health. Because the chemical composition of the two teas varies widely, the purpose of the study was to investigate whether the consumption of green tea and black tea had different effects on the arterial system. Thirty-three healthy subjects received a single dose of green tea (dose = 0.05 g/kg) and black tea (dose = 0.05 g/kg) in different weeks. Radial blood pressure and radial pulse pressure were measured before and after drinking tea. The harmonic analysis was performed on radial pressure waves, and harmonics (Cns) were recorded. The results showed that both black tea and green tea consumption significantly increased the C1, C2, C6, C7, C8, C9, and C10 of the radial pressure wave. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the consumption effect of green tea on C6-C10 increase is greater than that of black tea. This report also found a subtle difference that consumption of green tea increased C4, whereas consumption of black tea increased C3. We concluded that black tea and green tea have similar patterns in higher harmonics, but with varying degrees. ?

"Risk of cutaneous adverse reactions associated with allopurinol or febuxostat in real-world patients: A nationwide study","2019","Aims: Allopurinol carries a well-known risk of cutaneous adverse reactions (CARs). Although febuxostat, a xanthine-oxidase inhibitor with different chemical structure, has been considered an alternative to allopurinol, post-marketing case reports of life-threatening febuxostat-related CARs have been reported. We aimed to compare the risk of CARs between allopurinol and febuxostat in real-world settings and to assess the impact of the market entry of febuxostat on allopurinol use and associated CARs. Methods: A nationwide study was conducted using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. In the new-user cohort study, patients who received their first prescriptions of allopurinol or febuxostat were included, and Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of CARs. In the interrupted time series analysis, time series data on new users and incidence rate of CARs were divided into three periods based on the reimbursement scheme of febuxostat in Taiwan, and segmented regression models were used to estimate changes in both the level and trend in each period. Results: We identified 526 cases of CARs with 487 among new users of allopurinol and 39 among new users of febuxostat (incidence rate: 15.37 vs 3.48 per 1000 person-years). Allopurinol was associated with higher risk of CARs (adjusted IRR 5.55, 95% CI [3.97-7.76]), mild CARs (1.86, [1.24-2.81]), severe CARs (16.75, [8.87-31.62]) and fatal CARs (16.18, [5.05-51.83]) than febuxostat. The overall incidence rates of xanthine-oxidase inhibitor-related CARs decreased from 15.28 to 14.28 per 1000 person-years after the initial reimbursement of febuxostat and further decreased to 9.46 after the reimbursement coverage of febuxostat expanded; however, the changes were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Febuxostat can be considered an alternative for patients carrying risk factors for allopurinol-related CARs. However, since there were fatal cases of febuxostat-related CARs, the closely monitoring of symptoms of CARs during the initiation of febuxostat is still warranted. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","allopurinol; febuxostat; xanthine oxidase inhibitor; allopurinol; antigout agent; febuxostat; adolescent; adult; adverse event; aged; Article; child; cohort analysis; data base; drug marketing; drug safety; drug use; female; human; incidence; infant; insurance; major clinical study; male; newborn; priority journal; retrospective study; risk assessment; skin manifestation; Taiwan; drug eruption; epidemiology; gout; middle aged; preschool child; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Allopurinol; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Drug Eruptions; Febuxostat; Female; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"AKT-mediated phosphorylation enhances protein stability and transcription activity of ZNF322A to promote lung cancer progression","2019","ZNF322A is an oncogenic zinc-finger transcription factor. Our published results show that ZNF322A positively regulates transcription of alpha-adducin (ADD1) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) to promote tumorgenicity of lung cancer. However, the upstream regulatory mechanisms of ZNF322A protein function remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that AKT could phosphorylate ZNF322A by in vitro kinase assay and cell-based mass spectrometry analysis. Overexpression of AKT promoted ZNF322A protein stability and transcriptional activity, whereas these effects were inhibited by knockdown of AKT or treating with AKT inhibitor. We studied AKT-mediated phosphorylation sites, viz. Thr-150, Ser-224, Thr-234, and Thr-262. ZNF322A phosphorylation at Thr-262 by AKT promoted ZNF322A protein stability thus increased ADD1 promoter activity. Interestingly, phosphorylation at Thr-150, Ser-224, and Thr-234 enhanced transcription activity without affecting protein stability of ZNF322A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA affinity precipitation assays showed that ZNF322A phosphorylation defective mutants Thr-150A, Ser-224A, and Thr-234A attenuated chromatin binding and DNA binding affinity to ADD1 and CCND1 promoters compared with wild-type ZNF322A. Furthermore, AKT-mediated Thr-150, Ser-224, Thr-234, and Thr-262 phosphorylation promoted lung cancer cell growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, expression of phosphorylated ZNF322A (p-ZNF) correlated with actively phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in tumor specimens from 150 lung cancer patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that combined p-AKT and p-ZNF expression profile was an independent factor to predict the clinical outcome in lung cancer patients. Our results reveal a new mechanism of AKT signaling in promoting ZNF322A protein stability and transcriptional activity in lung cancer cell, xenograft, and clinical models. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","alpha adducin; cyclin D1; DNA; protein kinase B; serine; threonine; transcription factor; unclassified drug; ZNF322A protein; ADD1 gene; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; CCND1 gene; chromatin immunoprecipitation; clinical outcome; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; genetic database; genetic transcription; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; kinase assay; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mass spectrometry; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein stability; signal transduction; tumor promotion; wild type"
"Auditory event-related potentials in antipsychotic-free subjects with ultra-high-risk state and first-episode psychosis","2019","Background: Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) have been utilized to study defective information processing of patients with schizophrenia. To delineate the pathophysiological processes from prepsychotic state to first-episode psychosis, a study on subjects from ultra-high-risk (UHR) state to first-episode psychosis, ideally in an antipsychotic-free condition, can add important information to our understanding. Methods: Patients with UHR state or at their first-episode psychosis (FEP) who were drug-naive or only have been temporarily treated with antipsychotics were assessed by auditory ERPs measurement, including P50/N100 (sensory gating) and duration mismatch negativity (MMN; deviance detection). A group of age-matched healthy subjects served as their controls. Results: A total of 42 patients (23 UHR and 19 FEP) and 120 control subjects were recruited, including 21 pure drug-naive and 21 with very short exposure to antipsychotics. Collapsing FEP and UHR as a patient group, they exhibited significant sensory deficits manifested as larger P50 S2 amplitude, larger N100 ratio, and smaller N100 difference, and significantly less deviance detection response revealed by MMN. Such differences were less significant when treating FEP and UHR separately for comparisons. Comparisons of ERP results between drug-naive subjects and antipsychotic-short-exposure subjects revealed no significant difference in any P50/N100 and MMN parameter. Conclusion: Our study is one of the few studies focused on drug-naive or minimally treated patients at pre- or early-psychotic states. Our results exhibited impaired performance in sensory gating and deviance detection shown by certain parameters. A longitudinal study with larger sample sizes will be helpful to provide more evidence to elucidate the role of antipsychotics on an individual’s neurophysiological performance at different stages of psychosis.

"Do parents and children agree on rating a child’s HRQOL? A systematic review and Meta-analysis of comparisons between children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and children with typical development using the PedsQL TM","2019","Purpose: This meta-analysis was conducted to assess differences in a child’s health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as reported by the child and their parents using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory TM , and the effects in both children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and those with typical development. Methods: Eight studies encompassing 16 independent groups met the inclusion criteria and were combined and compared in this meta-analysis. Fixed effect analysis was applied in the subgroup analysis to compare differences between children with ADHD and those with typical development. Results: Small to moderate magnitudes of parent-child discrepancies were found in the ratings of the children’s HRQOL both in those with ADHD (g = ?0.23 [?0.33, ?0.13], p &lt; 0.001, physical HRQOL; g = ?0.60 [?0.71, ?0.48], p &lt; 0.001, psychosocial HRQOL) and in those with typical development (g = ?0.27 [?0.31, ?0.23], p &lt; 0.001, physical HRQOL; g = ?0.29 [?0.33, ?0.25], p &lt; 0.001, psychosocial HRQOL) except for emotional HRQOL in children with typical development (g = 0.003 [?0.04, 0.04], p = 0.90). The parent-child discrepancy in rating the child’s psychosocial HRQOL was significantly larger in the children with ADHD than in those with typical development. Conclusions and implications: This meta-analysis suggests that a child’s HRQOL may be assessed in children and adolescents with ADHD both by parent proxy- and child self-reports. Parent-child discrepancies, especially in psychosocial HRQOL, and sources of discrepancy need to be addressed when assessing the child’s HRQOL and planning interventions in children with ADHD.Implications for Rehabilitation Parents reported a significantly worse health-related quality of life of their children than both the children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and those with typical development. A child’s health-related quality of life needs to be assessed both by parent proxy and self-reports of the children. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and those with typical development differed significantly in parent-child discrepancy in child’s psychosocial health-related quality of life, but not in physical health-related quality of life. Parent-child discrepancies, especially in psychosocial health-related quality of life, and sources of discrepancy (e.g., child, parent or family characteristics) need to be addressed when assessing the child’s health-related quality of life and planning interventions in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ? 2017, ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attention deficit disorder; human; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; self report; standards; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Humans; Quality of Life; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Next Chapter of the Taiwan Biobank: Sustainability and Perspectives","2019","The emergence of biobanks has expanded the scope of biomedical research, ushering in an era of ""precision medicine"" to improve the treatment of disease. However, biobanks also face sustainability challenges comprising three dimensions - ""financial,"" ""operational,"" and ""social."" The Taiwan Biobank (TWB), as a large-scale national biobank that supplies valuable phenotypic and genetic information to biomedical researchers on an application basis to investigate the relationship among personal health, genes, lifestyle, environment and diseases of the Taiwanese population, has not been sufficiently explored by researchers. Although the TWB has successfully reached a few milestones since its inception, it faces many sustainability challenges. For the next chapter of the TWB, we propose three strategies to improve sustainability. First, the Ministry of Health and Welfare launched the TWB as an infrastructure project under the leadership of Academia Sinica in 2012. We now believe that it is time that the TWB is transformed into a legal entity as a nondepartmental public body. This would not only ensure efficient, effective, and flexible operation, but would also facilitate cooperation with commercial entities. Second, we suggest that the TWB integrates with other Taiwanese biobanks to reduce cost, improve low utilization, and expand specimen collection. Third, self-financing is important if funding is ceased. Besides implementing a cost-recovery model, the commodities developed by the TWB (e.g., TWB 2.0 microarray) will help increase income. After each of these strategies has been discussed in detail, this article will conclude by highlighting how these practices can help improve biobank sustainability. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Article; biobank; biotechnology; cost utility analysis; environmental sustainability; funding; human; international cooperation; leadership; priority journal; Taiwan; Taiwanese"
"Adhesive pyramidal thorn patches provide pain relief to athletes","2019","Pain in athletes is ideally treated without systemic medicine. Therefore, complementary and alternative medicine, including patch treatments, is often used. The physiologic mechanisms of pain relief produced by patch treatment, however, are not well elucidated. In the present study, we introduce a pyramidal thorn (PT) patch that we developed, demonstrate the effects of this PT patch for the treatment of various types of pain in 300 subjects, and suggest a physiologic mechanism for the pain relief effects. One treatment with the PT patch effectively relieved pain in almost half the subjects evaluated. Except for pain generated deeply under the skin, such as low-back pain, pain was eliminated within four treatments with the PT patch in almost all of the subjects. Interestingly, the pain-sensing region moved along the nerve fibers after each trial. Further, patches without PT also provided some pain relief. We considered that this effect was due to hair deflection on the skin; that is, adhesion of the PT patch activates Merkel cells directly as well as Merkel cell-neurite complexes around the hair follicles by deflecting the hair follicles, whereas adhesion of a patch without PT only activates the Merkel cell-neurite complexes. In any case, patch adhesion stimulates Aβ fibers to alleviate pain. Finally, we found that the pain threshold is increased by electric stimulation, suggesting that the gentle adhesion of a PT patch would be more effective. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate physiologically the validity of an adherent patch for pain relief. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Pan-Asian adapted ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with metastatic oesophageal cancer: A JSMO-ESMO initiative endorsed by CSCO, KSMO, MOS, SSO and TOS","2019","The most recent version of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of oesophageal cancer was published in 2016, and covered the management and treatment of local/ locoregional disease, limited disease, locally advanced disease and the management of advanced/metastatic disease. At the ESMO Asia Meeting in November 2017 it was decided by both ESMO and the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology (JSMO) to convene a special guidelines meeting immediately after the JSMO Annual Meeting in 2018. The aim was to adapt the ESMO 2016 guidelines to take into account the ethnic differences associated with the treatment of metastatic oesophageal cancer in Asian patients. These guidelines represent the consensus opinions reached by experts in the treatment of patients with metastatic oesophageal cancer representing the oncological societies of Japan (JSMO), China (CSCO), Korea (KSMO), Malaysia (MOS), Singapore (SSO) and Taiwan (TOS). The voting was based on scientific evidence, and was independent of both the current treatment practices and the drug availability and reimbursement situations in the individual participating Asian countries. ?

"A new primer construction technique that effectively increases amplification of rare mutant templates in samples","2019","Background: In personalized medicine, companion diagnostic tests provide additional information to help select a treatment option likely to be optimal for a patient. Although such tests include several techniques for detecting low levels of mutant genes in wild-type backgrounds with fairly high sensitivity, most tests are not specific, and may exhibit high false positive rates. In this study, we describe a new primer structure, named 'stuntmer', to selectively suppress amplification of wild-type templates, and promote amplification of mutant templates. Results: A single stuntmer for a defined region of DNA can detect several kinds of mutations, including point mutations, deletions, and insertions. Stuntmer PCRs are also highly sensitive, being able to amplify mutant sequences that may make up as little as 0.1% of the DNA sample. Conclusion: In conclusion, our technique, stuntmer PCR, can provide a simple, low-cost, highly sensitive, highly accurate, and highly specific platform for developing companion diagnostic tests. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Patient treatment; Polymerase chain reaction; Cancer; cfDNA; Construction technique; Diagnostic tests; False positive rates; High sensitivity; Mutation; Personalized medicines; DNA sequences; cell free DNA; DNA; unclassified drug; Article; cost; diagnostic test; DNA determination; DNA sequence; DNA template; exon; gene amplification; gene deletion; gene insertion; mutational analysis; polymerase chain reaction; process development; sensitivity and specificity; wild type"
"Developing a novel cholesterol-based nanocarrier with high transfection efficiency and serum compatibility for gene therapy","2019","Background/Purpose: Primary cells are sensitive to culture conditions, which can be more difficult to get efficient transfection. The purpose of this study is to develop a serum-compatible cholesterol-based nanocarrier for delivering therapeutic nucleic acids into cells efficiently for future clinical gene therapy. Methods: A novel cationic 3-β-[N-(2-guanidinoethyl)carbamoyl]-cholesterol (GEC-Chol) was mixed with cholesterol and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles to form GCC-Fe 3 O 4 nanocarrier. Transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity in serum and non-serum conditions were evaluated. Florescent-labeled oligonucleotides (ODNs) were transfected as indicators. Fluorescent microscopy, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry analysis were used for evaluations. Besides, we also delivered functional antisense c-myc ODNs as surrogates for specific gene manipulation in vitro. Results: Results indicated that GCC-Fe 3 O 4 nanocarrier could have size down to less than 135 nm, which structure was highly stable and consistent over time. It also showed great transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity in both serum and non-serum conditions. Our results demonstrated that GCC-Fe 3 O 4 nanocarrier had exceeded 90% transfection efficiency, which was much better than common commercialized transfection reagents under same conditions. Such nanocarrier not only worked well in cell lines, but also ideal for gene delivery in primary cells. Conclusion: With high transfection efficiency and serum compatibility, this novel biocompatible cholesterol-based nanocarrier provides an ideal platform especially for RNAi-based gene manipulation.

"Geographical variation and predictors of physical activity level in adults with congenital heart disease","2019","Background: Physical activity is important to maintain and promote health. This is of particular interest in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) where acquired heart disease should be prevented. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum of 2.5 h/week of physical activity exceeding 3 metabolic equivalents (METS) to achieve positive health effects. It is unknown whether physical activity levels (PAL) in adult CHD patients differ by country of origin. Methods: 3896 adults with CHD recruited from 15 countries over 5 continents completed self-reported instruments, including the Health Behaviour Scale (HBS-CHD), within the APPROACH-IS project. For each patient, we calculated whether WHO recommendations were achieved or not. Associated factors were investigated using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Results: On average, 31% reached the WHO recommendations but with a great variation between geographical areas (India: 10%–Norway: 53%). Predictors for physical activity level in line with the WHO recommendations, with country of residence as random effect, were male sex (OR 1.78, 95%CI 1.52–2.08), NYHA-class I (OR 3.10, 95%CI 1.71–5.62) and less complex disease (OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.16–1.83). In contrast, older age (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.96–0.98), lower educational level (OR 0.41, 95%CI 0.26–0.64) and being unemployed (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.42–0.77) were negatively associated with reaching WHO recommendations. Conclusions: A significant proportion of patients with CHD did not reach the WHO physical activity recommendations. There was a large variation in physical activity level by country of origin. Based on identified predictors, vulnerable patients may be identified and offered specific behavioral interventions. ? 2018","adult; alcohol consumption; APPROACH IS; Article; congenital heart disease; cross-sectional study; educational status; employment status; exercise; female; follow up; geographic pathology; health behavior; Health Behaviour Scale; heart injury; human; major clinical study; male; marriage; medical decision making; medical ethics; metabolic equivalent; New York Heart Association class; patient-reported outcome; physical activity; prediction; priority journal; questionnaire; self report; smoking; world health organization"
"Identification of urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin molecular forms and their association with different urinary diseases in cats","2019","Background: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a promising renal biomarker, can exists as a monomer, a dimer and/or in a NGAL/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) complex form when associated with different urinary diseases in humans and dogs. In this study, the presence of the various different molecular forms of NGAL in cat urine (uNGAL) was examined and whether these forms are correlated with different urinary diseases was explored. Results: One hundred and fifty-nine urine samples from cats with various different diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI, 22 cats), chronic kidney disease (CKD, 55 cats), pyuria (44 cats) and other non-renal and non-pyuria diseases (non-RP, 26 cats), as well as healthy animals (12 cats), were collected. The molecular forms of and concentrations of urinary NGAL in these cats were analyzed, and their uNGAL-to-creatinine ratio (UNCR) were determined. The cats with AKI had the highest UNCR (median: 2.92 × 10- 6), which was followed by pyuria (median: 1.43 × 10- 6) and CKD (median: 0.56 × 10- 6); all of the above were significantly higher than the healthy controls (median: 0.17 × 10- 6) (p &lt; 0.05). Three different NGAL molecular forms as well as the MMP-9 monomer were able to be detected in the cat urine samples. Moreover, the cases where urine NGAL monomer were present also had significantly higher levels of BUN (median: 18.9 vs 9.6 mmol/L) and creatinine (327.1 vs 168 umol/L). The presence of dimeric NGAL was found to be associated with urinary tract infections. Most cats in the present study (126/159, 79.2%) and more than half of healthy cats (7/12, 58.3%) had detectable NGAL/MMP-9 complex present in their urine. Conclusions: The monomeric and dimeric molecular forms of uNGAL suggest upper and lower urinary tract origins of disease, respectively, whereas the presence of the uNGAL/MMP-9 complex is able to be detected in most cats, including seemingly healthy ones. ? 2019 The Author(s).","creatinine; gelatinase B; monomer; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; biological marker; isoprotein; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; acute kidney failure; Article; cat; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; creatinine urine level; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; hospitalization; leukocyte count; neutrophil; nonhuman; protein urine level; pyuria; urea nitrogen blood level; urinalysis; urine culture; Western blotting; animal; cat disease; chemistry; classification; urinary tract disease; urine; veterinary medicine; Animals; Biomarkers; Cat Diseases; Cats; Lipocalin-2; Protein Isoforms; Urologic Diseases"
"Computer-aided diagnosis of endobronchial ultrasound images using convolutional neural network","2019","Background and objective: In the United States, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. The survival rate could increase by early detection. In recent years, the endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS)images have been utilized to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions and guide transbronchial needle aspiration because it is real-time, radiation-free and has better performance. However, the diagnosis depends on the subjective judgment from doctors. In some previous studies, which using the grayscale image textures of the EBUS images to classify the lung lesions but it belonged to semi-automated system which still need the experts to select a part of the lesion first. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to achieve full automation assistance by using convolution neural network. Methods: First of all, the EBUS images resized to the input size of convolution neural network (CNN). And then, the training data were rotated and flipped. The parameters of the model trained with ImageNet previously were transferred to the CaffeNet used to classify the lung lesions. And then, the parameter of the CaffeNet was optimized by the EBUS training data. The features with 4096 dimension were extracted from the 7th fully connected layer and the support vector machine (SVM)was utilized to differentiate benign and malignant. This study was validated with 164 cases including 56 benign and 108 malignant. Results: According to the experiment results, applying the classification by the features from the CNN with transfer learning had better performance than the conventional method with gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)features. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under ROC achieved 85.4% (140/164), 87.0% (94/108), 82.1% (46/56), and 0.8705, respectively. Conclusions: From the experiment results, it has potential ability to diagnose EBUS images with CNN. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Automation; Biological organs; Computer aided instruction; Computer networks; Convolution; Diseases; Image texture; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Textures; Transfer matrix method; Ultrasonic applications; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Convolutional neural network; Lung Cancer; Transfer learning; Ultrasound images; Computer aided diagnosis; adult; aged; Article; automation; cancer diagnosis; computer assisted diagnosis; computer language; controlled study; convolution neural network; diagnostic accuracy; endobronchial ultrasonography; feature extraction; human; lung cancer; machine learning; major clinical study; predictive value; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; transfer of learning"
"Bone mineral density as a dose-response predictor for osteoporosis: A propensity score analysis of longitudinal incident study (KCIS no. 39)","2019","Background: Osteoporosis is a global disease burden for aging society. The role of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in the prediction for osteoporosis in a dose-response manner is hardly addressed. Aim: We aimed to show the dose-response of QUS measurement in the prediction for osteoporosis by a community-based study. Design: A prospective cohort study. Methods: Participants were recruited between 2000 and 2004. Demographic data and heel QUS measurement were collected at baseline. Diagnosis of osteoporosis was ascertained by the follow-up of this cohort over time. In order to reduce the imbalance of baseline characteristics in the observational study, we applied propensity score by using proportional odds regression analysis to match the quintiles of QUS T-score. Results: A total of 44 957 subjects composed of 17 678 men (39.3%) and 27 279 women (69.7%) were recruited. After adjustments for propensity score, an increase in one unit of QUB T-score led to 7% reduction in the risk for osteoporosis [adjusted odds ratio (OR) ? 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89–0.96, P < 0.0001]. Higher quintile of QUS T-score yielded a lower risk of osteoporosis with a gradient relationship [OR: 0.82 (95%CI: 0.72–0.92); OR: 0.81 (95%CI: 0.71–0.91); OR: 0.77 (95%CI: 0.68–0.87) and OR: 0.76 (95%CI: 0.67–0.86)] from the second to highest quintile opposed to first quintile (P < 0.0001). The cumulative incidence of osteoporosis was higher in the lower quintile during follow-up (log-rank test, P < 0.001). Conclusion: QUS is an independent predictor for osteoporosis in a dose-response manner using a large population-based cohort. Due to the lower cost and portability of QUS measurement, the pre-screening for osteoporosis by QUS can be considered in the area with limited resources can be a feasible and alternative method. ?

"Case investigations of infectious diseases occurring in workplaces, United States, 2006-2015","2019","Workers in specific settings and activities are at increased risk for certain infectious diseases. When an infectious disease case occurs in a worker, investigators need to understand the mechanisms of disease propagation in the workplace. Few publications have explored these factors in the United States; a literature search yielded 66 investigations of infectious disease occurring in US workplaces during 2006-2015. Reported cases appear to be concentrated in specific industries and occupations, especially the healthcare industry, laboratory workers, animal workers, and public service workers. A hierarchy-of-controls approach can help determine how to implement effective preventive measures in workplaces. Consideration of occupational risk factors and control of occupational exposures will help prevent disease transmission in the workplace and protect workers’ health. ? 2019, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"Investigating the relationship between district-level socioeconomic status and individual obesity in Taiwanese adolescents: A large-scale cross-sectional analysis","2019","The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of obesity and to explore the relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity among adolescents in Taiwan, a transitioning country. Data from the Taiwan School Physical Fitness Database on 1,875,627 Taiwanese adolescents aged 10–18 years were analyzed. The average family income per household in each district was collected from the national statistical institutional database. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Pearson correlation analysis, and mixed model analyses were used. The overall prevalence of combined overweight and obesity was 28.1%. The prevalence of overweight/obesity significantly differed according to gender and age. Furthermore, the average family income per household was negatively associated with the district-level prevalence of obesity. Additionally, when controlling for physical fitness, the average family income per household remained negatively associated with adolescent obesity. In addition, multilevel analysis was also applied to explore the relationship between district-level socioeconomic status and individual-level obesity to prevent the nested data structure from affecting the results. The results revealed that the average family income per household negatively correlated with individual obesity. These findings provide insight for public health officials into preventing and managing adolescent obesity. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

"Survival outcomes of eye-sparing surgery for adenoid cystic carcinoma of lacrimal gland","2019","Purpose: To survey adenoid cystic carcinoma of lacrimal glands in Asian population and investigate the predictability in prognosis following the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging guideline. Study design: Retrospective study. Methods: The clinical entities and surgical outcomes of the patients who were histologically confirmed with a diagnosis of lacrimal adenoid cystic carcinoma in National Taiwan University Hospital between January 1995 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Enrolled were 11 patients. The median follow-up was 7.2 years. Eight patients (72.7%) were diagnosed as T1 or T2 disease, and three patients (27.3%) were diagnosed as T3 or T4 disease according to the AJCC 8th edition guideline. Eye-sparing surgery with radiotherapy was performed in nine patients. Local recurrence was noted in six patients (54.5%) with median disease-free interval of 23.5 months. Six patients (54.5%) developed distant metastases, including lung, bone, and cranial invasions. Overall survival rate during the study period was 54.6%. Five-year overall survival was 81.8% and ten-year overall survival was 68.2%. The Log-rank test for overall survival and disease-free survival between patients with less than T3 disease (p=0.001) and patients with T3 or T4 disease (p=0.006) revealed significant differences. Conclusion: This study highlighted the aggressive nature of adenoid cystic carcinoma of lacrimal glands. Eye-sparing surgery with adjunctive radiotherapy may achieve relatively optimal disease control in diseases staged T1 or T2, but in advanced disease metastasis and mortality are usually inevitable. ? 2019, Japanese Ophthalmological Society.","adenoid cystic carcinoma; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; Asian; bone metastasis; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer survival; cataract; clinical article; clinical outcome; controlled study; diplopia; disease free interval; disease free survival; dry eye; eye surgery; eyelid erythema; female; follow up; glaucoma; human; lacrimal gland tumor; local recurrence free survival; lung metastasis; male; medical record review; middle aged; neuropathy; overall survival; postoperative period; practice guideline; priority journal; retinopathy; retrospective study; survival rate; tumor invasion; tumor volume; very elderly; young adult; adenoid cystic carcinoma; biopsy; cancer staging; epidemiology; eye surgery; eye tumor; lacrimal apparatus; lacrimal gland disease; mortality; pathology; procedures; prognosis; Taiwan; time factor; trends; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biopsy; Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic; Disease-Free Survival; Eye Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lacrimal Apparatus; Lacrimal Apparatus Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Taiwan; Time Factors; Young Adult"
"Traditional-Chinese Dispositional Flow Scale-2 and Flow State Scale-2 in Taiwanese subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder","2019","Introduction: The 36-item Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (DFS-2) and Flow State Scale-2 (FSS-2) were developed to assess flow experience in daily and specific activities. Although their validity and reliability had been examined in general populations and different cultures, little is known for schizophrenic subjects. Thus, this study aimed to validate Traditional-Chinese DFS-2 (TCDFS-2) and FSS-2 (TCFSS-2) in Taiwanese subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Methods: We recruited 229 adult participants from outpatient clinics, day care centers, and psychiatric rehabilitation centers in Taipei. They filled out 36-item TCDFS-2 and TCFSS-2 under guidance. The LISREL 9.30 software was used to conduct exploratory factor analysis for exploring measurement structures, and then confirmatory factor analysis for identifying factor models. Results: The six first-order factor and one second-order factor measurement models were obtained for both 36-item TCDFS-2 (Chi-square statistic = 999.1, df = 545, p < 0.0001, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation [RMSEA] = 0.0603, and Comparative Fit Index [CFI] = 0.9213) and TCFSS-2 (Chi-square statistic = 987.9, df = 539, p < 0.0001, RMSEA = 0.0603, and CFI = 0.9213). Conclusion: Our factor models differed remarkably from those of 36-item DFS-2 and FSS-2. Yet, they were barely acceptable to be used to measure flow experiences in schizophrenic subjects in clinical applications. Since the factor scores, measurement structures, or even definitions of flow experiences could differ substantially between healthy people and patients with mental illness, disease-specific instruments of flow experiences should be considered in the future. ? 2018","adult; Article; controlled study; female; flow experience; human; major clinical study; male; pilot study; priority journal; psychological well-being; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; Taiwan; Taiwanese; Traditional Chinese Dispositional Flow Scale 2; Traditional Chinese Flow State Scale 2; validation study; Asian continental ancestry group; ethnology; middle aged; psychological rating scale; psychology; psychometry; psychosis; reproducibility; schizophrenia; standards; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychometrics; Psychotic Disorders; Reproducibility of Results; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Taiwan"
"The long-term care experiences and care needs of parents caring for children with adrenoleukodystrophy","2019","Background: Children suffering from adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) requires life-long care. Little is known about the care needs of parents of ALD children at different stages of their disease. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand the long-term care experiences and care needs of parents caring for their ALD children. Methods: A descriptive qualitative study with 7 in-depth interviews was conducted with parents. Results: The results of these care experiences were distinguished into three phases: ""pathogenesis to diagnosis"", ""rapid deterioration of physiological functions"", and ""bedridden until the death"". The long-term care experiences revealed five themes, including ""chaos and helplessness to seek medical attention then being forced to accept"", ""self-accusation and guilt"", ""strengthening parents' toughness"", ""seizing the moment and facing the future"", and ""accompanying children through life without pain"". Within the three phases, the care needs comprised the three themes of ""integrating resources and providing immediate care"", ""obtaining information and support regarding ALD rapidly"", and ""establishing individualized long-term care"". Conclusion/Implication for Practice: This study revealed the long-term care experiences and care needs of the parents of ALD children. Providing individualized care, nursing instruction, and telephone consultation as well as connecting case managers with the hospice-care team will help facilitate and meet the care needs of these parents. ? 2019 Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Quality gaps and priorities for improvement of healthcare service for patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation in the view of family","2019","Background: Little is known about the gaps between expectation and the perception of service quality in the care setting of prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: We conducted this prospective study at the Respiratory Care Center (RCC) of a medical center from February 2017 to January 2018. Family members of the patients admitted to the RCC completed a questionnaire based on the SERVQUAL instrument in two sections – expectation and perception, consisting of 22 questions each in five dimensions. We analyzed the gaps between paired items, used important-performance analysis (IPA) to identify priority items for improvement, and performed multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 167 respondents participated in the survey. The average length of patient stay in the RCC was 19.4 days, and 70.7% were successfully liberated from MV. The overall mean SERVQUAL scores for the two sections were similar (4.50 ± 0.52 and 4.51 ± 0.54 for expectation and perception, respectively; p = 0.808). IPA identified four items, including one “tangible,” one “reliability” and two “empathy” with an undesired expectation/perception gap indicating a priority for improvement. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male respondents, patients older than 75 years, tracheostomy, and the need for physical training or dialysis were associated with an increased gap in these priority items. Conclusion: Gaps exist between expectation and perception in multiple dimensions of the quality of healthcare service in the care setting of prolonged MV, indicating unmet needs and priorities for improvement. ? 2018","adult; article; artificial ventilation; controlled study; dialysis; empathy; expectation; human; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; perception; prospective study; questionnaire; reliability; respiratory care; satisfaction; tracheostomy; training; aged; artificial ventilation; female; health care quality; middle aged; multivariate analysis; patient satisfaction; perception; psychology; questionnaire; reproducibility; statistical model; Taiwan; university hospital; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Patient Satisfaction; Perception; Prospective Studies; Quality of Health Care; Reproducibility of Results; Respiration, Artificial; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Readmission after Adult Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty: A Population-Based Inpatient Cohort Study in Taiwan","2019","Objective: To investigate readmissions among adult inpatients who underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) in Taiwan. Design: Population-based survey. Setting: Retrospective study with the National Health Insurance Database. Methods: All cases of inpatient adult UPPP (age &gt;20 years) from 1997 to 2012 were identified through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Factors associated with readmission within 30 days after surgery were analyzed. Results: A total of 38,839 adults with UPPP were identified (mean age, 39.3 years; men, 73.7%). The incidence of UPPP was 14.6 per 100 000 adults, which increased from 1997 to 2012 (6.7 to 16.7 per 100,000, P trend &lt;.001). The rates of readmission for any reason, readmission for bleeding, reoperation for bleeding, and 30-day mortality were 4.2%, 1.7%, 1.0%, and 0.14%, respectively. Young age increased the risk of reoperation for bleeding, and old age increased the risk of readmission for any reason and mortality. Men had an increased risk of readmission and reoperation. Hypertension was associated with an increased risk of readmission for any reason (odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51), bleeding-related readmission (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.52-2.36), and reoperation (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.84-3.30). Concurrent hypopharyngeal surgery was associated with an increased risk of readmission for any reason (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07-1.66) and bleeding-related readmission (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.25-2.27). Finally, the use of steroids was associated with an increased risk of bleeding-related readmission and reoperation. Conclusions: The incidence of adult UPPP increased from 1997 to 2012 in Taiwan. Age, sex, comorbidity, concurrent hypopharyngeal surgery, and drug administration were associated with readmission after inpatient UPPP. ?

"Immunofluorescence can assess the efficacy of mTOR pathway therapeutic agent Everolimus in breast cancer models","2019","When breast cancer patients start to exhibit resistance to hormonal therapy or chemotherapy, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus can be considered as an alternative therapeutic agent. Everolimus can deregulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and affect a range of cellular functions. In some patients, the agent does not exhibit the desired efficacy and, even worse, not without the associated side effects. This study assessed the use of immunofluorescence (IF) as a modality to fill this unmet need of predicting the efficacy of everolimus prior to administration. Cell viability and MTT assays based on IF intensities of pho-4EBP1 Thr37/46 and pho-S6K1 Ser424 on breast cancer cells (Hs578T, MCF7, BT474, MDA-MB-231) and patient-derived cell culture from metastatic sites (ABC-82T and ABC-16TX1) were interrogated. Results show that independent pho-4EBP1 Thr37/46 and pho-S6K1 Ser424 IF expressions can classify data into different groups: everolimus sensitive and resistant. The combined IF baseline intensity of these proteins is predictive of the efficacy of everolimus, and their intensities change dynamically when cells are resistant to everolimus. Furthermore, mTOR resistance is not only consequence of the AKT/mTOR pathway but also through the LKB1 or MAPK/ERK pathway. The LKB1 and pho-GSK3β may also be potential predictive markers for everolimus. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Adoptive donor immunity protects against resolved hepatitis B virus reactivation after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the world's largest retrospective cohort study","2019","Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) by reverse seroconversion (HBV-RS) after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can occur in patients with resolved HBV infection (rHBV, defined as negative HBV surface antigen [HBsAg] and positive HBV core antibody), and may cause fatal hepatitis. To explore the risk factors, we retrospectively identified 817 consecutive patients who underwent allo-HSCT from 2005 to 2016 in this largest single centre cohort from National Taiwan Univerisity Hospital. Transplants using donors or recipients positive for HBsAg or HBV DNA were excluded, leaving 445 rHBV patients for analysis. The 3- and 5-year cumulative incidence of HBV-RS after allo-HSCT was 8·7% and 10·5%, respectively, at a median 16?months after allo-HSCT. All had concurrent HBV reactivation. HBV flares developed in 19% of HBV-RS cases, but none experienced hepatic failure. Neither did it impact non-relapse mortality or overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with donor lacking hepatitis B surface antibody and extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) have the highest risk for HBV-RS, with 5-year incidence of 24·2%. In conclusion, adoptive immunity transfer from the donor seems to have protective effects against HBV-RS, which may alter future donor selection algorithms, and combined with extensive cGVHD provides a good target for risk-adaptive HBV prophylaxis. ? 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","hepatitis B surface antibody; adaptive immunity; adoptive donor immunity; adult; aged; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; chronic graft versus host disease; cohort analysis; disease exacerbation; donor; female; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; liver failure; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; reverse seroconversion; risk factor; seroconversion; virus reactivation"

Results: Nine cross-sectional studies, four prospective studies, and one retrospective report that, respectively, involved 37 536, 9295, and 80 adolescents were included in the meta-analysis. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that adolescents with sleep disturbances were at higher risks of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts (pooled odds ratios [ORs] = 2.35, 1.58, and 1.92) than those without sleep disturbances. Prospective reports indicated that sleep disturbances in adolescents significantly predicted the risk of suicidal ideation but not suicide attempts (pooled ORs = 1.79 and 1.98, 95% confidence intervals = 1.36-2.36 and 0.62-6.29, respectively). The retrospective study did not support the association between sleep disturbances and suicide attempts. Depression did not moderate the associations between sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation or attempts in adolescents. Adolescents with insomnia complaints had a higher risk of suicidal ideation than those with other sleep complaints. Age, the female percentage, and reliable sleep measures were significant moderators (all p < .05). Conclusions: Sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia, should be considered an influencing factor when developing preventive strategies against adolescent suicidal ideation. Additional prospective studies are warranted to establish causality of sleep disturbances in youth suicide plans and attempts. ?

"Absolute bioavailability, tissue distribution, and excretion of erinacine S in hericium erinaceus mycelia","2019","Erinacine S, so far known to have been produced only in Hericium erinaceus mycelia, has just recently been discovered and is able to reduce amyloid plaque growth and improve neurogenesis in aged brain of rats. However, few investigations have been conducted on the absorption, distribution, and excretion study of Erinacine S. This study aimed to investigate the absolute bioavailability, tissue distribution, and excretion of Erinacine S in H. Erinaceus mycelia in eight-week old Sprague-Dawley rats. After oral administration and intravenous administration of 2.395 g/kg body weight of the H. erinaceus mycelia extract (equivalent to 50 mg/kg body weight Erinacine S) and 5 mg/kg of Erinacine S, respectively, the absolute bioavailability was estimated as 15.13%. In addition, Erinacine S was extensively distributed in organs such as brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The maximum concentration of Erinacine S was observed in the stomach, 2 h after the oral administration of H. erinaceus mycelia extract, whereas the maximum amount of Erinacine S found in other tissues were seen after 8 h. Total amount of unconverted Erinacine S eliminated in feces and urine in 24 h was 0.1% of the oral dosage administrated. This study is the first to show that Erinacine S can penetrate the blood–brain barrier of rats and thus support the development of H. erinaceus mycelia, for the treatment of neurological diseases. ? 2019 by the authors.","erinacine S; sesterterpene; amyloid plaque; animal; Basidiomycetes; bioavailability; brain; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; human; metabolism; mycelium; nervous system development; pathology; rat; tissue distribution; Animals; Basidiomycota; Biological Availability; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Mycelium; Neurogenesis; Plaque, Amyloid; Rats; Sesterterpenes; Tissue Distribution"
"Biofunctional core-shell polypyrrole-polyethylenimine nanocomplex for a locally sustained photothermal with reactive oxygen species enhanced therapeutic effect against lung cancer","2019","Background: Polymeric delivery systems have been elucidated over the last few years as an approach of achieving high therapeutic effect to the local site of malignant disease patients who have cancer. Polypyrrole (Ppy) is a potential organic conducting polymer which has long been recognized as a versatile material due to its excellent stability, conductive properties, and great absorbance in the range of near-infrared (NIR). It is tremendously versatile for use in various biomedical fields such as cancer therapy. NIR irradiation-activated treatment platform technologies are now being considered to be novel and exciting options in potential nanomedicine. However, the realistic photothermal use of Ppy-applied nanomaterials is yet in its early phase, and there are a few disadvantages of Ppy, such as its water insolubility. In the clinic, the common approach for treatment of lung cancer is the delivery of therapeutic active substances through intratumoral administration. Nevertheless, the tumor uptake, regional retention, mechanism of treatment, and tissue organ penetration regarding the developed strategy of this nanomaterial with photothermal hyperthermia are important issues for exerting effective cancer therapy. Materials and methods: In this study, we developed a cationic Ppy-polyethylenimine nanocomplex (NC) with photothermal hyperthermia to study its physicochemical characteristics, including size distribution, zeta potential, and transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared morphology. We also examined the cellular uptake effect on lung cancer cells, the photothermal properties, intracellularly generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytotoxicity. Results: The results suggested that this nanocarrier system was able to effectively attach onto lung cancer cells for subsequent endocytosis. The NCs taken up were able to absorb NIR and then converted the NIR light into local hyperthermia with its intracellular photothermal performance to provide local hyperthermic treatment. This regionally generated hyperthermia also induced ROS formation and improved the killing of lung cancer cells as a promising local photothermal therapy. Conclusion: This development of a nanocarrier would bring a novel therapeutic strategy for lung cancer in the future. ? 2019 Chiang and Chuang.","nanocarrier; polypyrrole polyethylenimine nanocomplex; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; nanomaterial; polyethyleneimine; polymer; polypyrrole; pyrrole derivative; reactive oxygen metabolite; Article; cell killing; cell transport; controlled study; cytotoxicity; endocytosis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; human; human cell; lung cancer; NCI-H460 cell line; near infrared radiation; oxidative stress; particle size; photon correlation spectroscopy; photothermal therapy; physical chemistry; radiation; radiation absorption; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; thermotherapy; transmission electron microscopy; zeta potential; cell communication; cell survival; chemistry; fluorescence; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; phototherapy; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Cell Communication; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Fluorescence; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Lung Neoplasms; Nanostructures; Phototherapy; Polyethyleneimine; Polymers; Pyrroles; Reactive Oxygen Species; Surface Properties"
"Progression of chronic kidney disease and the risk of tuberculosis: An observational cohort study","2019","BACKGROUND: Little is known about tuberculosis (TB) risk in the earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between CKD at all stages and the risk of incident TB. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using 100 058 participants of a community-based health screening programme in northern Taiwan, 2005-2008. Renal function was ascertained at baseline using serum creatinine level and the urine dipstick test. The occurrence of active TB was ascertained using the National Tuberculosis Registry. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association between CKD and TB. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.5 years, the number of TB incident cases was 472. In the Cox regression analyses, individuals with Stage 1-4 CKD had a 25% increase in TB hazard than those without disease (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.25, 95%CI 1.02-1.54). A positive correlation between CKD stage and TB was observed (P ? 0.02 for trend). TB risk increased by 5.1% with every 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (aHR 1.05, 95%CI 0.99-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested an increased risk of TB in early-stage CKD. TB prevention efforts should consider individuals with earlier stages of CKD. ? 2019 The Union","adult; Article; body mass; chronic kidney failure; clinical protocol; cohort analysis; community care; controlled study; disease association; disease course; disease registry; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; glucose blood level; health program; human; major clinical study; male; observational study; priority journal; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; Taiwan; tuberculosis"
"Pharmacodynamic Analysis of Daptomycin-treated Enterococcal Bacteremia: It is time to change the breakpoint","2019","Background. Currently, there is debate over whether the daptomycin susceptibility breakpoint for enterococci (ie, minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ?4 mg/L) is appropriate. In bacteremia, observational data support prescription of high doses (>8 mg/kg). However, pharmacodynamic targets associated with positive patient outcomes are undefined. Methods. Data were pooled from observational studies that assessed outcomes in daptomycin-treated enterococcal bacteremia. Patients who received an additional antienterococcal antibiotic and/or a β-lactam antibiotic at any time during treatment were excluded. Daptomycin exposures were calculated using a published population pharmacokinetic model. The free drug area under the concentration-time curve to MIC ratio (fAUC/MIC) threshold predictive of survival at 30 days was identified by classification and regression tree analysis and confirmed with multivariable logistic regression. Monte Carlo simulations determined the probability of target attainment (PTA) at clinically relevant MICs. Results. Of 114 patients who received daptomycin monotherapy, 67 (58.8%) were alive at 30 days. A fAUC/MIC >27.43 was associated with survival in low-acuity (n = 77) patients (68.9 vs 37.5%, P = .006), which remained significant after adjusting for infection source and immunosuppression (P = .026). The PTA for a 6-mg/kg/day (every 24 hours) dose was 1.5%-5.5% when the MIC was 4 mg/L (ie, daptomycin-susceptible) and 91.0%-97.9% when the MIC was 1 mg/L. Conclusions. For enterococcal bacteremia, a daptomycin fAUC/MIC >27.43 was associated with 30-day survival among low-acuity patients. As pharmacodynamics for the approved dose are optimized only when MIC ?1 mg/L, these data continue to stress the importance of reevaluation of the susceptibility breakpoint. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"What's wrong with neutrophils in lupus?","2019","Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) act by promoting phagocytosis, and are regarded as the first line of defense against pathogen invasion. However, recent investigations have revealed that they have many previously unknown functions. These functions include mitogen-induced cell-mediated cytotoxicity, production of cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and ectosomes/exosomes. Membrane exchange (trogocytosis) is also noted following direct cell-cell contact with other immune cells for modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. These observations strongly suggest that neutrophils may play an important role in the immune network. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototype of systemic autoimmune diseases characterised by the production of diverse antigen-driven autoantibodies against intra- and extracellular molecules. Multiple immune dysfunctions have been reported in SLE patients. These include excessive interferon alpha (IFN-α) expression, aberrant cytokine/chemokine/growth factor production, skewing of T cell immune responses toward Th2 and Th17 pathways, polyclonal B cell activation, increased apoptosis and NET formation, defective clearance of cell debris and NET-related molecules, and abnormal ectosome/exosome release in the plasma. We have demonstrated that SLE-PMNs per se exhibit aberrant cytokine/chemokine expression, defective glucose metabolism, and increased mitochondrial DNA D310 heteroplasmy with reduced redox capacity. Our data also indicate that autoantibodies purified from SLE sera disrupt PMN functions. In the present review, we discuss these abnormalities in detail and attempt to elucidate the potential roles of disrupted PMN functions in lupus pathogenesis.","discoid lupus erythematosus; extracellular trap; human; immunology; neutrophil; phagocytosis; systemic lupus erythematosus; Extracellular Traps; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Neutrophils; Phagocytosis"
"Stenosis and revascularization of the coronary artery are associated with outcomes in presumed cardiogenic arrest survivors: A multi-center retrospective cohort study","2019","Background: The emergent coronary angiography (CAG) is associated with better outcomes in CA survivors. However, the impact of severity and revascularization of coronary artery stenosis on outcomes in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors remains unclear. Methods: A total of 273 non-traumatic adult CA survivors who underwent emergent CAG from January 2011 to July 2017 were retrospectively recruited. The stenosis and non-revascularization of an individual coronary artery ?70% were defined as significant in any of the major coronary arteries based on an operator visual estimate. Results: There were 201 patients (73.63%) had ≧1 significant coronary artery stenosis and 58 patients (21.25%) with ≧1 non-revascularized coronary artery. The increased number of stenosed coronary artery was associated with an increased risk for in-hospital mortality [1-vessel: adjusted hazard ration (HR) 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.43–4.04, p = 0.021; 2-vessel: adjusted HR 5.49, 95% CI=2.17–13.89, p < 0.001; 3-vessel: adjusted HR 11.05, 95% CI=4.20–29.04, p < 0.001)] and poor neurological recovery (cerebral performance category = 3–5) [(1-vessel: adjusted odds ration (OR) 1.66, 95% CI 0.67–4.15, =0.275; 2-vessel: adjusted OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.05–3.97, p = 0.045; 3-vessel: adjusted OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.25–8.15, p = 0.001)], which was positively correlated with the number of vessels. The incomplete revascularization were also associated with increased in-hospital mortality and poor neurological function in patients with ≧1vessel stenosis. Conclusion: The severity and incomplete revascularization of coronary artery stenosis were associated with increased in-hospital mortality and poor neurological recovery in patients with presumed cardiogenic arrest. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","inotropic agent; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; convalescence; coronary artery obstruction; coronary artery recanalization; extracorporeal oxygenation; heart arrest; hospital mortality; human; induced hypothermia; major clinical study; medical record review; outcome assessment; priority journal; resuscitation; retrospective study; return of spontaneous circulation"
"P53 ICE CRIM mouse: A tool to generate mutant allelic series in somatic cells and germ lines for cancer studies","2019","The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology facilitates somatic genome editing to reveal cooperative genetic interactions at the cellular level without extensive breeding between different mutant animals. Here we propose a transgenic inducible Cas9 effector-CRISPR mutagen (ICE CRIM) mouse model in which CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic mutagenesis events can occur in response to Cre expression. The well-known tumor suppressor gene, Trp53, and 2 important DNA mismatch repair genes, Mlh1 and Msh2, were selected to be our somatic mutagenesis targets. Amplicon-based sequencing was performed to validate the editing efficiency and to identify the mutant allelic series. Crossed with various Cre lines, the Trp53 ICE CRIM alleles were activated to generate targeted cancer gene somatic or germ line mutant variants. We provide experimental evidence to show that an activated ICE CRIM can mutate both targeted alleles within a cell. Simultaneous disruption of multiple genes was also achieved when there were multiple single-guide RNA expression cassettes embedded within an activated ICE CRIM. Our mouse model can be used to generate mutant pools in vivo, which enables a functional screen to be performed in situ. Our results also provide evidence to support a monoclonal origin of hematopoietic neoplasms and to indicate that DNA mismatch repair deficiency accelerates tumorigenesis in Trp53 mutant genetic background. ?

"Cognitive impairment in patients with end-stage renal disease: Accelerated brain aging?","2019","Background: Chronic kidney disease exhibits a prominent premature aging phenotype in many different organ systems, including the brain. Nevertheless, a comprehensive characterization of brain aging in non-demented patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is lacking and it remains unclear if the collective changes of cognitive functions and brain structures in ESRD is compatible with aging. Methods: We compared 56 non-demented, independently living dialysis patients (mean age 59.4 ± 11.0 years; mean dialysis vintage of 5.9 years) and 60 non-dialysis controls on a battery of neuropsychological tests, brain MRI T1 imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Participants with diagnosis of dementia, Mini-Mental State Examination <24, medical history of stroke, or recent hospitalization within 1 month were excluded. Results: Dialysis patients showed significantly worse performance in attention/information processing speed and executive function adjusted for age, sex, education, diabetes and depression. Reduced total brain volume and subcortical volume including hippocampus were found in dialysis patients. Vertex-wise analysis showed cortical thinning in middle frontal, lateral occipital and precuneus region. Furthermore, decreased white matter integrity was found primarily in bilateral anterior thalamic tract, fronto-occipital fasciculus, forceps minor and uncinate tract after correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: Overall, differences in cognitive functions, cortical volumes/thickness and white matter integrity associated with dialysis are also cognitive domains and brain structure changes associated with normal aging. In other words, non-demented, independently living dialysis patients present an accelerated brain aging phenotype even after taking into account effects of age, diabetes and depression. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","adult; aged; aging; amygdala; Article; attention; brain size; capsula interna; caudate nucleus; cognitive defect; controlled study; corona radiata (brain); cortical thickness (brain); depression; diabetes mellitus; diffusion tensor imaging; end stage renal disease; executive function; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; Geriatric Depression Scale; globus pallidus; gray matter; hemodialysis; hemodialysis patient; hippocampus; human; hypertension; independent living; inferior longitudinal fasciculus; information processing; major clinical study; male; medial frontal cortex; mental performance; middle frontal gyrus; Mini Mental State Examination; neuropsychological test; nucleus accumbens; occipital gyrus; occipitofrontal fasciculus; peritoneal dialysis; postcentral gyrus; precuneus; processing speed; putamen; pyramidal tract; Stroop test; subcortex; thalamus; thalamus anterior nucleus; trail making test; uncinate fasciculus; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; Wechsler memory scale; white matter; adverse event; aging; brain; brain mapping; chronic kidney failure; cognition; cognitive defect; complication; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; Taiwan; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Renal Dialysis; Taiwan"
"Postarrest Steroid Use May Improve Outcomes of Cardiac Arrest Survivors","2019","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the ramifications of steroid use during postarrest care. DESIGN: Retrospective observational population-based study enrolled patients during years 2004-2011 with 1-year follow-up. SETTING: Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. PATIENTS: Adult nontraumatic cardiac arrest patients in the emergency department, who survived to admission. INTERVENTIONS: These patients were classified into the steroid and nonsteroid groups based on whether steroid was used or not during hospitalization. A propensity score was used to match patient underlying characteristics, steroid use prior to cardiac arrest, the vasopressors, and shockable rhythm during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hospital level, and socioeconomic status. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 5,445 patients in each group after propensity score matching. A total of 4,119 patients (75.65%) in the steroid group died during hospitalization, as compared with 4,403 patients (80.86%) in the nonsteroid group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.70-0.77; p < 0.0001). The mortality rate at 1 year was significantly lower in the steroid group than in the nonsteroid group (83.54% vs 87.77%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.76; p < 0.0001). Steroid use during hospitalization was associated with survival to discharge, regardless of age, gender, underlying diseases (diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma), shockable rhythm, and steroid use prior to cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective observational study, postarrest steroid use was associated with better survival to hospital discharge and 1-year survival.","steroid; aged; epidemiology; female; heart arrest; human; male; mortality; propensity score; retrospective study; survivor; Taiwan; treatment outcome; Aged; Female; Heart Arrest; Humans; Male; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Steroids; Survivors; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"The safety and immunogenicity of a cell-derived adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine – A phase I randomized clinical trial","2019","Background: Development of an efficacious egg-free mock-up H5N1 vaccine is key to our preparedness against pandemic avian flu. Methods: This is a single-center, randomized, observer-blinded phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of an alum-adjuvanted Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-derived inactivated whole-virion H5N1 influenza vaccine in healthy adults. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing antibody titers were measured using horse and turkey red blood cells (RBCs). Results: Thirty-six adult subjects were randomized to receive two doses of 0.5 mL of the MDCK-derived H5N1 alum-adjuvanted vaccine containing 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin (HA) 21 days apart. The candidate vaccine was well tolerated and safe across the three dosing groups. The most frequent adverse event was injection site pain (46.5%). Both HAI and neutralizing antibody titers increased after each vaccination in all three dosing groups. The best HAI responses, namely a seroconversion rate of 91.7% and a geometric mean ratio of 9.51 were achieved with the HA dose of 30 μg assayed using horse RBCs at day 42. HAI titers against H5N1 avian influenza virus was significantly higher when measured using horse RBCs compared with turkey RBCs. Conclusions: This Phase I trial showed the MDCK-derived H5N1 candidate vaccine is safe and immunogenic. The source of RBCs has a significant impact on the measurement of HAI titers (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01675284.). ? 2019","aluminum potassium sulfate; influenza vaccine; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; neutralizing antibody; adult; animal cell; antibody response; antibody titer; arthralgia; Article; controlled study; coughing; dermatitis; drug safety; drug tolerability; dysmenorrhea; erythrocyte; fatigue; female; headache; hemagglutination inhibition; horse; human; human experiment; Influenza A virus (H5N1); injection site bleeding; injection site erythema; injection site pain; injection site pruritus; injection site reaction; injection site swelling; male; MDCK cell line; middle aged; myalgia; nonhuman; open study; phase 1 clinical trial; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rigor; seroconversion; single blind procedure; turkey (bird); vaccine immunogenicity; young adult"
"Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and risk of disability among an elderly population","2019","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental pollutants. Exposure to PAHs is associated with several adverse health outcomes. However, no previous study has examined the relationship between PAH exposure and functional dependence in an elderly population. Our aim was to examine whether PAH exposure was associated with functional dependence including total disability, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), leisure and social activities (LSA), lower extremity mobility (LEM), and general physical activities (GPA) in an elderly population. A total of 5816 elderly adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2001 to 2006 were examined. PAH exposure was measured by urinary biomarkers. Functional dependence was assessed by 19 structured questions. The association between PAH exposures with functional dependence was performed by using a multivariable linear regression model. After adjusting for pertinent variables, positive associations were observed between the total number of disabilities and 2-naphthalene and 1-pyrene quartiles (all P trend &lt; 0.05). There was a dose-dependent relationship between 1-pyrene quartiles and all functional dependence domains, and the higher quartile of 1-pyrene was more closely associated with functional impairment (all P trend &lt; 0.05). PAH exposure is associated with functional dependence in American elderly adults. Future research is needed to bring to light the pathophysiological underlying mechanisms related to these findings. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","biomarker; disability; dose-response relationship; elderly population; health risk; health survey; PAH; pollution exposure; public health; Central America; North America; South America; biological marker; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; adult; aged; analysis; daily life activity; disabled person; environmental exposure; female; human; male; middle aged; nutrition; pollutant; risk assessment; statistics and numerical data; United States; urine; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Disabled Persons; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Risk Assessment; United States"

"Risk of cardiovascular events associated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in patients with diabetes with and without chronic kidney disease: A nationwide cohort study","2019","Background Cardiovascular events associated with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) have raised significant safety concerns. This study assessed the association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Study design A retrospective cohort study using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Settings and participants Our study included patients with type 2 diabetes who received OHAs between March 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. All eligible subjects were classified into CKD and non-CKD cohorts and further categorized as the DPP-4i and non-DPP-4i users in each cohort. Methods The DPP-4i and non-DPP-4i groups were matched 1:1 by propensity score to attenuate potential selection bias. Propensity score was estimated by logistic regression, using demographics, co-medications, comorbidities. and adapted diabetic complication severity index at baseline. Outcomes Outcomes of interest included a composite endpoint of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death (major adverse cardiac events [MACE]), and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF). COX proportional hazard models were applied to examine the association between DPP-4i and outcomes of interest. Results We identified 37,641 and 87,604 patients with type 2 diabetes with and without CKD, respectively. After propensity score matching, 8,213 pairs of CKD patients and 12,313 pairs of non-CKD patients were included for analysis. In the CKD cohort, DPP-4i were associated with a 25% increased risk of hHF (DPP-4i vs. non-DPP-4i incidence/1,000 person-years: 15.0 vs. 9.9, HR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.01–1.54, p = 0.037) but not with the risk of MACE (HR = 0.89, p = 0.144). In the non-CKD cohort, DPP-4i were associated with a lower risk of MACE (DPP-4i vs. non-DPP-4i incidence/1,000 person-years: 9.8 vs. 12.6 HR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.61–0.87, p = 0.0007), but not the risk of hHF (HR = 1.09, p = 0.631). Conclusions DPP-4i were found to be associated with decreased risk of MACE in the non-CKD cohort in our study. However, DPP-4i were associated with increased risk of hHF in the CKD cohort. DPP-4i in the CKD cohort should be used cautiously. ? 2019 Huang et al.

"How chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage the tissue: Comparative biology lessons from feather and hair models","2019","Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are common modalities for cancer treatment. While targeting rapidly growing cancer cells, they also damage normal tissues and cause adverse effects. From the initial insult such as DNA double-strand break, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a general stress response, there are complex regulatory mechanisms that control the actual tissue damage process. Besides apoptosis, a range of outcomes for the damaged cells are possible including cell cycle arrest, senescence, mitotic catastrophe, and inflammatory responses and fibrosis at the tissue level. Feather and hair are among the most actively proliferating (mini-)organs and are highly susceptible to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage, thus provide excellent, experimentally tractable model systems for dissecting how normal tissues respond to such injuries. Taking a comparative biology approach to investigate this has turned out to be particularly productive. Started in chicken feather and then extended to murine hair follicles, it was revealed that in addition to p53-mediated apoptosis, several other previously overlooked mechanisms are involved. Specifically, Shh, Wnt, mTOR, cytokine signalling and ROS-mediated degradation of adherens junctions have been implicated in the damage and/or reparative regeneration process. Moreover, we show here that inflammatory responses, which can be prominent upon histological examination of chemo- or radiotherapy-damaged hair follicle, may not be essential for the hair loss phenotype. These studies point to fundamental, evolutionarily conserved mechanisms in controlling tissue responses in vivo, and suggest novel strategies for the prevention and management of adverse effects that arise from chemo- or radiotherapy. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The predominant enterotoxin genotypes and combination profiles of S. aureus were (sea, seb, seg, sei, sem, sen, seo, seu) and (sea, sea-seb, and seg-sei-sem-sen-seo-seu), respectively, and 20% of isolates carried food poisoning-associated enterotoxins. The se profiles in shelter dogs were different from those in general pet dogs and their owners. MRSA isolates were identified as SCCmec IV and VII, and they shared se combination profiles of (sec-seg-sei-sel-sem-sen-seo-seu) and (seb-sek-seq). MRSA in this shelter had similar microbiological characteristics as those reported in CA-MRSA ST59 in humans. Conclusions: Human health-associated bacteria and food poisoning-related toxin genes were identified. Further evaluations of health concerns in animal shelters are necessary. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to focus on se prevalence and MRSA characteristics in an animal shelter in Taiwan. The MRSA characteristics determined in this study were similar to those of CA-MRSA strains isolated from communities in the past, indicating potential health risks in cities. ? 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology","chloramphenicol; clindamycin; cotrimoxazole; erythromycin; oxacillin; rifampicin; Staphylococcus enterotoxin; tetracycline; bacterial DNA; enterotoxin; antibiotic resistance; antibiotics; bacterium; canid; gene; gene expression; genotype; shelter; toxin; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium culture; bacterium isolation; dog; female; genetic analysis; genetic profile; male; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; molecular typing; nonhuman; seasonal variation; summer; winter; animal; genetics; genotype; human; isolation and purification; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbiology; nose cavity; prevalence; season; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; Taiwan; veterinary medicine; Taiwan; Animalia; Canis familiaris; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus aureus; Animals; DNA, Bacterial; Dogs; Enterotoxins; Genotype; Humans; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Nasal Cavity; Prevalence; Seasons; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Taiwan"
"Parasympathetic effect of deep pressure input on third molar extraction in adolescents","2019","Backgroud/Purpose: Deep pressure input is used to normalize physiological arousal due to stress. Third molar extraction is an invasive dental procedure with high stress for the patient, and an alleviation strategy is rarely applied during tooth extraction. In the present study, we investigated the effects of deep pressure input on autonomic responses during the procedures of third molar extraction in healthy adolescents. Methods: A randomized controlled crossover design was used for adolescents who were allocated to experimental and control groups that received intervention with or without deep pressure input, respectively. Autonomic indicators, namely the heart rate, percentage of low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV), percentage of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), and low-frequency/high-frequency heart rate variability ratio (LF/HF-HRV), were assessed at the baseline, during molar extraction, and in the posttreatment phase. Results: The results indicated that third molar extraction caused significant autonomic parameter changes in both groups; however, differential response patterns were observed between two groups. In particular, application of deep pressure input in the experimental group was associated with higher HF-HRV and lower LF/HF-HRV during third molar extraction compared with those in the control group. Conclusion: LF/HF-HRV measurement revealed balanced sympathovagal activation in response to deep pressure application. The present study suggests that the application of deep pressure alters the response of HF-HRV and facilitate maintaining sympathovagal balance during third molar extraction. ? 2019","adolescent; article; controlled study; crossover procedure; dental anxiety; female; heart rate variability; human; male; randomized controlled trial; third molar; tooth extraction"
"Artificial intelligence for the real-time classification of intrapapillary capillary loop patterns in the endoscopic diagnosis of early oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A proof-of-concept study","2019","Background: Intrapapillary capillary loops (IPCLs) represent an endoscopically visible feature of early squamous cell neoplasia (ESCN) which correlate with invasion depth – an important factor in the success of curative endoscopic therapy. IPCLs visualised on magnification endoscopy with Narrow Band Imaging (ME-NBI) can be used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect the presence and classify staging of ESCN lesions. Methods: A total of 7046 sequential high-definition ME-NBI images from 17 patients (10 ESCN, 7 normal) were used to train a CNN. IPCL patterns were classified by three expert endoscopists according to the Japanese Endoscopic Society classification. Normal IPCLs were defined as type A, abnormal as B1–3. Matched histology was obtained for all imaged areas. Results: This CNN differentiates abnormal from normal IPCL patterns with 93.7% accuracy (86.2% to 98.3%) and sensitivity and specificity for classifying abnormal IPCL patterns of 89.3% (78.1% to 100%) and 98% (92% to 99.7%), respectively. Our CNN operates in real time with diagnostic prediction times between 26.17 ms and 37.48 ms. Conclusion: Our novel and proof-of-concept application of computer-aided endoscopic diagnosis shows that a CNN can accurately classify IPCL patterns as normal or abnormal. This system could be used as an in vivo, real-time clinical decision support tool for endoscopists assessing and directing local therapy of ESCN. ?

"The expression profile and prognostic significance of metallothionein genes in colorectal cancer","2019","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease resulting from the combined influence of many genetic factors. This complexity has caused the molecular characterization of CRC to remain uncharacterized, with a lack of clear gene markers associated with CRC and the prognosis of this disease. Thus, highly sensitive tumor markers for the detection of CRC are the most essential determinants of survival. In this study, we examined the simultaneous downregulation of the mRNA levels of six metallothionein (MT) genes in CRC cell lines and public CRC datasets for the first time. In addition, we detected downregulation of these six MT mRNAs’ levels in 30 pairs of tumor (T) and adjacent non-tumor (N) CRC specimens. In order to understand the potential prognostic relevance of these six MT genes and CRC, we presented a four-gene signature to evaluate the prognosis of CRC patients. Further discovery suggested that the four-gene signature (MT1F, MT1G, MT1L, and MT1X) predicted survival better than any combination of two-, three-, four-, five-, or six-gene models. In conclusion, this study is the first to report that simultaneous downregulation of six MT mRNAs’ levels in CRC patients, and their aberrant expression together, accurately predicted CRC patients’ outcomes. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Biocompatible and multifunctional gold nanorods for effective photothermal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinoma","2019","Herein, a cysteine-functionalized alginate was used to replace cytotoxic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on gold nanorods (GNRs) by gold-thiol bonding. The characterization shows that the alginate-modified GNRs (GNR@Alg-Cys) were 137 nm in length (measured by zetasizer) with a negative surface charge (-28.4 mV). The GNR@Alg-Cys showed an intense absorption at 800 nm, indicating the potential of GNR@Alg-Cys for NIR-excited photothermal therapy (PTT). To target cancer cells, a cyclic peptide, c(RGDfK)KKK, was further modified on GNR@Alg-Cys (denoted as GNR@Alg-Cys/RGD). In vitro experiments reveal the apparently enhanced cell viability under a high dose of GNRs as well as the death of SAS-3 cell lines exposed to a single-wavelength laser (808 nm). The animal study revealed that the volume of GNR@Alg-Cys/RGD-treated laser-exposed tumor was reduced five times when compared with that in the case of the control group (PBS-treated tumor). Furthermore, the in vivo toxicity of GNR@Alg-Cys/RGD was evaluated, and no significant effect was observed on the functions of liver and kidneys after PTT. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Amino acids; Biocompatibility; Cell culture; Cells; Gold; Nanorods; Peptides; Plasmons; Tumors; Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide; Control groups; Cyclic peptides; Gold nanorods (GNRs); Negative surface charges; Oral squamous cell carcinomata; Photothermal therapy; Single wavelength lasers; Nanoribbons"
"Applying swanson’s theory of caring to manage powerlessness in an older patient with vasculitis","2019","This case report describes a nursing care experience that applied Swanson’s Caring Theory to a powerless elderly patient who was suffering from vasculitis problems that had made her incapable of walking and had delayed her discharge from the hospital. The associated health problems, including impaired physical mobility, infection, and powerlessness, were affirmed after an integrated physical, psychological, social, and spiritual assessment was conducted during the nursing care period, which lasted between April 26th and May 5th, 2018. The five categories (knowing, being with, doing for, enabling, maintaining belief) of Swanson’s Caring Theory were applied. The patient was encouraged to participate in the treatment plan and motivated to participate in rehabilitation. In addition, the caring capacity and care confidence of family members was enhanced in order to support the patient’s further care after discharge. Furthermore, religious support was involved, which allowed the patient to communicate her emotions, reduce her stress, and achieve spiritual comfort. By providing care in the realms of physiology, psychology, and spirit, the author helped the patient regain her self-worth and enhance her positive beliefs in the future. This case report is hoped to provide medical staffs with a reference for facilitating the recovery of elderly patients experiencing disease-related powerlessness. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Religion and spirituality as predictors of patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease around the globe","2019","Aims: Religion and spirituality can be resources for internal strength and resilience, and may assist with managing life's challenges. Prior studies have been undertaken primarily in countries with high proportions of religious/spiritual people. We investigated (i) whether being religious/spiritual is an independent predictor of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in a large international sample of adults with congenital heart disease, (ii) whether the individual level of importance of religion/spirituality is an independent predictor for PROs, and (iii) if these relationships are moderated by the degree to which the respective countries are religious or secular. Methods and results: APPROACH-IS was a cross-sectional study, in which 4028 patients from 15 countries were enrolled. Patients completed questionnaires to measure perceived health status; psychological functioning; health behaviors; and quality of life. Religion/spirituality was measured using three questions: Do you consider yourself religious or spiritual?; How important is religion, spirituality, or faith in your life?; and If religious, to what religion do you belong?. The country level of religiosity/secularity was appraised using data from the Gallup Poll 2005–2009. General linear mixed models, adjusting for patient characteristics and country differences were applied. Overall, 49.2% of patients considered themselves to be religious/spiritual. Being religious/spiritual and considering religion/spirituality as important in one's life was positively associated with quality of life, satisfaction with life and health behaviors. However, among patients living in more secular countries, religion/spirituality was negatively associated with physical and mental health. Conclusion: Religiosity/spirituality is an independent predictor for some PROs, but has differential impact across countries. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; congenital heart disease; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; health behavior; health status; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; life satisfaction; major clinical study; male; mental health; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; religion; scoring system; clinical trial; congenital heart malformation; cultural factor; global health; health status; mental health; morbidity; multicenter study; patient satisfaction; psychology; quality of life; trends; Adult; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Global Health; Health Status; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Morbidity; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Religion; Spirituality"
"The probability of re-treatment after discontinuation of a 3-month versus a 6-month course of solifenacin for female overactive bladder: A prospective randomized controlled study","2019","Objectives: The aim of this study is to compare the re-treatment probabilities after a 3-month versus a 6-month course of antimuscarinic treatment for women with overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). Study design: A prospective randomized controlled study. Main outcome measures: Between-group differences in the probability of re-treatment for OAB between the 3-month and 6-month groups. Methods: Women with OAB were randomly allocated to receive solifenacin (5 mg per day)for a treatment interval of either 3 or 6 months. Results: Ninety-one patients were treated in each group. The probability of re-treatment did not differ between the 3-month and 6-month groups (P = 0.11). Parity (hazard ratio = 1.81, P = 0.001), number of incontinence episodes (hazard ratio = 1.09, P = 0.008)and suboptimal response (hazard ratio = 3.56, P = 0.006)were independent predictors of re-treatment of OAB. Physical limitation, as indicated on the King's Health Questionnaire, was the only independent factor predicting completion of the scheduled treatment period (odds ratio = 1.01, P = 0.008). Conclusions: Prolonged antimuscarinic treatment does not decrease the need for re-treatment of OAB. Nonetheless, female patients with increased parity, more severe incontinence and a suboptimal response to antimuscarinic treatment are more likely to seek re-treatment of OAB due to recurrence of symptoms. In addition, patients with more serious physical limitation related to OAB are more likely to complete the scheduled treatment period. These findings could serve as a guide in clinical consultations regarding antimuscarinic treatment and if taken into consideration in future studies could lower the dropout rate. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","solifenacin; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; solifenacin; urinary tract agent; adult; area under the curve; Article; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; drug withdrawal; female; human; King Health Questionnaire; major clinical study; middle aged; overactive bladder; parity; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; receiver operating characteristic; retreatment; sensitivity and specificity; treatment response; urinary tract disease assessment; urine incontinence; aged; drug administration; overactive bladder; recurrent disease; retreatment; treatment outcome; Aged; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Muscarinic Antagonists; Recurrence; Retreatment; Solifenacin Succinate; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Bladder, Overactive; Urological Agents"
"Effects of epidural analgesia on cancer recurrence and long-term mortality in patients after non-small-cell lung cancer resection: A propensity score-matched study","2019","Objectives: Previous studies showed reductions in recurrence and mortality rate of several cancer types in patients receiving perioperative epidural analgesia. This study aimed to investigate the effects of thoracic epidural analgesia on oncological outcomes after resection for lung cancer. Design: Retrospective study using propensity score matching methodology. Setting: Single medical centre in Taiwan. Participants: Patients with stages I-III non-small-cell lung cancer undergoing primary tumour resection between January 2005 and December 2015 and had either epidural analgesia, placed preoperatively and used intra- and postoperatively, or intravenous analgesia were evaluated through May 2017. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary endpoint was postoperative recurrence-free survival and secondary endpoint was overall survival. Results: The 3-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates were 69.8% (95% CI 67.4% to 72.2%) and 92.4% (95% CI 91% to 93.8%) in the epidural group and 67.4% (95% CI 62.3% to 72.5%) and 89.6% (95% CI 86.3% to 92.9%) in the non-epidural group, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression analysis before matching demonstrated no significant difference in recurrence or mortality between groups (adjusted HR: 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.14 for recurrence; 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.13 for mortality), similar to the results after matching (HR: 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.31; 0.94, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.54). Independent risk factors for both recurrence and mortality were male, higher pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, advanced cancer stage, poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, microscopic necrosis and postoperative radiotherapy. Conclusions: Thoracic epidural analgesia was not associated with better recurrence-free or overall survival in patients receiving surgical resection for stages I-III non-small-cell lung cancer. ? 2019 Author(s).","antineoplastic agent; bupivacaine; carcinoembryonic antigen; fentanyl; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; paracetamol; adult; anesthesia induction; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; controlled study; epidural analgesia; female; follow up; human; lymph vessel metastasis; lymphocytic infiltration; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; patient controlled analgesia; propensity score; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; Taiwan; treatment outcome; tumor differentiation; tumor necrosis"
"Does “hospital loyalty” matter? Factors related to the intention of using a mobile app","2019","Purpose: This study aimed to explore the association between hospital loyalty, perceived usefulness of a mobile app, perceived ease of use of that mobile app, and satisfaction with the app’s use as well as predicting patients’ intended use of the app. Patients and methods: Purposive sampling was adopted in a cross-sectional survey. The participants were outpatients at the traditional Chinese medicine departments of three hospitals in northern Taiwan (n=125). The self-report questionnaire comprised information about sociodemographics and scales related to hospital loyalty, perceived usefulness of the mobile app, its perceived ease of use, satisfaction with its use, and its usage intention. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results: The four factors explained 70% variance in usage intention. The perceived usefulness of the mobile app directly and indirectly affects their usage intention, but its perceived ease of use had only indirect effects on the usage intention. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence the usage intention through satisfaction. The women’s hospital loyalty does not directly affect the usage intention of the mobile app, but indirectly affects it through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the mobile app. Conclusion: Intended use of the app by women is mainly related to their experience of which is usefulness, ease of use and satisfaction of service are the most important factors contributing to continuous use. Hospital loyalty does not directly affect intention to use as expected. The influence of loyalty must be related to the patients’ perception of the product, in terms of usefulness, ease to use, and satisfaction. The finding is helpful to understand patients’ preference and support their behavioral adherence. ? 2019 Lin et al.","adult; article; Chinese medicine; female; human; major clinical study; mobile application; multicenter study; outpatient; perception; questionnaire; sampling; satisfaction; self report; structural equation modeling; Taiwan"
"Attachment avoidance and fearful prosodic emotion recognition predict depression maintenance","2019","Insecure attachment cognitions, emotion recognition biases, and their interaction are important contributors to depression susceptibility. The present study, with a prospective longitudinal design, investigated the role of negative emotion recognition in moderating the linkage from insecure attachment cognitions to elevated depressive symptoms. A sample of 96 depression-prone individuals completed measures for attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, depression symptom severity, and a computerized facial and prosodic emotion recognition task twice with a four-week interval. Results revealed that the interaction between attachment avoidance and fearful prosodic emotion recognition significantly predicted subsequent depressive symptoms. More specifically, greater attachment avoidance with lower accuracy of fearful prosodic emotions at baseline predicted an increase of depressive symptoms over four-week interval. However, no moderating role of emotion recognition in the linkage from attachment anxiety to depression persistence was noted. The present study demonstrates that attachment avoidance and negative emotion recognition may together contribute to the maintenance of depression. The findings may be pertinent to attachment avoidance-related deactivating strategy that appears to be a specific cultural forbearance way for emotion regulation in collectivistic societies. Potential applications and future research are then suggested. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; anxiety; Article; automation; avoidance behavior; controlled study; depression; disease severity; emotion; emotional attachment; facial recognition; fear; female; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; prosodic emotion; prospective study; recognition; task performance; adolescent; depression; emotion; fear; object relation; perception; physiology; psychology; severity of illness index; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Emotions; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Object Attachment; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Social Perception; Young Adult"

"A Benzenoid 4,7-Dimethoxy-5-Methyl-L, 3-Benzodioxole from Antrodia cinnamomea Attenuates Dendritic Cell-Mediated Th2 Allergic Responses","2019","Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in initiating immune responses; however, DCs also induce Th2-related allergic sensitivities. Thus, DCs become a target for therapeutic design in allergic diseases. In this study, we aim to investigate the anti-allergic effect of pure compounds from a medicinal mushroom Antrodia cinnamomea (Ac) on DC-induced allergic responses. We identified a benzenoid compound 4,7-dimethoxy-5-methyl-l,3-benzodioxole (DMB) which may modulate Th2 polarization in bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and in a murine food allergy model. DMB effectively reduced the Th2 adjuvant cholera toxin (CT)-induced BMDC maturation and cytokine production. In studying the mechanism, DMB blocked the molecular processes involved in Th2 induction, including cAMP activation, IL-33 production, and IRF4/Tim4 upregulation, in CT-activated BMDCs. Furthermore, DMB treatment attenuated the symptoms, clinical scores, and Th2 responses of CT-induced ovalbumin (OVA)-specific food allergy in mice at sensitization stage. These results indicated that DMB could suppress DC function for Th2 polarization and mitigate allergic responses. Thus, DMB may have potential to be a novel agent for preventing or treating food allergy. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","4,7 dimethoxy 5 methyl levo,3 benzodioxole; antiallergic agent; aromatic compound; cholera toxin; cyclic AMP; interferon regulatory factor 4; interleukin 33; ovalbumin; plant extract; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiallergic activity; Antrodia camphorata; Article; bone marrow derived dendritic cell; cell maturation; controlled study; cytokine production; drug isolation; drug mechanism; drug synthesis; food allergy; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; polarization; sensitization; Th2 cell; upregulation"
"Formation and risk assessment of trihalomethanes through different tea brewing habits","2019","Trihalomethanes (THMs) are suspected carcinogens and reproductive toxicants commonly found in chlorinated drinking water. This study investigates the formation of THMs and their associated risks during different tea brewing habits. Three main categories of tea (black, oolong, and green) under various brewing conditions and drinking water sources were tested. Tea samples prepared in ordinary thermos flask formed significant levels of total THM (TTHM). The highest TTHM formation came from black tea made with tap water, plausibly due to higher concentrations of reactive THM precursors. Compared with tap water, when the background solution is bottled water or distilled water, less TTHM was observed in prepared tea infusions. The results also revealed that unlike the traditional teapot-based tea serving habit, the removal of THMs is significantly reduced when tea infusion is stored in enclosed containers. Risk assessment analysis based on the survey among tea shop costumers also revealed that cancer risks induced by ingestion of THMs through drinking tea infusions prepared in thermos flask exceeded the tolerable level. Data obtained in this research demonstrated that drinking tea infusions directly from enclosed containers can be a significant source of exposure to THMs. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH","trihalomethane; water; adolescent; adult; analysis; chemistry; dietary exposure; female; human; male; risk assessment; tea; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Dietary Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Risk Assessment; Tea; Trihalomethanes; Water; Young Adult"
"Clinical features of acute human immunodeficiency virus infection in Taiwan: A multicenter study","2019","Background/purpose: Acute HIV infection is characterized by a high concentration of HIV RNA in the plasma and rapid depletion of the CD4 cell count. This multicenter, retrospective observational study aimed to characterize the manifestations of acuteHIV infection in Taiwan. Methods: Between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016, all patients aged 20 years or greater who presented with acute HIV infection were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at diagnosis were collected. Baseline laboratory assessment included hemogram, CD4 count, plasma HIV RNA load (PVL), serologic markers of syphilis and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, and serum biochemistry. Results: The proportion of acute HIV infection was 6.9% among the patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection during the study period. The most common presenting symptoms of acute HIV infection were fever, fatigue, and myalgia. The median PVL at diagnosis was 5.9 log10 copies/ml, and median CD4 count was 307 cells/mm3. A total of 68 patients (27%) had baseline CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3. Multiple logistic regression analysis, showed that the baseline CD4 count (OR, 4.02; p = 0.013) and aspartate aminotransaminase levels (OR, 3.49; p = 0.002) were associated with high PVL (&gt;5 log10 copies/ml); and high baseline PVL (OR, 2.64; p = 0.002) was associated with symptomatic acute HIV infection. Conclusions: Manifestations of acute HIV infection are nonspecific and of wide spectrum ranging from fever to severe illness. A higher proportion of patients with initial CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm3 or less during acute HIV infection warrants early, timely diagnosis and treatment to prevent rapid disease progression. ? 2018","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; creatinine; hemoglobin; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase inhibitor; integrase inhibitor; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; virus RNA; acute HIV infection; adult; antiretroviral therapy; arthralgia; Article; aseptic meningitis; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; blood biochemistry; body weight loss; candidiasis; CD4 lymphocyte count; chlamydiasis; clinical feature; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; condyloma; coughing; cryptococcosis; demography; diarrhea; disease association; fatigue; female; fever; genital ulcer; gonorrhea; headache; Hepatitis A virus; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; laboratory test; leukocyte count; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; mouth ulcer; myalgia; nausea; night sweat; observational study; pharyngitis; plasma; platelet count; pneumocystosis; rash; retrospective study; salmonellosis; syphilis; syphilis serology; Taiwan; urea nitrogen blood level; virus load; vomiting"

"A prospective study of the factors associated with life quality during medical internship","2019","Background Medical interns' quality of life (QOL) are related to patient care quality, but the specific factors responsible for interns' QOL have not been well studied. Herein we presented this nationwide, prospective study to examine the impact of working hours restrictions on the QOL among medical interns. Methods The study recruited 295 medical interns (age: 25.3 ± 2.1, male: 68.1%) from all the 8 medical colleges in Taiwan during the 2012-2013 academic years. Subjects were assessed for QOL by brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOLBREF) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) before and every 3 months during their internship. We also investigated their demographic data, working hours, workload characteristics, such as specialties of internship rotation, acceptance of new patients after 24-hour, and no 24-hour off within 7 days, and self-reported patient related burnout. We used generalized estimation equation to delineate the change of WHOQOL-BREF and PHQ-9 scores during internship. We used multivariate regression analysis to examine the associated factors of QOL. Results WHOQOL-BREF score significantly decreased during internship (baseline: 60.0 ± 9.7, 53.7 ± 9.3 at 3 months, then remained at 55 after 9 months). Acceptance of new patients after 24 hours of continuous duty (β = -2.089), no 24-hour off within 7 days (β = -1.748), score of patient related burnout (β = -2.50), and PHQ-9 depression score (β = -1.02) were associated with lower WHOQOL-BREF score. Working hours was not significantly associated with the QOL (p = .6268). Conclusions Our findings revealed interns' QOL significantly decreased during internship. Acceptance of new patients after 24-hour of continuous duty and patient related burnout predominantly impacted interns' QOL and depression more than working hours did. ? 2019 Lin et al.","adult; article; burnout; case report; clinical article; demography; human; male; medical school; multicenter study; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; prospective study; quality of life assessment; regression analysis; rotation; Taiwan; workload; World Health Organization"
"Taiwan National Newborn Screening Program by Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Mucopolysaccharidoses Types I, II, and VI","2019","Objective: To evaluate the initial cutoff values, rates of screen positives, and genotypes for the large-scale newborn screening program for multiple mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) in Taiwan. Study design: More than 100 000 dried blood spots were collected consecutively as part of the national Taiwan newborn screening programs. Enzyme activities were measured by tandem mass spectrometry from dried blood spot punches. Genotypes were obtained when a second newborn screening specimen again had a decreased enzyme activity. Additional clinical evaluation was then initiated based on enzyme activity and/or genotype. Results: Molecular genetic analysis for cases with low enzyme activity revealed 5 newborns with pathogenic alpha-L-iduronidase mutations, 3 newborns with pathogenic iduronate-2-sulfatase mutations, and 1 newborn was a carrier of an arylsulfatase B mutation. Several variants of unknown pathogenic significance were also identified, most likely causing pseudodeficiency. Conclusions: The highly robust tandem mass spectrometry-based enzyme assays for MPS-I, MPS-II, and MPS-VI allow for high-throughput newborn screening for these lysosomal storage disorders. Optimized cutoff values combined with second tier testing could largely eliminate false-positive results. Accordingly, newborn screening for these lysosomal storage disorders is possible. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","iduronate 2 sulfatase; leukocyte enzyme; n acetylgalactosamine 4 sulfatase; algorithm; Article; clinical evaluation; dried blood spot testing; enzyme activity; female; follow up; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genotype; human; Hunter syndrome; Hurler syndrome; major clinical study; male; Maroteaux Lamy syndrome; newborn; newborn screening; priority journal; reference value; Taiwan; tandem mass spectrometry; clinical trial; genetic screening; genetics; Hunter syndrome; Hurler syndrome; morbidity; Morquio syndrome; multicenter study; newborn screening; procedures; reproducibility; retrospective study; tandem mass spectrometry; Dried Blood Spot Testing; Genetic Testing; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Morbidity; Mucopolysaccharidosis I; Mucopolysaccharidosis II; Mucopolysaccharidosis IV; Neonatal Screening; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Tandem Mass Spectrometry"
"Early antiviral therapy reduces the risk of lymphoma in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection","2019","Background: Chronic hepatitis C infection is linked to lymphoma development. Aim: To investigate whether antiviral therapy prevents the risk of HCV-related lymphoma. Methods: Patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database during 2004-2012. We included patients who received pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) antiviral therapy for ?24?weeks (PegIFN/RBV cohort) or hepatoprotectants for ?90?days without antiviral therapy (HCV-untreated cohort). Both cohorts were matched by age, sex, and comorbidities through propensity scores and followed for newly diagnosed lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Results: In total, 24?133 patients were included in both the PegIFN/RBV and HCV-untreated cohort. The lymphoma incidence was significantly higher in the untreated than in the treated cohort (66.48 vs 43.34 per 100?000 person-years, P?=?0.029). After adjusting for confounders, the patients who received PegIFN/RBV therapy were at a lower risk of developing lymphoma compared with the untreated patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-0.96, P?=?0.030). Moreover, this beneficial effect was mainly observed in patients with chronic hepatitis C <60?years old with a relative risk reduction of 51% for all lymphoma (HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.29-0.82, P?=?0.007) and 48% for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.91, P?=?0.022). The risk of all lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma development after antiviral therapy was lowered to that of subjects without HCV. Conclusions: PegIFN/RBV-based antiviral therapy significantly reduced the risk of lymphoma, especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; the reduction was mostly among patients <60?years old. Early antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C is suggested. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","peginterferon; ribavirin; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; macrogol; ribavirin; adult; age distribution; antiviral therapy; Article; cancer incidence; cancer risk; chronic hepatitis C; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; comorbidity; confidence interval; controlled study; data base; female; follow up; hazard ratio; human; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; medical research; national health insurance; nonhodgkin lymphoma; population research; priority journal; propensity score; risk reduction; sex difference; Taiwan; time to treatment; treatment duration; chemistry; chronic hepatitis C; incidence; lymphoma; middle aged; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Cohort Studies; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Incidence; Interferon-alpha; Lymphoma; Male; Middle Aged; Polyethylene Glycols; Ribavirin; Taiwan"
"Sex-specific association between serum uric acid and elevated alanine aminotransferase in a military cohort: The chief study","2019","The study was conducted in order to examine the sex-specific association of serum uric acid (SUA) levels with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in a Taiwanese military cohort. Methods: We made a cross-sectional examination of the sex-specific relationship using 6728 men and 766 women, aged 18-50 years from a large military cohort in Taiwan. SUA levels within the reference range (<7.0 mg/dL for men and <5.7 mg/dL for women respectively) were divided into quartiles and SUA levels greater than the upper reference limits were defined as hyperuricemia. Elevated ALT levels were defined as ?40 U/L. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between each SUA category and elevated ALT levels in men and women, respectively. Results: The prevalence of hyperuricemia and elevated ALT in men were 18.7% and 12.7%, respectively, and in women were 3.3% and 2.1%, respectively. As compared with the lowest SUA quartile, hyperuricemia was associated with elevated ALT in men (odds ratios (OR): 1.62, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.19-2.20) after controlling for age, service specialty, body mass index, metabolic syndrome components, current cigarette smoking, alcohol intake status, and weekly exercise times, but the associations for the other SUA quartiles were null. By contrast, the associations of hyperuricemia (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.10-6.64) and the other SUA quartiles with elevated ALT were null in women. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the relationship between each SUA level and elevated ALT may differ by sex among military young adults. The mechanism for the sex difference requires further investigations. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","alanine aminotransferase; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; alanine aminotransferase; biological marker; uric acid; adult; anthropometric parameters; area under the curve; army; Article; blood biochemistry; blood pressure; body mass; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; disease association; exercise; female; hospital admission; hyperuricemia; male; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; physical activity; prevalence; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; sex factor; smoking; uric acid blood level; adolescent; blood; cardiorespiratory fitness; human; middle aged; physiology; sexual characteristics; soldier; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alanine Transaminase; Biomarkers; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Military Personnel; Retrospective Studies; Sex Characteristics; Uric Acid; Young Adult"
"Potential spatial accessibility of health care resources: An example of four counties and cities in northern Taiwan","2019","Objectives: The purposes of this study were to evaluate potential spatial accessibility of health care resources in four counties and cities in northern Taiwan and examine the provision of medical services in areas with shortages of health care resource to identify the degree to which the potential spatial accessibility of health care resources has been be improved. Methods: We conducted our studying using data concerning population, physicians and medical institutions, travel distance, health insurance mobile health care, and integrated delivery system (IDS) service locations. The study subjects were the populations living in the villages of four counties and cities in northern Taiwan. This study calculated physician to population ratio within a 15-kilometer travel distance and applied this ratio as an indicator of the spatial accessibility of health care resources in the use of the enhanced two-step floating catchment area method. Results: Eleven villages (0.14%) had no physician resources within 15 kilometers, 144 villages (2.84%) were in less accessible areas, and 1,723 villages (97.02%) had sufficient resources within 15 kilometers. After mobile health care and IDS service resources were implemented, the number of villages with insufficient accessibility was reduced to 99 (2.33%). Conclusions: Most of the villages covered by mobile health care and IDS are located in areas with insufficient accessibility. The policies promoting these two services have responded to the actual situation, and there is no obvious misallocation of overall resources. However, 2.33% of the population (174,575) still resides in areas with insufficient medical resources.

"Nobiletin Prevents Trimethylamine Oxide-Induced Vascular Inflammation via Inhibition of the NF-κB/MAPK Pathways","2019","Dietary choline and its containing foods are biotransformed to trimethylamine (TMA) via gut microbial metabolism. Subsequently, as an intermediate molecule, TMA is quickly transported and oxidized in the liver by hepatic flavin monooxygenases to form trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). TMAO was treated as a waste byproduct from choline metabolism, but recent convincing evidence demonstrated the association between the small molecule TMAO and inflammation-related diseases, including blood vessel inflammation and vascular diseases. The scope of this study is to investigate the preventive effect of nobiletin on TMAO-induced blood vessel inflammation. Our results from Western blot showed that the inhibition of TMAO-induced cardiovascular inflammation was correlated with nobiletin-mediated inhibitory effects on NF-κB and MAPK/ERK related pathways. More specifically, nobiletin prevented the oxidative damage of vascular sites (proximal aorta), inhibited the activity of MAPK/ERK, reduced the expression of NF-κB p65 and phospho-NF-κB p65, and consequently decreased the inflammatory response. Flow cytometry analyses showed that nobiletin decreased TMAO-induced apoptosis of HUVEC cells and counteracted TMAO-induced HUVEC cell proliferation. Results from HE staining and immunohistochemical results also showed that nobiletin reduced the degree of inflammation of the proximal aorta in Sprague-Dawley rats. In summary, nobiletin significantly reduced TMAO-induced vascular inflammation via inhibition of the NF-κB/MAPK pathways. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Blood vessels; Cell death; Cell proliferation; Metabolism; Molecules; Cardiovascular inflammation; Flow cytometry analysis; Inflammatory response; Microbial metabolism; Nobiletin; TMAO; Trimethylamine oxide; vascular inflammation; Pathology; flavone derivative; methylamine; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase; nobiletin; transcription factor RelA; trimethyloxamine; animal; aorta; chemically induced; drug effect; female; genetics; human; immunology; liver; male; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vascular disease; Animals; Aorta; Female; Flavones; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Liver; Male; Methylamines; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Transcription Factor RelA; Vascular Diseases"
"Bacterial and eukaryote microbiomes of mosquito habitats in dengue-endemic southern Taiwan","2019","Mosquitoes interact with the microbiome of the waters where they oviposit in several ways. Past work suggests adult mosquitoes can detect certain microbes that stimulate oviposition. The presence or absence of certain microbes in water containers thus can attract or repel mosquito species to different containers. I hypothesized that these relationships could be detected via metagenomics. I focused on two container breeders that coexist in Southern Taiwan: the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the less competent vector Ae. albopictus. In addition to culturing, I performed 16S and 18S rDNA metagenomics assays, the latter of which had never been applied to mosquito waters before, to identify the microbial diversity of artificial containers with and without mosquito larvae. I found no correlation between mosquito presence to any features of the containers or to their microbiomes, which instead correlated strongly with location. Microbial diversity across containers was highly variable, even within the same location, with multiple taxa only found in single containers. This variability is reasonable, because mosquito gut microbiomes are also extremely variable. The possibility remains that microbes in natural containers differ significantly from those in artificial containers, and that these differences drive Aedes preferences for human-associated containers. Broad, single-microbe experimental work is recommended to identify possible attractant or repellent microbial taxa. ? 2019 Korean Society of Applied Entomology",""

"Segments in the Amyloid Core that Distinguish Hamster from Mouse Prion Fibrils","2019","Prion diseases are transmissible fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and other mammals. The disease transmission can occur between different species but is limited by the sequence homology between host and inoculum. The crucial molecular event in the progression of this disease is prion formation, starting from the conformational conversion of the normal, membrane-anchored prion protein (PrPC) into the misfolded, β-sheet-rich and aggregation-prone isoform (PrPSc), which then self-associates into the infectious amyloid form called prion. Amyloid is the aggregate formed from one-dimensional protein association. As amyloid formation is a key hallmark in prion pathogenesis, studying which segments in prion protein are involved in the amyloid formation can provide molecular details in the cross-species transmission barrier of prion diseases. However, due to the difficulties of studying protein aggregates, very limited knowledge about prion structure or prion formation was disclosed by now. In this study, cross-seeding assay was used to identify the segments involved in the amyloid fibril formation of full-length hamster prion protein, SHaPrP(23–231). Our results showed that the residues in the segments 108–127, 172–194 (helix 2 in PrPC) and 200–227 (helix 3 in PrPC) are in the amyloid core of hamster prion fibrils. The segment 127–143, but not 107–126 (which corresponds to hamster sequence 108–127), was previously reported to be involved in the amyloid core of full-length mouse prion fibrils. Our results indicate that hamster prion protein and mouse prion protein use different segments to form the amyloid core in amyloidogenesis. The sequence-dependent core formation can be used to explain the seeding barrier between mouse and hamster. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","amyloid; prion protein; thioflavine; amyloid; peptide fragment; prion protein; amino acid sequence; Article; fibril; hamster; in vitro study; mouse; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; priority journal; animal; metabolism; protein multimerization; Amyloid; Animals; Cricetinae; Mice; Peptide Fragments; Prion Proteins; Protein Multimerization"
"Nucleolin is a functional binding protein for salinomycin in neuroblastoma stem cells","2019","The aim of this study is to illuminate a novel therapeutic approach by identifying a functional binding target of salinomycin, an emerging anticancer stem cell (CSC) agent, and to help dissect the underlying action mechanisms. By utilizing integrated strategies, we identify that nucleolin (NCL) is likely a salinomycin-binding target and a critical regulator involved in human neuroblastoma (NB) CSC activity. Salinomycin markedly suppresses NB CD34 expression and reduces CD34+ cell population in an NCL-dependent manner via disruption of the interaction of NCL with CD34 promoter. The elevated levels of NCL expression in NB tumors are associated with poor patient survival. Altogether, these results indicate that NCL is likely a novel functional salinomycin-binding target that exhibits the potential to be a prognostic marker for NB therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Action mechanisms; Binding proteins; Elevated level; Human neuroblastoma; Integrated strategy; Neuroblastomas; Patient survivals; Prognostic markers; Stem cells; binding protein; CD34 antigen; nucleolin; salinomycin; antigen expression; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer stem cell; cancer survival; cell population; controlled study; drug protein binding; drug targeting; human; human cell; inhibition kinetics; neuroblastoma; promoter region; protein expression; protein interaction"
"Using a smartwatch with real-time feedback improves the delivery of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation by healthcare professionals","2019","Aim: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quality affects survival after cardiac arrest. We aimed to investigate if a smartwatch with real-time feedback can improve CPR quality by healthcare professionals. Methods: An app providing real-time audiovisual feedback was developed for a smartwatch. Emergency Department (ED) professionals were recruited and randomly allocated to either the intervention group wearing a smartwatch with the preinstalled app, or to a control group. All participants were asked to perform a two-minute CPR on a manikin at a 30:2 compression-ventilation ratio. Primary outcomes were the mean CCR and CCD measured on the manikin. A secondary outcome was the percentage of chest compressions meeting both the guideline-recommended rate (100–120 min ?1 ) and depth (50–60 mm) of high-quality CPR during a 2-min period. Differences between groups were evaluated with t-test, Chi-Square test, or Mann–Whitney U test depending on the distribution. Results: Eighty participants were recruited. 40 people were assigned to the intervention and 40 to the control group. The compression rates (mean ± SD, min ?1 ) were significantly faster (but above the guideline recommendation, P &lt; 0.001) in the control (129.1 ± 14.9) than in the intervention group (112.0 ± 3.5). The compression depths (mean ± SD, mm) were significantly deeper (P &lt; 0.001) in the intervention (50.9 ± 6.6) than in the control group (39.0 ± 8.7). The percentage (%) of high-quality CPR was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) in the intervention (median 39.4, IQR 27.1–50.1) than in the control group (median 0.0, IQR 0.0?0.0). Conclusion: Without real-time feedback, chest compressions tend to be too fast and too shallow. CPR quality can be improved with the assistance of a smartwatch providing real-time feedback. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; auditory feedback; clinical evaluation; controlled study; emergency nurse practitioner; emergency physician; emergency ward; female; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care quality; human; intervention study; male; mobile application; outcome assessment; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; registered nurse; resuscitation; simulation training; visual feedback"

Measurements of cell proliferation by estimation of DNA synthesis with several radiolabeled nucleosides have been tested to assess tumor growth. Deoxycytidine can be phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and is incorporated into DNA. This study evaluated a radiofluorinated deoxycytidine analog, 5-[ 18 F]fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine ([ 18 F]FdCyd), as a proliferation probe and compared it with 5-[ 18 F]fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine ([ 18 F]FdUrd), 3′-deoxy-3'-[ 18 F]fluorothymidine ([ 18 F]FLT), and [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([ 18 F]FDG) in a tumor-bearing mouse model. [ 18 F]FdCyd was synthesized from two precursors by direct electrophilic substitution. The serum stability and partition coefficient of [ 18 F]FdCyd were evaluated in vitro. Positron emission topography (PET) imaging of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-bearing mice with [ 18 F]FdCyd, [ 18 F]FdUrd, [ 18 F]FLT, and [ 18 F]FDG were evaluated. [ 18 F]FdCyd was stable in mouse serum and normal saline for up to 4 h. With all radiotracers except [ 18 F]FLT, PET can clearly delineate the tumor lesion. [ 18 F]FdCyd and [ 18 F]FdUrd showed high accumulation in the liver and kidney. The SUV and tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratios derived from PET imaging of the radiotracers were [ 18 F]FDG &gt; [ 18 F]FdCyd &gt; [ 18 F]FdUrd &gt; [ 18 F]FLT.

"Sequencing of therapy following first-line afatinib in patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer","2019","Objectives: With the availability of several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), sequential therapy could potentially render EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer a chronic disease in some patients. In this retrospective analysis of EGFR mutation-positive (Del19/L858R) patients receiving first-line afatinib in LUX-Lung 3, 6, and 7, we assessed uptake of, and outcomes following, subsequent therapies including the third-generation EGFR TKI, osimertinib. Methods: Post-progression therapy data were prospectively collected during follow-up. Molecular testing of tumours at progression/discontinuation of afatinib was not mandatory. Duration of subsequent therapies, and survival following osimertinib, were calculated with Kaplan–Meier estimates. Results: Among 553 patients who discontinued first-line afatinib, second-, third- and fourth-line therapy was administered in 394 (71%), 265 (48%), and 156 (28%) patients. The most common post-progression therapy was platinum-based chemotherapy (46%). Thirty-seven patients received subsequent osimertinib, 10 as second-line treatment. Median progression-free survival on afatinib in these 37 patients was 21.9 months. Median duration of osimertinib therapy was 20.2 months; median overall survival was not reached after a median follow-up of 4.7 years. Conclusions: Most patients treated with first-line afatinib received subsequent therapy. Although limited by sample size, enrichment, and a retrospective nature, data from patients who received sequential afatinib and osimertinib are encouraging, warranting further investigation. ? 2019 The Authors","afatinib; cisplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor; gemcitabine; osimertinib; pemetrexed; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer survival; cancer therapy; controlled study; drug withdrawal; EGFR gene; female; follow up; gene mutation; human; major clinical study; male; multiple cycle treatment; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; prospective study; retrospective study; treatment duration"
"Role of PGRMC1 in cell physiology of cervical cancer","2019","Aims: The most frequent cancers among women worldwide. The mortality of cervical cancer has declined significantly primarily due to the widespread use of Pap smear tests as a screening test and therapeutic vaccination. However, cervical cancer still remains a severe disease among the female population, as the prognosis of metastatic cervical cancer is very poor. Key methods: In this study, we performed 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS to analyze differentially expressed proteins between HeLa and invasive HeLa-I5 cells. Key findings: According to our proteomics data, 68 differentially expressed proteins between the HeLa and HeLa-I5 cells were identified. One of these differentially expressed proteins, Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), was selected as a candidate for further studies. To correlate the role of PGRMC1 with cellular migration and cancer progression, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown the expression of PGRMC1. Similar function of PGRMC1 was also observed in two other cervical cancer lines, CaSki and ME-180. Significance: PGRMC1 plays an essential role in regulating cancer progression and metastasis of cervical cancer cells, thus serving as a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer. ? 2019","membrane protein; progesterone receptor membrane component 1; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; membrane protein; PGRMC1 protein, human; progesterone receptor; Article; Ca Ski cell line; cancer growth; cell function; cell migration; cervical adenocarcinoma cell line; controlled study; female; gene knockdown; HeLa cell line; HeLa I5 cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; ME-180 cell line; metastasis; protein expression; protein function; proteomics; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; uterine cervix cancer; cell motion; cell proliferation; genetics; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; metabolism; pathology; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; uterine cervix tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Female; HeLa Cells; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Proteomics; Receptors, Progesterone; RNA, Small Interfering; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"
"Panel-Based Next-Generation Sequencing for the Diagnosis of Cholestatic Genetic Liver Diseases: Clinical Utility and Challenges","2019","Objective: To test the application of a target enrichment next-generation sequencing (NGS) jaundice panel in genetic diagnosis of pediatric liver diseases. Study design: We developed a capture-based target enrichment NGS jaundice panel containing 42 known disease-causing genes associated with jaundice or cholestasis and 10 pathway-related genes. During 2015-2017, 102 pediatric patients with various forms of cholestasis or idiopathic liver diseases were tested, including patients with initial diagnosis of cholestasis in infancy, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, syndromic cholestasis, Wilson disease, and others. Results: Of the 102 patients, 137 mutations/variants in 44 different genes were identified in 84 patients. The genetic disease diagnosis rate was 33 of 102 (32.4%). A total of 79 of 102 (77.5%) of patients had at least 1 heterozygous genetic variation. Those with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis or syndromic cholestasis in infancy had a diagnostic rate of 62.5%. Disease-causing mutations, including ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, ABCC2, TJP2, NR1H4 (FXR), JAG1, AKR1D1, CYP7B1, PKHD1, ATP7B, and SLC25A13, were identified. Nine patients had unpredicted genetic diagnosis with atypical phenotype or novel mutations in the investigational genes. We propose an NGS diagnosis classification categorizing patients into high (n = 24), moderate (n = 9), or weak (n = 25) levels of genotype–phenotype correlations to facilitate patient management. Conclusions: This panel enabled high-throughput detection of genetic variants and disease diagnosis in patients with a long list of candidate causative genes.

"Association of Metformin Use With End-Stage Renal Disease in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Nationwide Cohort Study Under the Pay-for-Performance Program","2019","Animal studies have demonstrated that metformin exerts a renoprotective effect. Human studies of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) regarding the association of metformin use with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are lacking. Patients with type 2 DM and without a history of kidney disease who were enrolled under the pay-for-performance program of the National Health Insurance in Taiwan were identified. Those who received ?90 cumulative defined daily doses of metformin within 1 year were selected (metformin users) and compared with a 1:1 propensity score–matched metformin nonuser cohort. Primary and secondary outcomes were development of ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD), respectively. Independent predictors were investigated using Cox regression analysis. A total of 24?158 pairs of metformin users and nonusers were enrolled, with an incidence of ESRD of 1908 and 1723 and CKD of 1095 and 1056 cases per 100?000 person-years, respectively. Metformin use was independently associated with increased risks of ESRD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.32) and CKD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.40) in a dose-response relationship. Patients with hypertension plus nonuse of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers potentiated kidney damage by metformin.

"Dual-triggered drug-release vehicles for synergistic cancer therapy","2019","Cancer is a complex and tenacious disease. Drug-delivery systems in combination with multimodal therapy strategies are very promising candidates for cancer theranostic applications. In this study, a new drug-delivery vehicle that combine human serum albumin (HSA)- and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS)-coated gold nanorod nanoparticles(GNR/PSS/HSA NPs) was developed for synergistic cancer therapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded onto GNR/PSS/HSA NPs, by electrostatic and hydrophobic forces, to create multimodal DOX@GNR/PSS/HSA NPs. DOX@GNR/PSS/HSA NPs were found to be highly biocompatible and stable in physiological solutions. Furthermore, GNR/PSS/HSA NPs with or without DOX were designed to exhibit strong absorbance in the near-infrared region and high photothermal conversion efficiency. Therefore, bimodal DOX release from DOX@GNR/PSS/HSA NPs could be triggered by an acidic pH and by near-infrared irradiation after NPs preferentially accumulated at tumor sites, leading to a significant chemotherapeutic effect. Moreover, DOX@GNR/PSS/HSA NPs were designed to be applied during chemo- and photo-thermal combination therapy and exhibited a synergistic anticancer effect that was superior to the effect of monotherapy, from both in vitro and in vivo results. These results suggest that DOX@GNR/PSS/HSA NPs are a strong candidate for a nanoplatform for future antitumor therapeutic strategies. ? 2018","Biocompatibility; Body fluids; Chemotherapy; Diseases; Drug products; Gold coatings; Gold nanoparticles; Infrared devices; Nanoribbons; Nanorods; Oncology; Targeted drug delivery; Controlled drug release; Gold nanorod; Human serum albumins; Photothermal conversion efficiencies; Photothermal therapy; Physiological solution; Polysodium 4-styrenesulfonate; Triggered drug release; Controlled drug delivery; doxorubicin; gold nanorod; human serum albumin; polystyrenesulfonate sodium; antineoplastic antibiotic; doxorubicin; gold; human serum albumin; nanotube; polymer; styrenesulfonic acid polymer; sulfonic acid derivative; adsorption; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; aqueous solution; Article; body weight loss; cancer chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell viability; coated particle; concentration response; controlled drug release; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug solubility; endosome; female; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; internalization; lysosome; mouse; nanopharmaceutics; nonhuman; particle size; pH; photothermal therapy; priority journal; static electricity; surface charge; temperature; tumor growth; tumor volume; uterine cervix cancer; zeta potential; animal; chemistry; delayed release formulation; drug formulation; drug release; drug screening; infrared radiation; low level laser therapy; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; multimodality cancer therapy; neoplasm; nude mouse; procedures; subcutaneous drug administration; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Combined Modality Therapy; Delayed-Action Preparations; Doxorubicin; Drug Compounding; Drug Liberation; Female; Gold; HeLa Cells; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Infrared Rays; Injections, Subcutaneous; Low-Level Light Therapy; Mice; Mice, Nude; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Nanotubes; Neoplasms; Polymers; Serum Albumin, Human; Sulfonic Acids; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"

"Development of a nursing-specific Mini-CEX and evaluation of the core competencies of new nurses in postgraduate year training programs in Taiwan","2019","BACKGROUND: Modern nursing requires a broad set of academic and practical skills, and an effective nurse must integrate these skills in a wide range of healthcare contexts. Cultivation of core competencies has recently become a key issue globally in the development of nursing education. To assess the performance of new nurses, this study developed a nursing-specific Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX) to evaluate the effect of postgraduate year (PGY) nurse training programs in Taiwan. METHODS: A nursing-specific Mini-CEX was developed based on the required core competencies of nurses. Reliability and validity were confirmed in evaluator workshops carried out prior to the administration of the pilot test and final test. Thirty-two PYG trainees were recruited with a supervisor-to-trainee ratio of 1:1.94. Data were collected from February to June 2012 and analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The 32 PGY trainees scored highest in the ""nursing professionalism"" dimension and the lowest in the ""physical examination"" dimension. The overall competency score was satisfactory. The trainee nurses with 19-24?months of experience scored higher than the other two groups in overall performance. CONCLUSION: The results of this research indicate the feasibility of using our Mini-CEX tool to evaluate the competencies of PGY trainees.","article; clinical evaluation; exercise; feasibility study; human; human experiment; Kruskal Wallis test; nurse training; physical examination; postgraduate student; professionalism; reliability; Taiwan; validity"
"Congenital generalized lipodystrophy in Taiwan","2019","Background: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare disorder characterized by scarce adipose tissue. This disease is distributed worldwide, but little is known about these patients in the Chinese population. Here, we delineate the phenotype and prognosis of CGL in our cohort. Methods: Patients diagnosed with CGL from 8 medical centers were reviewed. The initial presentation, laboratory findings, and molecular testing were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 16 patients were analyzed, and the current median age was 3.5 years (range, 9 months-17.5 years). In all patients, molecular results confirmed BSCL2 mutation. c.782dupG (p.Ile262Hisfs*12) was the most common genotype identified. All patients had triangular faces and muscular hypertrophy. In addition, 75% presented with hepatomegaly, 19% had cardiomegaly, and 44% exhibited acanthosis nigricans. Developmental delay was noted in 5 out of 9 patients (56%) with a median developmental quotient (DQ)/intelligence quotient (IQ) of 61. Thirteen patients (81.3%) had high triglyceride levels. Eight patients received leptin analysis, and 7 of them (88%) had low leptin levels. One patient exclusively received a lipid-lowering drug, 4 patients were exclusively placed on a fat-restricted diet, 5 patients were administered combination therapy, and 5 patients received no treatment. Three patients (19%) who developed diabetes mellitus received both oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin. Three patients (19%) experienced loss of ambulation and died prematurely. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the uniqueness of the genotype and phenotype in our cohort. Further long-term surveillance for comorbidities is necessary for early detection and management of these patients. ? 2018","fenofibrate; genomic DNA; insulin; leptin; metformin; pioglitazone; triacylglycerol; BSCL2 protein, human; guanine nucleotide binding protein gamma subunit; acanthosis nigricans; adolescent; Article; atrial fibrillation; bscl2 gene; cardiomegaly; child; clinical article; congenital disorder; congenital generalized lipodystrophy; developmental delay; diabetes mellitus; face malformation; female; gene mutation; genotype; heart arrest; hepatomegaly; hormone determination; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; infant; insulin treatment; intelligence quotient; low fat diet; male; muscle hypertrophy; phenotype; pleura effusion; pneumonia; prognosis; respiratory failure; school child; seizure; Taiwan; triacylglycerol level; weakness; Asian continental ancestry group; clinical trial; complication; congenital generalized lipodystrophy; genetics; multicenter study; mutation; phenotype; preschool child; retrospective study; Acanthosis Nigricans; Adolescent; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cardiomegaly; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Genotype; GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits; Humans; Infant; Lipodystrophy, Congenital Generalized; Male; Mutation; Phenotype; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan"
"Pure type-1 collagen application to third molar extraction socket reduces postoperative pain score and duration and promotes socket bone healing","2019","Background/Purpose: Extraction of the third molar may cause post-operative complications. This study assessed whether application of pure type-1 collagen to the third molar extraction socket can reduce post-operative pain score and duration and promote socket bone healing. Methods: Fourteen patients who underwent 20 bilateral and symmetric third molar extractions were included in this study. After two tooth extractions at two different occasions in the same patient, one socket was filled with pure type-1 collagen (experimental group, n = 20) and the other socket received nothing but the blood clot (control group, n = 20). The post-operative pain score and duration, mouth-opening limitation, and the bone density at the socket site were assessed at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 after tooth extraction. Results: Patients in the experimental group had a significantly lower mean post-operative pain score (2.6 ± 1.2) than patients in the control group (4.7 ± 2.0), and had a significantly shorter post-operative pain duration (2.7 ± 1.4 days) than patients in the control group (3.7 ± 1.8 days). We also observed a significantly lower frequency of mouth-opening limitation in 20 experimental-group patients (45%) than in 20 control-group patients (90%, P = 0.007). Moreover, a significantly higher mineralization ratio (10.2%) was found in the experimental socket site than in the control socket site. Conclusion: Application of pure type-1 collagen to the third molar extraction socket can reduce post-operative pain score and duration, decrease the frequency of mouth-opening limitation, and increase mineralization ratio at the extraction socket site. ? 2018","collagen type 1; biomaterial; collagen type 1; adult; Article; blood clot; bone density; bone mineralization; clinical article; controlled study; disease duration; female; follow up; fracture healing; human; male; mandibular third molar; maxillary third molar; operation duration; pain assessment; postoperative pain; postoperative pain score; retrospective study; second molar; tooth extraction; tooth socket; adolescent; mandible; postoperative complication; postoperative pain; Taiwan; third molar; tooth disease; tooth extraction; wound closure; wound healing; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biocompatible Materials; Collagen Type I; Female; Humans; Male; Mandible; Molar, Third; Pain, Postoperative; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Tooth Extraction; Tooth, Impacted; Wound Closure Techniques; Wound Healing; Young Adult"
"White matter microstructure disruptions mediate the adverse relationships between hypertension and multiple cognitive functions in cognitively intact older adults","2019","Although hypertension is a prominent vascular risk factor for late-life cognitive decline, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the role of white matter microstructural integrity in hypertension-related cognitive detriments. We recruited 66 cognitively normal older adults, comprising 41 hypertensive patients and 25 normotensive controls. All participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. White matter microstructural integrity was assessed using a tract-based automatic analysis approach derived from diffusion spectrum imaging. Mediating effects of white matter integrity were evaluated using structural equation modeling analyses. The results revealed that hypertensive older adults displayed poorer processing speed, executive function, and memory encoding. Lower white matter microstructural integrity was observed in the hypertensive elderly patients, primarily in long-range association fiber bundles. In particular, low microstructural integrity in specific tract bundles connecting frontal and posterior cerebral regions was found to underlie the adverse relationships between hypertension and multiple cognitive domains, including processing speed, executive function, memory encoding, and memory retention. Our findings suggest that hypertension may impair multiple cognitive functions by undermining white matter microstructures, even in cognitively intact older adults, thus further highlighting the necessity of monitoring vascular health to prevent cognitive decline. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; age distribution; aged; Article; brain function; brain region; clinical article; cognition; cognition assessment; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; disease association; executive function; female; geriatric patient; human; hypertension; image analysis; image processing; male; memory; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; priority journal; structural equation modeling; tissue structure; very elderly; voxel based morphometry; white matter"
"Involvement of pericardial adipose tissue in cardiac fibrosis of dietary-induced obese minipigs— Role of mitochondrial function","2019","Background: Heart is a high energy demand organ and cardiac fat is the main local energy source for heart. Alteration in cardiac fat may affect cardiac energy and contribute to heart dysfunction. We previously observed a link between alteration in pericardial fat (PAT) and local adverse effects on myocardial fibrosis in obese minipigs. This study investigated the role of PAT on cardiac energy and mitochondrial function, and elucidated a potential mechanism for PAT in cardiac fibrosis. Materials and methods: Five-month-old Lee-Sung minipigs were made obese by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 months. The conditioned medium from PAT of obese minipigs (PAT-CM) was collected and H9C2 cells were treated with it to study mechanisms. Results: HFD caused a cardiac energy deficit and fibrosis in the left ventricle. An elevated content of IL6 and malondialdehyde was found in the PAT of obese pigs. Obese pigs exhibited an increased level of oleic acid and a reduced level of saturated fatty acids in PAT compared to control pigs. HFD did not alter the metabolic characteristics of epicardial fat. PAT-CM caused apoptosis of H9C2 cells and inhibited basal mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Protein expressions for mitochondrial dynamics- (Mfn2, Opa1, Drp1, and Fis1) and a mitophagy-related protein (Parkin) were suppressed by PAT-CM. PAT-CM enhanced the protein expression of LC3II, and the ratio of LC3II/LC3I. To conclude, PAT was involved in cardiac fibrosis of HFD-fed minipigs. The secretomes of PAT impaired mitochondrial functions and caused cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a paracrine manner. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adenosine triphosphate; malonaldehyde; saturated fatty acid; adult; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cell function; controlled study; diet induced obesity; disease course; disorders of mitochondrial functions; energy metabolism; female; H9c2(2-1) cell line; heart left ventricle; heart muscle fibrosis; lipid diet; male; mitochondrial respiration; mitochondrion; mitophagy; nonhuman; pericardial fat; priority journal; protein expression"
"Needlescopic-assisted thoracoscopic pulmonary anatomical lobectomy and segmentectomy for lung cancer: a bridge between multiportal and uniportal thoracoscopic surgery","2019","Purpose: Needlescopic instruments allow us to perform complex laparoscopic procedures, which are almost painless and scarless postoperatively; however, their utilization in thoracoscopic surgery has been limited to minor procedures, including bullectomy and sympathectomy. We present our initial experience of performing thoracoscopic anatomical lung resection via a single utility incision with additional needlescopic working ports and compare the operative results with those of uniportal video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS). Methods: We reviewed data on 75 consecutive patients with lung cancer, who underwent anatomical lung resections, including lobectomy and segmentectomy, between February 2015 and September 2017. Of the 75 patients, 39 underwent uniportal VATS (uniportal group), and 36 underwent needlescopic-assisted VATS (n-VATS group). We compared the peri- and postoperative outcomes of the two groups. Results: The clinical characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups, except in the ages of the patients. The n-VATS group had a shorter operation time (mean 159.3?min vs. 198.8?min, P = 0.023) and lower intraoperative blood loss (mean 40.9?mL vs. 143.2?mL, P = 0.047). Two major pulmonary arterial bleeding events and one conversion to thoracotomy occurred in the uniportal group. Conclusion: Uniportal VATS can be performed more efficiently and safely with the assistance of additional needlescopic ports and instruments, without compromising the benefits of less postoperative pain and early recovery. ? 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","morphine; paracetamol; adult; Article; cancer staging; cancer surgery; carcinoid; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; conversion to open surgery; female; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; intermethod comparison; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; lung lobectomy; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; operation duration; operative blood loss; patient controlled analgesia; patient safety; postoperative analgesia; postoperative pain; retrospective study; sarcomatoid carcinoma; segmentectomy; squamous cell lung carcinoma; surgical anatomy; thoracotomy; thorax drainage; treatment duration; tumor volume; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; aged; devices; lung resection; lung tumor; operative blood loss; postoperative pain; procedures; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Adult; Aged; Blood Loss, Surgical; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Pain, Postoperative; Pneumonectomy; Retrospective Studies; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Treatment Outcome"
"Biomaterial substrate-derived compact cellular spheroids mimicking the behavior of pancreatic cancer and microenvironment","2019","Pancreatic stromal cells especially pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a critical role in the progression of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the exact interaction between cancer cells and PSCs remains to be elucidated in order to develop more effective therapeutic approaches to treat PDAC. The microenvironment of PDAC shows higher hyaluronan (HA) levels, which is associated with poor prognosis of PDAC patients. In the current study, an efficient three-dimensional tumor spheroid model for PDAC was established. The pancreatic cancer cells and PSCs were co-cultured on hyaluronan grafted chitosan (CS-HA) coated plates to generate 3D tumor-like co-spheroids. The pancreatic cancer cells and PSCs (1:9 ratio) co-cultured on CS-HA coated plates were assembled into tumor-like co-spheroids with 3D core-shell structure in 48 h. These spheroids displayed potent in vitro tumorigenicity such as up-regulated expression of stemness and migration markers. The migration rate of cancer cells in spheroids (from 1:9 cell ratio) was much faster (3.2-fold) than that of cancer cells alone. Meanwhile, this unique co-spheroidal cancer cell structure with the outer wrap of PSCs contributed to the chemo-resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine as well as sensitivity to the combined gemcitabine and Abraxane treatment in vitro. The metastatic nature of the spheroids was confirmed by the zebrafish xenograft model in vivo. The compact and dynamic pancreatic cancer-PSC co-spheroids generated by the unique 3D co-culture platform on CS-HA biomaterials can mimic the PSC-constituting microenvironment of PDAC and demonstrate the chemo-resistant, invasive, and metastatic phenotypes. They have potential applications in personalized and high-throughput drug screening. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chitosan; Cytology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Hyaluronic acid; Plates (structural components); Tumors; 3D spheroids; Core shell structure; Ductal adenocarcinomas; High throughput; Metastatic; Microenvironments; Pancreatic cancers; Stellate cells; Cells; biomaterial; chitosan; gemcitabine; hyaluronic acid; paclitaxel; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer resistance; carcinogenicity; cell interaction; cell invasion; cell migration; cell structure; coculture; concentration (parameter); controlled study; drug screening; embryo; high throughput screening; human; human cell; in vitro study; metastasis; nonhuman; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreatic cancer cell line; pancreatic stellate cell; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tumor microenvironment; tumor spheroid; tumor xenograft; upregulation; zebra fish"

"The evolution of spindles and their mechanical implications for cancer metastasis","2019","The mitotic spindle has long been known to play a crucial role in mitosis, orchestrating the segregation of chromosomes into two daughter cells during mitosis with high fidelity. Intracellular forces generated by the mitotic spindle are increasingly well understood, and recent work has revealed that the efficiency and the accuracy of mitosis is ensured by the scaling of mitotic spindle size with cell size. However, the role of the spindle in cancer progression has largely been ignored. Two recent studies point toward the role of mitotic spindle evolution in cancer progression through extracellular force generation. Cancer cells with lengthened spindles exhibit highly increased metastatic potential. Further, interpolar spindle elongation drives protrusive extracellular force generation along the mitotic axis to allow mitotic elongation, a morphological change that is required for cell division. Together, these findings open a new research area studying the role of the mitotic spindle evolution in cancer metastasis. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","kinesin 5; anaphase; Article; astral microtubule; cancer growth; cell size; cytokinesis; extracellular matrix; extracellular space; genetic variability; human; in vitro selection; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; metaphase; metastasis; metastasis potential; microtubule; mitosis; mitosis spindle; molecular evolution; nonhuman; telophase; tumor microenvironment; upregulation"
"Use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and the risk of arthralgia: Population-based cohort and nested case–control studies","2019","Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the administration of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (cumulative duration, timing, and individual substance) and the risk of arthralgia by using a nationwide database with two methodological approaches including cohort and nested case–control study designs. Methods: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified patients who were newly prescribed with DPP-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), or acarbose between 1 March 2009 and 31 December 2012. The exposure of studied drugs was categorized into five exclusive categories: DPP-4 inhibitor, TZD, acarbose, combined use, or non-use, and assessed in a time-varying manner. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between DPP-4 inhibitors and the risk of arthralgia. Particularly, we tested the impact of different cumulative duration, timing, and individual substance of DPP-4 inhibitors use on risk of arthralgia. A corresponding nested case–control study using conditional logistic regression was conducted to verify this association. Results: An increased risk of arthralgia was observed during the first year after initiating DPP-4 inhibitors (adjusted Hazard Ratio?=?1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.75) but the risk declined with cumulative use. This duration–response relation was not found in TZDs use and acarbose use. In the nested case–control study, there was a slightly increased risk of arthralgia (aOR?=?1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12) associated with current DPP-4 inhibitor use. Conclusion: A relatively higher risk of arthralgia was associated with the initial administration of DPP-4 inhibitors, however, the risk declined among long-term users. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acarbose; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; linagliptin; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; vildagliptin; adult; arthralgia; Article; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; drug exposure; female; hazard ratio; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; priority journal; risk factor; survival rate; treatment duration"
"International variation in survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A validation study of the Utstein template","2019","Introduction: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival varies greatly between communities. The Utstein template was developed and promulgated to improve the comparability of OHCA outcome reports, but it has undergone limited empiric validation. We sought to assess how much of the variation in OHCA survival between emergency medical services (EMS) across the globe is explained by differences in the Utstein factors. We also assessed how accurately the Utstein factors predict OHCA survival. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patient-level prospectively collected data from 12 OHCA registries from 12 countries for the period 1 Jan 2006 through 31 Dec 2011. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the variation in survival between EMS agencies (n = 232). Results: Twelve registries contributed 86,759 cases. Patient arrest characteristics, EMS treatment and patient outcomes varied across registries. Overall survival to hospital discharge was 10% (range, 6% to 22%). Overall survival with Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2 (available for 8/12 registries) was 8% (range, 2% to 20%). The area-under-the-curve for the Utstein model was 0.85 (Wald CI: 0.85–0.85). The Utstein factors explained 51% of the EMS agency variation in OHCA survival. Conclusions: The Utstein factors explained 51% of the variation in survival to hospital discharge among multiple large geographically separate EMS agencies. This suggests that quality improvement and public health efforts should continue to target modifiable Utstein factors to improve OHCA survival. Further study is required to identify the reasons for the variation that is incompletely understood. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","epinephrine; adult; aged; Article; emergency health service; female; hospital discharge; human; major clinical study; male; out of hospital cardiac arrest; overall survival; priority journal; prospective study; register; retrospective study; total quality management; treatment outcome; utstein emergency health service; validation study; very elderly"
"Elucidating bidirectional relationship between metabolic syndrome and elevated faecal haemoglobin concentration: A Taiwanese community-based cohort study","2019","Objectives To elucidate the bidirectional temporal relationship between elevated faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) concentration and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Design A longitudinal cohort study was conducted by utilising data on community-based periodical screening for colorectal cancer with faecal immunochemical test (FIT) and health check-up for MetS. Setting Population-based organised integrated service screening in Keelung city, Taiwan. Participants We enrolled a total of 62,293 community residents aged 40-79 years. Main outcomes and measures Bidirectional outcomes of FIT-positive and MetS were measured. Results The presence of MetS at baseline led to a statistically significant 31% elevated risk of being incident FIT-positive (adjusted HR, (aHR)=1.31, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.51) whereas the effect of those with FIT-positive at baseline on incident MetS was not statistically significant (aHR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.25) after adjusting for relevant confounders. Such an effect was particularly noted for three individual components (abnormal waist circumference, higher fasting plasma glucose and lower high-density lipoprotein). Conclusions Our finding on the presence of MetS before FIT-positive based on bidirectional relationship assessment suggests the control of MetS may contribute to reducing the risk of colorectal neoplasia through the early surveillance of f-Hb. However, such a temporal epidemiological finding still needs to be verified by using other external data. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"Correlation of retinal vascular perfusion density with dark adaptation in diabetic retinopathy","2019","Purpose: To evaluate the anatomic versus functional changes in diabetic retinopathy (DR) by studying the correlation of retinal vascular perfusion density and dark adaptation (DA). Methods: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and DA tests were performed in diabetic patients and nondiabetic controls. DA was measured using AdaptDx dark adaptometer and the rod intercept was recorded. Macular OCTA images were acquired using the RTVue XR Avanti with AngioVue. Results: Eighty-six eyes from 57 patients with diabetes (19 with no DR, 19 with non-proliferative DR [NPDR], and 19 with proliferative DR [PDR] who had undergone photocoagulation) and 10 eyes from 10 patients without diabetes were recruited. A significant decrease in vascular density and a prolonged rod intercept were found as DR progressed (P &lt;.01). A negative trend was found between vascular density and the rod intercept. The negative trend in the deep layer (R2 = 0.28) was more substantial than that in the superficial layer (R2 = 0.14). A prolonged rod intercept was associated with elevated HbA1c (R2 = 0.08). Conclusions: The vascular density of the macula could be assessed by OCTA and the functional change in the outer retina could be measured non-invasively by DA. The severity of decreasing vascular density and prolongation of DA are proportional to progression of DR. Decreased deep retinal vascular perfusion density and impaired DA response are correlated and show a negative trend according to the severity of DR. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","hemoglobin A1c; adult; Article; blood vessel parameters; clinical evaluation; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dark adaptation; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; diabetic retinopathy; disease association; female; human; laser coagulation; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy; observational study; optical coherence tomography angiography; priority journal; proliferative diabetic retinopathy; retina macula lutea; retina rod; retinal rod outer segment; retinal vascular perfusion density; retrospective study; trend study; visual system parameters; aged; blood flow; capillary; dark adaptation; diabetic retinopathy; fluorescence angiography; follow up; optical coherence tomography; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; retina blood vessel; visual acuity; Aged; Capillaries; Dark Adaptation; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Macula Lutea; Male; Middle Aged; Regional Blood Flow; Retinal Vessels; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity"
"A nanodroplet cell processing platform facilitating drug synergy evaluations for anti-cancer treatments","2019","Therapeutic drug synergism intervened in cancer treatments has been demonstrated to be more effective than using a single effector. However, it remains inherently challenging, with a limited cell count from tumor samples, to achieve potent personalized drug cocktails. To address the issue above, we herein present a nanodroplet cell processing platform. The platform incorporates an automatic nanodroplet dispenser with cell array ParaStamp chips, which were fabricated by a new wax stamping approach derived from laser direct writing. Such approach enables not only the on-demand de-wetting with hydrophobic wax films on substrates but also the mask-less fabrication of non-planar microstructures (i.e. no photolithography process). The ParaStamp chip was pre-occupied with anti-cancer drugs and their associate mixtures, enabling for the spatially addressable screening of optimal drug combinations simultaneously. Each droplet with a critical volume of 200 nl containing with 100 cells was utilized. Results revealed that the optimal combination reduces approximate 28-folds of conducted doses compared with single drugs. Tumor inhibition with the optimally selected drug combination was further confirmed by using PC-3 tumor-bearing mouse models. Together, the nanodroplet cell processing platform could therefore offer new opportunities to power the personalized cancer medicine at early-stage drug screening and discovery. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"4-Acetylantroquinonol B from antrodia cinnamomea enhances immune function of dendritic cells against liver cancer stem cells","2019","The functions of 4-acetylantroquinonol B (4-AAQB), a ubiquinone derivative isolated from the mycelium of Antrodia cinnamomea, in immunotherapy for liver cancer were investigated. We found that 4-AAQB could inhibit liver cancer stem cell related manifestations and activate the antitumor ability of dendritic cells. Specifically, 4-AAQB can inhibit EpCAM, AFP and related pathways of HepG2 cells. It also significantly decreases the expression of β-catenin, inhibits the tumorigenicity and decreases the secretion of immune escape related cytokines. Moreover, 4-AAQB can stimulate the proliferation of immune cells and promote the endocytosis of immature dendritic cells. When co-cultured immature dendritic cells with EpCAM+ HepG2 cells, 4-AAQB enhanced the expression of MHC class I and II on the surface of liver cancer stem cells and dendritic cells, increased the expression of costimulatory molecules CD80 of dendritic cells and cytokines related to immune activation. In conclusion, 4-AAQB from Antrodia cinnamomea can enhance immune function of dendritic cells against liver cancer stem cells, and may have the potential to be used for liver cancer prevention and immunotherapy. ? 2018","4 acetylantroquinonol b; antineoplastic agent; B7 antigen; beta catenin; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; fluorouracil; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; tumor antigen; tumor necrosis factor; ubiquinone derivative; unclassified drug; 4-acetylantroquinonol B; cyclohexanone derivative; gamma butyrolactone; animal cell; antigen presentation; antineoplastic activity; Antrodia camphorata; Article; cancer immunotherapy; cancer prevention; cancer stem cell; carcinogenesis; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell activation; cell function; cell maturation; cell subpopulation; cell viability; comparative study; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytokine release; cytotoxicity; dendritic cell; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; immune response; immunocompetent cell; immunoreactivity; liver cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rat; THP-1 cell line; analogs and derivatives; animal; Antrodia; cancer stem cell; cell survival; cellular immunity; coculture; dendritic cell; dose response; drug effect; immunology; isolation and purification; liver tumor; mouse; RAW 264.7 cell line; 4-Butyrolactone; Animals; Antrodia; Cell Survival; Coculture Techniques; Cyclohexanones; Dendritic Cells; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Neoplastic Stem Cells; RAW 264.7 Cells"
"Polymethoxyflavones: Chemistry and Molecular Mechanisms for Cancer Prevention and Treatment","2019","Polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) are one group of the flavonoid compounds, with tangeretin (Tan) and nobiletin (Nob) being the most abundant PMFs in citrus peel. Numerous biological activities of PMFs have been intensively studied, including anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. Because of their methoxy groups, PMFs are more lipophilic than hydroxyl flavones, which may affect their biological activities. In addition, researchers found that hydroxylated PMFs (HPMFs) are one of the major metabolites of PMFs in animal urine and feces. Although PMF and HPMFs do show anticancer activity against different types of cancers, but their low hydrophilicity is still a crucial factor that may affect their biological effectiveness. Therefore, from the pharmaceutical aspect, chemical modifications of PMFs have been carried out to obtain acetylated PMFs (Ac-PMFs) for enhancing their biological effects. From the past centuries to the present, cancer is still a critical disease that needs to be solved. Carcinogenesis can be simply divided into three stages: initiation, promotion, and progression. These three stages involve different biological events, such as DNA mutation, cell proliferation, cell growth, and metastasis. In this paper, we aim to illustrate the biological effects of different PMFs, HPMFs, PMF derivatives, and metabolites against different types of cancer and related molecular mechanisms. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","3',4' didemethylnobiletin; 3′ hydroxy 5,6,7,8,49 pentamethoxyflavone; 3′,4′ dihydroxy 5,6,7,8 tetramethoxyflavone; 3′,4′ dimethoxyflavone; 4' demethylnobiletin; 4′ hydroxy 5,6,7,8 tetramethoxyflavone; 4′ hydroxy 5,6,7,8,3 pentamethoxyflavone; 4′,6 dihydroxy 5,7,8 trimethoxyflavone; 4′,6,7 trihydroxy 5,8 dimethoxyflavone; 4′,7 dihydroxy 5,6,8 trimethoxyflavone; 5 hydroxy 3,6,7,8,3′,4′ hexamethoxyflavone; 5,3′,4′ didemethylnobiletin; 5,4′ didemethylnobiletin; 5,6 dihydroxy 4′,7,8 tetramethoxyflavone; 5,7 dimethoxyflavone; 6 hydroxy 40,5,7,8 tetramethoxyflavone; carboplatin; cisplatin; flavone derivative; imatinib; nobiletin; nobilitin 5,6,7,8,3',4' hexamethoxyflavone; nobilitin, 3,5,6,7,8,3′,4′ heptamethoxyflavone; paclitaxel; phenol; polymethoxyflavone; sinensetin; tangeretin; tangeretin 4',5,6,7,8 pentamethoxyflavone; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antiinflammatory activity; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; biological activity; cancer growth; cancer prevention; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; cell growth; cell proliferation; chemical modification; DNA damage; drug mechanism; gene mutation; human; hydrophilicity; lipophilicity; metabolite; metastasis; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; tumor promotion"
"Retinal ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer thickness is nonlinearly associated with cognitive impairment in the community-dwelling elderly","2019","Introduction: Thinning of optical coherence tomography–measured retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness has been found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, the association of these retinal markers and cognition in nondemented elders may not be linear. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 227 community-dwelling elders (age 65+ years). Multivariable regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between retinal nerve fiber layer/GC-IPL and global/domain-specific cognition. Results: The performance of global cognition decreased as mean GC-IPL of bilateral eyes deviated from the sample mean (77.5 μm) (quadratic GC-IPL: β = –0.49 × 10?2; 95% confidence interval: ?0.74 × 10?2 to ?0.23 × 10?2). Similar associations were also found for logical memory. No significant association was observed between retinal nerve fiber layer and cognition. Discussion: Either thinning or thickening of GC-IPL was associated with poor cognition in nondemented elderly (a U-shaped association). GC-IPL may serve as a noninvasive preclinical predictor of Alzheimer's disease. ? 2018 The Authors","aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; cognition; cohort analysis; community dwelling person; confidence interval; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; female; follow up; ganglion cell inner plexiform layer thickness; geriatric patient; human; major clinical study; male; memory; multivariate logistic regression analysis; retina ganglion cell; retinal nerve fiber layer; retinal thickness"

"Effect of lower urinary tract symptoms on the quality of life and sexual function of males in China, Taiwan, and South Korea: Subgroup analysis of a cross-sectional, population-based study","2019","Objective: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in males can reduce patients’ quality of life (QoL) and affect sexual function and satisfaction. Although this has been documented in the US, Canada, Germany, Italy, UK, and Sweden, data are limited on the effects of LUTS on QoL and sexual function in Asian men. The present subgroup analysis of an Internet-based survey correlated the incidence of male LUTS by severity and category with self-assessed QoL and sexual function and satisfaction measures. Methods: Males aged ?40 years were randomly selected from consumer survey panels in China, Taiwan, and South Korea. LUTS were defined using the International Continence Society (ICS) 2002 symptom definitions; symptom severity was assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The effect of LUTS on QoL was assessed using Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) and IPSS QoL scores. Sexual function and satisfaction were assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Results: Men with moderate-to-severe LUTS and overlap of voiding, storage, and post-micturition symptom categories reported dissatisfaction with their QoL and sexual function. LUTS severity was negatively correlated with IIEF scores. Overlap of LUTS categories had a greater effect on QoL and sexual satisfaction than the incidence of just 1 LUTS. Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest that LUTS is prevalent in >60% of Asian males aged ?40 years and is associated with reduced QoL and sexual function, particularly in those with overlap of LUTS categories and greater symptom severity. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Atopic dermatitis in African American patients is T H 2/T H 22-skewed with T H 1/T H 17 attenuation","2019","Background: African Americans (AA) are disproportionately impacted by atopic dermatitis (AD), with increased prevalence and therapeutic challenges unique to this population. Molecular profiling data informing development of targeted therapeutics for AD are derived primarily from European American (EA) patients. These studies are absent in AA, hindering development of effective treatments for this population. Objective: We sought to characterize the global molecular profile of AD in the skin of AA patients as compared with that of EA AD and healthy controls. Methods: We performed RNA-Seq with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction validation and immunohistochemistry studies in lesional and nonlesional skin of AA and EA AD patients vs healthy controls. Results: African American AD lesions were characterized by greater infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs) marked by the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor (FcεR1+) compared with EA AD (P < .05). Both AD cohorts showed similarly robust up-regulation of Th2-related (CCL17/18/26) and Th22-related markers (interleukin [IL]-22, S100A8/9/12), but AA AD featured decreased expression of innate immune (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], IL-1β), Th1-related (interferon gamma [IFN-γ], MX1, IL-12RB1), and Th17-related markers (IL-23p19, IL-36G, CXCL1) vs EA AD (P < .05). The Th2 (IL-13) and Th22-related products (IL-22, S100A8/9/12) and serum IgE were significantly correlated with clinical severity (Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis [SCORAD]) in AA. Fillagrin (FLG) was exclusively down-regulated in EA AD, whereas loricrin (LOR) was down-regulated in both AD cohorts and negatively correlated with SCORAD in AA. Conclusion: The molecular phenotype of AA AD skin is characterized by attenuated Th1 and Th17 but similar Th2/Th22-skewing to EA AD. Our data encourages a personalized medicine approach accounting for phenotype-specific characteristics in future development of targeted therapeutics and clinical trial design for AD. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","C-C motif chemokine 18; calgranulin A; calgranulin B; calgranulin C; CXCL1 chemokine; eotaxin 3; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin E receptor; interleukin 12 receptor beta1; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 22; interleukin 23p19; loricrin; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; transcription factor; tumor necrosis factor; CCL17 protein, human; cytokine; FcepsilonRI alpha-chain, human; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E receptor; interleukin derivative; interleukin-22; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; adult; African American; Article; atopic dermatitis; binding affinity; cell infiltration; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; correlational study; dendritic cell; disease severity; down regulation; female; human; human tissue; immunoglobulin blood level; immunohistochemistry; male; middle aged; preschool child; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; scoring system; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; Th22 cell; upregulation; validation process; aged; atopic dermatitis; blood; immunology; nucleotide sequence; sequence analysis; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; young adult; Adult; African Americans; Aged; Base Sequence; Chemokine CCL17; Cytokines; Dendritic Cells; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Interleukins; Male; Middle Aged; Receptors, IgE; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Th1 Cells; Th17 Cells; Th2 Cells; Young Adult"
"Pigment epithelium-derived factor inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and protects against high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders in mice","2019","Obesity is a major cause of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes, and it presents with metabolic disorders, such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a protein isolated from retinal pigment epithelial cells, has multiple functions, including neuronal protection, antineoplastic effects, and anti-inflammatory activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the antiobesity effects of PEDF. The antiobesity effects of PEDF on fat accumulation, inflammation, energy expenditure, insulin resistance, and obesity-related physiological parameters and protein levels were assessed in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice in vivo and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, palmitate (PA)-treated HepG2 cells, and C2C12 myotubes in vitro. In an in vivo assay, PEDF effectively decreased body weight gain, white adipose tissue mass, and inflammation and improved insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia in HFD-induced mice. In liver tissue, PEDF decreased lipid accumulation and fibrosis. In an in vitro assay, PEDF diminished the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. We also determined that PEDF promoted lipolysis and prolonged cell cycle progression, through the mTOR-S6K pathway and downstream transcription factors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBP-α), and CEBP-β. In addition, PEDF decreased reactive oxygen species production in PA-induced HepG2 cells and improved glucose uptake ability in PA-induced HepG2 cells and C2C12 myotubes. In the present study, PEDF protected against HFD-induced obesity and metabolic disorders in mice, inhibited adipogenesis, and improved insulin resistance. These results provide a new potential treatment for obesity in the future. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adiponectin; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta; creatinine; cyclin A; cyclin B1; cyclin D1; glucose; high density lipoprotein; insulin; leptin; low density lipoprotein; mammalian target of rapamycin; perilipin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pigment epithelium derived factor; reactive oxygen metabolite; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; eye protein; nerve growth factor; palmitic acid; pigment epithelium-derived factor; S6 kinase; serine proteinase inhibitor; target of rapamycin kinase; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiobesity activity; Article; body composition; body weight gain; body weight loss; cell cycle progression; cell differentiation; cell metabolism; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; diet induced obesity; energy expenditure; glucose transport; Hep-G2 cell line; hyperglycemia; hyperlipidemia; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin tolerance test; lipid storage; lipolysis; liver fibrosis; metabolic disorder; mouse; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; priority journal; proadipocyte; protein phosphorylation; retina pigment cell; treatment duration; white adipose tissue; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; animal; blood; C57BL mouse; cell clone; complication; drug effect; fatty liver; human; insulin resistance; lipid diet; male; metabolic disorder; metabolism; obesity; oxidative stress; pathology; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; skeletal muscle cell; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Clone Cells; Diet, High-Fat; Eye Proteins; Fatty Liver; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Muscle, Skeletal; Nerve Growth Factors; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Palmitic Acid; Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases; Serpins; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"
"Indole compound NC009-1 augments APOE and TRKA in Alzheimer's disease cell and mouse models for neuroprotection and cognitive improvement","2019","Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), is the most common cause of dementia among older people. A few studies have identified substantial AD biomarkers in blood but their results were inconsistent. Here we screened gene expression alterations on Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y neuronal model for AD, and evaluated the findings on peripheral leukocytes from 78 patients with AD and 56 healthy controls. The therapeutic responses of identified biomarker candidates were further examined in Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y neuronal and APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic (3×Tg-AD) mouse models. Downregulation of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TRKA) were detected in Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells and validated by peripheral leukocytes from AD patients. Treatment with an in-house indole compound NC009-1 upregulated the expression of APOE and TRKA accompanied with improvement of neurite outgrowth in Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells. NC009-1 further rescued the downregulated APOE and TRKA and reduced Aβ and tau levels in hippocampus and cortex, and ameliorated cognitive deficits in streptozocin-induced hyperglycemic 3×Tg-AD mice. These results suggest the role of APOE and TRKA as potential peripheral biomarkers in AD, and offer a new drug development target of AD treatment. Further studies of a large series of AD patients will be warranted to verify the findings and confirm the correlation between these markers and therapeutic efficacy. ? 2019 IOS Press and the authors.

"Dependence on size and shape of non-nature amino acids in the enhancement of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) neutralizing activities of antimicrobial peptides","2019","Hypothesis: Release of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from bacteria into bloodstream may cause serious unwanted stimulation of the host immune system. P-113 is a clinically active histidine-rich antimicrobial peptide. Nal-P-113, a β-naphthylalanine-substituted P-113, is salt-resistant but has limited LPS neutralizing activity. We suspected the size and shape of the non-natural bulky amino acid may affect its LPS neutralizing activity. Herein, antimicrobial, LPS neutralizing, and antiproteolytic effects of phenylalanine- (Phe-P-113), β-naphthylalanine- (Nal-P-113), β-diphenylalanine- (Dip-P-113), and β-(4,4′-biphenyl)alanine- (Bip-P-113) substituted P-113 were studied. Experiments: Structure-activity relationships of P-113, Phe-P-113, Nal-P-113, Dip-P-113, and Bip-P-113 were evaluated using antimicrobial activity assays, serum proteolytic assays, peptide-induced permeabilization of large unilamellar vesicles, zeta potential measurements, dynamic light scattering measurement of LPS aggregation, and Limulus amebocyte lysate assays for measuring LPS neutralization. In vitro and in vivo LPS neutralizing activities were further confirmed by LPS-induced inflammation inhibition in an endotoxemia mouse model. Findings: Bip-P-113 and Dip-P-113 had the longest and widest non-nature amino acids, respectively. Bip-P-113 enhanced salt resistance, serum proteolytic stability, peptide-induced permeabilization, zeta potential measurements, LPS aggregation, and in vitro and in vivo LPS neutralizing activities. These results could help design novel antimicrobial peptides that have enhanced stability in vivo and that can have potential therapeutic applications. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Acid resistance; Body fluids; Light scattering; Microorganisms; Peptides; Polypeptides; Zeta potential; Antimicrobial peptide; Dynamic light scattering measurement; Large unilamellar vesicles; Lipopolysaccharides; Non natural amino acids; Salt resistance; Structure activity relationships; Zeta potential measurements; Amino acids; bacterium lipopolysaccharide; beta (4,4' biphenyl)alanine p 113; beta diphenylalanine p 113; beta naphthylalanine p 113; phenylalanine p 113; polypeptide antibiotic agent; proteinase inhibitor; saralasin; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; amino acid; antiinfective agent; antimicrobial cationic peptide; endotoxin; lipopolysaccharide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antimicrobial activity; Article; cell membrane permeability; controlled study; cytokine production; dilution; dose response; drug bioavailability; drug cytotoxicity; drug design; drug synthesis; hemolysis; human; human cell; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; Limulus lysate test; lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia; lipopolysaccharide-induced lung inflammation; male; minimum inhibitory concentration; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; phospholipid vesicle; photon correlation spectroscopy; priority journal; protein degradation; structure activity relation; surface charge; zeta potential; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; blood; C57BL mouse; chemically induced; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; endotoxemia; Escherichia coli; fibroblast; hemolytic plaque assay; inflammation; microbial sensitivity test; particle size; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; surface property; Amino Acids; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Dynamic Light Scattering; Endotoxemia; Endotoxins; Escherichia coli; Fibroblasts; Hemolytic Plaque Technique; Humans; Inflammation; Lipopolysaccharides; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Particle Size; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; Structure-Activity Relationship; Surface Properties"
"Prevalence and clinical characteristics of stroke patients with p.R544C NOTCH3 mutation in Taiwan","2019","Objective: Features of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) caused by NOTCH3 mutations vary between ethnicities and regions. In Taiwan, more than 70% of CADASIL patients carry the mutation hot spot of p.R544C. We investigated the prevalence of NOTCH3 p.R544C mutation in stroke patients in Taiwan. Methods: This prospective, multicenter study recruited acute stroke patients within 10?days of symptom onset. The p.R544C mutation was identified by polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers and sequencing. Clinical parameters, vascular risk factors, stroke subtypes, and stroke outcomes were analyzed. Results: Of the 1970 stroke patients (mean age 61.1?±?13.6?years, male 69.5%) included, 1705 (86.5%) had ischemic stroke and 265 (13.5%) had intracerebral hemorrhage. The prevalence of p.R544C in the study population was 2.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]?=?2.1–3.5%). The prevalence was highest in patients with small vessel occlusion type of ischemic stroke (5.6%), followed by intracerebral hemorrhage (5.3%), and infarct of undetermined etiology (2.7%), and was low in patients with cardioembolism (0.8%) and large artery atherosclerosis (0.7%). All p.R544C patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were nonlobar hemorrhage. Sibling history of stroke (odds ratio [OR]?=?4.50, 95% CI?=?1.67–12.14 in ischemic stroke; OR?=?6.03, 95% CI?=?1.03–35.47 in intracerebral hemorrhage, respectively) and small vessel occlusion (OR, 4.03, 95% CI, 1.26–12.92) were significantly associated with p.R544C. Interpretation: p.R544C NOTCH3 mutation is underdiagnosed in stroke patients in Taiwan, especially in those with small vessel occlusion and sibling history of stroke. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Risk factors in metabolic syndrome predict the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes","2019","Background: While metabolic syndrome can independently predict the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes, the risk factors for DKD progression have rarely been discussed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between metabolic syndrome and the progression of DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes. Material and methods: This retrospective observational cohort study lasted approximately five years. We defined metabolic syndrome using the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III with the Asian definition of obesity. The progression of DKD was demonstrated by either the progression of albuminuria or worsening renal function. Progression of albuminuria was defined by the transition from normoalbuminuria (<30 mg/g) to microalbuminuria (30–300 mg/g) or from micro- to macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/g). Worsening renal function was defined by a reduction of eGFR to 50% of the baseline or the doubling of serum creatinine. We adopted multivariate Cox-regression analysis to determine the risk factors associated with DKD progression. Results: This study consisted of 935 type 2 diabetic patients with a mean age of 64.62 years. We found progression of albuminuria in 172 patients (18.4%) and worsened renal function in 41 patients (4.4%). After Cox regression analysis, the multivariable-adjusted HR for the progression of albuminuria and worsened renal function was 1.65 (95% C.I.:1.07–2.53 P = 0.022) and 2.62 (95% C.I.:1.01–6.79 P = 0.047) respectively, for those with metabolic syndrome compared to those without metabolic syndrome. Conclusion: The presence of metabolic syndrome independently predicts DKD progression in patients with type 2 diabetes. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","albumin; creatinine; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; creatinine blood level; disease association; disease course; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; macroalbuminuria; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; microalbuminuria; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; retrospective study; risk factor; blood; complication; diabetic nephropathy; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathology; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Nephropathies; Female; Humans; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Young Adult"
"Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) flower proanthocyanidin fraction exhibited protective efficacy to suppress nickel-induced expression for vascular endothelial growth factor in HepG2 cells","2019","The protective efficacy of litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) flower proanthocyanidin fraction (LFPF) composed of (-)-epicatechin and proanthocyanidin A2 against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) generation induced by nickel (Ni) in hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2) cells was studied. VEGF is an angiogenic inducer, which promotes tumor angiogenesis, leading to rapid tumor growth and metastasis. VEGF could be substantially induced in the Ni-mediated Hep G2 cells. Through LFPF treatment, the Ni-induced VEGF generation could be suppressed significantly. The inhibition of HIF-1α expression by blocking phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, and the suppression of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT 3), and Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (RAF1)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK1/2)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathways are important molecular mechanisms for the LFPF action. LFPF should probably reduce the risk of liver cancer in Ni-contaminated environments by inhibiting VEGF expression. Practical applications: LFPF mainly contained (-)-epicatechin and proanthocyanidin A2. Our results demonstrated that LFPF considerably suppressed the Ni-induced VEGF expression through inhibition of JAK2/STAT 3 and RAF1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathways and prohibited HIF-1α expression through blocking PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Litchi flowers might have the potential to diminish the liver cancer risk in a Ni-contaminated environment through suitable treatment. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Amino acids; Cell engineering; Cytology; Diseases; Enzymes; Flavonoids; Mechanisms; Nickel; Tumors; Hep-g2 cells; Hypoxia-inducible factors; litchi flower; Proanthocyanidins; Vascular endothelial growth factor; Endothelial cells"
"Identification of three podoviruses infecting Klebsiella encoding capsule depolymerases that digest specific capsular types","2019","Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important human pathogen causing opportunistic nosocomial and community-acquired infections. A major public health concern regarding K.?pneumoniae is the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant strains. Here, we isolated three novel Klebsiella bacteriophages, KN1-1, KN3-1 and KN4-1, which infect KN1, KN3 and K56, and KN4 types respectively. We determined their genome sequences and conducted a comparative analysis that revealed a variable region containing capsule depolymerase-encoding genes. Recombinant depolymerase proteins were produced, and their enzymatic activity and specificity were evaluated. We identified four capsule depolymerases in these phages that could only digest the capsule types of their respective hosts. Our results demonstrate that the activities of these capsule depolymerases were correlated with the host range of each phage; thus, the capsule depolymerases are host specificity determinants. By generating a capsule mutant, we demonstrate that capsule was essential for phage adsorption and infection. Further, capsule depolymerases can enhance bacterial susceptibility to serum killing. The discovery of these phages and depolymerases lays the foundation for the typing of KN1, KN3, KN4 and K56 Klebsiella and could be useful alternative therapeutics for the treatment of K.?pneumoniae infections. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Novel phthalocyanines activated by dim light for mosquito larva- And cell-inactivation with inference for their potential as broadspectrum photodynamic insecticides","2019","Mosquitoes are significant vectors, responsible for transmitting serious infectious diseases, including the recent epidemics of global significance caused by, for example, Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. The chemical insecticides in use for mosquito control are toxic and ineffective due to the development of resistance to them. The new approach to reduce mosquito population by releasing genetically modified males to cause female infertility is still under environmental safety evaluation. Photodynamic insecticides (PDI) have long been known as a safe and effective alternative by using dyes as the photosensitizers (PS) for activation with light to generate insecticidal singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species. This approach warrants re-examination with advances in the chemical synthesis of novel PS, e.g. phthalocyanines (PC). Nine PC were compared with five porphyrin derivatives and two classic PS of halogenated fluoresceins, i.e. cyanosine and rose bengal experimentally for photodynamic treatment (PDT) of the larvae of laboratory-reared Aedes mosquitoes and their cell lines. Groups of 2nd instar larvae were first exposed overnight to graded concentrations of each PS in the dark followed by their exposure to dim light for up to 7 hours. Larvae of both experimental and control groups were examined hourly for viability based on their motility. Monolayers of mosquito cells were similarly PS-sensitized and exposed briefly to light at the PS-specific excitation wavelengths. Cell viability was assessed by MTT reduction assays. Of the 16 PS examined for photodynamic inactivation of the mosquito larvae, effective are three novel PC, i.e. amino-Si-PC1 and -PC2, anilinium Zn-PC3.4, pyridyloxy SiPC14 and two porphyrin derivatives, i.e. TPPS2 and TMAP. Their EC50 values were determined, all falling in the nanomolar range lower than those of rose bengal and cyanosine. All PS effective in vivo were also found to dose-dependently inactivate mosquito cells photodynamically in vitro, providing cellular basis for their larvicidal activities. The present findings of novel PC with effective photodynamic larvicidal activities provide fresh impetus to the development of PDI with their established advantages in safety and efficacy. Toward that end, the insect cell lines are of value for rapid screening of new PC. The optimal excitability of PC with insect-invisible red light is inferred to have the potential to broaden the range of targetable insect pests. ? 2019 Shiao et al.

"The Impact of Universal Infant Hepatitis B Immunization on Reducing the Hepatitis B Carrier Rate in Pregnant Women","2019","Background: The hepatitis B virus (HBV) status of pregnant women affects HBV vaccine failure in their offspring. This study is aimed to investigate the impact of the universal infant HBV vaccination program on the long-term hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) rate in pregnant women. Methods: Using the National Immunization Information System, we examined a 32-year period of cross-sectional data on a maternal HBsAg and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) screening program launched in July 1984. An age-period-cohort model analysis of 940 180 pregnant women screened for July 1996-June 1997 and the years 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 was applied. Results: The annual HBsAg- A nd HBeAg-seropositive rates decreased from 13.4% and 6.4%, respectively, for the period 1984-1985 to 5.9% and 1.0% in 2016 (P for both trends <. 0001). Pregnant women with birth years after July 1986 (the HBV vaccination cohort) had the lowest relative risk (0.27 [95% confidence interval,. 26-.28]) of HBsAg positivity compared with birth years before June 1984. Conclusions: The birth cohort effect in relation to the universal infant HBV immunization program has effectively reduced the HBV carrier rate in pregnant women and the burden of perinatal HBV infection on the next generation. ? 2018 The Author(s).

"Endoscopic Retrograde Biliary Drainage Causes Intra-Abdominal Abscess in Pancreaticoduodenectomy Patients: An Important But Neglected Risk Factor","2019","Background: Patients with periampullary cancer frequently suffer obstructive jaundice and commonly require preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) for relief and to avoid related complications. Although research has established a correlation between PBD and surgical wound infection, the impact of PBD on major infectious complications (intra-abdominal abscess [IAA]) and overall mortality remains debatable. We hypothesized that PBD could lead to IAA and mortality, and evaluated their correlation in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Methods: We enrolled patients undergoing PD at an Asian academic medical center between 2007 and 2016. The types of PBD included endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage (PTCD). The primary outcome was IAA, defined as the presence of pus or infected fluid inside the abdominal cavity and with documented infectious pathogens. Results: There was one (0.1%) 30-day mortality and eight (0.9%) 90-day mortalities among 899 consecutive patients examined. More than one-quarter of patients had PBD (n = 237, 26.4%; 165 ERBD, 72 PTCD). In the ERBD, PTCD, and non-PBD groups, the IAA rates were 37.0%, 16.7%, and 10.6%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, ERBD (odds ratio 3.67; 95% confidence interval 2.22–6.06; p < 0.001) was the only significant factor associated with IAA. No significant factor was found to analyze variables associated with mortality. Conclusions: ERBD, but not PTCD, is associated with an increased risk of IAA in patients undergoing PD, which suggests that ERBD should be avoided whenever possible to prevent IAA. Further randomized clinical trials should be conducted to validate this relationship. ? 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","bilirubin; abdominal abscess; abdominal pain; aged; Article; biliary tract drainage; bilirubin blood level; cholangitis; controlled study; endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage; endoscopic surgery; female; heart infarction; human; intestine necrosis; intestine perforation; liver failure; major clinical study; male; pancreas fistula; pancreaticoduodenectomy; pancreatitis; percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography; postoperative hemorrhage; preoperative treatment; retrospective study; risk factor; septic shock; surgical mortality; abdominal abscess; bile duct tumor; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; follow up; middle aged; pancreas carcinoma; pancreas tumor; pancreaticoduodenectomy; pathology; preoperative care; prognosis; prospective study; surgical infection; survival rate; Abdominal Abscess; Aged; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde; Common Bile Duct Neoplasms; Drainage; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreaticoduodenectomy; Preoperative Care; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surgical Wound Infection; Survival Rate"
"Anesthetic care of children with gene therapy for the treatment of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency","2019","AADC deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease that may lead to movement disorder and/or autonomic dysfunction. The prognosis of AADC deficiency patients is poor, and most die in childhood. Gene therapy is the only method currently available to help alleviate related symptoms. Gene therapy involves the injection of adeno-associated viral (AV) vector into the basal ganglia of patients, helping transfer the AADC gene and leading to improved AADC production and higher numbers of neurotransmitters in the brain. Moreover, as patients are unable to produce catecholamine, they may also suffer from a disorder affecting the regulatory control of the autonomic nervous system, resulting in hypoglycemia, which often causes imbalances in thermoregulation and hemodynamic and functional adjustments during surgery. Furthermore, the use of analgesics and inhalational anesthetics increase the risks of hypotension and bradycardia. Thus, in addition to assessing cardiac and respiratory system functions, it is important to evaluate the patient's airway before administering anesthesia, as structural anomalies or other situations may be present that lead to difficulties in tracheal intubation. Various airway tools, anesthesia equipment, and alternative plans should thus be prepared to protect the airway and maintain vital signs. All of the abovementioned issues increase the risks of AADC deficiency patients undergoing general anesthesia. The development of gene transfection for genetic diseases is a future trend. This paper identifies possible problems and related responses in perioperative patient care during gene therapy. The authors hope that these experiences provide references for the administration of AADC and similar gene therapies in the future. ? 2019 Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Declining prevalence of pediatric sudden deafness during the past two decades","2019","Objective: This study compared the prevalence of sudden deafness (SD) in children to investigate the evolution of pediatric SD during the past two decades. Methods: From 1996 to 2005, totaling 358 SD patients were experienced. Of them, 25 patients (7%) aged <15 years were assigned to Group A. In contrast, 5 patients (2%) aged <15 years of 242 SD patients encountered during the period 2006–2015 were assigned to Group B. All patients underwent audiovestibular function testing. Results: The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination reached to 95% vaccination rate in Taiwan after 1994. As 1994 (MMR vaccination years) + 11 (mean age of pediatric SD) equals 2005, this study found that declining prevalence of pediatric SD was from 7% (1996–2005) to 2% (2006–2015) at our hospital, consistent with declining annual cases of SD in Taiwan during the past decades. A significantly higher abnormality rate of mean hearing level (93%) than abnormal caloric responses (20%) was identified indicating that pediatric SD predominately affected the cochlear partition. Conclusion: The prevalence of pediatric SD cases has significantly declined during the past 20 years, probably due to global vaccination policy. Other causal factors such as growing numbers of hospital and advancement in radiological diagnostic technique may also contribute to the declining prevalence. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","measles mumps rubella vaccine; adolescent; adult; Article; caloric vestibular test; child; clinical article; cochlear nerve; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic procedure; disease course; female; groups by age; human; male; middle aged; morbidity; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; school child; sudden deafness; Taiwan; vaccination; vestibular test; hearing impairment; measles; mumps; prevalence; rubella; sudden deafness; vaccination; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Deafness; Female; Hearing Loss, Sudden; Humans; Male; Measles; Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine; Mumps; Prevalence; Rubella; Taiwan; Vaccination"
"A novel Sb-doped Mo(O,S)3 oxy-sulfide photocatalyst for degradation of methylene blue dye under visible light irradiation","2019","Environmentally toxic methylene blue organic pollutants are of more concerns due to their antagonistic effects on human health, animals, and plants, thus needs serious attention for their removal. For elimination purpose, the Sb-doped Mo(O,S)3 oxy-sulfide nanoplate catalyst with different Sb contents was synthesized at low temperature of 95 °C via a facile method. The structural, morphological, chemical composition, optical properties, and electrical conductivity of the catalyst were characterized with different techniques. The photocatalytic performance of Sb-Mo(O,S)3 at various Sb contents was investigated for the degradation of methylene blue dye under visible light irradiation using hydrogen peroxide as an effective electron scavenger to further accelerate the reaction. It was observed that the incorporation of Sb enhanced the catalytic activity. Sb-Mo(O,S)3-10 was the most efficient catalyst with excellent activity to degrade 99.7% of the dye within 60 min irradiation time. The degradation kinetics follows a pseudo-first-order reaction with a rate constant 8.78 × 10?2 min?1, which is 3-fold higher than that for Sb- Mo(O,S)3-0 catalyst. Sb-Mo(O,S)3-10 showed slower recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and lower charge transfer resistance which proved to be capable for the removal of toxic methylene blue organic pollutant. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antimony; Aromatic compounds; Catalyst activity; Charge transfer; Degradation; Irradiation; Light; Nanocatalysts; Optical properties; Photocatalysts; Photocatalytic activity; Photodegradation; Rate constants; Sulfur compounds; Temperature; Charge transfer resistance; Chemical compositions; Electrical conductivity; Methylene Blue; Photocatalytic performance; Photogenerated charge carriers; Pseudo-first order reactions; Visible-light irradiation; Organic pollutants"
"Impact of type D personality on clinical outcomes in Asian patients with stable coronary artery disease","2019","Background: Some personality types are associated with cardiovascular (CV) diseases and may be related to clinical outcomes in coronary artery disease (CAD). This study investigates the association between type D personality and clinical outcomes in stable CAD patients in an Asian cohort. Methods: Stable CAD patients were enrolled and prospectively followed up for at least 1 year in Taiwan. The inclusion criteria were at least one successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stable medical treatment for at least 1 month before enrollment. Vulnerability to psychological distress was measured by the Type D Personality Scale (DS14) after enrollment. The end point was the occurrence of total CV events. Cox regression models of CV events were used to investigate the role of type D personality in clinical outcomes. Results: The study included 777 patients, among which 122 (15.77%) had type D personality. Forty-two CV events were identified: 3 cardiac deaths, 5 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 1 stroke, 4 congestive heart failures (CHF), 6 peripheral arterial occlusive disorder cases, and 23 readmissions for angina/revascularization treatment. Patients with type D personality had significantly higher incidence of future CV events (9.84% vs. 4.58%, p = 0.018%) and admission for angina/revascularization (5.74% vs. 2.44%, p = 0.049). Patients with subsequent CV events were more likely to have type D personality (28.57% vs. 14.97%, p=0.018). After proportional Cox regression analysis, type D personality remained an independent predictor of future CV events (HR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.06–9.69). In subgroup analyses, type D personality was especially associated with higher risk of total CV events among females, the elderly, hypertension patients, diabetes patients, and non-smokers. Conclusion: Type D personality was an independent predictor of CV outcomes in an Asian cohort of stable CAD patients. This personality type may be identified in risk stratification for secondary prevention after PCI. ? 2018","acute coronary syndrome; acute heart infarction; adult; angina pectoris; Article; Asian; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; diabetic patient; distress syndrome; female; follow up; heart death; heart infarction; high risk patient; hospital readmission; human; hypertensive patient; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonsmoker; percutaneous coronary intervention; peripheral occlusive artery disease; personality assessment; prospective study; revascularization; type D behavior; Type D Personality Scale; unstable angina pectoris; aged; coronary artery disease; hypertension; mortality; procedures; register; risk factor; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; Aged; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Prospective Studies; Registries; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Type D Personality"
"Importance of the Nucleophilic Property of Tea Polyphenols","2019","Tea is the second most popular beverage in the world after water. Vast accumulative evidence attest that tea consumption may promote human health, such as antioxidant, anti-obesity, and anticancer activities. Therefore, tea phytochemicals have drawn exceeding attention from researchers in structure confirmation, formation mechanism, component clarification, and bioactivity screening of interested constituents. Particularly, most investigations of chemical or biochemical reactions of catechins have concentrated on the B ring of the C6-C3-C6 skeleton. Hence, in this perspective, we reviewed the profound findings of the carbon-carbon (C-C) connection from the unambiguous characterization of novel A-ring addition derivatives of tea catechins, including catechin-carbonyl and catechin-theanine conjugates and the C-C formation mechanisms, and offered our view of the potential effects of catechin-carbonyl interactions on flavor generation and bioactive action in tea. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","Flavonoids; Vitamins; A-RINGS; catechin-carbonyl adducts; Flavor formation; Formation mechanism; Theanine; Phenols; antioxidant; plant extract; polyphenol; animal; Camellia sinensis; chemistry; human; tea; Animals; Antioxidants; Camellia sinensis; Humans; Plant Extracts; Polyphenols; Tea"
"Clinical manifestations of candidemia caused by uncommon Candida species and antifungal susceptibility of the isolates in a regional hospital in Taiwan, 2007–2014","2019","Objective: This retrospective study investigated clinical manifestations of candidemia caused by uncommon Candida species and antifungal susceptibility of the isolates in a regional hospital in Taiwan. Methods: The uncommon Candida species was initially defined as Candida species other than C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata complex, C. parapsilosis complex and C. krusei. All uncommon Candida isolates were identified and confirmed by molecular methods. In vitro susceptibility testing of the uncommon Candida species to nine antifungal agents was conducted using the broth microdilution method with the Sensititre YeastOne (SYO) system (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Ltd., East Grimstead, UK). Results: Twenty-one patients, comprising 11 males and 10 females with a median age of 69 years, were recruited. Cancer (n = 11) was the most common underlying disease, 19 (90.5%) cases had prior antibiotic exposure, and only two patients had prior antifungal use. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 38.1% (n = 8). C. guilliermondii (n = 11) was the most common pathogen, followed by C. curvata (n = 3). C. guilliermondii isolates exhibited relatively high rates of azole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) above epidemiological cut-off values (ECVs), whereas C. pelliculosa and C. lusitaniae isolates all remained susceptible to azoles. All three C. curvata isolates had high caspofungin (>8 mg/L) and fluconazole MICs (8 mg/L) and could be defined as multidrug-resistant. Conclusions: Uncommon Candida species frequently exhibit high rates of non-susceptibility to antifungals. Identification of all Candida isolates at the species level from blood samples is of value for treatment. ? 2017","amphotericin B; antifungal agent; caspofungin; echinocandin; fluconazole; flucytosine; itraconazole; micafungin; posaconazole; pyrrole derivative; voriconazole; antifungal agent; caspofungin; echinocandin; fluconazole; pyrrole derivative; RNA 28S; adolescent; adult; aged; antifungal susceptibility; antifungal therapy; Article; broth dilution; Candida; Candida albicans; Candida curvata; Candida glabrata; Candida parapsilosis; Candida pulcherrima; Candida sake; Candida tropicalis; candidemia; child; Clavispora lusitaniae; clinical article; Debaryomyces hansenii; female; fungus isolation; hospital mortality; human; in vitro study; male; malignant neoplasm; Meyerozyma guilliermondii; minimum inhibitory concentration; mortality rate; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; Pichia kudriavzevii; retrospective study; Taiwan; Wickerhamomyces anomalus; Yarrowia lipolytica; Candida; candidemia; classification; cross infection; drug effect; genetics; infant; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiological examination; microbiology; middle aged; molecular typing; phenotype; procedures; Taiwan; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antifungal Agents; Azoles; Candida; Candida glabrata; Candidemia; Caspofungin; Cross Infection; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Fungal; Echinocandins; Female; Fluconazole; Humans; Infant; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Molecular Typing; Mycological Typing Techniques; Phenotype; Retrospective Studies; RNA, Ribosomal, 28S; Taiwan"
"Surgical resection is sufficient for incidentally discovered solitary pulmonary nodule caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria in asymptomatic patients","2019","Incidentally discovered solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is uncommon, and its optimal treatment strategy remains uncertain. This cohort study determined the clinical characteristics and outcome of asymptomatic patients with NTM-SPN after surgical resection. Resected SPNs with culture-positive for NTM in six hospitals in Taiwan during January, 2010 to January, 2017 were identified. Asymptomatic patients without a history of NTM-pulmonary disease (PD) or same NTM species isolated from the respiratory samples were selected. All were followed until May 1, 2019. A total of 43 patients with NTM-SPN were enrolled. Mycobacterium avium complex (60%) and M. kansasii (19%) were the most common species. The mean age was 61.7 ± 13.4. Of them, 60% were female and 4% had history of pulmonary tuberculosis. The NTM-SPN was removed by wedge resection in 38 (88%), lobectomy in 3 (7%) and segmentectomy in 2 (5%). Caseating granuloma was the most common histologic feature (58%), while chronic inflammation accounts for 23%. Mean duration of the follow-up was 5.2 ± 2.8 years (median: 4.2 years [2.5-7.0]), there were no mycobacteriology recurrence or NTM-PD development. In conclusion, surgical resection is likely to curative for incidentally discovered NTM-SPN in asymptomatic patients without culture evidence of the same NTM species from respiratory specimens, and routine mycobacterium culture for resected SPN might be necessary for differentiating pulmonary tuberculosis and NTM because further treatment differs. ? 2019 Huang et al.

"First tidal volume greater than 8 mL/kg is associated with increased mortality in complicated influenza infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome","2019","Backgrounds: Severe influenza infection causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide and remains an important threat to global health. This study addressed factors related to treatment outcomes in subjects of complicated influenza infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during the Taiwan epidemic in the Spring of 2016. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted by Taiwan Severe Influenza Research Consortium (TSIRC), including eight tertiary referral medical centers. Patients with virology-proven influenza infection admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) between January and March 2016 were included for analysis. Results: We identified 263 patients with complicated influenza infection who fulfilled ARDS criteria; the mean age was 59.8 ± 14.6 (years), and 66.1% (166/263) were male. Type A influenza (77.9%, 205/263) virus was the main pathogen during this epidemic. The 30-day mortality rate was 23.2% (61/263). The mean tidal volume (V T ) in the first three days after intubation was greater than 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW). Patients whose first measured V T was &gt;8 mL/kg PBW had an increased 30-day mortality (p = 0.04, log-rank test). In a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model, an increase of 1 mL/kg PBW of first V T was associated with 26.1% increase in 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.261, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.072–1.484, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: First tidal volume, shortly after intubation, greater than 8 mL/kg PBW is an independent risk factor for mortality in complicated influenza infection with ARDS. Timely recognition of ARDS with strict adherence to protective ventilation strategy of lowering V T may be important in reducing mortality. ? 2018","adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; artificial ventilation; body weight; clinical feature; epidemic; female; human; infectious agent; influenza; intensive care unit; intubation; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient referral; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; tidal volume; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; clinical trial; complication; epidemiology; influenza; Kaplan Meier method; lung; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; positive end expiratory pressure; proportional hazards model; severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; tidal volume; time factor; Aged; Female; Humans; Influenza, Human; Intensive Care Units; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Proportional Hazards Models; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan; Tidal Volume; Time Factors"
"Performing different kinds of physical exercise differentially attenuates the genetic effects on obesity measures: Evidence from 18,424 Taiwan Biobank participants","2019","Obesity is a worldwide health problem that is closely linked to many metabolic disorders. Regular physical exercise has been found to attenuate the genetic predisposition to obesity. However, it remains unknown what kinds of exercise can modify the genetic risk of obesity. This study included 18,424 unrelated Han Chinese adults aged 30-70 years who participated in the Taiwan Biobank (TWB). A total of 5 obesity measures were investigated here, including body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Because there have been no large genome-wide association studies on obesity for Han Chinese, we used the TWB internal weights to construct genetic risk scores (GRSs) for each obesity measure, and then test the significance of GRS-by-exercise interactions. The significance level throughout this work was set at 0.05/550 = 9.1x10-5 because a total of 550 tests were performed. Performing regular exercise was found to attenuate the genetic effects on 4 obesity measures, including BMI, BFP, WC, and HC. Among the 18 kinds of self-reported regular exercise, 6 mitigated the genetic effects on at least one obesity measure. Regular jogging blunted the genetic effects on BMI, BFP, and HC. Mountain climbing, walking, exercise walking, international standard dancing, and a longer practice of yoga also attenuated the genetic effects on BMI. Exercises such as cycling, stretching exercise, swimming, dance dance revolution, and qigong were not found to modify the genetic effects on any obesity measure. Across all 5 obesity measures, regular jogging consistently presented the most significant interactions with GRSs. Our findings show that the genetic effects on obesity measures can be decreased to various extents by performing different kinds of exercise. The benefits of regular physical exercise are more impactful in subjects who are more predisposed to obesity. ? 2019 Lin et al.

"Development of a spherical ultrasound transducer for transcranial low-dose ultrasound hyperthermia used in brain tumor nanodrug delivery","2019","Previous studies showed that low-dose focused ultrasound hyperthermia (UH) could enhance the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of nanodrug for brain metastasis of breast cancer. In this study, our purpose is to design an ultrasound transducer that can be used for clinical application for brain tumor nanodrug delivery. Computer simulation has been used to calculate the pressure field, temperature distribution and thermal dose in the brain for different parameters of a spherical array ultrasound transducer. An ultrasound transducer with 112 disc elements (1, MHz, 2, cm in diameter) was constructed and its heating ability was characterized using a skull phantom filled with hydrogel. The simulation results showed that the position of peak pressure was slightly offset when the transducer was mechanically moved 3, cm away from the center point in all directions. There was no significant side-lobe developed when the transducer was moved away from the center 2, cm. Temperature distribution showed that the heating zone was an ellipsoid with temperature higher than 42 °C for a maximum intensity of 121, W/cm2. Phantom experiment showed that the 42 °C color-changeable hydrogel would turn to be white at the focal point when the transducer was moved 2, cm in all directions with an electrical power 55, W. A spherical ultrasound phased array was developed and characterized, and the results showed that this ultrasound transducer has the potential used in transcranial short-time ultrasound hyperthermia for brain tumor nanodrug delivery. ?

"The Effects of Peer Victimization on Children’s Internet Addiction and Psychological Distress: The Moderating Roles of Emotional and Social Intelligence","2019","This study examines the moderating effects of both emotional intelligence and social intelligence (social awareness and social information processing) on the relationship between peer victimization and internet addiction, and on the association between peer victimization and psychological distress. We collected data from a national proportionately-stratified random sample of 6233 fourth-grade primary school students in Taiwan and constructed hierarchical linear regression models to test the research hypotheses. The results show that youth who have experienced more peer victimization are at a higher risk of internet addiction and psychological distress than youth who have experienced less peer victimization. In this study, emotional intelligence was negatively associated with internet addiction, but it did not significantly buffer the impact of victimization on internet addiction. Social awareness was negatively associated with internet addiction, but it exacerbated the negative impact of peer victimization on internet addiction. On the other hand, emotional intelligence was negatively associated with psychological distress and buffered the negative impact of victimization on mental health. Social information processing was negatively associated with psychological distress, but it amplified the negative impact of peer victimization on mental health among Taiwanese adolescents. The research implications of these findings are discussed. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Thrombospondin-2 is a Highly Specific Diagnostic Marker and is Associated with Prognosis in Pancreatic Cancer","2019","Background: Thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) has been reported as an early diagnostic marker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in Caucasian populations. This study was designed to validateTSP-2 as a diagnostic marker in a large Taiwan cohort and to investigate the association of TSP-2 with the clinical outcomes of PDAC patients. Methods: The serum TSP-2 levels in 263 PDAC patients and 230 high-risk individuals (HRIs) were measured via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of TSP-2 as a diagnostic marker to discriminating PDAC patients from HRIs and correlations between TSP-2 levels and prognosis of PDAC patients were analyzed. Results: Serum TSP-2 levels were significantly higher in patients with PDAC (44.90 ± 40.70?ng/ml) than in the HRIs (17.52 ± 6.23?ng/ml). At a level of ? 29.8?ng/ml, TSP-2 exhibited 100% specificity, 55.9% sensitivity, 100% positive predictive value (PPV), and 66.5% negative predictive value (NPV) for discriminating PDAC patients from HRIs. The Cox regression analysis showed that higher serum TSP-2 levels were significantly associated with poor outcomes in PDAC patients (hazard ratio = 1.54, 95% confidence interval = 1.143–2.086, P = 0.005). Combining the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (cutoff value of 62.0 U/ml) and TSP-2 (cutoff value of 29.8?ng/ml) levels yielded 98.7% specificity, 90.5% sensitivity, 98.8% PPV, and 90.1% NPV for discriminating patients with PDAC from HRIs. Conclusions: TSP-2 is a highly specific diagnostic marker and an independent prognostic marker in patients with PDAC. A combined biomarker panel, including TSP-2 and CA19-9, may facilitate future PDAC screening. ? 2018, Society of Surgical Oncology.","CA 19-9 antigen; thrombospondin 2; thrombospondin; thrombospondin 2; tumor marker; adult; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; Caucasian; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pancreas adenocarcinoma; predictive value; sensitivity and specificity; study design; Taiwan; blood; case control study; follow up; pancreas carcinoma; pancreas tumor; prognosis; survival rate; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Prognosis; Survival Rate; Thrombospondins"

"Epidemiologic features of shigellosis and associated climatic factors in Taiwan","2019","The consistent, sporadic transmission of shigellosis in Taiwan necessitates an exploration of risk factors for the occurrence of shigellosis. The purpose of this study was to study the epidemiologic characteristics and the relationship between climatic factors and the incidence of shigellosis in Taiwan. We collected data from cases of shigellosis reported to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) from 2001 to 2016. Climatic data were obtained from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau. The relationships between weather variability and the incidence of shigellosis in Taiwan were determined via Poisson regression analyses. During the 16-year study period, a total of 4171 clinical cases of shigellosis were reported to the Taiwan CDC. Among them, 1926 (46.2%) were classified as confirmed cases. The incidence of shigellosis showed significant seasonality, with the majority of cases occurring in summertime (for oscillation, P?<?.001). The number of shigellosis cases started to increase when temperatures reached 21°C (r?=?0.88, P?<?.001). Similarly, the number of shigellosis cases began to increase at a relative humidity of 70-74% (r?=?0.75, P?<?.005). The number of shigellosis cases was positively associated with the mean temperature and relative humidity in the period preceding the infection. In conclusion, the occurrence of shigellosis is significantly associated with increasing temperature and relative humidity in Taiwan. Therefore, these factors could be regarded as warning signals indicating the need to implement preventive measures.","adolescent; adult; child; female; health survey; heat; human; humidity; incidence; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; Poisson distribution; season; shigellosis; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Dysentery, Bacillary; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; Humidity; Incidence; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Poisson Distribution; Population Surveillance; Seasons; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Extracorporeal life support: The final ‘antidote’ for massive propranolol overdose","2019","Massive propranolol overdose may result in severe cardiotoxicity. A 48-year-old female had consumed more than 5000 mg of propranolol. Despite high-dose insulin, intravenous sodium bicarbonate, glucagon and inotropic support, she became hypotensive and subsequently arrested. Following cardiopulmonary resuscitation, she had a return of spontaneous circulation but continued to experience refractory hypotension. Resuscitation continued with veno-arterial extracorporeal life support. Therapeutic plasma exchange was initiated to shorten time on extracorporeal life support. Extracorporeal life support was weaned off within 67 h, and she survived without neurological deficits. This records the largest propranolol overdose in recent years. When traditional antidotes are insufficient to prevent collapse, extracorporeal life support is a salvage therapy to maintain perfusion and reduce vasopressor requirements. As drug clearance is significantly prolonged, therapeutic plasma exchange can enhance removal of propranolol and reduce the time to extracorporeal life support removal. With increasing expertise and availability, extracorporeal life support should be considered early in patients who have overdosed with significant cardiotoxicity. ?

"Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in Taiwan from 2014 to 2017: Clinical manifestations and outcomes between pediatric and adult patients","2019","Background: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) is a severe and lethal opportunistic infection in the immunocompromised patients. As the increasing usage of immunosuppressants, the incidence of non-HIV related PJP has increased in recent years. Still, there is little research regarding children with PJP. The aim of this study is to understand PJP more among pediatric population. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of the patients with PJP in National Taiwan University Hospital from 2014 to 2017. Diagnosis was made if the patient met all of the criteria: presence of relevant pulmonary symptoms and signs, pulmonary infiltrates on images, detection of Pneumocystis jiroveci from respiratory specimens via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and received antibiotics for PJP. Results: Twenty children and 132 adults were enrolled in this study. The most common underlying diseases among children included malignancy (40%), post-transplantation (30%), and primary immunodeficiency (20%). The major underlying diseases in adults included malignancy (36%), HIV with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (31%), and autoimmune diseases (24%). There is no significant difference in the clinical manifestations, mortality, and complication between children and adults, but children tended to have less chance of using alternative antibiotics, methylprednisolone and inhaled nitric oxide (NO). The chance of concomitant cytomegalovirus disease was also significantly lower in pediatric patients. Conclusion: No significant difference was found in the clinical manifestations, mortality, and complication between children and adults, but children tended to have lesser chance of using alternative antibiotics, methylprednisolone and inhaled NO. The chance of associated cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease was also significantly lower in children. ? 2019","antibiotic agent; antineoplastic agent; corticosteroid; cotrimoxazole; methylprednisolone; nitric oxide; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; acute kidney failure; adult; antibiotic prophylaxis; antibiotic therapy; Article; artificial ventilation; autoimmune disease; bloodstream infection; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; cancer chemotherapy; child; childhood cancer; clinical feature; coughing; cytomegalovirus infection; disease association; dyspnea; extracorporeal oxygenation; female; fever; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; hepatitis; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hyperkalemia; hyponatremia; immune deficiency; lung infiltrate; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; medical record review; outcome assessment; Pneumocystis pneumonia; pneumothorax; polymerase chain reaction; respiratory failure; retrospective study; symptom; Taiwan; vomiting"
"Lymphatic vessel remodeling and invasion in pancreatic cancer progression","2019","Background: The lymphatic system is involved in metastasis in pancreatic cancer progression. In cancer staging, lymphatic spread has been used to assess the invasiveness of tumor cells. However, from the endothelium's perspective, the analysis downplays the peri-lesional activities of lymphatic vessels. This unintended bias is largely due to the lack of 3-dimensional (3-D) tissue information to depict the lesion microstructure and vasculature in a global and integrated fashion. Methods: We targeted the pancreas as the model organ to investigate lymphatic vessel remodeling in cancer lesion progression. Transparent pancreases were prepared by tissue clearing to facilitate deep-tissue, tile-scanning microscopy for 3-D lymphatic network imaging. Findings: In human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, we identify the close association between the pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions and the lymphatic network. In mouse models of PanIN (elastase-CreER;LSL-KrasG12D and elastase-CreER;LSL-KrasG12D;p53+/?), the 3-D image data reveal the peri-lesional lymphangiogenesis, endothelial invagination, formation of the bridge/valve-like luminal tubules, vasodilation, and luminal invasion. In the orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, we identify the localized, graft-induced lymphangiogenesis and the peri- and intra-tumoral lymphatic vessel invasion. Interpretation: The integrated view of duct lesions and vascular remodeling suggests an active role, rather than a passive target, of lymphatic vessels in the metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Our 3-D image data provide insights into the pancreatic cancer microenvironment and establish the technical and morphological foundation for systematic detection and 3-D analysis of lymphatic vessel invasion.

"Differentiating malignant and benign lymph nodes using endobronchial ultrasound elastography","2019","Background/Purpose: Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is a new technique that provides information on tissue compressibility during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). The purposes of this study were to evaluate the utility of EBUS elastography in differentiating malignant and benign mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) and to explore the factors that influence its accuracy. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent EBUS-TBNA from October 2016 to July 2017 was performed. EBUS with conventional B-mode features and elastographic patterns were compared with the final pathology results or clinical follow-up. We used the following EBUS elastographic patterns for classification: type 1, predominantly non-blue (green, yellow and red); type 2, part blue, part non-blue; type 3, predominantly blue. The potential impacts of the characteristics of LNs, the underlying lung diseases and obtaining fibrotic components from EBUS-TBNA specimens were evaluated relative to the accuracy of EBUS elastography. Results: A total of 206 LNs from 94 patients were retrospectively evaluated. In classifying type 1 as ‘benign’ and type 3 as ‘malignant,’ the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy rate were 90.6, 82.6, 71.6, 94.7 and 85.2%, respectively. The EBUS elastographic patterns had higher diagnostic yields and negative predictive values than conventional B-mode features. Logistic regression analysis revealed that central necrosis was a factor that influenced the accuracy of elastography in malignant LNs. The fibrotic component within benign LNs could cause an incorrect elastographic pattern. Conclusion: EBUS elastography is a valuable tool in discriminating benign and malignant mediastinal LNs. ? 2018","fentanyl; midazolam; adult; aged; Article; B scan; bronchoscopy; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; elastography; female; human; lymph node; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; male; mediastinum lymph node; medical record review; predictive value; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; transbronchial aspiration; unselected mediastinal lymphadenopathy; very elderly; diagnostic imaging; echography; fine needle aspiration biopsy; lymph node; lymphadenopathy; mediastinum; middle aged; pathology; statistical model; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biopsy, Fine-Needle; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Lymph Nodes; Lymphadenopathy; Male; Mediastinum; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Taiwan; Ultrasonography; Young Adult"
"A Multicentre Evaluation of the Role of the Prostate Health Index (PHI) in Regions with Differing Prevalence of Prostate Cancer: Adjustment of PHI Reference Ranges is Needed for European and Asian Settings(Figure presented.)","2019","Asians have a lower incidence of prostate cancer (PC). We compared the performance of the Prostate Health Index (PHI) for 2488 men in different ethnic groups (1688 Asian and 800 European men from 9 sites) with PSA 2–20 ng/ml and PHI test and transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy results available. Of these, 1652 men had PSA 2–10 ng/ml and a normal digital rectal examination and underwent initial biopsy. The proportions of PC (Gleason ?6) and higher-grade PC (HGPC, Gleason ?7) across different PHI ranges were compared. The performance of PSA and PHI was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses (DCA). Among Asian men, HGPC would be diagnosed in 1.0%, 1.9%, 13%, and 30% of men using PHI thresholds of <25, 25–35, 35–55, and >55, respectively. At 90% sensitivity for HGPC (PHI >30), 56% of biopsies and 33% of Gleason 6 PC diagnoses could have been avoided. Among European men, HGPC would be diagnosed in 4.1%, 4.3%, 30%, and 34% of men using PHI thresholds of <25, 25–35, 35–55, and >55, respectively. At 90% sensitivity for HGPC (PHI >40), 40% of biopsies and 31% of Gleason 6 PC diagnoses could have been avoided. AUC and DCA confirmed the benefit of PHI over PSA. The benefit of PHI was also seen at repeat biopsy (n = 397) and for PSA 10–20 ng/ml (n = 439). PHI is effective in cancer risk stratification for both European and Asian men. However, population-specific PHI reference ranges should be used. Patient summary: The Prostate Health Index (PHI) blood test helps to identify individuals at higher risk of prostate cancer among Asian and European men, and could significantly reduce unnecessary biopsies and overdiagnosis of prostate cancer. Different PHI reference ranges should be used for different ethnic groups. The Prostate Health Index (PHI) test is effective in cancer risk stratification for both European and Asian men. A higher proportion of biopsies could be avoided among Asian men using PHI. An ethnic-specific reference range should be used. ? 2018 European Association of Urology","Article; Asian; cancer risk; clinical assessment tool; comparative study; digital rectal examination; ethnic group; European; evaluation study; Gleason score; human; human tissue; image guided biopsy; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; prostate health index; receiver operating characteristic; reference value; sensitivity analysis; transrectal ultrasonography; Asia; Asian continental ancestry group; biopsy; blood; cancer grading; Caucasian; clinical trial; epidemiology; ethnology; Europe; health status; health status indicator; multicenter study; predictive value; prostate tumor; reproducibility; risk assessment; risk factor; kallikrein; kallikrein-related peptidase 3, human; prostate specific antigen; Asia; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biopsy; Digital Rectal Examination; Europe; European Continental Ancestry Group; Health Status; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Kallikreins; Male; Neoplasm Grading; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors"
"Factors associated with antimuscarinic drug persistence and increasing drug persistence after switching to mirabegron for overactive bladder patients","2019","Purpose: To evaluate long-term antimuscarinic drug persistence and its associated characteristics in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) treated with antimuscarinic agents. We also assessed the efficacy and safety of switching from solifenacin to mirabegron in patients refractory to antimuscarinic therapy. Methods: In this prospective, open-label, 48-month study, 416 patients (mean age, 70.6 ± 12.4 years) were enrolled. All patients completed the overactive bladder symptom score and urgency severity score questionnaires, along with initial and follow-up uroflowmetry. All patients received antimuscarinic solifenacin 5 mg daily. Mirabegron (25 mg daily) was suggested in patients that were refractory to antimuscarinic therapy or had intolerable side effects. Results: The mean solifenacin persistence was 6.6 ± 8.1 months (range, 0.5–48 months). Only 81 (19.5%) patients had drug persistence of ?12 months. Male sex, age, cerebral vascular accident, maximum flow rate, and post-void residual were associated with solifenacin persistence in the univariate analysis. Age (odds ratio [OR], 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08–0.21) was the only independent predictor in the multivariate logistic regression. Of the 416 patients, 171 (60.8%) changed from solifenacin to mirabegron for due to the persistence of OAB symptoms. The switch resulted in a significantly longer period of actual OAB pharmacotherapy (9.3 ± 9.2 vs 13.3 ± 9.3 months, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Long-term drug persistence of solifenacin was low during the 2-year follow-up. Age was an independent factor associated with longer drug persistence. Switching from solifenacin to mirabegron was an effective and safe alternative for OAB patients that were refractory to solifenacin treatment. ? 2018","mirabegron; solifenacin; acetanilide derivative; mirabegron; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; solifenacin; thiazole derivative; adult; aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; disease association; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; female; flow rate; follow up; human; logistic regression analysis; long term care; major clinical study; male; medical history; observational study; overactive bladder; patient referral; postvoid residual urine volume; prediction; prescription; prospective study; prostate volume; risk factor; transrectal ultrasonography; treatment duration; treatment outcome; univariate analysis; uroflowmetry; middle aged; multivariate analysis; overactive bladder; severity of illness index; statistical model; very elderly; Acetanilides; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Muscarinic Antagonists; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Solifenacin Succinate; Thiazoles; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Bladder, Overactive"
"Proton pump inhibitors therapy and the risk of pneumonia: a systematic review and meta?analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies","2019","Objective: We aimed to summarize the current evidence regarding the risk of pneumonia associated with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) treatment. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL from the 1970 through December 2017. We included both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. We used random-effect model to calculate the summary effect estimates and quantified the heterogeneity by I 2 statistics. Results: A total of 7,643,982 patients from 10 RCTs and 48 observational studies were included in this meta-analysis. The primary meta-analysis demonstrated PPIs use was significantly associated with increased risk of pneumonia, but the heterogeneity was high (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30–1.57; I 2 , 95.4%). The sensitivity analysis indicated PPIs were not statistically associated with increased risk of pneumonia among patients concomitantly taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.94–1.31; I 2 , 5.8%). The funnel plot demonstrated significant publication bias, especially for observational studies. Conclusions: The presence of significant between-study heterogeneity and publication bias raised concerns regarding the validity of the primary meta-analytic result. Protopathic bias, or reverse causality, may cause overestimated association. Studies that adopted a design to account for protopathic bias did not show a significant association between PPI use and risk of pneumonia. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; proton pump inhibitor; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; proton pump inhibitor; Article; disease association; drug effect; Embase; evidence based practice; genetic heterogeneity; high risk patient; human; infection risk; Medline; meta analysis; observational study; pneumonia; publication bias; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; methodology; pneumonia; publishing; statistical analysis; statistical model; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Models, Statistical; Pneumonia; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Publication Bias; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design"
"Quantile-based fecal hemoglobin concentration for assessing colorectal neoplasms with 1,263,717 Taiwanese screenees","2019","Background: Although fecal hemoglobin concentration (f-Hb) was highly associated with the risk of colorectal neoplasms, current studies on this subject are hampered by skewedness of the data and the ordinal property of f-Hb has not been well studied yet. Our aim was to develop a quantile-based method to estimate adjusted percentiles (median) of fecal hemoglobin concentration and their derived prediction for the risk of multistage outcomes of colorectal disease. Methods: We used a 6-year follow-up cohort of Taiwanese nationwide colorectal screening program with fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) to obtain fecal hemoglobin concentration and applied accelerated failure time multi-variable analyses to make the comparison of adjusted median and other percentitles of fecal hemoglobin across four categories of colorectal carcinogenesis. We then predicted the risk of colorectal neoplasms on the basis of the corresponding percentile values by using accelerated failure time model with Bayesian inversion method. Results: The adjusted median fecal hemoglobin concentration of nonadvanced adenoma, advanced adenoma, and colorectal cancer were 57, 82, and 163 μg/g feces as opposed to 0 μg/g feces for the normal group. At 90 μg/g of f-Hb, the highly suspected cut-off for colorectal disease, the risks were 17% for non-advanced adenoma, 6% for advanced adenoma, and 9% for CRC. Life-time risks of each colorectal neoplasm were derived by percentiles of fecal hemoglobin concentration. Conclusion: Covariate-adjusted risk stratification for multistage outcomes of colorectal neoplasia were provided by using the quantiles of fecal hemoglobin concentration, yielding the estimated life-time risks of 25th to 75th quantitles, ranging from 0.5 to 44% for colorectal cancer, 0.2 to 46% for non-advanced adenoma, and 0.1 to 20% for advanced adenoma. ? 2019 The Author(s).","hemoglobin; adenoma; aged; Bayes theorem; cohort analysis; colonoscopy; colorectal tumor; early cancer diagnosis; feces; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; occult blood; predictive value; Taiwan; Adenoma; Aged; Bayes Theorem; Cohort Studies; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Feces; Female; Hemoglobins; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occult Blood; Predictive Value of Tests; Taiwan"
"Urine protein:creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma","2019","Background: Proteinuria monitoring is required in patients receiving lenvatinib, however, current methodology involves burdensome overnight urine collection. Methods: To determine whether the simpler urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) calculated from spot urine samples could be accurately used for proteinuria monitoring in patients receiving lenvatinib, we evaluated the correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein results from the phase 3 REFLECT study. Paired data (323 tests, 154 patients) were analysed. Results: Regression analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein (R2: 0.75; P &lt; 2 × 10?16). A UPCR cut-off value of 2.4 had 96.9% sensitivity, 82.5% specificity for delineating between grade 2 and 3 proteinuria. Using this UPCR cut-off value to determine the need for further testing could reduce the need for 24-hour urine collection in ~74% of patients. Conclusion: Incorporation of UPCR into the current algorithm for proteinuria management can enable optimisation of lenvatinib treatment, while minimising patient inconvenience.

"Cancer-associated fibroblasts produce netrin-1 to control cancer cell plasticity","2019","Netrin-1 is upregulated in a large fraction of human neoplasms. In multiple animal models, interference with netrin-1 is associated with inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. Although netrin-1 upregulation was initially described in cancer cells, we report here that in the human colorectal cancer database, the expression of netrin-1 and its receptor UNC5B correlates with a cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) signature. Both colon and lung CAF secreted netrin-1 when cocultured with respective cancer cells, and netrin-1 upregulation in CAF was associated with increased cancer cell stemness. Pharma-cologic inhibition of netrin-1 with a netrin-1–mAb (Net1–mAb) abrogated the CAF-mediated increase of cancer stemness both in coculture experiments and in mice. Net-1–mAb inhibited intercellular signaling between CAF and cancer cells by modulating CAF-mediated expression of cytokines such as IL6. Together these data demonstrate that netrin-1 is upregulated not only in cancer cells but also in cancer-associated stromal cells. In addition to its direct activity on cancer cells, inhibition of netrin-1 may reduce proneoplastic CAF–cancer cell cross-talk, thus inhibiting cancer plasticity. Significance: Netrin-1, a navigation cue during embryonic development, is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts and regulates cancer cell stemness. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","interleukin 6; monoclonal antibody; netrin 1; netrin 1 monoclonal antibody; siltuximab; unclassified drug; A-549 cell line; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer associated fibroblast; cancer cell; cell plasticity; coculture; colon adenocarcinoma; controlled study; ex vivo study; female; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein secretion; protein synthesis; signal transduction; upregulation"
"Combining procalcitonin with the qSOFA and sepsis mortality prediction","2019","To investigate whether procalcitonin (PCT) can improve the performance of quick sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score in predicting sepsis mortality, we conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study with independent validation in a prospectively collected cohort in 3 tertiary medical centers. Patients with presumed sepsis were included. Serum PCT levels were measured at admission. Quick SOFA score and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria were calculated for each patient. PCT levels were assigned into 0, 1, and 2 points for a serum level of <0.25, 0.25 to 2, and >2ng/mL, and added to the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score. The incremental value of PCT to qSOFA was then evaluated by logistic regression, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and reclassification analysis.In all, 1318 patients with presumed severe infection were enrolled with a 30-day mortality of 13.5%. Serum level of PCT showed a high correlation with qSOFA score and 30-day inhospital mortality. The area under the ROC curve was 0.56 for SIRS criteria, 0.67 for qSOFA score, and 0.73 for qSOFA-PCT in predicting 30-day mortality. The risk prediction improvement was reflected by a net reclassification improvement of 35% (17%-52%). Incorporation of PCT into the qSOFA model could raise the sensitivity to 86.5% (95% confidence interval 80.6%-91.2%). In the validation cohort, qSOFA-PCT greatly improved the sensitivity to 90.9%.A simple modification of qSOFA score by adding the ordinal scale of PCT value to qSOFA could greatly improve the suboptimal sensitivity problem of qSOFA and may serve as a quick screening tool for early identification of sepsis. ? 2019 Oxford University Press.

"Anti-metastatic activity of MPT0G211, a novel HDAC6 inhibitor, in human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo","2019","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with an increased risk of metastasis and a poor prognosis. The invasive ability of TNBC relies on actin reorganization and is regulated by histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). The present study aimed to examine the effect of MPT0G211, a novel HDAC6 inhibitor, on cell migration and microtubule association in both in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC. Here MPT0G211 more selectively and potently targeted and inhibited HDAC6, compared with tubastatin A, another selective HDAC6 inhibitor. In vitro, MPT0G211 decreased the migration of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, particularly when administered together with paclitaxel, and increased heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) acetylation, leading to the dissociation of Hsp90 from aurora-A and proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, MPT0G211 significantly disrupted F-actin polymerization by increasing cortactin acetylation and downregulating slingshot protein phosphatase 1 (SSH1) and active cofilin expression. In vivo, MPT0G211 treatment significantly ameliorated TNBC metastasis. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MPT0G211 reduces TNBC cell motility by promoting cortactin acetylation and aurora-A degradation, and inhibiting the cofilin–F-actin pathway via HDAC6 activity attenuation. MPT0G211 therefore demonstrates therapeutic potential for invasive TNBC. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","cofilin; cortactin; F actin; heat shock protein 90; histone deacetylase 6; histone deacetylase inhibitor; mpt 0g211; paclitaxel; phosphoprotein phosphatase 1; proteasome; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; AURKA protein, human; aurora A kinase; heat shock protein 90; histone deacetylase inhibitor; paclitaxel; acetylation; Article; breast cancer; cancer cell; cell migration; cell viability; controlled study; human; human cell; metastasis inhibition; microtubule; polymerization; priority journal; protein degradation; animal; cell motion; cell survival; drug effect; drug potentiation; drug screening; female; gene expression regulation; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; metastasis; mouse; triple negative breast cancer; tumor cell line; Acetylation; Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Aurora Kinase A; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Survival; Drug Synergism; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Paclitaxel; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Validation of psychometric properties and development of response criteria for the psoriasis symptoms and signs diary (PSSD): results from a phase 3 clinical trial","2019","Purpose: The Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD) is a patient-reported instrument that assesses severity of six symptoms (itch, skin tightness, burning, stinging, and pain) and five signs (dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding/flaking, redness, and bleeding) of psoriasis. Materials and methods: PSSD symptoms and signs summary scores (range, 0–100) were derived based on individual item scores (0–10 [absent-worst imaginable]). Using Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI], Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA] and Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]) data from the NAVIGATE trial of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, analyses were conducted to further validate the PSSD (7-day recall version) and establish criteria for clinically meaningful improvements (CMIs). Results: Mean PSSD symptoms and signs summary scores were 50.6 and 60.7, respectively, at baseline, with no major floor (score of 0) or ceiling (maximum score) effects. PSSD scores and changes in PSSD scores were highly correlated with PASI, IGA, and DLQI scores (most Spearman’s correlation r’s ?0.4, all p <.001). A 2-grade improvement in IGA or an improvement of 75%-<90% in PASI was associated with CMIs of ?40-points in PSSD summary scores and ?3–5-points in individual item scores. Conclusions: The PSSD possesses strong psychometric properties and is suitable for use as a measure of disease severity in clinical studies of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","guselkumab; ustekinumab; dermatological agent; guselkumab; monoclonal antibody; adult; Article; burn; controlled study; Dermatology Life Quality Index; disease severity; double blind procedure; dry skin; female; human; major clinical study; male; patient-reported outcome; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; psoriasis; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary; psychometry; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; skin bleeding; skin pain; skin redness; skin tightness; symptom assessment; treatment response; United Kingdom; validation study; aged; clinical trial; medical record; middle aged; multicenter study; patient-reported outcome; procedures; psoriasis; psychometry; quality of life; severity of illness index; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Dermatologic Agents; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Records; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Psoriasis; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index"
"Efficacy of Antiplatelet Agent Usage for Primary and Secondary Prevention in Dialysis Patients: a Nationwide Data Survey and Propensity Analysis","2019","Background: Although cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients, there is little evidence to guide the use of antiplatelet agents in dialysis patients. Method: A nationwide database (Registry for Catastrophic Illnesses) for Taiwan, which has data from nearly all patients who received dialysis therapy from 1995 to 2008, was used. This is a population-based cohort study with time to event analyses to estimate the relation between antiplatelet agent use and outcomes. Hazard ratios were calculated to evaluate the effect of antiplatelet agent use on the risk of major CV events and mortality. Baseline characteristics were matched by propensity score (PS). Results: A total of 71,835 were included, and 10,595 (14.7%) patients received an anti-platelet agent. The median value of follow-up days was 61.6?months. After PS-based matching, 9598 patients who used an antiplatelet agent and 23,794 non-users were included in the analysis. After PS matching, there was no difference between patients using an antiplatelet agent or not in CV events (p = 0.672) and total mortality (p = 0.529). A subgroup analysis of different usage periods of antiplatelet agents indicated that CV events and total mortality were similar in those who used antiplatelet agents for short or long durations. In subgroup analysis, there was also no difference between patients with a different modality of dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), different antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel, and/or ticlopidine) or patients with/without previous cardiovascular disease in CV events and total mortality. Conclusions: Antiplatelet agent usage does not reduce CV events and total mortality in dialysis patients. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; clopidogrel; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; oral antidiabetic agent; ticlopidine; warfarin; adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; data base; drug efficacy; end stage renal disease; female; follow up; hazard ratio; health survey; hemodialysis patient; human; major clinical study; male; prescription; primary prevention; priority journal; propensity score; renal replacement therapy; secondary prevention; Taiwan"
"Outcome of stage IV cancer patients receiving in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a population-based cohort study","2019","The effects of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on patients with advanced cancer remain to be elucidated. We identified a cohort of patients with stage-IV cancer who received in-hospital CPR from the Taiwan Cancer Registry and National Health Insurance claims database, along with a matched cohort without cancer who also received in-hospital CPR. The main outcomes were post-discharge survival and in-hospital mortality. In total, 3,446 stage-IV cancer patients who underwent in-hospital CPR after cancer diagnosis were identified during January 2009–June 2014. A vast majority of the patients did not survive to discharge (n = 2,854, 82.8%). The median post-discharge survival was 22 days; 10.1% (n = 60; 1.7% of all patients) of the hospital survivors received anticancer therapy after discharge. We created 1:1 age–, sex–, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)–, and year of CPR–matched noncancer and stage-IV cancer cohorts (n = 3,425 in both; in-hospital mortality rate = 82.1% and 82.8%, respectively). Regression analysis showed that the stage-IV cancer cohort had shorter post-discharge survival than did the noncancer cohort. The outcome of patients with advanced cancer was poor. Even among the survivors, post-discharge survival was short, with only few patients receiving further anticancer therapy. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Direct Neck Exposure for Rescue Endovascular Mechanical Thrombectomy in a Patient with Acute Common Carotid Occlusion Concurrent with Type A Aortic Dissection","2019","Background: Mechanical thrombectomy is an effective treatment of acute large vessel occlusion. However, when difficult anatomy is encountered in which the reperfusion catheter cannot be positioned well, the outcomes can be suboptimal. We present a patient with right common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery occlusion after repair of an acute type A aortic dissection. Successful mechanical thrombectomy and stenting through direct neck exposure and puncture was performed. Case Description: A 45-year-old man with a type A aortic dissection presented with sudden onset of neck pain and cold sweating. Aortic valve resuspension, proximal anastomosis of ascending aortic graft, partial aortic arch graft replacement, and innominate artery reimplantation was performed. After aortic surgery, left limb weakness was noted in the intensive care unit. Computed tomography angiography of the brain showed right CCA occlusion up to the internal carotid artery. The right CCA was exposed and directly punctured. A thrombus was successfully removed, and 5 stents were deployed to treat the internal carotid artery and CCA dissection. Angiography showed a final Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 3 result, and the patient had an excellent clinical recovery. Conclusions: Acute mechanical thrombectomy through open direct neck puncture to treat an acute type A aortic dissection and concurrent CCA dissection and occlusion is an effective and optimal method. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","acetylsalicylic acid; adult; aortic arch; aortic dissection; aortic valve; arm weakness; Article; backache; brachiocephalic trunk; carotid artery obstruction; case report; celiac artery; clinical article; computed tomographic angiography; digital subtraction angiography; endovascular surgery; epigastric pain; human; iliac artery; internal carotid artery occlusion; male; mechanical thrombectomy; middle aged; muscle strength; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; neck pain; reimplantation; skin incision; sternocleidomastoid muscle"
"The dentin permeability of anti-inflammatory and antibacterial drugs: In vitro study","2019","Background/purpose: Stimuli from the oral cavity may penetrate through exposed dentinal tubules and evoke inflammatory pulp response. Anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory drugs applied to exposed dentin may infiltrate through the dentinal tubules and cause pulp recovery. This study investigated the dentin permeability of anti-bacterial and anti-inflammation drugs via an in-vitro transwell dentin disc tube model. Methods: Twenty-seven dentin discs prepared from extracted human molars were collected. Nine kinds of drugs were investigated with three dentin discs in each group. These nine drugs included two anti-bacterial drugs (ampicillin sodium and clindamycin phosphate), two corticosteroids (betamethasone sodium phosphate and hydrocortisone sodium succinate), three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, piroxicam, lysine acetylsalicylate, and diclofenac sodium), and two natural extracts with anti-inflammatory effect (Ginsenoside Rg1 and Hinokitol). The drugs were introduced to the transwell dentin disc tube model and the 4-hour cumulative release of the drug was detected and recorded by UV-visible spectroscopy. Results: We found that ampicilin sodium had better dentin permeability than clindamycin phosphate. Betamethasone sodium phosphate revealed better dentin permeability than hydrocortisone sodium succinate. Lysine acetylsalicylate showed the best dentin permeability among the three NSAIDs. Ginsenoside Rg1 had the best dentin permeability among the nine drugs tested. However, Hinokitiol could not penetrate the dentin disc after 4 h. Conclusion: Regarding the dentin permeability, Ginsenoside Rg1 is the best among the seven anti-inflammatory drugs tested and ampicilin sodium is the better one between the two anti-bacterial drugs tested. Therefore, these two drugs may have high potential for treating exposed dentinal tubule diseases. ? 2018","ampicillin; antibiotic agent; antiinflammatory agent; betamethasone; betamethasone sodium phosphate; clindamycin phosphate; diclofenac; ginsenoside Rg 1; hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone sodium succinate; lysine acetylsalicylate; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; piroxicam; thujaplicin; acetylsalicylic acid; acetylsalicylic acid lysinate; ampicillin; antiinfective agent; antiinflammatory agent; betamethasone; ginsenoside; lysine; antiinflammatory activity; Article; dentin; dentin permeability; human; in vitro study; molar tooth; molecular weight; pH; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; analogs and derivatives; drug effect; scanning electron microscopy; Ampicillin; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Aspirin; Betamethasone; Dentin; Dentin Permeability; Ginsenosides; Humans; Lysine; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"
"Baseline Level of Hepatitis B Core Antibody Predicts Spontaneous Hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg) Seroconversion in HBeAg-Positive Children With a Normal Alanine Aminotransferase Level","2019","It is not clear whether baseline hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) level in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive children with a normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is predictive of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion. We investigated the correlation between anti-HBc level and the natural course of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus (HBV) infection in children, particularly the ability of baseline anti-HBc level to predict spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion during long-term follow-up. HBeAg-positive children with untreated CHB and a normal ALT level were followed longitudinally. Anti-HBc level was determined by double-sandwich immunoassay. Effects of anti-HBc levels and other parameters on spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion and the natural course of CHB were assessed. A total of 182 children (106 males) with a median age at enrollment of 10.6?years (interquartile range [IQR], 10.3-15.3) were followed for a median of 19.8?years (IQR, 11.9-21.9). Spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 85 children (46.7%) during the follow-up. A baseline anti-HBc titer of?&gt;500?IU/mL (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.81), HBV genotype B and B?+?C (HR?=?3.46), and a baseline hepatitis B surface antigen titer of??4.8 log10?IU/mL (HR?=?3.09) were predictive of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion, based on multivariable survival analysis (P?&lt;?0.001). In cases remaining HBeAg positive, their anti-HBc levels increased gradually during follow-up because of ongoing inflammation. Conclusion: Baseline anti-HBc level is predictive of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive children with a normal ALT level. Anti-HBc level reflects anti-HBV immune response in the HBeAg-positive normal ALT phase of CHB. ? 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","hepatitis B core antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; virus DNA; adolescent; Article; child; chronic hepatitis B; controlled study; cross-sectional study; double sandwich immunoassay; female; follow up; Hepatitis B virus genotype B; human; immunoassay; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; seroconversion"
"A prospective, multi-institution assessment of irreversible electroporation for treatment of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma: initial outcomes from the AHPBA pancreatic registry","2019","Background: The optimal treatment and management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) remains unclear and controversial. This study aimed to report the initial outcomes of the AHPBA Registry and evaluate the reproducibility of existing evidence that the addition of Irreversible Electroporation (IRE), a nonthermal ablative treatment, confers survival benefits beyond standard therapeutic options for patients with LAPC. Methods: From December 2015 to October 2017, patients with LAPC were treated with open-technique IRE following the AHPBA Registry Protocols. Patient demographics, long-term outcomes, and adverse events were recorded. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves for overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP). Results: A total of 152 patients underwent successful IRE. Morbidity and mortality were 18% and 2% respectively, with 19 (13%) patients experiencing severe adverse events. Nine (6%) patients presented with local recurrence. Median TTP, PFS, and OS from diagnosis were 27.3 months, 22.8 months, and 30.7 months respectively. Conclusion: The combination of IRE with established multiagent therapy is safe and demonstrates encouraging survival among patients with LAPC. IRE is associated with a low rate of serious adverse events and has been optimized for more widespread adoption through the standardized protocols available through the AHPBA registry. ? 2019 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Inc.","adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; body mass; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; cancer registry; cancer survival; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; endocrine disease; follow up; gastrointestinal disease; health care utilization; hematologic disease; human; irreversible electroporation; kidney disease; liver disease; lung disease; major clinical study; mental disease; morbidity; neurologic disease; observational study; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreas disease; postoperative infection; postoperative period; progression free survival; prospective study; surgical wound; survival analysis; treatment outcome; tumor volume; vascular disease"
"Structure-guided development of purine amide, hydroxamate, and amidoxime for the inhibition of non-small cell lung cancer","2019","An 8-oxopurine-6-carboxamide compound (1a) was previously identified as an inhibitor of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, more than 30 purine-6-carboxamide derivatives with variations at the C2, N7, C8, and N9 positions were synthesized to investigate the structure?activity relationship as a basis for the construction of an advanced pharmacophore model. This model suggests that purine-6-hydroxamate and purine-6-amidoxime analogs could form more hydrogen bonds with a target protein to enhance the inhibitory activities against H1975 cells. Among the series of analogs, hydroxamate 17 and amidoxime 19a exhibited excellent potency against H1975 cells (IC50 &lt; 1.5 μM) and other lung cancer cells with either wild-type or mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Mouse experiments indicated that compounds 17 and 19a were efficient anticancer agents with no appreciable toxicity. The mechanisms of action for the induction of cell apoptosis were determined to involve microtubule fragmentation and p53-mediated signaling pathways. ? 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","2 (2 ethoxyphenyl) 9 (3 methoxyphenyl) 8 oxo 8,9 dihydro 7h purine 6 carboxamide; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 8 (methylthio) 9 phenyl 9h purine 6 carboxamide; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 8 mercapto 9 phenyl 9h purine 6 carboxamide; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 7 methyl 8 oxo 8,9 dihydro 7h purine 6 carbonitrile; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 7 methyl 8 oxo 8,9 dihydro 7h purine 6 carboxamide; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 8 oxo 8,9 dihydro 7h purine 6 carbonitrile; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 8 oxo 8,9 dihydro 7h purine 6 carboxamide; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 8 oxopurine 6 (n hydroxy)carboxamide; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 8 oxopurine 6 carboxylic acid; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 9 phenyl 8 mercaptopurine 6 carboxnitrile; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) n' hydroxy 8 mercapto 9 phenyl 9h purine 6 carboximidamide; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) n' hydroxy 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 8 oxo 8,9 dihydro 7h purime 6 carboximidamide benzenesulfonic acid salt; 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) n' hydroxy 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 8 oxo 8,9 dihydro 7h purine 6 carboximidamide; 3 [2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 6 (n' hydroxycarbamimidoyl) 8 oxo 7,8 dihydri 9h purin 9 yl] n [5 [5 ( 2 oxohexahydro 1h thieno[3,4 d]imidazol 4 yl)pentanamido]pentyl]benzamide; 8 chloro 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 9h purine 6 carbonitrile; 8 mercaptopurine; amide; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor; hydroxamic acid; n [5 [5 (2 oxohexahydro 1h thieno [3,4 d]imidazol 4 yl)pentanamido]pentyl]3 [6 cyano 2(4 ethoxyphenyl)8 oxo 7,8 dihydro 9h purin 9 yl]benzamide; purine derivative; tert butyl [6 cyano 2 (4 ethoxyphenyl) 9 (2 methoxyphenyl) 9h purin 8 yl]carbamate; unclassified drug; amide; amidoxime; antineoplastic agent; hydroxamic acid; oxime; purine; purine derivative; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; BALB/c nude mouse; cancer inhibition; controlled study; drug inhibition; drug potency; drug synthesis; human; human cell; hydrogen bond; IC50; male; mouse; NCI-H1975 cell line; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; pharmacophore; protein targeting; structure activity relation; tumor xenograft; wild type; animal; cell proliferation; chemical structure; chemistry; dose response; drug effect; drug screening; experimental neoplasm; lung tumor; non small cell lung cancer; nude mouse; pathology; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell line; Amides; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Humans; Hydroxamic Acids; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Nude; Molecular Structure; Neoplasms, Experimental; Oximes; Purines; Structure-Activity Relationship"
"Hypoxia-induced Slug SUMOylation enhances lung cancer metastasis 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis 06 Biological Sciences 0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology","2019","Background: The Slug-E-cadherin axis plays a critical role in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) where aberrant upregulation of Slug promotes cancer metastasis. Now, the post-translational modifications of Slug and their regulation mechanisms still remain unclear in lung cancer. Hence, exploring the protein linkage map of Slug is of great interest for investigating the scenario of how Slug protein is regulated in lung cancer metastasis. Methods: The Slug associated proteins, Ubc9 and SUMO-1, were identified using yeast two-hybrid screening; and in vitro SUMOylation assays combined with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed to explore the detail events and regulations of Slug SUMOylation. The functional effects of SUMOylation on Slug proteins were examined by EMSA, reporter assay, ChIP assay, RT-PCR, migration and invasion assays in vitro, tail vein metastatic analysis in vivo, and also evaluated the association with clinical outcome of NSCLC patients. Results: Slug protein could interact with Ubc9 and SUMO-1 and be SUMOylated in cells. Amino acids 130-212 and 33-129 of Slug are responsible for its binding to Ubc9 and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS)y, respectively. SUMOylation could enhance the transcriptional repression activity of Slug via recruiting more HDAC1, resulting in reduced expression of downstream Slug target genes and enhanced lung cancer metastasis. In addition, hypoxia could increase Slug SUMOylation through attenuating the interactions of Slug with SENP1 and SENP2. Finally, high expression Slug and Ubc9 levels were associated with poor overall survival among NSCLC patients. Conclusions: Ubc9/PIASy-mediated Slug SUMOylation and subsequent HDAC1 recruitment may play a crucial role in hypoxia-induced lung cancer progression, and these processes may serve as therapeutic targets for NSCLC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","histone deacetylase 1; messenger RNA; protein inhibitor of activated STAT; protein Ubc9; proteinase; SENP1 protein; SENP2 protein; SUMO 1 protein; transcription factor Slug; unclassified drug; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer prognosis; cell hypoxia; cell invasion; cell migration; chromatin; controlled study; female; human; human cell; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; metastasis; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; overall survival; priority journal; protein protein interaction; sumoylation; transcription regulation; transcriptional repression; complication; genetic transfection; genetics; lung tumor; metastasis; pathology; sumoylation; tumor cell line; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Neoplasm Metastasis; Sumoylation; Transfection"
"Basics and applications of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles","2019","Extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated intercellular communication acts as a critical culprit in cancer development. The selective packaging of oncogenic molecules renders tumor-derived EVs capable of altering the tumor microenvironment and thereby modulating cancer developments that may contribute to drug resistance and cancer recurrence. Moreover, the molecular and functional characteristics of cancer through its development and posttreatment evolve over time. Tumor-derived EVs are profoundly involved in this process and can, therefore, provide valuable real-time information to reflect dynamic changes occurring within the body. Because they bear unique molecular profiles or signatures, tumor-derived EVs have been highlighted as valuable diagnostic and predictive biomarkers as well as novel therapeutic targets. In addition, the use of an advanced EV-based drug delivery system for cancer therapeutics has recently been emphasized in both basic and clinical studies. In this review, we highlight comprehensive aspects of tumor-derived EVs in oncogenic processes and their potential clinical applications. ? 2019 The Author(s).","integrin; messenger RNA; microRNA; tumor marker; 3' untranslated region; binding affinity; cancer diagnosis; cancer growth; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; cell isolation; cell transport; clinical feature; drug delivery system; epithelial mesenchymal transition; exosome; gene expression; genetic variability; homeostasis; human; immunotherapy; intracellular signaling; practice guideline; priority journal; protein function; Review; tumor microenvironment; cell communication; exosome; neoplasm; oncogene; physiology; procedures; tumor microenvironment; Cell Communication; Drug Delivery Systems; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Neoplasms; Oncogenes; Tumor Microenvironment"
"PhantomLegs: Reducing virtual reality sickness using head-worn haptic devices","2019","Virtual Reality (VR) sickness occurs when exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to motion sickness, and has been one of the major user experience barriers of VR. To reduce VR sickness, prior work has explored dynamic field-of-view modification and galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) that recou-ples the visual and vestibular systems. We propose a new approach to reduce VR sickness, called PhantomLegs, that applies alternating haptic cues that are synchronized to users' footsteps in VR. Our prototype consists of two servos with padded swing arms, one set on each side of the head, that lightly taps the head as users walk in VR. We conducted a three-session, multi-day user study with 30 participants to evaluate its effects as users navigate through a VR environment while physically being seated. Results show that our approach significantly reduces VR sickness during the initial exposure while remaining comfortable to users. ? 2019 IEEE.","Biped locomotion; Diseases; User interfaces; Centered computing; Dynamic fields; Haptics; Human; Interaction techniques; Motion sickness; User experience; Vestibular system; Virtual reality"
"Ultrasound Parameters Other Than the Direct Measurement of Ulnar Nerve Size for Diagnosing Cubital Tunnel Syndrome: A Systemic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","Objective: To investigate the diagnostic performance of available ultrasound (US) parameters, other than the direct measurements of ulnar nerve size, that is, cross-sectional area (CSA) and diameter, for diagnosing cubital tunnel syndrome (CuTS). Data Sources: Databases, including PubMed and Embase, were searched from the earliest record of CuTS US to April 24, 2018. Study Selection: Published studies (N=13) comparing US parameters of ulnar nerves between patients with CuTS and patients without CuTS were included. Data Extraction: Study design, participants’ demographics, diagnostic references of CuTS, and US parameters other than the direct measurements of the ulnar nerve size were retrieved from the included studies. Data Synthesis: This systematic review comprised 663 CuTS patients and 543 patients without CuTS. The pooled nerve swelling ratio in the CuTS group was significantly larger than that of the controls. The mean between-group differences of CSAMax or ME/CSAarm, CSAMax or ME/CSAforearm and CSAMax or ME/CSAwrist were 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.29), 1.38 (95% CI, 0.93-1.82), and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.56-1.11), respectively. Regarding the swelling ratio of CSAMax or ME /CSAarm, the pooled sensitivity and specificity available from the 3 included studies were 0.67 (95% CI, 0.59-0.74) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.75-0.86), respectively. Similarly, for the swelling ratio of CSAMax or ME/CSAforearm, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.62 (95% CI, 0.54-0.69) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.81-0.90), respectively. Other US parameters identified in this review included nerve-flattening ratio (maximum diameter/minimum diameter), nerve-to-tunnel ratio (ulnar nerve CSA/cubital tunnel CSA), nerve echogenicity, and intraneural vascularity, all of which were reported in a minority of included articles. Conclusions: Despite the insufficient number of pertinent studies to prove its superiority to other US measurements, the ulnar nerve-swelling ratio can be a complementary tool for diagnosing CuTS. The presence of intraneural vascularity, increased flattening ratio, and enlarged intraneural hypoechoic fraction also seem to be potential US indicators for CuTS diagnosis, which need to be validated with more prospective studies. ? 2018 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","confidence interval; cubital tunnel syndrome; data base; demography; echography; human; meta analysis; Review; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; ulnar nerve; vascularization; cubital tunnel syndrome; diagnostic imaging; edema; organ size; pathology; ulnar nerve; Cubital Tunnel Syndrome; Edema; Humans; Organ Size; Ulnar Nerve; Ultrasonography"
"Effects of PM2.5 on Skeletal Muscle Mass and Body Fat Mass of the Elderly in Taipei, Taiwan","2019","Loss of skeletal muscle mass is common with aging and can cause morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The effects of particulate air pollution on skeletal muscle mass is not known. The study aims to assess the chronic effects of ambient fine particulates (PM2.5) on the body composition of the elderly. From October 2015 to November 2016, a cross-sectional survey on 530 elderly (age?>?=?65 years) was conducted in the Taipei Basin, Taiwan. The body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody 120). One year exposure to air pollution was estimated using the Kriging method at the participant's residence. Multiple linear regression analysis, after adjustments for demographics and co-pollutants, was used to examine the effects of PM2.5 on body composition indices and force of handgrip. Changes in body composition for an interquartile (1.4?μm/m3) increase in PM2.5 concentration included a 0.4?kg (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.31, -0.58; p?<?0.0001) decrease in skeletal muscle mass (2.0%) and a 0.7?kg (95% CI: 0.47, 0.91; p?<?0.0001) increase in body fat mass (3.6%). While PM2.5 reduced fat free mass in the upper extremities and trunk, but not in the lower extremities, it increased body fat mass in the three parts. There was no significant effect of PM2.5 on handgrip force. Higher physical activity (versus lower than median) was associated with less detrimental effect of PM2.5 on skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass (p values for interaction term: 0.009 and 0.013, respectively). Long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass and increased body fat mass in the elderly, which can be ameliorated by physical activity.","aged; air pollution; article; body fat; controlled study; fat free mass; female; hand grip; human; impedance; kriging; lower limb; major clinical study; male; multiple linear regression analysis; muscle mass; physical activity; pollutant; skeletal muscle; statistical significance; Taiwan; upper limb"
"Slide-free imaging of hematoxylin-eosin stained whole-mount tissues using combined third-harmonic generation and three-photon fluorescence microscopy","2019","Intraoperative margin assessment of surgical tissues during cancer surgery is clinically important, especially in the case of tissue conserving surgery like Mohs micrographic surgery in which minimization of the surgical area is considered crucial. Frozen pathology is the gold standard of assessing excised tissues for signs of remaining cancerous lesions. The current protocol, however, is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Instead of the complex frozen sectioning, staining, and traditional white light microscopy imaging protocol, optically sectioned histopathological imaging of hematoxylin-eosin stained whole-mount skin tissues with a subfemtoliter resolution is demonstrated by using nonlinear microscopy in this study. With our proposed method, the reagents of staining and the contrast of imaging are fully consistent with the current clinical standard of frozen pathology, thus facilitating rapid intraoperative assessment of surgical tissues for future applications.Slide-free nonlinear microscopy imaging of H&E stained whole-mount skin tissue showing the morphology of sweat glands. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Development and validation of nomograms for predicting survival probability of patients with advanced adenocarcinoma in different EGFR mutation status","2019","Introduction Molecular markers are important variables in the selection of treatment for cancer patients and highly associated with their survival. Therefore, a nomogram that can predict survival probability by incorporating epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status and treatments for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma would be highly valuable. The aim of the study is to develop and validate a novel nomogram, incorporating epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status and treatments, for predicting 1-year and 2-year survival probability of patients with advanced adenocarcinoma. Material and methods Data on 13,043 patients between June 1, 2011, and December 31, 2014 were collected. Seventy percent of them were randomly assigned to the training cohort for nomogram development, and the remaining 30% assigned to the validation cohort. The most important factors for constructing the nomogram were identified using multivariable Cox regression analysis. The discriminative ability and calibration of the nomograms were tested using C-statistics, calibration plots, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results In the training cohort, 1-year and 2-year OS were 52.8% and 28.5% in EGFR(-) patients, and 73.9% and 44.1% in EGFR(+) patients, respectively. In EGFR(+) group, factors selected were age, gender, congestive heart failure, renal disease, number of lymph node examined, tumor stage, surgical intervention, radiotherapy, first-line chemotherapy, ECOG performance status, malignant pleural effusion, and smoking. In EGFR(-) group, factors selected were age, gender, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, number of lymph node examined, tumor stage, surgical intervention, radiotherapy, ECOG performance status, malignant pleural effusion, and a history of smoking. Two nomograms show good accuracy in predicting OS, with a concordance index of 0.83 in EGFR(+) and of 0.88 in EGFR(-). Conclusions The survival prediction models can be used to make individualized predictions with different EGFR mutation status and a useful tool for selecting regimens for treating advanced adenocarcinoma. ? 2019 Chen et al.

"Promotion of homology-directed DNA repair by polyamines","2019","Polyamines, often elevated in cancer cells, have been shown to promote cell growth and proliferation. Whether polyamines regulate other cell functions remains unclear. Here, we explore whether and how polyamines affect genome integrity. When DNA double-strand break (DSB) is induced in hair follicles by ionizing radiation, reduction of cellular polyamines augments dystrophic changes with delayed regeneration. Mechanistically, polyamines facilitate homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair without affecting repair via non-homologous DNA end-joining and single-strand DNA annealing. Biochemical reconstitution and functional analyses demonstrate that polyamines enhance the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51 recombinase. The effect of polyamines on RAD51 stems from their ability to enhance the capture of homologous duplex DNA and synaptic complex formation by the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. Our work demonstrates a novel function of polyamines in the maintenance of genome integrity via homology-directed DNA repair. ? 2019, The Author(s).","polyamine; Rad51 protein; olaparib; ornithine decarboxylase; ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor; phthalazine derivative; piperazine derivative; polyamine; Rad51 protein; RAD51 protein, human; single stranded DNA; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; DNA repair; double stranded DNA break; female; genome; hair follicle; human; human cell; mouse; nonhuman; animal; C57BL mouse; DNA end joining repair; drug effect; gamma radiation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; physiology; radiation response; recombination repair; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; DNA End-Joining Repair; DNA, Single-Stranded; Female; Gamma Rays; Hair Follicle; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Ornithine Decarboxylase; Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors; Phthalazines; Piperazines; Polyamines; Rad51 Recombinase; Recombinational DNA Repair"
"Real-life experience of ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema in Taiwan","2019","Purpose: To evaluate the visual and anatomical outcomes of intravitreal ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema (DME) in the healthcare system of Taiwan. Methods: A total of 39 eyes from 39 patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study. All eyes that fulfilled the key criteria, including a baseline vision between 20 and 70 ETDRS letters and a minimum central macular thickness (CMT) of 300??m, had at least 3 monthly loading injections of ranibizumab in a year. Macular laser or posterior subtenon injections of triamcinolone acetonide (PSTA) could be performed as supplementary treatments following loading injections. Primary outcomes include best-corrected visual acuity and CMT. Results: Patients’ vision improved from 46.5 ± 15.3 letters at baseline to 51.4 ± 16.6 letters at 12?months (p = 0.031). Mean CMT at baseline was 406 ± 105??m, which decreased to 329 ± 108??m (p = 0.002). At 12?months, 44.4% of eyes with total injection number < 5 and 42.9% with injection number ? 5 achieved a gain in vision that was 10 letters or more. A total of 5 injections or more did not lead to a better visual gain in comparison with only 3–4 injections (p = 0.71), and both had similar number of supplementary treatments (p = 0.43). Monthly reinjections of ranibizumab resulted in a lower likelihood of visual loss of 10 or 15 letters (p = 0.019 and 0.015, respectively, adjusted for age, baseline vision, severity of diabetic retinopathy and the presence of previous treatments); however, supplementary macular lasers, PSTA or ranibizumab without monthly reinjections did not (all p > 0.05). The average number of injections was 4.3 ± 1.0. Conclusion: Treatment for DME with at least three monthly ranibizumab loading injections, with or without other supplementary treatments, is effective at 12?months thereafter. Two monthly reinjections of ranibizumab, while not significantly increasing vision, may have a role in preventing visual loss. ? 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","ranibizumab; triamcinolone acetonide; angiogenesis inhibitor; ranibizumab; vasculotropin A; adult; Article; best corrected visual acuity; central macular thickness; clinical article; diabetic macular edema; diabetic retinopathy; disease severity; health care system; human; middle aged; personal experience; Taiwan; Taiwanese; treatment outcome; vision; visual impairment; antagonists and inhibitors; complication; diabetic retinopathy; female; follow up; incidence; intravitreal drug administration; macular edema; male; optical coherence tomography; pathology; retina macula lutea; retrospective study; visual acuity; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Intravitreal Injections; Macula Lutea; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Ranibizumab; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Visual Acuity"
"Dual therapy with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) plus lamivudine versus triple therapy with ritonavir-boosted PI plus two nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor in HIV-infected patients with viral suppression","2019","Background: Dual antiretroviral regimens are attractive options to optimize the combination antiretroviral therapy in light of potential toxicities with long-term cumulative exposure to nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we included HIV-infected patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy with plasma viral load (PVL) < 200 copies/mL for at least 6 months who were switched to dual regimens containing lamivudine (3TC) (150 mg twice daily or 300 mg once daily) plus lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) 250/50 mg twice daily or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800/100 mg once daily. Patients maintaining on suppressive triple therapy with DRV/r or LPV/r plus two NRTIs were included for comparisons. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PVL <50 copies/mL after 48 weeks of follow-up. Results: In total, 364 patients were included with 93 (25.5%) switched to dual therapy After 48 weeks of observation, PVL <50 copies/mL was observed in 96.8% and 94.1% of dual-therapy and triple-therapy group, respectively, in per-protocol analysis (difference 2.7%; 95% CI -2.5%–7.9%). Nineteen patients (3 [3.2%] in dual-therapy and 16 [7.6%] in triple-therapy group) developed virologic failure, with none having emergent M184V resistance-associated mutation. A statistically significant increase of cholesterol level (13 mg/dL versus 2 mg/dL, p = 0.003) and high-density lipoprotein (3 mg/dL versus ?2 mg/dL, p = 0.019) were observed in dual-therapy than in triple-therapy group. Changes of triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein and glycated hemoglobin levels were similar between the two groups. Conclusion: Dual therapy with DRV/r or LPV/r plus lamivudine demonstrated similar effectiveness in maintaining viral suppression to triple therapy. ? 2019","abacavir; cholesterol; darunavir; dolutegravir; glycosylated hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein; lamivudine; lipid; lopinavir; low density lipoprotein; ritonavir; triacylglycerol; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; cholesterol level; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; drug safety; female; follow up; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; metabolic parameters; observational study; patient care; retrospective study; treatment response; virus load"
"Risk Prediction of Prostate Cancer with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Prostate Specific Antigen","2019","Purpose:Combined information on single nucleotide polymorphisms and prostate specific antigen offers opportunities to improve the performance of screening by risk stratification. We aimed to predict the risk of prostate cancer based on prostate specific antigen together with single nucleotide polymorphism information.Materials and Methods:We performed a prospective study of 20,575 men with prostate specific antigen testing and 4,967 with a polygenic risk score for prostate cancer based on 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the Finnish population based screening trial of prostate cancer and 5,269 samples of 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the Finnish prostate cancer DNA study. A Bayesian predictive model was built to estimate the risk of prostate cancer by sequentially combining genetic information with prostate specific antigen compared with prostate specific antigen alone in study subjects limited to those with prostate specific antigen 4 ng/ml or above.Results:The posterior odds of prostate cancer based on 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms together with the prostate specific antigen level ranged from 3.7 at 4 ng/ml, 14.2 at 6 and 40.7 at 8 to 98.2 at 10 ng/ml. The ROC AUC was elevated to 88.8% (95% CI 88.6-89.1) for prostate specific antigen combined with the risk score based on 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms compared with 70.1% (95% CI 69.6-70.7) for prostate specific antigen alone. It was further escalated to 96.7% (95% CI 96.5-96.9) when all prostate cancer susceptibility polygenes were combined.Conclusions:Expedient use of multiple genetic variants together with information on prostate specific antigen levels better predicts the risk of prostate cancer than prostate specific antigen alone and allows for higher prostate specific antigen cutoffs. Combined information also provides a basis for risk stratification which can be used to optimize the performance of prostate cancer screening. ? 2019 by AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, INC.","DNA; prostate specific antigen; prostate specific antigen; adult; aged; Article; Bayesian learning; cancer risk; Finn (citizen); genetic variability; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prospective study; prostate cancer; single nucleotide polymorphism; validation study; Bayes theorem; biopsy; blood; early cancer diagnosis; genetics; middle aged; prostate tumor; risk assessment; single nucleotide polymorphism; Bayes Theorem; Biopsy; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prospective Studies; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Assessment"
"A gelatin/collagen/polycaprolactone scaffold for skin regeneration","2019","Background. A tissue-engineered skin substitute, based on gelatin (‘‘G’’), collagen (‘‘C’’), and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL; ‘‘P’’), was developed. Method. G/C/P biocomposites were fabricated by impregnation of lyophilized gelatin/collagen (GC) mats with PCL solutions, followed by solvent evaporation. Two different GC:PCL ratios (1:8 and 1:20) were used. Results. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that all G/C/P biocomposites had characteristic melting point of PCL at around 60 ?C. Scanning electron microscopy showed that all biocomposites had similar fibrous structures. Good cytocompatibility was present in all G/C/P biocomposites when incubated with primary human epidermal keratinocytes (PHEK), human dermal fibroblasts (PHDF) and human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in vitro. All G/C/P biocomposites exhibited similar cell growth and mechanical characteristics in comparison with C/P biocomposites. G/C/P biocomposites with a lower collagen content showed better cell proliferation than those with a higher collagen content in vitro. Due to reasonable mechanical strength and biocompatibility in vitro, G/C/P with a lower content of collagen and a higher content of PCL (GCLPH) was selected for animal wound healing studies. According to our data, a significant promotion in wound healing and skin regeneration could be observed in GCLPH seeded with adipose-derived stem cells by Gomori’s trichrome staining. Conclusion. This study may provide an effective and low-cost wound dressings to assist skin regeneration for clinical use. ? 2019 Wei et al.","collagen; cytoskeleton protein; gelatin; polycaprolactone; adipose derived stem cell; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biocompatibility; BJ [Human fibroblast] cell line; cell culture; cell density; cell encapsulation; cell isolation; cell proliferation; child; composite graft; differential scanning calorimetry; extracellular matrix; female; foreskin cell line; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; keratinocyte; mouse; nonhuman; protein secretion; regenerative medicine; scanning electron microscopy; skin regeneration; tensile strength; tissue engineering; wound healing"
"High throughput sequencing of T-cell receptor repertoire using dry blood spots","2019","Background: Immunology research, particularly next generation sequencing (NGS) of the immune T-cell receptor β (TCRβ) repertoire, has advanced progression in several fields, including treatment of various cancers and autoimmune diseases. This study aimed to identify the TCR repertoires from dry blood spots (DBS), a method that will help collecting real-world data for biomarker applications. Methods: Finger-prick blood was collected onto a Whatman filter card. RNA was extracted from DBS of the filter card, and fully automated multiplex PCR was performed to generate a TCRβ chain library for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of unique CDR3s (uCDR3). Results: We demonstrated that the dominant clonotypes from the DBS results recapitulated those found in whole blood. According to the statistical analysis and laboratory confirmation, 40 of 2-mm punch disks from the filter cards were enough to detect the shared top clones and have strong correlation in the uCDR3 discovery with whole blood. uCDR3 discovery was neither affected by storage temperatures (room temperature versus-20 °C) nor storage durations (1, 14, and 28 days) when compared to whole blood. About 74-90% of top 50 uCDR3 clones of whole blood could also be detected from DBS. A low rate of clonotype sharing, 0.03-1.5%, was found among different individuals. Conclusions: The DBS-based TCR repertoire profiling method is minimally invasive, provides convenient sampling, and incorporates fully automated library preparation. The system is sensitive to low RNA input, and the results are highly correlated with whole blood uCDR3 discovery allowing study scale-up to better understand the relationship and mutual influences between the immune and diseases. ? 2019 The Author(s).","T lymphocyte receptor beta chain; Article; controlled study; dried blood spot testing; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; next generation sequencing; room temperature; storage temperature"
"Impact of major illnesses and geographic regions on do-not-resuscitate rate and its potential cost savings in Taiwan","2019","Background/Purpose Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) is a legal order that demonstrates a patient's will to avoid further suffering from advanced treatment at the end of life. The concept of palliative care is increasingly accepted, but the impacts of different major illnesses, geographic regions, and health expenses on DNR rates remain unclear. Methods This study utilized the two-million National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database to examine the percentage of DNR rates among all deaths in hospitals from 2001 to 2011. DNR in the study was defined as no resuscitation before death in hospitals. Death records were extracted from the database and correlated with healthcare information. Descriptive statistics were compiled to examine the relationships between DNR rates and variables including major illnesses, geographic regions, and NHI spending. Results A total of 126,390 death records were extracted from the database for analysis. Among cancer-related deaths, pancreatic cancer patients had the highest DNR rate (86.99%) and esophageal cancer patients had the lowest DNR rate (71.62%). The higher DNR rate among cancer-only patients (79.53%) decreased with concomitant dialysis (66.07%) or ventilator use (57.85%). The lower DNR rates in patients with either chronic dialysis (51.27%) or ventilator use (59.10%) increased when patients experienced these two conditions concomitantly (61.31%). Although DNR rates have consistently increased over time across all regions of Taiwan, a persistent disparity was noted between the East and the South (76.89% vs. 70.78% in 2011, p < 0.01). After adjusting for potential confounders, DNR patients had significantly lower NHI spending one year prior to death ($67,553), compared with non-DNR patients. Conclusion Our study found that DNR rates varied across cancer types and decreased in cancer patients with concomitant chronic dialysis or ventilator use. Disparities in DNR rates were evident across geographic regions in Taiwan. A wider adoption of the DNR policy may achieve substantial savings in health expenses and improve patients' quality of life. ? 2019 Cheng et al.

"24-Month Overall Survival from KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G: Pemetrexed and Carboplatin with or without Pembrolizumab as First-Line Therapy for Advanced Nonsquamous Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer","2019","Introduction: Cohort G of KEYNOTE-021 (NCT02039674) evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-carboplatin (PC) versus PC alone as first-line therapy for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. At the primary analysis (median follow-up time 10.6 months), pembrolizumab significantly improved objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS); the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) was 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42?1.91). Herein, we present an updated analysis. Methods: A total of 123 patients with previously untreated stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR and/or ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) aberrations were randomized 1:1 to four cycles of PC with or without pembrolizumab, 200 mg every 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab treatment continued for 2 years; maintenance pemetrexed was permitted in both groups. Eligible patients in the PC-alone group with radiologic progression could cross over to pembrolizumab monotherapy. p Values are nominal (one-sided p < 0.025). Results: As of December 1, 2017, the median follow-up time was 23.9 months. The ORR was 56.7% with pembrolizumab plus PC versus 30.2% with PC alone (estimated difference 26.4% [95% CI: 8.9%?42.4%, p = 0.0016]). PFS was significantly improved with pembrolizumab plus PC versus PC alone (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33?0.86, p = 0.0049). A total of 41 patients in the PC-alone group received subsequent anti?programmed death 1/anti?programmed death ligand 1 therapy. The HR for OS was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.32?0.95, p = 0.0151). Forty-one percent of patients in the pembrolizumab plus PC group and 27% in the PC-alone group had grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events. Conclusions: The significant improvements in PFS and ORR with pembrolizumab plus PC versus PC alone observed in the primary analysis were maintained, and the HR for OS with a 24-month median follow-up was 0.56, favoring pembrolizumab plus PC. ? 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; carboplatin; creatinine; pembrolizumab; pemetrexed; advanced cancer; alanine aminotransferase blood level; anemia; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cancer growth; cancer staging; cohort analysis; colitis; constipation; controlled study; creatinine blood level; decreased appetite; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; dysgeusia; fatigue; follow up; human; hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism; infusion related reaction; lacrimation disorder; major clinical study; multiple cycle treatment; nausea; neutrophil count; non small cell lung cancer; open study; overall survival; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; pneumonia; priority journal; progression free survival; pruritus; rash; side effect; skin toxicity; vomiting"
"Metabolomics of Children and Adolescents Exposed to Industrial Carcinogenic Pollutants","2019","Studies on metabolomes of carcinogenic pollutants among children and adolescents are limited. We aim to identify metabolic perturbations in 107 children and adolescents (aged 9-15) exposed to multiple carcinogens in a polluted area surrounding the largest petrochemical complex in Taiwan. We measured urinary concentrations of eight carcinogen exposure biomarkers (heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represented by 1-hydroxypyrene), and urinary oxidative stress biomarkers and serum acylcarnitines as biomarkers of early health effects. Serum metabolomics was analyzed using a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based method. Pathway analysis and ""meet-in-the-middle"" approach were applied to identify potential metabolites and biological mechanisms linking carcinogens exposure with early health effects. We found 10 potential metabolites possibly linking increased exposure to IARC group 1 carcinogens (As, Cd, Cr, Ni) and group 2 carcinogens (V, Hg, PAHs) with elevated oxidative stress and deregulated serum acylcarnitines, including inosine monophosphate and adenosine monophosphate (purine metabolism), malic acid and oxoglutaric acid (citrate cycle), carnitine (fatty acid metabolism), and pyroglutamic acid (glutathione metabolism). Purine metabolism was identified as the possible mechanism affected by children and adolescents' exposure to carcinogens. These findings contribute to understanding the health effects of childhood and adolescence exposure to multiple industrial carcinogens during critical periods of development. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Biomarkers; Body fluids; Fatty acids; Health; Heavy metals; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Metabolites; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Adenosine monophosphate; Biological mechanisms; Children and adolescents; Glutathione metabolism; Liquid chromatography - mass spectrometries; Oxidative stress biomarkers; Petrochemical complex; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Carcinogens; 2 oxoglutaric acid; 2 oxoisocaproic acid; adenosine phosphate; arsenic; aspartic acid; cadmium; carcinogen; carnitine; chromium; inosine phosphate; isovalerylcarnitine; malic acid; mercury; nickel; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyroglutamic acid; unclassified drug; vanadium; biological marker; carcinogen; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; adolescence; carcinogen; child health; health impact; industrial emission; metabolism; oxidative stress; PAH; pollution effect; pollution exposure; serum; adolescent; Article; body mass; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; environmental exposure; female; high performance liquid chromatography; human; kidney concentrating capacity; lipid peroxidation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; male; metabolomics; method detection limit; oxidative stress; partial least squares regression; pollutant; purine metabolism; quality control; quantitative analysis; systolic blood pressure; urine level; child; environmental monitoring; metabolomics; Taiwan; Taiwan; Adolescent; Biomarkers; Carcinogens; Child; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Metabolomics; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Taiwan"
"Distinct tumor microenvironment at tumor edge as a result of astrocyte activation is associated with therapeutic resistance for brain tumor","2019","Tumor vasculatures and hypoxia are critical tumor microenvironmental factors associated with tumor response to the therapy and heterogeneous in both time- and location-dependent manner. Using a murine orthotopic anaplastic astrocytoma model, ALTS1C1, this study showed that brain tumor edge had a very unique microenvironment, having higher microvascular density (MVD) and better vessel function than the tumor core, but on the other hand was also positive for hypoxia markers, such as pimonidazole (PIMO), hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIX). The hypoxia at tumor edge was transient, named as peripheral hypoxia, and caused by different mechanisms from the chronic hypoxia in tumor core. The correlation of CAIX staining with astrocyte activation marker, glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), at the tumor edge indicated the involvement of astrocyte activation on the development of peripheral hypoxia. Peripheral hypoxia was a specific trait of orthotopic brain tumors at tumor edge, regardless of tumor origin. The hypoxic cells were resistant to the therapy, regardless of their location. Surviving cells, particularly those at the hypoxic region of tumor edge, are likely the cause of tumor recurrence after the therapy. New therapeutic platform that targets cells in tumor edge is likely to achieve better treatment outcomes. Copyright ? 2019 Lin, Yu, Huang, Chen, Hong and Chiang.

"Clinical Manifestations, Management, and Outcomes of Osteitis/Osteomyelitis Caused by Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin in Children: Comparison by Site(s) of Affected Bones","2019","Objective: To evaluate the clinical manifestations, management, and outcomes of Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin (BCG) osteitis/osteomyelitis. Study design: We reviewed 71 cases of BCG osteitis/osteomyelitis registered in Taiwan's vaccine injury compensation program (VICP) in 1998-2014. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were compared according to site(s) of infection. Results: Involvement of a long bone of the lower extremity was present in 36.6% of the children, followed by foot bone (23.9%), rib or sternum (15.5%), upper extremity long bone (9.9%), hand bone (7%), multiple bones (4.2%), and vertebrae (2.8%). Children with lower extremity long bone involvement had a longer interval from receipt of BCG vaccine to presentation (median, 16.0 months; P =.02), and those with foot bone infection had higher rates of swelling (94.1%; P =.02) and local tenderness (76.5%; P =.004). Surgical intervention was performed in 70 children, with no significant difference in the number of procedures by site (median, 1.0 procedure per patient). Among the 70 children who received antimicrobial therapy, those with vertebral and multifocal infections had a longer duration of treatment (P <.001) and/or second-line antituberculosis medications (P =.002). Three children with vertebral and multifocal infections had major sequelae with kyphosis or leg length discrepancy. Outcomes were good for children with involvement of the ribs, sternum, and peripheral bones without multifocal involvement. The average time for functional recovery was 6.2 ± 3.9 months. Conclusion: Children with BCG osteitis/osteomyelitis in different bones had distinct presentations and outcomes. Pediatricians should consider BCG bone infection in young vaccinated children with insidious onset of signs and symptoms, and consider affected site(s) in the management plan. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","amikacin; BCG vaccine; clarithromycin; ethambutol; isoniazid; levofloxacin; macrolide; moxifloxacin; pyrazinamide; rifampicin; streptomycin; antimicrobial therapy; Article; BCG vaccination; child; clinical feature; convalescence; drug withdrawal; erythema; female; fever; foot bone; hand bone; heat; human; kyphosis; laboratory test; leg length inequality; long bone; lower limb; major clinical study; male; Mycobacterium bovis BCG; osteitis; osteomyelitis; priority journal; rib; sternum; swelling; Taiwan; treatment duration; treatment outcome; upper limb; vertebra; walking difficulty"
"Development of a PD-L1-expressing orthotopic liver cancer model: Implications for immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma","2019","Background: Anti-programmed cell death-1(anti-PD1) treatment has shown promising antitumor efficacy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study sought to explore the functional significance of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. Methods: The mouse liver cancer cell line BNL-MEA was transfected with PD-L1 plasmids and stable clones expressing PD-L1 were selected. An orthotopic HCC model was generated by implanting the cells into the subcapsular space of BALB/c mice. Cell growth features were measured by proliferation assay, colony formation, flow cytometry (in vitro), ultrasonography, and animal survival (in vivo). The changes in T-cell function were examined by cytokine assay, expression of T-cell related genes, and flow cytometry. The efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy was compared between the parental and PD-L1-expressing tumors. Results: PD-L1 expression did not affect growth characteristics of BNL-MEA cells but downregulated the expression of genes related to T-cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. Co-culture of PD-L1-expressing BNL-MEA cells with CD8+ T cells reduced T-cell proliferation and expression of cytokines IFNγ and TNFα. Tumors with PD-L1 expression showed better response to anti-PD1 therapy and depletion of CD8+ T cells abolished the antitumor effect. The difference in treatment response between parental and PD-L1-expressing tumors disappeared when a combination of anti-PD1 and sorafenib was given. Conclusions: PD-L1 expression in HCC cells may inhibit T-cell function in the liver tumor microenvironment.

"The effect of insoles on symptomatic flatfoot in preschool-aged children: A prospective 1-year follow-up study","2019","Flatfoot is a common reason for parents to seek help from health care professionals, and limited evidence is available regarding the effects of insoles on preschool-aged children. This study mainly investigated the effect of insoles on symptomatic flatfoot in preschool-aged children and followed up the changes in footprints after 1 year. This study was a prospective, observational cohort study. Children aged 3 to 5 years old who exhibit the signs of flatfoot feet were recruited from the kindergartens in the central Taiwan between March 2010 and December 2013. The Chippaux-Smirak index (CSI) was used to determine whether the footprints of children were associated with flatfoot. The children were divided into an insole group and a no-insole group according to diagnoses by doctors. This study used the modified shoe insole as the intervention, and the CSI measured and followed up the changes in footprints after 1 year. A total of 466 preschool-aged children aged 3 to 5 years old with flatfoot completed the 1-year follow-up study. Of these, 123 children (men 77; women 46) were in the insole group and 343 children (men 187; women 156) were in the no-insole group. After the insoles were worn for 1 year, the CSI values of the children with symptomatic flatfoot decreased by 9.7%, and the 5-year-old children had the biggest change (effect size=1.25). In the insole group, 34.1% of the footprints were determined as normal at 1-year follow-up, and CSI values decreased by 17.5%. High prevalence of joint laxity was found in both groups (insole group: 34.5%; no-insole group: 35.1%). Of the children in the insole group, the proportion of joint laxity was significantly higher in the flatfoot group (43.1%) than in the normal group (17.7%). This study showed that wearing insoles indeed can reduce the signs of flatfoot in preschool-aged children, and the effect is better in 5-year-old children. It is suggested that insoles can be provided as a conservative treatment for preschool-aged children with symptomatic flatfoot.

"The incidence and risk factors of hepatic veno-occlusive disease after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Taiwan","2019","Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a potentially fatal complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We conducted this study to investigate the incidence and risk factors of hepatic VOD for patients receiving HSCT in Taiwan. We retrospectively analyzed the data from a nationwide registry for patients receiving HSCT, which was collected by the Taiwan Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The data collection period was from 2009 to 2014. A total 2345 patients were reviewed and 39 patients among them were diagnosed as having hepatic VOD. The cumulative incidence of hepatic VOD in the whole cohort of 2345 patients was 1.66%. In multivariate analysis, disease diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic HCV infection, condition regimens of bulsulfan intravenously administered, and antithymocyte immunoglobulin were independent factors to predict higher risk of hepatic VOD. The overall mortality rate for patients with hepatic VOD was 79%. Patients with hepatic VOD had significant worse survival outcomes when compared with those without hepatic VOD (P = 0.00063). In conclusion, although the incidence is low, hepatic VOD remains a serious complication after HSCT in Taiwan. The findings of this study could be the basis for developing prophylactic or early treatment strategies for hepatic VOD. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","bilirubin; busulfan; cyclophosphamide; ferritin; thymocyte antibody; busulfan; lymphocyte antibody; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; adolescent; adult; age; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; bilirubin blood level; child; chronic hepatitis; chronic hepatitis B; chronic hepatitis C; chronic myeloid leukemia; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; ferritin blood level; gender; Hodgkin disease; human; incidence; liver cirrhosis; liver venoocclusive disease; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; multiple myeloma; multivariate analysis; myeloablative conditioning; myelodysplastic syndrome; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nonmyeloablative conditioning; priority journal; register; relapse; remission; retrospective study; risk factor; survival; survival rate; Taiwan; thalassemia major; allograft; clinical trial; disease free survival; epidemiology; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; incidence; liver vein obstruction; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; myelodysplastic syndrome; register; risk factor; Adolescent; Adult; Allografts; Antilymphocyte Serum; Busulfan; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Registries; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Taiwan"
"Correlation Between the Increased Hospital Volume and Decreased Overall Perioperative Mortality in One Universal Health Care System","2019","Background: Volume–outcome relationship has been demonstrated extensively for short-term outcomes for oncological surgery. However, its effect on long-term surgical outcomes or in one universal health care (UHC) system is unknown. This retrospective population-based study aims to validate the correlation between the increased hospital volume and better short- and long-term outcomes in patients who underwent total gastrectomy (TG) for gastric cancer. Methods: From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we examined 7905 patients who underwent TG between 2000 and 2010. The surgical outcomes of this study were defined as death within 30, 60, and 180?days after TG. Results: A total of 7905 subjects were included for analysis. The mean age was 65.8?years, and 68.8% were males. The 30-, 60-, and 180-day mortality rates after TG for gastric cancer were 2.7%, 6.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. On the multivariate analysis, TG at high-volume hospitals significantly contributed to lower 30-day (odds ratio 0.64; 95% confidence interval 0.48–0.85; P < 0.001), 60-day (odds ratio 0.68; 95% confidence interval 0.56–0.82; P < 0.001), and 180-day mortality rates (odds ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.70–0.90; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although TG is a complex operation with high mortality rates (~180-day), high hospital volume correlates with better perioperative outcomes even in UHC system. Hence, the strategy to advocate the centralization of TG is reasonable, especially for the elderly. ? 2019, Soci?t?

"Protective effects of fucoxanthin on ultraviolet B-induced corneal denervation and inflammatory pain in a rat model","2019","Fucoxanthin is a carotenoid with many pharmaceutical properties that is found in brown seaweed. However, the effects of fucoxanthin on corneal innervation and intense eye pain have not been extensively examined. To clarify the protective roles and underlying mechanisms of fucoxanthin on ocular lesions, we investigated the beneficial effects and mechanisms by which fucoxanthin ameliorates ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced corneal denervation and trigeminal pain. Treatment with fucoxanthin enhanced the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in the cornea. Inhibition of typical denervation and epithelial exfoliation in the cornea were observed in rats treated with fucoxanthin following UVB-induced nerve disorders. Moreover, the active phosphorylated form of p38 MAP kinase (pp38) and the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive neural cells were significantly reduced. Decreased expression of neuron-selective transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) in the trigeminal ganglia neurons was also demonstrated in rats treated with fucoxanthin after UVB-induced keratitis. Symptoms of inflammatory pain, including difficulty in opening the eyes and eye wipe behaviour, were also reduced in fucoxanthin-treated groups. Pre-treatment with fucoxanthin may protect the eyes from denervation and inhibit trigeminal pain in UVB-induced photokeratitis models. ? 2019 by the authors.","fucoxanthin; glial fibrillary acidic protein; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; transcription factor Nrf2; vanilloid receptor 1; fucoxanthin; protective agent; Trpv1 protein, rat; vanilloid receptor; xanthophyll; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; controlled study; denervation; drug dose comparison; drug mechanism; enzyme phosphorylation; inflammatory pain; keratitis; male; nerve cell; nonhuman; protein expression; rat; trigeminus neuralgia; ultraviolet B radiation; animal; chemistry; cornea; cytology; denervation; disease model; drug effect; eye pain; human; innervation; keratitis; metabolism; oral drug administration; radiation response; seaweed; Sprague Dawley rat; trigeminus ganglion; ultraviolet radiation; Administration, Oral; Animals; Cornea; Denervation; Disease Models, Animal; Eye Pain; Humans; Keratitis; Male; Neurons; Protective Agents; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Seaweed; Trigeminal Ganglion; TRPV Cation Channels; Ultraviolet Rays; Xanthophylls"
"Dovitinib Triggers Apoptosis and Autophagic Cell Death by Targeting SHP-1/ p -STAT3 Signaling in Human Breast Cancers","2019","Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. The rising incidence rate and female mortality make it a significant public health concern in recent years. Dovitinib is a novel multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been enrolled in several clinical trials in different cancers. However, its antitumor efficacy has not been well determined in breast cancers. Our results demonstrated that dovitinib showed significant antitumor activity in human breast cancer cell lines with dose- and time-dependent manners. Downregulation of phosphor-(p)-STAT3 and its subsequent effectors Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 was responsible for this drug effect. Ectopic expression of STAT3 rescued the breast cancer cells from cell apoptosis induced by dovitinib. Moreover, SHP-1 inhibitor reversed the downregulation of p-STAT3 induced by dovitinib, indicating that SHP-1 mediated the STAT3 inhibition effect of dovitinib. In addition to apoptosis, we found for the first time that dovitinib also activated autophagy to promote cell death in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, dovitinib induced both apoptosis and autophagy to block the growth of breast cancer cells by regulating the SHP-1-dependent STAT3 inhibition. ? 2019 Yi-Han Chiu et al.","bafilomycin A1; beclin 1; caspase 9; cyclin D1; dovitinib; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein lc3b i; protein lc3b ii; protein mcl 1; protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 1; sequestosome 1; STAT3 protein; survivin; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cell death; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; ectopic expression; flow cytometry; HCC1937 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; MDA-MB-453 cell line; MDA-MB-468 cell line; MTT assay; protein expression; protein targeting; signal transduction; SK-BR-3 cell line; Western blotting"
"Health impact assessment of PM2.5 from a planned coal-fired power plant in Taiwan","2019","Purpose: To investigate the impact of a planned coal-fired power plant (CFPPT) in Shenao on air quality and health at subnational levels in Taiwan. Methods: We applied the Gaussian trajectory transfer-coefficient (GTx) model to estimate annual average PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) increments in 19 Taiwanese cities and counties caused by CFPPT operation. A population health risk assessment was performed by incorporating evidence of the health effects of PM2.5 provided by prospective studies and estimating long-term PM2.5 exposure. Additionally, we considered ischemic heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and chronic obstruct pulmonary disease as the primary outcomes. The population-attributable fraction was used to estimate the county-level mortality burden attributable to CFPPT-generated PM2.5 in 2025. Results: The estimated annual PM2.5 increments ranged from 0.004 μg/m3 (Taitung County) to 0.28 μg/m3 (Hsinchu County) due to the Shenao CFPPT. The total and premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 from Shenao CFPPT operation in Taiwan during 2025–2040 would be 576 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 537–619) and 145 (95% CI: 136–155), respectively. Notably, we estimated 198 (95% CI: 169–234) deaths and 58 (95% CI: 51–66) premature deaths, respectively, in New Taipei City, which accounted for over a quarter of the total deaths. Overall, the mortality rate attributable to the Shenao CFPPT in Taiwan was 6 per 10,000. Conclusion: A scientific approach should be adopted for assessing the impacts of CFPPT operation on population health, which can serve as a valuable policymaking reference for the government. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","coal; air quality; all cause mortality; Article; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; disease burden; dry deposition; electric power plant; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; ischemic heart disease; long term exposure; lung cancer; meteorology; mortality rate; particulate matter; risk assessment; Taiwan"
"Automated drosophila heartbeat counting based on image segmentation technique on optical coherence tomography","2019","Drosophila and human cardiac genes are very similar. Biological parametric studies on drosophila cardiac have improved our understanding of human cardiovascular disease. Drosophila cardiac consist of five circular chambers: a conical chamber (CC) and four ostia sections (O1–O4). Due to noise and grayscale discontinuity on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, previous researches used manual counting or M-mode to analyze heartbeats, which are inefficient and time-consuming. An automated drosophila heartbeat counting algorithm based on the chamber segmentation is developed for OCT in this study. This algorithm has two parts: automated chamber segmentation and heartbeat counting. In addition, this study proposes a principal components analysis (PCA)-based supervised learning method for training the chamber contours to make chamber segmentation more accurate. The mean distances between the conical, second and third chambers attained by the proposed algorithm and the corresponding manually delineated boundaries defined by two experts were 1.26 ± 0.25, 1.47 ± 1.25 and 0.84 ± 0.60 (pixels), respectively. The area overlap similarities were 0.83 ± 0.09, 0.75 ± 0.11 and 0.74 ± 0.12 (pixels), respectively. The average calculated heart rates of two-week and six-week drosophila were about 4.77 beats/s and 4.73 beats/s, respectively, which was consistent with the results of manual counting. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Use of the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Risk Stratification of Hospital Admissions Among Patients With Cardiovascular Diseases Receiving a Fourth-Generation Synchronous Telehealth Program: Retrospective Cohort Study","2019","BACKGROUND: Telehealth programs are generally diverse in approaching patients, from traditional telephone calling and texting message and to the latest fourth-generation synchronous program. The predefined outcomes are also different, including hypertension control, lipid lowering, cardiovascular outcomes, and mortality. In previous studies, the telehealth program showed both positive and negative results, providing mixed and confusing clinical outcomes. A comprehensive and integrated approach is needed to determine which patients benefit from the program in order to improve clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75 years [doubled], type 2 diabetes mellitus, previous stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease, age of 65-75 years, and sex) score has been widely used for the prediction of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. This study investigated the CHA2DS2-VASc score to stratify patients with cardiovascular diseases receiving a fourth-generation synchronous telehealth program. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. We recruited patients with cardiovascular disease who received the fourth-generation synchronous telehealth program at the National Taiwan University Hospital between October 2012 and June 2015. We enrolled 431 patients who had joined a telehealth program and compared them to 1549 control patients. Risk of cardiovascular hospitalization was estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves. The CHA2DS2-VASc score was used as the composite parameter to stratify the severity of patients' conditions. The association between baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes was assessed via the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 886.1 (SD 531.0) days in patients receiving the fourth-generation synchronous telehealth program and 707.1 (SD 431.4) days in the control group (P<.001). The telehealth group had more comorbidities at baseline than the control group. Higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores (?4) were associated with a lower estimated rate of remaining free from cardiovascular hospitalization (46.5% vs 54.8%, log-rank P=.003). Patients with CHA2DS2-VASc scores ?4 receiving the telehealth program were less likely to be admitted for cardiovascular disease than patients not receiving the program. (61.5% vs 41.8%, log-rank P=.01). The telehealth program remained a significant prognostic factor after multivariable Cox analysis in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc scores ?4 (hazard ratio=0.36 [CI 0.22-0.62], P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: A higher CHA2DS2-VASc score was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular admissions. Patients accepting the fourth-generation telehealth program with CHA2DS2-VASc scores ?4 benefit most by remaining free from cardiovascular hospitalization. ?Jen-Kuang Lee, Chi-Sheng Hung, Ching-Chang Huang, Ying-Hsien Chen, Pao-Yu Chuang, Jiun-Yu Yu, Yi-Lwun Ho.

"Osimertinib in patients with T790M mutation-positive, advanced non–small cell lung cancer: Long-term follow-up from a pooled analysis of 2 phase 2 studies","2019","Background: Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is selective for both EGFR-TKI–sensitizing and T790M (threonine-to-methionine substitution at codon 790)-resistance mutations. The authors present long-term follow-up data from a preplanned, pooled analysis of phase 2 studies, the AZD9291 First Time in Patients Ascending Dose Study (AURA) extension trial (clincialtrials.gov identifier NCT01802632) and the AURA2 trial (NCT02094261). Methods: Patients with centrally confirmed, T790M mutation-positive, advanced non-small cell lung cancer received osimertinib 80 mg once daily until disease progression or study discontinuation. Response was assessed by a blinded, independent, central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate. Results: In total, 411 patients received osimertinib (second line, 129 patients; third line or later, 282 patients). At the data cutoff date of November 1, 2016, the median treatment exposure was 16.4 months (range, 0-29.7 months), the objective response rate was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61%-70%), the median response duration was 12.3 months (95% CI, 11.1-13.8 months), and the median progression-free survival was 9.9 months (95% CI, 9.5-12.3 months). At the data cutoff date of May 1, 2018, 271 patients (66%) had died, and 140 patients (34%) had discontinued before death. The median overall survival was 26.8 months (95% CI, 24.0-29.1 months); and the 12-month, 24-month, and 36-month survival rates were 80%, 55%, and 37%, respectively. Grade ?3 possibly causally related (investigator assessed) adverse events were reported in 65 patients (16%), and the most common were rash (grouped terms; 42%; grade ?3, 1%) and diarrhea (39%; <1%).

"Polymorphisms of the DNA repair gene EXO1 modulate cognitive aging in old adults in a Taiwanese population","2019","Evidence indicates that the age-related neuropathological mechanisms associated with DNA repair genes may contribute to cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 155 DNA repair genes may be linked to cognitive aging independently and/or through complex interactions in an older Taiwanese population. A total of 3,730 Taiwanese subjects aged over 60 years from the Taiwan Biobank were analyzed. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered to all subjects, and MMSE scores were used to measure cognitive functions. Our data showed that out of 1,652 SNPs, the rs1776181 (P = 1.47 × 10 ?5 ), rs1776177 (P = 8.42 × 10 -7 ), rs1635510 (P = 7.97 × 10 -6 ), and rs2526698 (P = 7.06 × 10 -6 ) SNPs in the EXO1 gene were associated with cognitive aging. The association with these SNP remained significant after performing Bonferroni correction. Additionally, we found that interactions between the EXO1 and RAD51C genes influenced cognitive aging (P = 0.002). Finally, we pinpointed the influence of interactions between EXO1 and physical activity (P &lt; 0.001) as well as between DCLRE1C and physical activity (P &lt; 0.001). Our study indicated that DNA repair genes may contribute to susceptibility in cognitive aging independently as well as through gene-gene and gene-physical interactions. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DNA cross link repair 1c protein; exonuclease; exonuclease 1; nucleic acid binding protein; Rad51 protein; Rad51C protein; unclassified drug; adult; aged; aging; Article; biobank; cognition; cognitive aging; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; DNA repair; female; gene expression; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; multicenter study; physical activity; priority journal; protein protein interaction; single nucleotide polymorphism; Taiwanese"
"Capsaicin enhances erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity: Via AKT inactivation and excision repair cross-complementary 1 (ERCC1) down-regulation in human lung cancer cells","2019","Capsaicin, a natural active ingredient of green and red peppers, has been demonstrated to exhibit anti-cancer properties in several malignant cell lines. Excision repair cross-complementary 1 (ERCC1) has a leading role in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) process because of its involvement in the excision of DNA adducts. Erlotinib (TarcevaR) is a selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, whether capsaicin and erlotinib could induce synergistic cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells through modulating ERCC1 expression is unknown. In this study, capsaicin decreased the ERCC1 expression in an AKT inactivation dependent manner in two human lung adenocarcinoma cells, namely, A549 and H1975. Enhancement of AKT activity by transfection with constitutive active AKT vectors increased the ERCC1 protein level as well as the cell survival by capsaicin. Moreover, capsaicin synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of erlotinib in NSCLC cells, which were associated with the down-regulation of ERCC1 expression and inactivation of AKT in A549 and H1975 cells. Together, these results may provide a rationale to combine capsaicin with erlotinib for lung cancer treatment. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","capsaicin; erlotinib; excision repair cross complementing protein 1; messenger RNA; protein kinase B; A-549 cell line; Akt signaling; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer survival; cell migration; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug potentiation; enzyme inactivation; genetic transfection; human; human cell; lung adenocarcinoma; mRNA expression level; MTS assay; NCI-H1975 cell line; priority journal; protein expression level; real time polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting"
"Collaboration with Status Asymmetry: Evidence from HIV/AIDS Disease Control in China","2019","ABSTRACT: Studies on organization and management theory use status to explain intra-organizational behaviors such as developing alliances and partnerships by drawing on the practices of the private sector. We extend the concept of status to the public sector to study how the different status of partners influences their collaboration. Through studying collaboration in the field of HIV/AIDS disease control in China from 2015 to 2017, we assess how status asymmetry (different-status partners) affects collaboration by comparing several dimensions of different-status organizations, including their structure, funding distribution, target population, and service category. We find that, through structure design, a collaboration between high- and low-status organizations improves health service delivery in the epidemic disease control process by providing more integrated health schemes. This article contributes to the body of knowledge on collaboration by studying the dynamic role of status, thereby helping practitioners better understand how to effectively manage collaboration with status asymmetry. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",""
"Using serum placenta growth factor could improve the sensitivity of colorectal cancer screening in fecal occult blood negative population: A multicenter with independent cohort validation study","2019","Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Screening for CRC using the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is feasible and useful for decreasing disease-related mortality; however, its sensitivity and compliance are unsatisfactory. Methods: This study examined the efficacy of using serum placenta growth factor (PlGF) for a novel CRC screening strategy. To investigate a potential novel screening tool for CRC, we compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the FOBT, serum PlGF, and their combination through an examination of two independent cohorts and validation using the second cohort. All the patients and control group received the colonoscopy and FOBT, the colonoscopy was used as the gold standard for the result. Results: Serum PlGF levels were significantly increased in CRC patients (16.8?±?11.4?pg/mL) compared with controls (12.0?±?11.2?pg/mL). The predictive model that used the serum PlGF level alone was as effective as the FOBT (AUC: 0.60 vs 0.68, P?=?0.891), and it had significantly higher sensitivity than the FOBT (0.81 vs 0.39). In addition, we found serum PlGF level has a good value for predicting CRC patients in those FOBT negative populations. Finally, combining serum PlGF level and the FOBT improved the predictive power and demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity (0.71) and specificity (0.71). This result was confirmed and validated in the second independent cohort. Furthermore, no matter the stages (early/advanced) and the location (distal/proximal) of CRC, the efficacy of serum PlGF and the combined model remained quite stable. Conclusion: Serum PlGF level is a potential alternative screening tool for CRC, especially for those who are reluctant to stool-based screening methods and who were tested as negative FOBT. In addition, combining serum PlGF level and the FOBT could increase the power of CRC screening. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Depth-Camera-Based System for Estimating Energy Expenditure of Physical Activities in Gyms","2019","Energy expenditure (EE) monitoring is crucial to tracking physical activity (PA). Accurate EE monitoring may help people engage in adequate activity and therefore avoid obesity and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. This study proposes a depth-camera-based system for EE estimation of PA in gyms. Most previous studies have used inertial measurement units for EE estimation. By contrast, the proposed system can be used to conveniently monitor subjects' treadmill workouts in gyms without requiring them to wear any devices. A total of 21 subjects were recruited for the experiment. Subjects' skeletal data acquired using the depth camera and oxygen consumption data simultaneously obtained using the K4b 2 device were used to establish an EE predictive model. To obtain a robust EE estimation model, depth cameras were placed in the side view, rear side view, and rear view. A comparison of five different predictive models and these three camera locations showed that the multilayer perceptron model was the best predictive model and that placing the camera in the rear view provided the best EE estimation performance. The measured and predicted metabolic equivalents of task exhibited a strong positive correlation, with r = 0.94 and coefficient of determination r 2 = 0.89. Furthermore, the mean absolute error was 0.61 MET, mean squared error was 0.67 MET, and root mean squared error was 0.76 MET. These results indicate that the proposed system is handy and reliable for monitoring user's EE when performing treadmill workouts. ? 2013 IEEE.","Accelerometers; Calorimetry; Errors; Estimation; Mean square error; Monitoring; Sensors; Sporting goods; Biomedical measurements; Depth camera; Energy expenditure; Physical activity; Predictive models; Cameras; accuracy; adipose tissue; anthropometry; Article; body movement; calorimetry; computer prediction; electrocardiography; energy expenditure; female; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; kinematics; kinetics; locomotion; lung gas exchange; machine learning; male; mathematical model; obesity; oxygen consumption; physical activity; sensitivity and specificity; steady state; training; treadmill exercise; walking; adult; devices; energy metabolism; exercise; image processing; physiologic monitoring; physiology; procedures; statistical model; young adult; Adult; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Models, Statistical; Monitoring, Physiologic; Walking; Young Adult"

The phase III open-label CAURAL trial (NCT02454933) investigated osimertinib plus durvalumab versus osimertinib monotherapy in patients with EGFR-TKI sensitizing and EGFR T790M mutation–positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression after EGFR-TKI therapy. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally administered osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with or without durvalumab (10 mg/kg administered intravenously every 2 weeks) until progression. Treatment could continue beyond progression, providing clinical benefit continued (judged by the investigator). The amended primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib plus durvalumab; efficacy was an exploratory objective. Results: CAURAL recruitment was terminated early because of increased incidence of interstitial lung disease–like events in the osimertinib plus durvalumab arm from the separate phase Ib TATTON trial (NCT02143466). At termination of CAURAL recruitment, 15 patients had been randomly assigned to treatment with osimertinib and 14 to treatment with osimertinib plus durvalumab. The most common AEs were diarrhea (53% [grade ?3 in 6% of patients]) in the osimertinib arm and rash (67% [grade ?3 in 0 patients]) in the combination arm. One patient who had been randomized to the combination arm reported grade 2 interstitial lung disease while receiving osimertinib monotherapy (after discontinuing durvalumab therapy after one dose). The objective response rates were 80% in the osimertinib arm and 64% in the combination arm. Conclusion: Limited patient numbers preclude formal safety and efficacy comparisons between the two treatment arms. The combination of programmed cell death 1/programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors and EGFR-TKIs as therapy for NSCLC is not well understood, but it requires a careful approach if considered in the future. ? 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","aspartate aminotransferase; durvalumab; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; osimertinib; adult; aged; arthralgia; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; backache; clinical article; constipation; controlled study; coughing; decreased appetite; diarrhea; disease control; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; dry skin; dyspnea; female; human; hypesthesia; interstitial lung disease; male; monotherapy; nausea; neutropenia; neutrophil count; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; paronychia; phase 3 clinical trial; pneumonia; priority journal; productive cough; progression free survival; pruritus; rash; rhinorrhea; side effect; stomatitis; survival rate; treatment response; upper respiratory tract infection; viral upper respiratory tract infection"
"Advanced glycation end products of bovine serum albumin suppressed Th1/Th2 cytokine but enhanced monocyte IL-6 gene expression via MAPK-ERK and MyD88 transduced NF-κB p50 signaling pathways","2019","Advanced glycation end products (AGE), the most known aging biomarker, may cause “inflamm-aging” (i.e., chronic low-grade inflammation that develops with aging) in both aged and diabetes groups. However, the molecular bases of inflamm-aging remain obscure. We prepared AGE by incubating BSA (0.0746 mmol/L) + glucose (0.5 mol/L) at 37 ?C in 5% CO2–95% air for 1–180 days. The lysine glycation in BSA–AGE reached 77% on day 30 and 100% after day 130, whereas the glycation of arginine and cysteine was minimal. The Nε-(carboxymethyl)-lysine content in BSA–AGE was also increased with increasing number of incubation days. The lectin-binding assay revealed that the glycation of BSA not only altered the conformational structure, but lost binding capacity with various lectins. An immunological functional assay showed that BSA–AGE &gt; 8 ?g/mL significantly suppressed normal human Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-10) mRNA expression, whereas AGE &gt; 0.5 ?g/mL enhanced monocyte IL-6 production irrelevant to cell apoptosis. The AGE-enhanced monocyte IL-6 production was via MAPK–ERK and MyD88-transduced NF-κBp50 signaling pathways. To elucidate the structure–function relationship of BSA–AGE-enhanced IL-6 production, we pre-preincubated BSA–AGE with different carbohydrate-degrading, protein-degrading, and glycoprotein-degrading enzymes. We found that trypsin and carboxypeptidase Y suppressed whereas β-galactosidase enhanced monocyte IL-6 production. In conclusion, BSA–AGE exerted both immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory effects that are the molecular basis of inflamm-aging in aged and diabetes groups. ? 2019 by the authors.","advanced glycation end product; amino acid; bovine serum albumin; glycoprotein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; lectin; messenger RNA; myeloid differentiation factor 88; animal; bovine; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; glycation; helper cell; human; MAPK signaling; metabolism; molecular weight; monocyte; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; Amino Acids; Animals; Cattle; Gene Expression Regulation; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Glycoproteins; Humans; Interleukin-6; Lectins; Maillard Reaction; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Molecular Weight; Monocytes; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; NF-kappa B p50 Subunit; RNA, Messenger; Serum Albumin, Bovine; T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer; Th1 Cells; Th2 Cells"
"Remote sensing of forest die-off in the Anthropocene: From plant ecophysiology to canopy structure","2019","Human activities have fundamentally changed Earth's climate and land surface in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to the proposal of a new geologic epoch known as the Anthropocene. One major ecological perturbation underway over the past several decades of the Anthropocene is extensive tree and shrub mortality, or forest die-off, triggered by elevated temperatures and prolonged drought, and/or insect and pathogen outbreaks. This increasingly common disturbance has affected forests and woodlands on all vegetated continents and may alter terrestrial carbon fluxes in the biosphere. Remote sensing has enabled mapping of the extent and ecological patterns of tree loss and damage, assessing potential carbon emissions and monitoring ecosystem trajectories after tree mortality. In this review article, we cover drought-induced changes in plant physiology, chemistry, and structure that occur as an individual tree progresses from healthy to stressed to standing dead or coarse woody debris, and corresponding responses in remotely sensed data that provide the opportunity and potential for observation and analysis at large spatial scales and early detection. The linkages between changes associated with tree mortality and remote sensing show exceptional promise for strategic and adaptive natural resource management as climate models project warmer and drier climates in the coming decades. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon; Chemical analysis; Climate models; Discoloration; Drought; Earth (planet); Ecology; Forestry; Image fusion; Natural resources management; Optical radar; Pathogens; Physiology; Pigments; Spectroscopy; Coarse woody debris; Drought stress; Elevated temperature; Human activities; Insect; Natural resource management; Pathogen outbreak; Remotely sensed data; Remote sensing; air-soil interaction; Anthropocene; drought stress; ecophysiology; forest canopy; forest ecosystem; insect; land surface; lidar; mortality; pathogen; perennial plant; pigment; remote sensing; shrub; spectroscopy; Hexapoda"
"Diselenide linkage containing triblock copolymer nanoparticles based on Bi(methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol))-poly(ε-carprolactone): Selective intracellular drug delivery in cancer cells","2019","Redox-responsive diselenide bond containing triblock copolymer Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL,Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL was developed for specific drug release in cancer cells. Initially, ditosylated polycaprolactone was prepared via the reaction between polycaprolactone diol (PCL-diol) and tosyl chloride (TsCl). Next, Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL was synthesized via the reaction between ditosylated polycaprolactone and sodium diselenide initiated poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether tosylate. The synthesized amphiphilic triblock copolymer could self-assemble into uniform nanoparticles in aqueous medium and disassemble upon redox stimuli. The Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL nanoparticles showed a DOX loading content of 5.1 wt% and a loading efficiency of 49%. In vitro drug release studies showed that about 62.4% and 56% of DOX was released from the nanoparticles during 72 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 2 mg/mL (6 mM) GSH and 0.1% H2O2, respectively, whereas only about 30% of DOX was released in PBS under the same conditions. The cell viability (MTT assays) results showed that the synthesized material was biocompatible with above 90% cell viability, and that the DOX-loaded Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL nanoparticles had a high antitumor activity against HeLa cells and low antitumor activity against HaCaT cells, following a 24-h incubation period. Three-dimensional (3D) spheroids of HeLa cells were established for the evaluation of localization of the DOX-loaded nanoparticles into spheroids cells and the successfully inhibition of 3D tumor spheroid growth. The results indicated that the synthesized material Bi(mPEG–SeSe)-PCL was biocompatible and it could be a potential candidate for anticancer drug delivery system. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biocompatibility; Biological materials; Block copolymers; Calcium compounds; Chlorine compounds; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Diseases; Drug products; Ethylene glycol; Lanthanum compounds; Nanoparticles; Polyethylene glycols; Polyols; Selenium compounds; Sodium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Targeted drug delivery; 3D-Spheroids; Amphiphilic triblock copolymers; Anti-cancer drug delivery; Diselenide; Intracellular drug delivery; Polycaprolactone diols; Redox-responsive; Threedimensional (3-d); Synthesis (chemical)"
"Osteoprotegerin and osteopontin levels, but not gene polymorphisms, predict mortality in cardiovascular diseases","2019","Aim: This study aims to investigate whether osteoprotegerin (OPG) or osteopontin (OPN) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will predict survival. Materials & methods: This study enrolled 617 participants undergoing health examination, 536 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and 86 peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients. Genotypes of OPG SNP rs2073618 and OPN SNP rs11730582 were determined. OPG and OPN levels were measured. Results: In both CAD and PAD populations, high OPG and OPN levels were strong predictors of all-cause death. The OPG rs2073618 CC genotype and the OPN rs11730582 TT genotype did not predict mortality.

"Identification of withaferin a as a potential candidate for anti-cancer therapy in non-small cell lung cancer","2019","Low response rate and recurrence are common issues in lung cancer; thus, identifying a potential compound for these patients is essential. Utilizing an in silico screening method, we identified withaferin A (WA), a cell-permeable steroidal lactone initially extracted from Withania somnifera, as a potential anti–lung cancer and anti–lung cancer stem-like cell (CSC) agent. First, we demonstrated that WA exhibited potent cytotoxicity in several lung cancer cells, as evidenced by low IC50 values. WA concurrently induced autophagy and apoptosis and the activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which plays an upstream role in mediating WA-elicited effects. The increase in p62 indicated that WA may modulate the autophagy flux followed by apoptosis. In vivo research also demonstrated the anti-tumor effect of WA treatment. We subsequently demonstrated that WA could inhibit the growth of lung CSCs, decrease side population cells, and inhibit lung cancer spheroid-forming capacity, at least through downregulation of mTOR/STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, the combination of WA and chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin and pemetrexed, exerted synergistic effects on the inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type lung cancer cell viability. In addition, WA can further enhance the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in lung CSCs. Therefore, WA alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy is a potential treatment option for EGFR wild-type lung cancer and may decrease the occurrence of cisplatin resistance by inhibiting lung CSCs. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Assessing the change of anisometropia in unilateral myopic children receiving monocular orthokeratology treatment","2019","Background: This study aimed at comparing the inter-eye axial elongation difference in order to evaluate the change of anisometropia in unilateral myopic children wearing monocular orthokeratology (Ortho-K) lens. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we recruited monocular myopic subjects treated with monocular Ortho-K lens from May 2012 to January 2017. The axial length (AL) of both eyes was recorded, and we calculated the AL difference as our primary outcome, to evaluate myopia progression. High anisometropia was defined as anisometropia more than 2.50D. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was used to assess the related risk factors. Results: A total number of 31 unilateral myopic patients were identified. The initial wearing age of the subjects was 12.32+/?3.07 years. In myopic eyes, the initial spherical equivalent was ?2.73+/?0.95 diopter (D). The mean follow-up duration was 2.01+/?1.48 years. A significant reduction in the AL difference was found, from 0.83+/?0.45 millimeters at the baseline to 0.59+/?0.49 millimeters at 24 months (P = 0.039). Besides, after wearing Ortho-K lens for a long term, high anisometropic wearers showed more AL difference reduction than low anisometropic wearers in unilateral myopic children (P=0.002). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the myopic eyes in unilateral myopic children had less AL growth than the companion emmetropic eyes when treated with monocular Ortho-K lenses. Wearing Ortho-K lens for a long time would present a more significant AL difference reduction in high anisometropic children. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","age; allergic reaction; anisometropia; Article; child; clinical article; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease exacerbation; emmetropia; eye axis length; female; follow up; generalized estimating equation; human; keratopathy; male; mathematical parameters; myopia; outcome assessment; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; school child; sex difference; time; adolescent; anisometropia; contact lens; cornea; devices; diagnostic imaging; equipment design; eye refraction; keratometry; myopia; orthokeratology lens; Taiwan; time factor; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Anisometropia; Axial Length, Eye; Child; Contact Lenses; Cornea; Corneal Topography; Disease Progression; Equipment Design; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Myopia; Orthokeratologic Procedures; Refraction, Ocular; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Thermal cycling-hyperthermia in combination with polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate and chlorogenic acid, exerts synergistic anticancer effect against human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells","2019","Hyperthermia (HT) has shown feasibility and potency as an anticancer therapy. Administration of HT in the chemotherapy has previously enhanced the cytotoxicity of drugs against pancreatic cancer. However, the drugs used when conducting these studies are substantially conventional chemotherapeutic agents that may cause unwanted side effects. Additionally, the thermal dosage in the treatment of cancer cells could also probably harm the healthy cells. The purpose of this work was to investigate the potential of the two natural polyphenolic compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and chlorogenic acid (CGA), as heat synergizers in the thermal treatment of the PANC-1 cells. Furthermore, we have introduced a unique strategy entitled the thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) that is capable of providing a maximum synergy and minimal side effect with the anticancer compounds. Our results demonstrate that the combination of the TC-HT and the CGA or EGCG markedly exerts the anticancer effect against the PANC-1 cells, while none of the single treatment induced such changes. The synergistic activity was attributed to the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and the induction of the ROS-dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These findings not only represent the first in vitro thermal synergistic study of natural compounds in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but also highlight the potential of the TC-HT as an alternative strategy in thermal treatment. ? 2019 Lu et al.","chlorogenic acid; epigallocatechin gallate; reactive oxygen metabolite; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; cell cycle regulation; concentration response; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug safety; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; growth inhibition; human; human cell; in vitro study; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; oxidative stress; PANC-1 cell line; pancreas cancer; protein expression; therapy effect; thermal cycling hyperthermia; thermotherapy"
"APASL clinical practice recommendation: how to treat HCV-infected patients with renal impairment?","2019","Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those on hemodialysis due to nosocomial infections and past blood transfusions. While a majority of HCV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease are asymptomatic, some may ultimately experience decompensated liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. Administration of a combination of elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12?weeks leads to high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in patients with HCV genotypes (GTs) 1a, 1b or 4 and stage 4 or 5 CKD. Furthermore, a combination of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8–16?weeks also results in high SVR rates in patients with all HCV GTs and stage 4 or 5 CKD. However, these regimens are contraindicated in the presence of advanced decompensated cirrhosis. Although sofosbuvir and/or ribavirin are not generally recommended for HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment, sofosbuvir-based regimens may be appropriate for those with mild renal impairment. To eliminate HCV worldwide, HCV-infected patients with renal impairment should be treated with interferon-free therapies. ? 2018, The Author(s).","asunaprevir; beclabuvir; boceprevir; daclatasvir; elbasvir; elbasvir plus grazoprevir; glecaprevir; glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir; grazoprevir; ledipasvir; ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir; ombitasvir; ombitasvir plus paritaprevir plus ritonavir; paritaprevir; pibrentasvir; ribavirin; simeprevir; sofosbuvir; telaprevir; velpatasvir; voxilaprevir; ABT-493; antivirus agent; benzimidazole derivative; benzofuran derivative; elbasvir-grazoprevir drug combination; imidazole derivative; pibrentasvir; quinoxaline derivative; sofosbuvir; sulfonamide; Article; clinical practice; disease classification; drug efficacy; drug safety; hemodialysis; hepatitis C; human; kidney failure; kidney graft; priority journal; sustained virologic response; chronic hepatitis C; chronic kidney failure; complication; drug combination; drug contraindication; genetics; genotype; Hepacivirus; practice guideline; Antiviral Agents; Benzimidazoles; Benzofurans; Contraindications, Drug; Drug Combinations; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Imidazoles; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Quinoxalines; Sofosbuvir; Sulfonamides; Sustained Virologic Response"
"Peripheral fat distribution versus waist circumference for predicting mortality in metabolic syndrome","2019","Objective: To elucidate whether the peripheral fat (PF)-combined definition of metabolic syndrome (MetS) would show a better predictive ability for cause-specific mortality than the common MetS. Methods: Data were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 through 2002. We investigated three types of MetS including waist circumference MetS (WCMetS), PFMetS, and PF-combined definition of MetS. The main outcome was to evaluate the predictive ability of the newly defined MetS for time to cause-specific mortality. The secondary outcomes were the relationships between the PF percentage and C-reactive protein (CRP) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) to clarify the gender discrepancy. Results: For cardiovascular mortality, the adjusted hazard ratios for WCMetS, PFMetS, and PF-combined definition MetS were 1.867, 1.742, and 2.117, respectively (all P?<?0.001). A positive association between PF percentage and CRP in men and a negative correlation between PF percentage and HOMA-IR in women after adjustment for all variates were found. Conclusions: The PF-combined definition of MetS had a stronger predictive ability for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than general MetS. Notably, the PF might have differential gender-specific health effects on cardiovascular events. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","C reactive protein; fat; biological marker; adult; adverse outcome; anthropometric parameters; Article; cardiovascular mortality; female; homeostasis model assessment; human; male; metabolic syndrome X; mortality; priority journal; waist circumference; body mass; cardiovascular disease; follow up; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; prognosis; risk factor; survival rate; Biomarkers; Body Mass Index; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Waist Circumference"
"Heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccination for mild and moderate alzheimer’s disease","2019","Background: Immunotherapy for Alzheimer’s disease(AD) has gained momentum in recent years. One of the concerns over its application pertains to Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) from population average and specific subgroup differences, as such a therapy is imperative for health decisionmakers to allocate limited resources. However, this sort of CEA model considering heterogeneous population with risk factors adjustment has been rarely addressed. Methods: We aimed to show the heterogeneity of CEA in immunotherapy for AD in comparison with the comparator without intervention. Economic evaluation was performed via incremental CostEffectiveness Ratio (ICER) and Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC) in terms of the QualityAdjusted Life Years (QALY). First, population-average CEA was performed with and without adjustment for age and gender. Secondly, sub-group CEA was performed with the stratification of gender and age based on Markov process. Results: Given the threshold of $20,000 of willingness to pay, the results of ICER without and with adjustment for age and gender revealed similar results ($14,691/QALY and $17,604/QALY). The subgroup ICER results by different age groups and gender showed substantial differences. The CEAC showed that the probability of being cost-effective was only 48.8%-53.3% in terms of QALY at population level but varied from 83.5% in women aged 50-64 years, following women aged 65-74 years and decreased to 0.2% in men? 75 years. Conclusion: There were considerable heterogeneities observed in the CEA of vaccination for AD. As with the development of personalized medicine, the CEA results assessed by health decision-maker should not only be considered by population-average level but also specific sub-group levels. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","Alzheimer disease vaccine; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; cohort analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; female; human; immunotherapy; major clinical study; male; personalized medicine; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; risk factor; vaccination; Willingness To Pay"
"Development and validation of the 9-item Concise Mental Health Checklist (CMHC-9) for suicide risk assessment","2019","Background/Purpose: Early detection of suicide risk is a challenge in suicide prevention. A comprehensive yet efficient tool providing timely identification of key risk factors allows healthcare providers to initiate interventions. The study aims to validate the 9-item Concise Mental Health Checklist (CMHC-9). Methods: A series of cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 3982 participants from psychiatric outpatient (n = 931), medical outpatient (n = 931) and community (n = 2120) populations. The factor analysis with internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's α) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed to evaluate the scale's reliability and validity. Results: The internal consistency of the CMHC-9 was satisfactory based on Cronbach's α values for the total sample (α = 0.79) and the three sub-samples (i.e., α = 0.76 for psychiatric subjects; 0.67 for community subjects; and 0.69 for medical outpatient subjects). Hierarchical exploratory factor analysis revealed that the CMHC-9 was a single-dimensional scale with two-factor structure of psychopathology and suicidality. The two-factor solution was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. The optimal cut-off of 3/4 obtained from the ROC analysis represented a satisfactory sensitivity (92%) and specificity (82%) in identifying recent suicide ideation. Conclusion: This large-scale study confirmed the CMHC-9 as a brief and effective tool for suicide risk detection. It is recommended that CMHC-9 can be used for care engagement and risk identification in both medical and community settings among people at risk for suicide. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","9 item concise mental health checklist; adult; aged; Article; clinical assessment tool; confirmatory factor analysis; cross-sectional study; exploratory factor analysis; factor analysis; female; general mental disease assessment; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; mental disease; outpatient department; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; suicidal ideation; suicide; validation study"
"Late outcomes of off-pump versus on-pump coronary bypass in patients with diabetes: A nationwide study from Taiwan","2019","Objectives: Although the benefits and risks of on- and off-pump coronary artery bypass have been compared in several clinical trials, large-scale studies regarding long-term outcomes in patients with diabetes are lacking. We compared long-term outcomes after on- and off-pump coronary artery bypass in patients with diabetes. Methods: We evaluated outcomes in 16,215 patients with diabetes who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass from 2000 to 2011. Clinical data validity was regulated by the single-payer, universal, and nationwide reimbursement systems. Long-term outcomes were compared using propensity score matched analyses. Results: Off-pump surgery was associated with a greater incidence of repeat revascularization (P =.0036) in the long term. Propensity score matching identified 3796 patients in each group. There were no significant differences between on- and off-pump surgery regarding the long-term risks of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-1.02, P =.1667), stroke (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.09, P =.6074), and myocardial infarction (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91-1.20, P =.5207). Off-pump surgery offered a survival benefit within 30 days (HR on vs off , 1.52, 95% CI, 1.24-1.85, P &lt;.0001). In patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease, on-pump surgery provided a significant long-term survival benefit (HR on vs off , 0.68, 95% CI, 0.51-0.91). Conclusions: In patients with diabetes undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass, off-pump surgery provided a 30-day benefit in mortality, but both groups had similar long-term survival. In off-pump surgery, repeat revascularization was a concern in the long term. In patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease, on-pump surgery has long-term survival benefits. ? 2018 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery","insulin; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; atrial fibrillation; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical study; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; end stage renal disease; event free survival; female; follow up; functional status; heart infarction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; hospital patient; hospital volume; human; hypertension; incidence; insulin treatment; internal mammary artery; kidney function; long term care; long term survival; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; medical history; morbidity; off pump coronary surgery; off pump surgery; pacemaker implantation; patient coding; peripheral vascular disease; preoperative care; priority journal; propensity score; reimbursement; renal replacement therapy; repeat procedure; revascularization; surgical mortality; Taiwan"
"Correlations of clinical parameters with quality of life in patients with acromegaly: Taiwan Acromegaly Registry","2019","Background/Purpose: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the associations between clinical parameters and quality of life (QOL) of patients with acromegaly in Taiwan and to identify the impacts of hormone control, regimens, or co-morbidities on acromegalic patients' daily life. Methods: From 2013 to 2015, subjects with acromegaly were recruited through five medical centers. Clinical data were recorded. The QOL of enrolled patients were assessed by using Acromegaly Quality of Life Questionnaire (AcroQoL). Results: This study enrolled 272 acromegalic subjects (117 males, 155 females). Remission, defined by normalization of IGF-1, had significant positive association with QOL scores in psychological/appearance (PSY/APP) dimension (β = 6.760, p = 0.023). Somatostatin analogues therapy had negative associations with total score and score in psychological (PSY) dimension (β = ?4.720, p = 0.046 and β = ?5.388, p = 0.035, respectively). Diabetes mellitus had negative associations with score in PSY dimension and psychological/personal relations (PSY/PER) dimensions (β = ?5.839, p = 0.034 and β = ?7.516, p = 0.013, respectively). Cerebral vascular accident (CVA) had significant negative associations with total score and scores in physical (PHY), PSY, and PSY/PER dimensions (β = ?26.632, p = 0.013; β = ?28.353, p = 0.024; β = ?25.648, p = 0.026; and β = ?34.586, p = 0.006, respectively). All these associations remained significant even after adjusted with sex and age.

"A low-cost, portable and easy-operated salivary urea sensor for point-of-care application","2019","Salivary urea was reported to be a useful biomarker to reflect the blood urea nitrogen in chronic kidney disease patients. However, as a new biomarker, enormous clinical trials are required to define the intended-use and to verify the specification. In this report, we demonstrated a low-cost easy-operated real-time sensing system (optical fiber-urea-sensing, OFUS, system) to detect salivary urea. We aim to make the system easily reproduced by the community to stimulate abundant clinical tests worldwide. The OFUS system is composed of a simple three-dimensional printed tank to link with two optical fibers, one connecting with a commercial light-emitting diode to deliver the input light signal, the other connecting with a commercial cadmium sulfide photo-conductive cell to detect the sensing signal. To allow on-site detection without any sample pretreatment, only 1 μl saliva is needed to be mixed with 10 μl urease solution and 90 μl pH indicator solution in the reaction tank and the detection time is only 20 s. A stable and reproducible calibration curve can be easily built with a detection range as 24–300 mg/dL.

"Comparison of phase mapping and electrogram-based driver mapping for catheter ablation in atrial fibrillation","2019","Introduction: Adjunctive driver-guided ablation in addition to pulmonary vein isolation has been proposed as a strategy to improve procedural success and outcomes for various populations with atrial fibrillation (AF). First, this study aimed to evaluate the different mapping techniques for driver/rotor identification and second to evaluate the benefits of driver/rotor-guided ablation in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF (PerAF). Methods: We searched the electronic database in PubMed using the keywords “atrial fibrillation,” “rotor,” “rotational driver,” “atrial fibrillation source,” and “drivers” for both randomized controlled trials and observational controlled trials. Clinical studies reporting efficacy or safety outcomes of driver-guided ablation for paroxysmal AF or (PerAF) were identified. We performed subgroup analyses comparing different driver mapping methods in patients with PerAF. The odds ratios (ORs) with random effects were analyzed. Results: Out of 175 published articles, seven met the inclusion criteria, of which two were randomized controlled trials, one was quasiexperimental study, and four observational studies (three case-controlled studies and one cross-sectional study). Overall, adjunctive driver-guided ablation was associated with higher rates of acute AF termination (OR: 4.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.12-10.08; P?<?0.001), lower recurrence of any atrial arrhythmia (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.30-0.065; P?<?0.001), and comparable complication incidence. Conclusions: Adjunctive driver-guided catheter ablation suggested an increased freedom from AF/AT relative to conventional strategies, irrespective of the mapping techniques. Furthermore, phase mapping appears to be superior to electrogram-based driver mapping in PerAF ablation. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article; atrial fibrillation; catheter ablation; clinical effectiveness; electrography; heart atrium arrhythmia; human; intermethod comparison; patient safety; postoperative complication; pulmonary vein isolation; quasi experimental study; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; surgical technique; treatment outcome; atrial fibrillation; catheter ablation; comparative study; heart function test; observational study; pathophysiology; procedures; Atrial Fibrillation; Catheter Ablation; Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"
"The surgery and repeat aspiration outcomes of the atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance category in The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology","2019","Background/Objective: The atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) category is one of six diagnostic categories of The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC). In this study, we report the diagnostic distribution of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology and analyze the outcome of AUS/FLUS cases. Methods: A total of 29,937 thyroid FNA results, reported between April 2012 and December 2016, were retrieved from the database of a medical center. We reviewed the electronic medical records and analyzed the management of these patients. Results: Overall frequency of AUS/FLUS is 3.1% in our laboratory, which is at the lower limit of the recommended range. Of these, 891 reports of AUS/FLUS from 770 patients were identified. Out of the 770 patients, 367 had surgical intervention. In these 367 patients, final surgical pathology yielded 204 (55.6%) malignancies, 12 indeterminateness (3.3%), and 151 (41.1%) benignity. Among these surgical patients, 113 (30.8%) had received a repeat FNA of the thyroid before thyroid resection. The difference between the malignancy rates among patients who directly received surgery after the first AUS/FLUS diagnosis (132 of 254, 52.0%) and patients having a repeat FNA before surgery (72 of 113, 63.7%) was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our results are in agreement with AUS/FLUS diagnoses in less than 7% of specimens, and confirm that it is appropriate to perform either a repeat thyroid FNA or thyroid lobectomy, with the clinical decision being subject to the standardized management protocols of the second edition of TBSRTC in the AUS/FLUS category. ? 2018","fine needle aspiration biopsy; human; pathology; statistics and numerical data; thyroid disease; thyroid gland; time factor; Biopsy, Fine-Needle; Humans; Thyroid Diseases; Thyroid Gland; Time Factors"
"Inhibition of 3β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 Suppresses Interleukin-6 in Breast Cancer","2019","Background: Recently, we demonstrated that the expression of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD3B1) in breast cancer is associated with shorter recurrence-free survival, and genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of HSD3B1 reduced colony formation and xenograft growth. However, the mechanisms are unclear. Methods: Triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 breast cancer cells underwent HSD3B1 silencing. Microarray and bioinformatic analysis were performed. The interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression and secretion were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clonogenic ability and cell viability were determined in the absence or presence of recombinant IL-6. Results: Functional and pathway enrichment analyses showed that HSD3B1 silencing modulates the expression of several growth factors and cytokines. Cells transfected with HSD3B1-targeting small interfering RNA or treated with an HSD3B1 inhibitor (trilostane) had decreased IL-6 expression and secretion. HSD3B1 inhibition reduced colony formation, which was partially rescued by IL-6 supplementation. The HSD3B1 knockdown enhanced paclitaxel sensitivity, and IL-6 treatment partially reversed the augmented cytotoxicity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the therapeutic potential of targeting HSD3B1 is in part mediated by IL-6 suppression. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","3(or 17)beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; alanine; aspartic acid; atp2c1 protein; cell adhesion molecule; creb3l3 protein; cytokine; eotaxin 3; glutamic acid; glycerolipid; growth factor; growth factor receptor; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; integrin linked kinase; interleukin 6; itpr3 protein; matrix metalloproteinase 15; matrix metalloproteinase 19; myh9 protein; oxidoreductase; paclitaxel; protein; protein Jagged 2; rnd2 protein; small interfering RNA; steroid reductase; tnnc2 protein; trilostane; unclassified drug; vanilloid receptor 6; vasculotropin A; Article; bioinformatics; BT-20 cell line; cancer survival; cell viability; clinical evaluation; colony formation; cytotoxicity; disease association; drug mechanism; enzyme inhibition; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene silencing; genetic analysis; human; human cell; MDA-MB-231 cell line; microarray analysis; priority journal; protein expression; protein secretion; real time polymerase chain reaction; recurrence free survival; RNA interference; triple negative breast cancer; tumor xenograft"
"Genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis using set-based association tests","2019","The identification of gene-environment interactions (G × E) may eventually guide health-related choices and medical interventions for complex diseases. More powerful methods must be developed to identify G × E. The “adaptive combination of Bayes factors method” (ADABF) has been proposed as a powerful genome-wide polygenic approach to detect G × E. In this work, we evaluate its performance when serving as a gene-based G × E test. We compare ADABF with six tests including the “Set-Based gene-EnviRonment InterAction test” (SBERIA), “gene-environment set association test” (GESAT), etc. With extensive simulations, SBERIA and ADABF are found to be more powerful than other G × E tests. However, SBERIA suffers from a power loss when 50% SNP main effects are in the same direction with the SNP × E interaction effects while 50% are in the opposite direction. We further applied these seven G × E methods to the Taiwan Biobank data to explore gene× alcohol interactions on blood pressure levels. The ADAMTS7P1 gene at chromosome 15q25.2 was detected to interact with alcohol consumption on diastolic blood pressure (p = 9.5 × 10?7, according to the GESAT test). At this gene, the P-values provided by other six tests all reached the suggestive significance level (p &lt; 5 × 10?5). Regarding the computation time required for a genome-wide G × E analysis, SBERIA is the fastest method, followed by ADABF. Considering the validity, power performance, robustness, and computation time, ADABF is recommended for genome-wide G × E analyses. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Changes in the relationship between childhood asthma and ambient air pollution in Taiwan: Results from a nationwide survey repeated 5?years apart","2019","Background: Childhood asthma is a common disease whose prevalence is changing. Shift in environmental exposure was one of the plausible explanations. This study investigated changes in the association between childhood asthma and ambient air pollution occurring over time. Method: A nationwide questionnaire survey concerning respiratory illness and symptoms was administered to Taiwanese elementary and middle school students in 2011 and repeatedly in 2016-2017. During the study period, the concentrations of ambient air pollutants were obtained from the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) monitoring stations. Generalized estimating equation models were applied to examine the association between air pollution in the past year and the risk of current asthma. Results: A total of 6346 children from the 2011 survey and 11?585 children from the 2016-2017 survey attended schools located within a 1-km radius of Taiwan EPA monitoring stations. The prevalence of childhood current asthma (children with physician-diagnosed asthma and persistent asthma symptoms in the past year) increased from 7.5% to 9.6% during this period. The level of exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ?2.5?μm (PM 2.5 ) in the past year was found to be associated with current asthma both in the 2011 survey (odds ratio (OR): 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.41-2.57) and in the 2016-2017 survey (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04-1.48). Conclusion: Improved air quality has reduced the effect of PM 2.5 on childhood asthma, but air quality remains a health concern in Taiwan. ? 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

"Stomach cancer and exposure to talc powder without asbestos via chinese herbal medicine: A population-based cohort study","2019","The present investigation was designed to explore the risk of stomach cancer by oral intake of talc powder without asbestos. We conducted a population-based cohort study on a randomly sampled cohort from Taiwan’s health insurance database, with population of 1,000,000. The study participants were followed up through 2013. The outcome event of interest was the diagnosis of stomach cancer. The exposure of interest was the prescription of talc powder. Cox regression analyses were performed respectively. There were 584,077 persons without talc exposure and 21,575 talc users, 1849 diagnosed with stomach cancer. Persons with exposure of talc had a higher hazard ratio of stomach cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54–2.94; p < 0.001). Classification by cumulative exposure of talc yielded adjusted hazard ratios of stomach cancer of 1.58 (95% CI, 0.79–3.17; p = 0.19) and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.48–3.57; p < 0.001) among persons with high (>21 g) and medium (6–21 g) exposure of talc, as compared to the low-exposure counterparts. Our data demonstrated positive association between increased risk of stomach cancer and oral intake of talc without asbestos. Despite the absence of dose-response effect, there might be a link between stomach cancer and talc. ? 2019 by the authors.

"First-line afatinib for advanced EGFRm+ NSCLC: Analysis of long-term responders in the LUX-Lung 3, 6, and 7 trials","2019","Objectives: In patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive (EGFRm+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), first-line afatinib significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response vs. platinum-doublet chemotherapy in the phase III LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 trials, and significantly improved PFS, time to treatment failure and objective response vs. gefitinib in the phase IIb LUX-Lung 7 trial. We report post-hoc analyses of efficacy, safety and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in afatinib long-term responders (LTRs) in these trials. Methods: Treatment-na?ve patients with stage IIIB/IV EGFRm + NSCLC randomized to afatinib in LUX-Lung 3/LUX-Lung 6/LUX-Lung 7 were included in the analysis. Patients treated with afatinib for ? 3 years were defined as LTRs. Results: In LUX-Lung 3, LUX-Lung 6, and LUX-Lung 7, 24/229 (10%), 23/239 (10%) and 19/160 (12%) afatinib-treated patients were LTRs. Baseline characteristics were similar to the study populations, except for the proportions of women (LUX-Lung 3/LUX-Lung 6 only; 92/78% vs. 64% overall) and Del19-positive patients (63–79% vs. 49–58% overall). Median treatment duration among LTRs was 50, 56 and 42 months, and median PFS was 49.5, 55.5, and 42.2 months in LUX-Lung 3/LUX-Lung 6/LUX-Lung 7, respectively. Median overall survival could not be estimated. Frequency of afatinib dose reduction was consistent with the LUX-Lung 3/LUX-Lung 6/LUX-Lung 7 overall populations. PROs were stable in LTRs, with slight improvements after 3 years of afatinib treatment vs. baseline scores. Conclusions: In the LUX-Lung 3/LUX-Lung 6/LUX-Lung 7 trials, 10–12% of afatinib-treated patients were LTRs. Long-term afatinib treatment was independent of tolerability-guided dose adjustment and had no detrimental impact on safety or PROs. ? 2019","afatinib; epidermal growth factor receptor; acne; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer staging; cancer survival; controlled study; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; human; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; patient-reported outcome; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; progression free survival; randomized controlled trial; rash; stomatitis; survival rate; survival time; treatment outcome"
"Associations between prenatal exposure to bisphenol a and neonatal outcomes in a Taiwanese cohort study: Mediated through oxidative stress?","2019","This study determined whether maternal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure influences birth outcomes through oxidative stress and estimated the daily intake of BPA through breast milk for infants. One hundred and eighty-six pregnant women without pregnancy complications were enrolled and maternal urine was collected in the third trimester. Postnatal breast milk was collected in the first and third months after delivery. Concentrations of BPA were determined through ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Generalized additive model-penalized regression splines and a multivariable regression model were employed to determine the effects of BPA exposure and oxidative stress levels on birth outcomes. A causal mediation analysis was conducted to clarify the mediation effects of oxidative stress due to maternal BPA exposure on birth outcomes. The daily intake of BPA in breast milk was calculated using probabilistic risk assessment methods. The geometric means (geometric standard deviation) of BPA levels for maternal urine and first- and third-month breast milk were 2.19 (2.88) μg/g creatinine., 1.35 (3.53) ng/g, and 3.17 (2.97) ng/g, respectively. No significant mediation existed among maternal BPA exposure, oxidative stress level, and neonatal head circumference. Three percent of 1-monthold babies and 1% of 3-month-old babies exceeded the BPA tolerable daily intake of 4 μg/kg-bw/day proposed by the European Food Safety Authority. This study revealed the BPA exposure profile for pregnant women and infants in northern Taiwan. The marginally significant correlation between maternal BPA exposure and neonatal head circumference should be considered. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Body fluids; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Phenols; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Bis-phenol a; Causal mediation; European food safety authorities; Infant; Multivariable regression model; Pregnant woman; Quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry; Ultra performance liquid chromatography; Oxidative stress; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; creatinine; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; phenol derivative; chemical compound; child health; concentration (composition); milk; neonate; oxidative stress; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk assessment; urine; adult; Article; breast milk; cohort analysis; creatinine blood level; female; head circumference; human; major clinical study; maternal exposure; oxidative stress; perinatal period; pregnancy complication; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; quadrupole mass spectrometry; risk assessment; Taiwan; Taiwanese; third trimester pregnancy; time of flight mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; breast milk; chemically induced; chemistry; child health; drug effect; high performance liquid chromatography; infant; mass spectrometry; maternal exposure; morphometry; newborn; oxidative stress; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; regression analysis; Taiwan; Adult; Benzhydryl Compounds; Body Weights and Measures; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Health; Infant, Newborn; Mass Spectrometry; Maternal Exposure; Milk, Human; Oxidative Stress; Phenols; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Taiwan"
"Standard operating procedure for lyssavirus surveillance of the bat population in taiwan","2019","Viruses within the genus Lyssavirus are zoonotic pathogens, and at least seven lyssavirus species are associated with human cases. Because bats are natural reservoirs of most lyssaviruses, a lyssavirus surveillance program of bats has been conducted in Taiwan since 2008 to understand the ecology of these viruses in bats. In this program, non-governmental bat conservation organizations and local animal disease control centers cooperated to collect dead bats or bats dying of weakness or illness. Brain tissues of bats were obtained through necropsy and subjected to direct fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of lyssavirus antigens and nucleic acids. For the FAT, at least two different rabies diagnosis conjugates are recommended. For the RT-PCR, two sets of primers (JW12/N165-146, N113F/N304R) are used to amplify a partial sequence of the lyssavirus nucleoprotein gene. This surveillance program monitors lyssaviruses and other zoonotic agents in bats. Taiwan bat lyssavirus is found in two cases of the Japanese pipistrelle (Pipistrellus abramus) in 2016–2017. These findings should inform the public, health professionals, and scientists of the potential risks of contacting bats and other wildlife. ? 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",""
"Risk of elevation of serum creatine kinase among HIV-positive individuals receiving dolutegravir-based combination antiretroviral therapy","2019","We aimed to compare the risks of creatine kinase (CK) elevation between patients receiving dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and those receiving non-integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI)-based ART.HIV-positive patients seeking HIV outpatient care between February 2017 and March 2018 were retrospectively reviewed to collect information on ART, practices of vigorous exercise, and laboratory tests including CK level, plasma HIV RNA load, and concurrent medications. The incidences of CK elevation were estimated among patients receiving dolutegravir-based ART and those receiving non-InSTI-based ART.During the 14-month study period, 1406 patients (mean age 39.4 years and 96.9% being male) were included. The incidence rate of grade 3 or grade 4 CK elevation (>10-fold of the upper limit of normal) was 2.0 per 100 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) and 1.3 per 100 PYFU in the dolutegravir and non-InSTI group, respectively (P?=?.32). While dolutegravir group had a higher rate of CK elevation of any level than non-InSTI group (22.9 vs 17.4 per 100 PYFU, P?=?.01), the risk was associated with weight (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], per 10-kg increase, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04), duration of exercise (aOR, per 1-hour increase, 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.03), but not with dolutegravir-based ART (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.06) after adjusting for the testing frequency of serum CK in the multivariate generalized estimating equation model. No patients were hospitalized or switched ART due to CK elevation.Serum CK elevation was associated with weight and duration of exercise among HIV-positive patients receiving ART, but not with dolutegravir-based ART.","antiretrovirus agent; creatine kinase; dolutegravir; fused heterocyclic rings; integrase inhibitor; adult; blood; cohort analysis; comparative study; drug combination; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; retrospective study; risk factor; Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Cohort Studies; Creatine Kinase; Drug Combinations; Female; Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring; HIV Integrase Inhibitors; HIV Seropositivity; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors"
"Toxicity-based toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic assessment for bioaccumulation of polystyrene microplastics in mice","2019","While a large body of literature has shown that microplastics (MPs) are highly likely to be accumulated in marine organisms and terrestrial animals, information about toxicity of MPs in mammal from a mechanistic point of view is more limited. Our paper fills this knowledge gap by assessing polystyrene (PS)-MPs-mice system based on toxicity-based toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic (TBTK/TD) modeling to quantify organ-bioaccumulation and biomarker responses appraised with published dataset. The key TBTK-parameters for mice liver, kidney, and gut posed by 5 or 20 μm PS-MPs could be obtained. We found that gut had the highest bioaccumulation factor (BCF) of ?8 exposed to 5 μm PS-MPs with a mean residence time of ?17 days. We showed that threshold concentrations of 5 and 20 μm PS-MPs among the most sensitive biomarkers were 8 ± 5 (mean ± SE) and 0.71 ± 0.14 μg g?1 bw, respectively, implicating that particle size was likely to affect TK/TD behavior in mice. The mice-based TK parameters and threshold criteria greatly assist in designing robust researches to evaluate MP consumption by humans. We establish a TBTK/TD framework for mechanistically assessing potential from mice size-specific MPs exposure that would offer a tool-kit for extrapolating to humans from health risk assessment perspective. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bioaccumulation; Biomarkers; Health risks; Marine biology; Particle size; Polystyrenes; Risk assessment; Toxicity; Bioaccumulation factor; Biomarker response; Mean residence time; Mice; Microplastics; Terrestrial animals; Threshold concentrations; Toxicokinetics; Mammals; adenosine triphosphate; catalase; plastic; polystyrene derivative; superoxide dismutase; triacylglycerol; assessment method; bioaccumulation; biomarker; concentration (composition); marine environment; parameter estimation; plastic waste; pollution exposure; polymer; risk assessment; rodent; toxicity; animal experiment; Article; bioaccumulation; controlled study; health hazard; intestine; kidney; lipid metabolism; liver; male; mean residence time; mouse; no-observed-adverse-effect level; nonhuman; oxidative stress; risk assessment; steady state; toxicokinetics; Animalia; Mammalia; Mus"
"Sofosbuvir-based direct acting antiviral therapies for patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 2 infection","2019","Background and Aim: Data regarding the comparative effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir (SOF) in combination with ribavirin (RBV), daclatasvir (DCV), or ledipasvir (LDV) for hepatitis C virus genotype 2 (HCV-2) patients were limited. We aimed to evaluate the performance of these regimens in Taiwan. Methods: One hundred eighty-seven HCV-2 patients with compensated liver diseases receiving SOF in combination with RBV (n?=?82), DCV (n?=?66), or LDV (n?=?39) for 12?weeks were retrospectively enrolled. The effectiveness was determined by sustained virologic response 12?weeks off therapy (SVR12). The patient characteristics potentially related to SVR12 were compared. The safety profiles and laboratory abnormalities were assessed. Results: The SVR12 rates were 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86.5–97.4%), 98.5% (95% CI: 91.9–99.7%), and 100% (95% CI: 91.0–100%) in patients receiving SOF combined with RBV, DCV, and LDV, respectively. All patients tolerated treatment well. The stratified SVR12 rates were comparable regardless of baseline characteristics or week 4 viral decline among these regimens. Six (3.2%) patients had serious adverse events which were not related to treatment. The rates of fatigue, pruritus, and anemia tended to be higher in patients receiving RBV (22.0%, 19.5%, and 8.5%) combination than those receiving DCV (10.6%, 6.1%, and 1.5%) or LDV (10.3%, 5.1%, and 0%) combination. Conclusions: Sofosbuvir in combination with RBV, DCV, or LDV for 12?weeks is effective and well-tolerated for HCV-2 patients. Compared with DCV or LDV combination, the risks of fatigue, pruritus, and anemia are higher in patients receiving RBV combination. ? 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",""
"Clinical Manifestations and Outcomes of Patients with Sarcomatoid Hepatocellular Carcinoma","2019","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Sarcomatoid HCC is a rare histological subtype of HCC with largely unclear clinical manifestations and outcomes. We evaluated the clinical manifestations and outcomes of patients with sarcomatoid HCC. We identified 5,047 patients with histologically proven HCC from the Cancer Registry Database (1996-2016) of National Taiwan University Hospital. Among them, 40 patients with sarcomatoid HCC were identified from the pathology database of National Taiwan University Hospital. We included 160 patients with nonsarcomatoid HCC through propensity score matching according to sex, age, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. The majority of these patients with sarcomatoid HCC were men (75%); their median age was 58 years. Only 47.5% of the patients with sarcomatoid HCC presented with typical image patterns of HCC. The pathological grading of sarcomatoid HCC was more advanced compared with that of nonsarcomatoid HCC (42.5% vs. 23.8% in grade III and IV, P < 0.0001). The sarcomatoid group had significantly shorter median recurrence-free (13.3 vs. 84.2 months, log-rank P < 0.0001) and overall (8.3 vs. 69.3 months, log-rank P < 0.0001) survival than did the nonsarcomatoid group. The results of the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model revealed histological sarcomatoid subtype as an independent factor for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 6.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.12-13.43; P < 0.0001) and tumor recurrence (HR, 4.08; 95% CI, 1.72-9.66; P = 0.001). Conclusion: Compared with nonsarcomatoid HCC, sarcomatoid HCC was associated with more advanced histological grades and atypical image patterns. Histological sarcomatoid subtype is an independent predictor of tumor recurrence after curative treatment and all-cause mortality in patients with HCC. ? 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cancer grading; cancer patient; cancer registry; cancer survival; chronic hepatitis B; chronic hepatitis C; clinical feature; clinical outcome; comparative study; controlled study; disease severity; female; histopathology; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver histology; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; overall survival; priority journal; propensity score; recurrence free survival; sarcomatoid carcinoma; survival analysis; survival rate; systemic therapy; tumor recurrence"
"The use of Fourier-domain analyses for unwrapping phase images of low SNR","2019","Purpose: We report a new postprocessing procedure that uses Fourier-domain data analyses to improve the accuracy and reliability of phase unwrapping for MRI data of low SNR. Methods: The developed method first identifies the Fourier-domain energy peak locations corresponding to different image-domain areas from which a robust measurement of image-domain phase gradients can be obtained even for MRI data of low SNR. The phase-gradient information measured from critical brain regions using the above-mentioned Fourier-domain analysis is then combined with the conventional temporal-domain or spatial-domain phase-unwrapping procedure to remove phase wraps. The developed method was tested with MRI data obtained from 30 healthy adult volunteers, and its performance was quantitatively evaluated. Results: The developed Fourier-domain analysis could robustly quantify image-domain phase gradients even for MRI data with low SNR (e.g., SNR (Formula presented.) 2). Experimental results show that the Fourier-domain analyses could further reduce phase wrap artifact in data produced by the conventional temporal-domain or spatial-domain phase-unwrapping procedures. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the developed phase-unwrapping method can reduce residual phase wraps resulting from conventional procedures in critical brain regions (e.g., near the air-tissue interfaces) and should prove valuable for studies that require accurate measurements of MRI phase values, such as QSM, B 0 field mapping, and temperature mapping. ? 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","adult; article; artifact; brain region; clinical article; controlled study; data analysis; female; human; human experiment; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative analysis; reliability; volunteer"
"Development of a Computerized Adaptive Testing System for Assessing 5 Functions in Patients with Stroke: A Simulation and Validation Study","2019","Objective: The authors aimed to develop and validate the Computerized Adaptive Testing System for Assessing 5 Functions in Patients with Stroke (CAT-5F) based on the Barthel Index (BI), Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke patients (PASS), and Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM) to improve the efficiency of assessment. The purposes of the CAT-5F assessment are to describe patients’ levels of impairments or disabilities in the 5 functions and to serve as an outcome measure in patients with stroke. Design: This is a data-mining study based on data from a previous study using simulation analysis to develop and validate the CAT-5F. Setting: One rehabilitation unit in a medical center in Taiwan served as the setting for this study. Participants: Data were retrieved from totals of 540 (initial assessment) and 309 (discharge assessment) participants with stroke assessed in a previous study. The assessment data (N=540) were from the BI, PASS, and STREAM. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The outcome measures for this study were from BI, PASS, and STREAM. Results: The CAT-5F using the optimal stopping rule (limited reliability increased <0.010) had good Rasch reliability across the 5 functions (0.86-0.96) and needed 12.7 items, on average, for the whole administration. The concurrent validity (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, r=0.91-0.96) and responsiveness (standardized response mean=0.33-0.91) of the CAT-5F were sufficient in the patients. Conclusion: The CAT-5F has sufficient administrative efficiency, reliability, concurrent validity, and responsiveness to simultaneously assess basic activities of daily living, postural control, upper extremity/lower extremity motor functions, and mobility in patients with stroke. ? 2018 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","aged; Article; Barthel index; body equilibrium; cerebrovascular accident; Computerized Adaptive Testing System for Assessing 5 Functions; concurrent validity; daily life activity; data mining; female; functional assessment; human; lower limb; major clinical study; male; motor performance; physical mobility; Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patient; Rasch analysis; rehabilitation center; retrospective study; simulation; stroke patient; Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement; Taiwan; upper limb; validation study; cerebrovascular accident; complication; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; disability; middle aged; movement (physiology); pathophysiology; stroke rehabilitation; task performance; walking difficulty; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Computer Simulation; Data Mining; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Mobility Limitation; Movement; Postural Balance; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Task Performance and Analysis; Upper Extremity"
"Increased risk of chronic fatigue syndrome following psoriasis: A nationwide population-based cohort study","2019","Background: The onset of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been shown to be associated with several immunological conditions such as infections or atopy. The aim of this study was to clarify the risk of chronic fatigue syndrome following the diagnosis of psoriasis, an immune-related dermatological disease, by analyzing the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Method: 2616 patients aged 20 years or older with newly diagnosed psoriasis during 2004-2008 and 10,464 participants without psoriasis were identified. Both groups were followed up until the diagnoses of CFS were made at the end of 2011. Results: The relationship between psoriasis and the subsequent risk of CFS was estimated through Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with the incidence density rates being 2.27 and 3.58 per 1000 person-years among the non-psoriasis and psoriasis populations, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, with 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-2.06). In the stratified analysis, the psoriasis group were consistently associated with a higher risk of CFS in male sex (HR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.31-3.20) and age group of ? 60 years old (HR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.33-4.06). In addition, we discovered that the significantly increased risk of CFS among psoriasis patients is attenuated after they receive phototherapy and/or immunomodulatory drugs. Conclusions: The data from this population-based retrospective cohort study revealed that psoriasis is associated with an elevated risk of subsequent CFS, which is differentiated by sex and age. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adalimumab; azathioprine; cyclosporine; etanercept; hydroxyurea; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; psoralen; retinoid; tacrolimus; ustekinumab; adult; Article; chronic fatigue syndrome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; data analysis; disease association; disease severity; female; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; phototherapy; population research; proportional hazards model; psoriasis; retrospective study; risk; sex difference; Taiwan; young adult"
"HSD3B1 gene polymorphism and female pattern hair loss in women with polycystic ovary syndrome","2019","Background/purpose: Genetic variant of HSD3B1 1245 is known to augment androgen production at peripheral tissue as skin. This study aimed to investigate whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome inheriting this variant exhibit specific androgenic phenotypes. Methods: A cross-sectional study of Taiwanese women with polycystic ovary syndrome, defined by Rotterdam criteria, at the reproductive endocrinology outpatient clinic in a university affiliated hospital. Results: The presence of female pattern hair loss in women with polycystic ovary syndrome was significantly associated with an increased body mass index, decreased sex hormone binding globulin and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, elevated triglyceride levels, and increased prevalence of hypertension. Using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, body mass index, triglyceride and HSD3B1 1245 AC or CC genotype were significantly related to female pattern hair loss in women with polycystic ovary syndrome after considering other variables. Overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome had significantly higher risk of female pattern hair loss than normal-weight women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The presence of female pattern hair loss was higher in overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome who comprised HSD3B1 AC or CC genotype compared with wild type. Conclusion: Carrying the HSD3B1 1245C allele and overweight are associated with the presence of female pattern hair loss in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hsd3b1 protein; protein; sex hormone binding globulin; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; adult; Article; body mass; cross-sectional study; DNA polymorphism; female; gene frequency; genotype; hair loss; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; hypertension; major clinical study; obesity; ovary polycystic disease; phenotype; prevalence; Taiwanese; triacylglycerol level"
"Survival analysis of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in neonatal and pediatric patients – A nationwide cohort study","2019","Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides short-term cardiopulmonary support for patients with acute cardiac and respiratory failure. This study reported the survival rate for pediatric patients from Taiwan's national cohort. Methods: Patients under the age of 18 who received ECMO from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2012 were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The underlying etiology for ECMO use was categorized into post-operative (n = 410), cardiac (245), pulmonary (146) groups, and others (120). A Cox regression model was used to determine hazard ratios and to compare 30-day and 1-year survival rates using post-operative group as a reference. Results: The average age of all 921 patients was 4.83 ± 5.84 years, and 59.1% were male. The overall mortality rate was 29.2% at 1 month, and 46.9% at 1 year. The cardiac origin group, consisting mostly of congenital heart disease without surgical intervention, myocarditis, and heart failure had a better outcome with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI 0.49–0.96, p = 0.008) at 30 days and 0.50 (95% CI 0.38–0.66, p < 0.001) at 1 year, as compared to the post-operative group. Conclusion: In contrast to the widespread use of ECMO in respiratory distress syndrome in western countries, pediatric ECMO in Taiwan was more often applied to patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. Mortality rates varied according to age groups and various etiologies. The results of this large pediatric cohort provides a different prospective in critical care outcomes in medical environments where ECMO is more widely available. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","atropine; bicarbonate; dopamine; epinephrine; noradrenalin; vasopressin; acute kidney failure; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; child; child hospitalization; cohort analysis; comparative study; congenital heart disease; extracorporeal oxygenation; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; groups by age; heart failure; human; infant; limb ischemia; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; myocarditis; national health insurance; newborn; outcome assessment; pediatric patient; postoperative care; preschool child; respiratory distress syndrome; survival analysis; survival rate; Taiwan; treatment duration; treatment indication"
"10-year outcome of temporary structured treatment interruption (STI) among HIV-1-infected patients: An observational study in a single medical center","2020","Background: Lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for HIV-1 infected patients but may lead to intolerance or poor adherence. Structured treatment interruption (STI) is a strategy for drug holiday or to boost HIV-specific immunity. But the long-term outcome of STI was never reported in literature. Methods: This is a single-center observational study. We followed the HIV-infected patients who already had a stable viral suppression and voluntarily started temporary STI with a fixed 12-week interval after counseling, evaluation and education. HIV-1-specific T cell response was also measured in some patients. Results: Totally 34 HIV-infected patients received temporary STI since July, 2006. 18 patients completed 10-year follow-up. All patients received protease inhibitors (PI)-based ART before and during temporary STI. The patients received temporary STI with a period of 36–85 weeks. All of them reached viral suppression after 12 weeks of restarting continuous ART. No viral rebound or opportunistic disease was recorded during follow-up. No adverse event or comorbidity was attributed to STI. The plasma viral load (PVL) at the end of STI was significantly lower than baseline PVL in patients with a longer duration of STI (?36 weeks vs. >36 weeks, P = 0.005). The T cell response study revealed that cyclically increased HIV-1-specific T cell response after starting STI in patients with baseline CD4+ count >350/μL. Conclusion: Temporary STI may not lead to worse long-term outcome among highly selected patients. The policy may partially control viral replication through reminding the HIV-1 specific T cell immunity. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",""
"Quantification of glucose via in situ growth of Cu2O/Ag nanoparticles","2019","The monitoring of glucose levels in blood is extremely important for the effective control of diabetes. Nanomaterial-based approaches for the quantification of glucose typically require two steps: material preparation and the actual glucose measurement. Herein, we report a single-step method that combines these functions via the in situ growth of Cu2O/Ag nanoparticles (NPs). Mechanistically, we use glucose itself to reduce Cu2+ and Ag+ ions that are stabilized with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) under alkaline conditions to form Cu2O/Ag NPs and produce a color change in solution due to plasmonic resonance at 400 nm, which can be related back to the concentration of glucose. We study several factors in this reaction, including the molar ratios of the metal ions and 3-MPA, the reaction time, and the temperature to control the synthesis of the Cu2O/Ag NPs and thus their sensitivity toward glucose. Introducing BSA into the system is a key factor for the quantification of glucose in blood without pretreatment, improving the probe's limit of detection and reducing the sample volumes to 1 μL. This colorimetric assay based on Cu2O/Ag NPs exhibits excellent sensitivity and specificity toward glucose, and a linear relationship with glucose concentrations ranging from 15 to 300 μM and a limit of detection of 9.2 μM. As proof of concept, we demonstrated that the Cu2O/Ag NP probes could successfully detect glucose in two representative blood samples by neglecting interferences from various common species, demonstrating the potential of this technique in point-of-care analysis. ? 2019","Blood; Colorimetry; Copper oxides; Mammals; Metal ions; Metals; Plasmonics; Plasmons; Probes; Silver compounds; Silver nanoparticles; Surface plasmon resonance; 3-mercaptopropionic acid; Bovine serum albumins; Cu2O; Glucose quantification; Plasmonic resonances; Glucose"
"Sociodemographic characteristics, disability trajectory, and health care and long-term care utilization among middle-old and older adults in Taiwan","2019","Objectives: To understand whether disability trajectories mediated the association between sociodemographic characteristics and later health care and long-term care services use. Methods: Data were from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging Survey, 1996–2007 (N =3429). Latent class growth curves modeling and structural equation modeling were applied to examine the effect of disability trajectory as mediator on sociodemographic characteristics and on later services use. Results: Respondents were identified in three trajectories: maintained disability (1.92%), progressive disability (10.56%), and functional independence trajectories (87.52%). The progressive disability trajectory partially and fully mediated the effects of age on later use of health care and long-term care services (the partially mediating effect on age and long-term care service use: β = 0.047, p < 0.001, for example). With the progressive disability trajectory in the model, higher education had a direct effect on greater use of long-term care services (β = 0.020, p =0.020), but through the mediating effect of the disability trajectory, education had an indirect effect on lower use of long-term care services(β = -0.025, p < 0.001). Education had fully mediating effects on the later use of inpatient (β = -0.016, p < 0.001) and emergency services (β= -0.012, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Preventing older adults from developing a fast-growing disability trajectory could be an effective way to decrease use of health care and long-term care services and related expenditures in late life. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; age; Article; correlational study; disability; educational status; emergency health service; female; functional status; gender; growth curve; health care utilization; hospital patient; human; independence; long term care; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; population risk; priority journal; risk factor; social status; Taiwan; trend study"
"Prevalence of bullying and perceived happiness in adolescents with learning disability, intellectual disability, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder: In the Taiwan Birth Cohort Pilot Study","2019","Children with learning disability (LD), intellectual disability (ID), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reported higher risk of being bullied compared to their peers. Controlling for the co-morbidity of different diagnosis is important in investigating the frequency of bullying. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the pathway relationship of adolescents' psychiatric diagnoses, including LD, ID, ADHD, ASD, with being bullied, their self-perceived psychological well-being (PWB) and social adaptation status (SAS) in 12-years-olds.The Taiwan Birth Cohort Pilot Study dataset (N=1561) was used. The Chinese Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was used to measure PWB and SAS.Adolescent-reported rate of bullying was 25.4%, while only 2.8% of the parents reported knowing their child had been bullied. Boys reported higher rate of being bullied than girls. Adolescents with ADHD were not at higher risk of being bullied compared to their peers, nevertheless, they perceived lower level of SAS. Adolescents diagnosed with ID and ASD reported 63% rate of bullying and those who have been bullied perceived lower level of happiness.Adolescents with ADHD reported lower level of SAS, for disruption of harmony is even less acceptable in the Asian culture. Adolescents with ID and ASD reported higher rate of bullying than their peers and perceived lower level of happiness. A gap was found between parent and adolescent-reported rate of bullying. Encouraging adolescents to seek adult protection and support to reduce the effect of bullying on the perceived level of happiness is important. ? 2019 the Author(s).

"Inter-brand competition in the convenience store industry, store density and healthcare utilization","2019","We investigate the impact of access to convenience stores and competition between convenience store chains on the use of medical care in Taiwan. Using insurance claims from 0.85 million individuals and administrative data on store sales, we find that greater store density and more inter-brand competition reduced expenditures on outpatient medical services and prescription drugs. In support of these findings, we demonstrate that convenience store competition was associated with greater consumption of healthy foods and lower obesity rates. Our estimates suggest that the rise in convenience store competition from 2002 to 2012 reduced outpatient expenditures in Taiwan by 0.44 percent and prescription drug expenditures by 0.85 percent. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","competition (economics); drug prescribing; food consumption; health expenditure; health impact; health services; retailing; Article; commercial phenomena; convenience food; cost control; feeding behavior; health care cost; health care utilization; health survey; human; insurance; interview; nutritional health; obesity; outpatient care; prescription; restaurant; Taiwan; urban rural difference; Taiwan"
"The selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator (SPPARMα) paradigm: Conceptual framework and therapeutic potential","2019","In the era of precision medicine, treatments that target specific modifiable characteristics of high-risk patients have the potential to lower further the residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Correction of atherogenic dyslipidemia, however, remains a major unmet clinical need. Elevated plasma triglycerides, with or without low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), offer a key modifiable component of this common dyslipidemia, especially in insulin resistant conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The development of selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulators (SPPARMα) offers an approach to address this treatment gap. This Joint Consensus Panel appraised evidence for the first SPPARMα agonist and concluded that this agent represents a novel therapeutic class, distinct from fibrates, based on pharmacological activity, and, importantly, a safe hepatic and renal profile. The ongoing PROMINENT cardiovascular outcomes trial is testing in 10,000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, elevated triglycerides, and low levels of HDL-C whether treatment with this SPPARMα agonist safely reduces residual cardiovascular risk. ? 2019 The Author(s).","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; triacylglycerol; atherogenesis; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular risk; conceptual framework; coronary artery atherosclerosis; disease association; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; dyslipidemia; high risk patient; human; lipoprotein metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; population research; preclinical study; prevalence; Review; risk factor; risk reduction; treatment outcome; treatment planning; triacylglycerol blood level"
"Outcome of patients with and poor prognostic factors for Mycobacterium kansasii-pulmonary disease","2019","Background: Aggressive therapy for Mycobacterium kansasii-pulmonary disease (MK-PD) is recommended because of the virulence of MK. However, some clinicians may be concerned regarding the lengthy course and numerous adverse effects. This study evaluated the natural course of MK-PD and investigated its prognostic factors. Methods: Radiographic outcome, prognostic factors, and mortality within 1 year for MK-PD were obtained from patients in 6 hospitals in Taiwan from 2010 to 2014 (derivation cohort) and validated using patients in 2015 and 2016 (validation cohort). Results: Of the 109 patients with MK-PD in the derivation cohort, radiographic progression occurred in 70 (64%), with a 1-year mortality rate of 43% and median survival of 71 days, whereas none of the 39 cases without radiographic progression died. All patients with acid-fast smear (AFS) grade ? 3 experienced radiographic progression. For the others, the independent risk factors of radiographic progression were fibroCavitary pattern, Leucocyte count >9000/μL, Old age (age >65 years), pUre MK in sputum (no other mycobacteria), and no Diabetes mellitus (the CLOUD factors). By applying these criteria to the validation cohort (n = 112), 3 (9%) of the 33 patients with MK-PD who initially had AFS grade < 3 and < 3 CLOUD risk factors experienced radiographic progression, and none of the 3 died of MK-PD. Conclusions: Because of the high risk of radiographic progression and subsequent fatal outcome, immediate anti-MK treatment is recommended. For patients with MK-PD who have sputum AFS grade <3 and < 3 CLOUD risk factors, regular follow-up may be an alternative. ? 2019 The Author(s)","acid fast smear; age; aged; Article; atypical mycobacteriosis; clinical article; cohort analysis; female; human; leukocyte count; lung infection; male; median survival time; mortality rate; Mycobacterium kansasii; nonhuman; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognostic assessment; retrospective study; risk factor; smear; sputum analysis; Taiwan; thorax radiography"
"Prospective comparison of (4S)-4-(3- 18 F-fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate versus 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT for detecting metastases from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a proof-of-concept study","2019","Purpose: (4S)-4-(3- 18 F-Fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate (FSPG) positron emission tomography (PET) reflects system x C ? transporter (xCT) expression. FSPG PET has been used to detect brain, lung, breast and liver cancer with only modest success. There is no report on the use of FSPG PET in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), presumably because of normal xCT expression in the pancreas. Nonetheless, the tissue-specific expression of xCT in the pancreas suggests that FSPG PET may be ideal for identifying metastasized PDAC. Methods: The performance of FSPG in detecting PDAC metastases was compared with that of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in small-animal PET studies in seven PDAC tumour-bearing mice and in prospective PET/computed tomography (CT) studies in 23 patients with tissue-confirmed PDAC of stage III or stage IV. All PET/CT results were correlated with the results of histopathology or contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) performed 3 and 6?months later. Results: In the rodent model, FSPG PET consistently found more PDAC metastases earlier than FDG PET. FSPG PET showed a trend for a higher sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy than FDG PET in detecting PDAC metastases in a patient-based analysis: 95.0%, 100.0% and 95.7%, and 90.0%, 66.7% and 90.0%, respectively. In a lesion-based analysis, FSPG PET identified significantly more PDAC metastases, especially in the liver, than FDG PET (109 vs. 95; P =?0.0001, 95% CI 4.9–14.6). The tumour-to-background ratios for FSPG and FDG uptake on positive scans were similar (FSPG 4.2 ± 4.3, FDG 3.6 ± 3.0; P = 0.44, 95% CI ?1.11 to 0.48), despite a lower tumour maximum standardized uptake value in FSPG-avid lesions (FSPG 4.2?+?2.3, FDG 7.7?+?5.7; P = 0.002, 95% CI 0.70–4.10). Because of the lower physiological activity of FSPG in the liver, FSPG PET images of the liver are more easy to interpret than FDG PET images, and therefore the use of FSPG improves the detection of liver metastasis. Conclusion: FSPG PET is superior to FDG PET in detecting metastasized PDAC, especially in the liver. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","4 (3 fluoropropyl)glutamate f 18; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; tracer; unclassified drug; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer tissue; clinical article; comparative study; contrast enhancement; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; distant metastasis; exploratory research; female; follow up; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; liver metastasis; male; maximum standardized uptake value; middle aged; mouse; nonhuman; open study; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreas tissue; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; proof of concept; radiodiagnosis; sensitivity and specificity; standardized uptake value; standardized uptake value ratio; tissue specificity; x-ray computed tomography"
"Meta-analysis: Exercise intervention for sleep problems in cancer patients","2019","Background: Sleep problems cause physical and mental distress and may influence the survival of cancer patients. Objectives: This study aimed to explore the efficacy of exercise intervention to improve sleep in cancer patients. Methods: Published papers from 1980 to 2018 were searched. Results: The major findings included (a) exercise intervention had small positive effects on enhancing total subjective sleep quality (TSSQ; g?=?0.38, 95% CI?=?0.21–0.54) and objective sleep onset latency (g?=?0.21, 95% CI?=?0.01–0.41). (b) The characteristics in subgroups in regarding the small to large effects of an exercise programme on sleep were identified. First, the groups of a home-based exercise and a supervised exercise combined with a home-based exercise had a medium effect on TSSQ than the usual group. Second, interventions with aerobic exercise, especially the 4- to 8-week programmes and those with weekly volume of 80–149?min per week for cancer patients with ongoing or completed treatment also had a medium to large positive effect on TSSQ. Finally, patients with breast cancer and haematologic malignancies contributed a small effect in this meta-analysis. Conclusions: Maintaining regular aerobic exercises, even of different durations and weekly volumes, benefits patient sleep quality. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"Machine learning methods applied to predict ventilator-associated pneumonia with pseudomonas aeruginosa infection via sensor array of electronic nose in intensive care unit","2019","One concern to the patients is the off-line detection of pneumonia infection status after using the ventilator in the intensive care unit. Hence, machine learning methods for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) rapid diagnose are proposed. A popular device, Cyranose 320 e-nose, is usually used in research on lung disease, which is a highly integrated system and sensor comprising 32 array using polymer and carbon black materials. In this study, a total of 24 subjects were involved, including 12 subjects who are infected with pneumonia, and the rest are non-infected. Three layers of back propagation artificial neural network and support vector machine (SVM) methods were applied to patients’ data to predict whether they are infected with VAP with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, in order to improve the accuracy and the generalization of the prediction models, the ensemble neural networks (ENN) method was applied. In this study, ENN and SVM prediction models were trained and tested. In order to evaluate the models’ performance, a fivefold cross-validation method was applied. The results showed that both ENN and SVM models have high recognition rates of VAP with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, with 0.9479 ± 0.0135 and 0.8686 ± 0.0422 accuracies, 0.9714 ± 0.0131, 0.9250 ± 0.0423 sensitivities, and 0.9288 ± 0.0306, 0.8639 ± 0.0276 positive predictive values, respectively. The ENN model showed better performance compared to SVM in the recognition of VAP with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the two models were 0.9842 ± 0.0058 and 0.9410 ± 0.0301, respectively, showing that both models are very stable and accurate classifiers. This study aims to assist the physician in providing a scientific and effective reference for performing early detection in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection or other diseases. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The 14-3-3η chaperone protein promotes antiviral innate immunity via facilitating MDA5 oligomerization and intracellular redistribution","2019","MDA5 belongs to the RIG-I-like receptor family and plays a non-redundant role in recognizing cytoplasmic viral RNA to induce the production of type I IFNs. Upon RNA ligand stimulation, we observed the redistribution of MDA5 from the cytosol to mitochondrial membrane fractions. However, the molecular mechanisms of MDA5 activation remain less understood. Here we show that 14-3-3η is an essential accessory protein for MDA5-dependent type I IFN induction. We found that several 14-3-3 isoforms may interact with MDA5 through the CARDs (N-MDA5), but 14-3-3η was the only isoform that could enhance MDA5-dependent IFNβ promoter activities in a dose-dependent manner. Knock-down of 14-3-3η in Huh7 cells impaired and delayed the kinetics of MDA5 oligomerization, which is a critical step for MDA5 activation. Consequently, the MDA5-dependent IFNβ promoter activities as well as IFNβ mRNA expression level were also decreased in the 14-3-3η knocked-down cells. We also demonstrated that 14-3-3η is essential in boosting the activation of MDA5-dependent antiviral innate immunity during viral infections. In conclusion, our results uncover a novel function of 14-3-3η to promote the MDA5-dependent IFNβ induction pathway by reducing the immunostimulatory potential of viral dsRNA within MDA5 activation signaling pathway. ? 2019 Lin et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.","14 3 3eta chaperone protein; beta interferon; chaperone; interferon induced helicase C domain containing protein 1; long chain fatty acid coenzyme A ligase; polyinosinic polycytidylic acid; tubulin; unclassified drug; voltage dependent anion channel 1; beta interferon; chaperone; DEAD box protein; double stranded RNA; IFIH1 protein, human; interferon induced helicase C domain containing protein 1; isoprotein; messenger RNA; protein 14 3 3; YWHAH protein, human; agar gel electrophoresis; antiviral activity; Article; cell fractionation; cellular distribution; controlled study; Encephalomyocarditis virus; gene knockdown; genetic transfection; HEK293 cell line; HEK293T cell line; Huh-7 cell line; human; human cell; immune response; immunoblotting; immunoprecipitation; innate immunity; luciferase assay; mitochondrial membrane; molecular biology; molecular mechanics; mRNA expression level; oligomerization; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; promoter region; protein dephosphorylation; protein expression; protein function; protein interaction; signal transduction; virus infection; virus inhibition; biosynthesis; cytoplasm; genetics; immunology; innate immunity; metabolism; protein transport; tumor cell line; 14-3-3 Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytoplasm; DEAD-box RNA Helicases; Gene Knockdown Techniques; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Interferon-beta; Interferon-Induced Helicase, IFIH1; Molecular Chaperones; Protein Isoforms; Protein Transport; RNA, Double-Stranded; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; Virus Diseases"
"Cilostazol Attenuates Retinal Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in a Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Animal Model","2019","Purpose: To investigate the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of cilostazol in the ocular tissues of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Materials and methods: Diabetes was induced in 6-week-old Wistar rats via peritoneal injections of STZ. The treatment group received cilostazol 18 mg/kg/day for 8?weeks (n =?10), and the diabetic group received phosphate buffer solution (n =?20). The expression of oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators in the ocular tissues was then assessed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Western blot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions, IHC staining, Western blot analysis, and ELISA showed that cilostazol inhibited mRNA and protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and fractalkine in the retina and aqueous humor (AqH). Consistent with these findings, cilostazol attenuated the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the diabetic rats. The levels of oxidatively modified DNA (8-OHdG), nitrotyrosine and oxidative lipids (acrolein) were also diminished in the cilostazol-treated group. Chemiluminescence analysis showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the AqH was significantly higher in the diabetic rats than in the non-diabetic rats. Treatment with cilostazol significantly reduced the ROS levels in the AqH compared to the diabetic rats. Conclusions: Our results indicated that cilostazol reduced inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress in diabetic eyes. The anti-inflammatory effects of cilostazol may be indirectly via reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting NF-κB activity, and subsequently decreasing inflammatory mediators. Cilostazol may be beneficial to prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","3 nitrotyrosine; acrolein; cilostazol; DNA; fractalkine; glucose; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; messenger RNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; placebo; reactive oxygen metabolite; streptozocin; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; aqueous humor; Article; body weight; chemoluminescence; controlled study; diabetic retinopathy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; eye tissue; female; gel mobility shift assay; glucose blood level; immunohistochemistry; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression level; rat; retina tissue; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; Western blotting"
"Dual Delivery of HNF4α and Cisplatin by Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles Inhibits Cancer Pluripotency and Tumorigenicity in Hepatoma-Derived CD133-Expressing Stem Cells","2019","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly malignancies characterized by high rate of recurrence. Tumor recurrence is often attributed to the presence of a subpopulation of cells with stem cell properties, referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Traditionally, cancer therapies target the entire bulk of tumor cells; however, they are poorly effective against CSCs, characterized by higher drug resistance. Therefore, approaches targeting CSCs may be required in addition to conventional chemotherapy to prevent tumor recurrence. In this study, we investigated an approach to target HCC by combining the conventional chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin, to target the bulk of tumor cells, and differentiation therapy by delivering the gene encoding HNF4α, an important regulator of hepatocyte differentiation, to target CSCs. We used the Huh7 cell line as an in vitro model of HCC, which is characterized by a high proportion of CD133-expressing CSCs. By using flow cytometry, we separated CD133+ and CD133- Huh7 cell subpopulations and have shown that the former has highly pronounced in vivo tumorigenic capacity in contrast to the latter, which could not generate tumors in vivo. For the dual delivery of HNF4α-encoding plasmid and cisplatin, we used polyethyleneimine-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PMSNs) as the nanocarriers. Here, we show that the treatment of CD133-expressing Huh7 cells with HNF4α-loaded PMSNs can suppress their proliferation rate, decrease the proportion of CSCs, downregulate stemness-associated genes, and increase the expression of mature hepatocyte-associated genes. At the same time, the treatment of Huh7 with PMSNs loaded with both HNF4α-encoding plasmid and cisplatin could block them in the S-phase of the cell cycle and cause apoptosis. In addition, dually loaded PMSNs were the most efficient formulation in suppressing tumor growth in vivo. To summarize, in this study, we tested the nanoparticle-based delivery system as both chemotherapy and gene-based therapy agents, which has great potential for development of effective treatment of HCC. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell culture; Cell death; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; DNA; Encoding (symbols); Gene encoding; Gene expression; Gene therapy; Gene transfer; Mesoporous materials; Nanoparticles; Signal encoding; Silica; Silica nanoparticles; Stem cells; Tumors; CD133; Gene Delivery; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Huh7; Mesoporous silica nanoparticles; Targeted drug delivery; CD133 antigen; cisplatin; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; HNF4A protein, human; nanoparticle; silicon dioxide; animal; cell cycle; chemistry; drug effect; flow cytometry; genetics; human; liver cell carcinoma; metabolism; mouse; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SCID mouse; stem cell; tumor cell line; TUNEL assay; Western blotting; AC133 Antigen; Animals; Blotting, Western; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; Flow Cytometry; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4; Humans; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Mice; Mice, SCID; Nanoparticles; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Silicon Dioxide; Stem Cells"
"Association of Delirium Response and Safety of Pharmacological Interventions for the Management and Prevention of Delirium: A Network Meta-analysis","2019","Importance: Although several pharmacological interventions for delirium have been investigated, their overall benefit and safety remain unclear. Objective: To evaluate evidence regarding pharmacological interventions for delirium treatment and prevention. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, ClinicalKey, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to May 17, 2018. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining pharmacological interventions for delirium treatment and prevention. Data Extraction and Synthesis: To extract data according to a predetermined list of interests, the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were applied, and all meta-analytic procedures were conducted using a random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were treatment response in patients with delirium and the incidence of delirium in patients at risk of delirium. Results: A total of 58 RCTs were included, in which 20 RCTs with 1435 participants (mean age, 63.5 years; 65.1% male) compared the outcomes of treatment and 38 RCTs with 8168 participants (mean age, 70.2 years; 53.4% male) examined the prevention of delirium. A network meta-analysis demonstrated that haloperidol plus lorazepam provided the best response rate for delirium treatment (odds ratio [OR], 28.13; 95% CI, 2.38-333.08) compared with placebo/control. For delirium prevention, the ramelteon, olanzapine, risperidone, and dexmedetomidine hydrochloride groups had significantly lower delirium occurrence rates than placebo/control (OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.66 for ramelteon; OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09-0.69 for olanzapine; OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.07-0.99 for risperidone; and OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.80 for dexmedetomidine hydrochloride). None of the pharmacological treatments were significantly associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with placebo/control. Conclusions and Relevance: This network meta-analysis demonstrated that haloperidol plus lorazepam might be the best treatment and ramelteon the best preventive medicine for delirium. None of the pharmacological interventions for treatment or prophylaxis increased the all-cause mortality. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Magnitude and modifiers of the weekend effect in hospital admissions: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Objective To examine the magnitude of the weekend effect, defined as differences in patient outcomes between weekend and weekday hospital admissions, and factors influencing it. Design A systematic review incorporating Bayesian meta-analyses and meta-regression. Data sources We searched seven databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 2000 to April 2015, and updated the MEDLINE search up to November 2017. Eligibility criteria: primary research studies published in peer-reviewed journals of unselected admissions (not focusing on specific conditions) investigating the weekend effect on mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay (LoS) or patient satisfaction. Results For the systematic review, we included 68 studies (70 articles) covering over 640 million admissions. Of these, two-thirds were conducted in the UK (n=24) or USA (n=22). The pooled odds ratio (OR) for weekend mortality effect across admission types was 1.16 (95% credible interval 1.10 to 1.23). The weekend effect appeared greater for elective (1.70, 1.08 to 2.52) than emergency (1.11, 1.06 to 1.16) or maternity (1.06, 0.89 to 1.29) admissions. Further examination of the literature shows that these estimates are influenced by methodological, clinical and service factors: at weekends, fewer patients are admitted to hospital, those who are admitted are more severely ill and there are differences in care pathways before and after admission. Evidence regarding the weekend effect on adverse events and LoS is weak and inconsistent, and that on patient satisfaction is sparse. The overall quality of evidence for inferring weekend/weekday difference in hospital care quality from the observed weekend effect was rated as a 'very low' based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. Conclusions The weekend effect is unlikely to have a single cause, or to be a reliable indicator of care quality at weekends. Further work should focus on underlying mechanisms and examine care processes in both hospital and community. ?

"Varlitinib downregulates HER/ERK signaling and induces apoptosis in triple negative breast cancer cells","2019","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a complex disease associated with the aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. TNBC harbors heterogeneous molecular subtypes with no approved specific targeted therapy. It has been reported that HER receptors are overexpressed in breast cancer including TNBC. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of varlitinib, a reversible small molecule pan-HER inhibitor in TNBC. Our results showed that varlitinib reduced cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in most TNBC cell lines but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. MEK and ERK inhibition overcame resistance to varlitinib in MDA-MB-231 cells. Varlitinib inhibited HER signaling which led to inhibition of migration, invasion and mammosphere formation of TNBC cells as well as significant suppression of tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 xenograft mouse model. In summary, these results suggest that HER signaling plays an important role in TNBC progression and that pan-HER inhibition is potentially an effective treatment for TNBC patients. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Development of Alzheimer disease in old major depressive patients based upon their health status: A retrospective study in Taiwan","2019","This study is conducted to investigate the association between major depressive disorder and the subsequent development of Alzheimer disease (AD) in elderly patients with different health statuses using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).A retrospective cohort study was performed on subjects over 65 years old from 2002 to 2006 using a random sampling from the 1 million beneficiaries enrolled in the NHI. Patients who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder were selected as the case group. Subjects in the control group were selected from elderly patients who did not have depression during the study period by matching age, sex, and index date of depression with subjects in the case group using a ratio of 1:4 (case:control). Both groups of patients were checked annually over a period of 7 years to observe whether they subsequently developed AD.A total of 1776 subjects were included in the case group while 7104 subjects were in the control group. After the follow-up period, 59 patients (3.3%) with depression developed AD while 96 patients (1.4%) without depression developed AD. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the incidence rate of AD in both groups varied significantly depending on different health statuses (log-rank P?<?.001). Results of the generalized estimating equation model found that patients with depression (hazard ratio [HR]?=?1.898; 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?1.451-2.438), very severe health status (HR?=?1.630; 95% CI?=?1.220-2.177), or artery diseases (HR?=?1.692; 95% CI?=?1.108-2.584) were at a higher risk of developing AD than other groups.The association between major depressive disorder and the later development of AD varied depending on the health statuses of elderly patients. Clinicians should exercise caution when diagnosing and treating underlying diseases in elderly depressed patients, and then attempt to improve their health status to reduce the incidence rate of subsequent AD development.","age; aged; Alzheimer disease; cardiovascular disease; female; health status; human; incidence; Kaplan Meier method; major depression; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; onset age; public health; retrospective study; risk factor; severity of illness index; sex factor; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; very elderly; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Cardiovascular Diseases; Depressive Disorder, Major; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Health Status; Humans; Incidence; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; National Health Programs; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Taiwan"
"Health Risk Assessment of Photoresists Used in an Optoelectronic Semiconductor Factory","2019","Photoresist materials are indispensable in photolithography, a process used in semiconductor fabrication. The work process and potential hazards in semiconductor production have raised concerns as to adverse health effects. We therefore performed a health risk assessment of occupational exposure to positive photoresists in a single optoelectronic semiconductor factory in Taiwan. Positive photoresists are widely used in the optoelectronic semiconductor industry for photolithography. Occupational exposure was estimated using the Stoffenmanager? model. Bayesian modeling incorporated available personal air sampling data. We examined the composition and by-products of the photoresists according to descriptions published in the literature and patents; the main compositions assessed were propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA), novolac resin, photoactive compound, phenol, cresol, benzene, toluene, and xylene. Reference concentrations for each compound were reassessed and updated if necessary. Calculated hazard quotients were greater than 1 for benzene, phenol, xylene, and PGMEA, indicating that they have the potential for exposures that exceed reference levels. The information from our health risk assessment suggests that benzene and phenol have a higher level of risk than is currently acknowledged. Undertaking our form of risk assessment in the workplace design phase could identify compounds of major concern, allow for the early implementation of control measures and monitoring strategies, and thereby reduce the level of exposure to health risks that workers face throughout their career. ? 2019 Society for Risk Analysis","Bayesian networks; Benzene; Health; Health hazards; Health risks; Occupational risks; Phenols; Photolithography; Photoresists; Semiconductor device manufacture; Xylene; Bayesian model; Benzene , toluene , and xylenes; Propylene glycol methyl ether; Reference concentration; Semi-conductor fabrication; Semiconductor factories; Semiconductor production; Stoffenmanager; Risk assessment; air sampling; chemical composition; chemical compound; health impact; health risk; modeling; occupational exposure; public health; risk assessment; semiconductor industry; workplace; Taiwan"
"Role of social anxiety on high engagement and addictive behavior in the context of social networking sites","2019","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to tackle the problem of technology addiction by investigating the differences between the antecedences of addictive (problematic technology usage) and high-engagement behavior (non-problematic technology usage). The case of social networking site usage (SNS, e.g. Facebook, Instagram or Twitter) is taken as the case out of the reason of prevalent user population. Design/methodology/approach: It is revealed that people tend to use SNS not only for building a relationship, but also for communicating. In other words, there are inner needs of adopting the SNS technology. However, no clear definitions can be followed for determining the problematic SNS usage, addictive behavior and the high-engagement behavior. Therefore, this study adopts the notion of uses and gratification theory (U&G theory) for investigating the SNS usage behavior. Also, the social anxiety is also first introduced to integrate into the research for an empirical study. Findings: Results reveal that gratification sought and relationship maintenance are associated with the addictive behavior, whereas the relationship maintenance is significantly related to high-engagement behavior. Research limitations/implications: First, the selected data represents a sample of SNW users in the Asian Pacific region and mainly from the group of young college users. Therefore, caution must be taken when generalizing the findings to other SNW users or groups. Second, the time aspect related to social media dependence may need to be considered in future studies. Third, the authors found marginal support for the influence of intentions of high engagement? and future studies may consider applying other theories that could better explain these types of behavior. Practical implications: The results of this study provide strong evidence that inner anxiety perceived by users should not be neglected while tackling the problematic internet use due to SNW addiction because it can strengthen the force for depending on SNW for seeking social support. Apart from the value of perceived enjoyment as asserted in previous studies, this study opens up a new opportunity to tackle SNW dependence. Social implications: The key implication of this research is that the impact of the mental health of users on SNW problematic should not be overlooked. The higher the level of anxiety perceived, the more likely is the SNW dependence. Therefore, the online behavior depending on psychological health should be addressed because it may be a critical point for assisting users to adopt SNW wisely. Originality/value: This study confirms that social anxiety people experience in real (offline) life has impacts on online behavior of SNS usage (online). It suggests that the difference between users as the perceived level of social anxiety can trigger different levels of SNS usage. Second, U&G theory is proven valid in understanding SNS addiction. Third, relationship maintenance through the use of SNS reveals its dissimilar effects on SNS addiction and high engagement. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",""

"Health risk assessment of banned veterinary drugs and quinolone residues in shrimp through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry","2019","The presence of antibiotic residues in seafood and their effect on public health constitute a matter of concern for consumers worldwide. Antibiotic residues can have adverse effects on both humans and animals, especially residues of banned veterinary drugs. In this study, we applied a validated method to analyze veterinary drug residues in shrimp, including the levels of banned chloramphenicol, malachite green, leucomalachite green, and four nitrofuran metabolites as well as thiamphenicol, florfenicol, and five quinolones, which have no recommended maximum residual levels in shrimp tissues in Taiwan. We collected 53 samples of whiteleg, grass, or giant river shrimp from Taiwanese aquafarms and production areas from July 2016 to December 2017.We found 0.31 ng/g of a chloramphenicol in one grass shrimp, 5.62 ng/g of enrofloxacin in one whiteleg shrimp, 1.52 ng/g of flumequine in one whiteleg shrimp, and 1.01 ng/g of flumequine in one giant river shrimp, indicating that 7.55% of the samples contained veterinary drug residues. We evaluated the health risk by deriving the estimated daily intake (EDI). The quinolone residue EDI was below 1.0% of the acceptable daily intake recommended by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization andWorld Health Organization. The risk was thus discovered to be negligible, indicating no immediate health risk associated with shrimp consumption. The present findings can serve as a reference regarding food safety and in monitoring of the veterinary drug residues present in aquatic organisms. Continual monitoring of residues in shrimp is critical for further assessment of possible effects on human health. ? 2019 by the authors. All right reserved.",""
"Circulating chemerin levels, but not the RARRES2 polymorphisms, predict the long-term outcome of angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease","2019","Chemerin, a novel adipokine, has been associated with metabolic, inflammatory, and atherosclerotic diseases. We aimed to determine the genetic basis of chemerin levels by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to investigate the role of RARRES2 polymorphisms and circulating chemerin levels in the long-term outcome of coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 2197 participants from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) were recruited for the GWAS analysis, and 481 patients with angiographically confirmed CAD were enrolled for long-term outcome analysis. One locus of genome-wide significance with a single independent association signal was identified in the GWAS for chemerin levels with the peak association at the RARRES2 gene promoter region polymorphism rs3735167 (p = 2.35 × 10-21). In the CAD population, borderline significance was noted between RARRES2 polymorphisms and chemerin levels, whereas high chemerin levels were associated with obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, current smoking, high platelet and leukocyte counts, anemia, impaired renal function, high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and multi-vessel disease. Kaplan?Meier survival curves indicated that the patients with high chemerin and CRP levels, but not those with RARRES2 polymorphisms, had a lower survival rate and higher combined cerebral and cardiovascular event rates. Combined chemerin and CRP levels further revealed a stepwise increase in poor clinical outcomes from low- to high-risk subgroups. In conclusion, rs3735167 is the lead RARRES2 polymorphism for chemerin levels in Taiwanese. Chemerin levels, but not the rs3735167 genotypes, predicted the long-term outcome of CAD, especially when combined with CRP levels. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Comparison of two methods for idiopathic clubfoot treatment: A case-controlled study in Taiwan","2019","Background/Purpose: In last century, two distinctive methods of manipulation and casting were developed, Kite method and Ponseti method. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of parallel series between two methods in one institution. Methods: From 2003 to 2008, two pediatric orthopedic services in one institution treated 57 patients with 88 idiopathic clubfeet. One service continued using Kite casting method consisted of 58 feet, and other service employed Ponseti casting method consisted of 30 feet. There was a minimum of 4 years follow-up. Results: Both groups had similar Dimeglio severity scores before treatment. Initial correction was achieved in 40 feet (69%) in the Kite group compared with 27 feet (90%) in the Ponseti group, while 19 feet (63.3%) had percutaneous Achilles tenotomy. The Ponseti method was found to have a significantly higher correction rate (p = 0.028). After a mean follow-up of 72 months, there were 29 relapses (50%) in the Kite group and 8 relapses (26.7%) in the Ponseti group with significant difference (p = 0.036). At the latest follow-up, the outcome measures were 24 feet (41.4%) good, 18 feet (31%) fair and 16 (27.6%) poor in the Kite group and 25 feet (83.3%) good, 3 feet (10%) fair and 2 feet (6.7%) poor in the Ponseti group with significant difference between two groups (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In this simultaneous series of two casting methods in a single institution with more than 4 years follow up, we concluded that Ponseti method significantly achieved better midterm outcome in clubfoot management. ? 2018","achilles tendon; Article; case control study; child; clubfoot; comparative study; controlled study; Dimeglio clubfoot severity score; female; follow up; forefoot; human; idiopathic disease; intermethod comparison; Kite method; major clinical study; male; manipulative medicine; Ponseti method; relapse; scoring system; Taiwan; tendon transfer; tenotomy; treatment outcome; clubfoot; comparative effectiveness; infant; joint characteristics and functions; newborn; orthopedic manipulation; procedures; recurrent disease; surgery; Achilles Tendon; Case-Control Studies; Clubfoot; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Manipulation, Orthopedic; Range of Motion, Articular; Recurrence; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"

"Dolutegravir plus lamivudine versus dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine in antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 infection (GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2): week 48 results from two multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trials","2019","Background: Effective two-drug regimens could decrease long-term drug exposure and toxicity with HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy (ART). We therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a two-drug regimen compared with a three-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-naive adults. Methods: We conducted two identically designed, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trials: GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2. Both studies were done at 192 centres in 21 countries. We included participants (?18 years) with HIV-1 infection and a screening HIV-1 RNA of 500 000 copies per mL or less, and who were naive to ART. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive a once-daily two-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus lamivudine (300 mg) or a once-daily three-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) and emtricitabine (200 mg). Both drug regimens were administered orally. We masked participants and investigators to treatment assignment: dolutegravir was administered as single-entity tablets (similar to its commercial formulation, except with a different film colour), and lamivudine tablets and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine tablets were over-encapsulated to visually match each other. Primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 in the intention-to-treat-exposed population, using the Snapshot algorithm and a non-inferiority margin of ?10%. Safety analyses were done on the safety population. GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02831673 and NCT02831764, respectively. Findings: Between July 18, 2016, and March 31, 2017, 1441 participants across both studies were randomly assigned to receive either the two-drug regimen (n=719) or three-drug regimen (n=722). At week 48 in the GEMINI-1 intention-to-treat-exposed population, 320 (90%) of 356 participants receiving the two-drug regimen and 332 (93%) of 358 receiving the three-drug regimen achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL (adjusted treatment difference ?2·6%, 95% CI ?6·7 to 1·5); in GEMINI-2, 335 (93%) of 360 in the two-drug regimen and 337 (94%) of 359 in the three-drug regimen achieved HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL (adjusted treatment difference ?0·7%, 95% CI ?4·3 to 2·9), showing non-inferiority at a ?10% margin in both studies (pooled analysis: 655 [91%] of 716 in the two-drug regimen vs 669 [93%] of 717 in the three-drug regimen; adjusted treatment difference ?1·7%, 95% CI ?4·4 to 1·1). Numerically, more drug-related adverse events occurred with the three-drug regimen than with the two-drug regimen (169 [24%] of 717 vs 126 [18%] of 716); few participants discontinued because of adverse events (16 [2%] in the three-drug regimen and 15 [2%] in the two-drug regimen). Two deaths were reported in the two-drug regimen group of GEMINI-2, but neither was considered to be related to the study medication. Interpretation: The non-inferior efficacy and similar tolerability profile of dolutegravir plus lamivudine to a guideline-recommended three-drug regimen at 48 weeks in ART-naive adults supports its use as initial therapy for patients with HIV-1 infection.

"Reprogramming of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line (IBMSi012-A) from an early-onset Parkinson's disease patient harboring a homozygous p.D331Y mutation in the PLA2G6 gene","2019","A recessive mutation in PLA2G6, which is known to cause a heterogeneous neurodegenerative clinical spectrum, has recently been shown to be responsible for autosomal-recessive familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a female patient with a homozygous PLA2G6 c.991G > T (p.D331Y) mutation by using the Sendai-virus delivery system. The resulting iPSCs showed pluripotency confirmed by immunofluorescent staining for pluripotency markers and differentiated into the 3 germ layers in vivo.

"Short- versus long-course antibiotics in osteomyelitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Current practice of long-term antibiotic use in patients with osteomyelitis is controversial. Recent studies showed short-term antibiotic use to be non-inferior to long-term use, but the results of these studies have been inconsistent. In this review, the PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception through to June 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies or case–control studies comparing two different durations of antibiotic use. Short antibiotic courses were defined as antibiotics administered for a shorter period than the recommended 4–6 weeks. A random-effects model was used to calculate summary odds ratios (ORs) of treatment failure in patients treated with short-course antibiotics compared with long-course antibiotics. A total of 15 articles (5 RCTs and 10 observational studies) and 3598 patients were included. The overall OR of treatment failure in patients receiving short-course antibiotics was 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97–2.34]. Subgroup analysis revealed that a short course of antibiotic treatment was associated with an increased treatment failure rate in vertebral osteomyelitis (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.18–3.57) while having a similar rate to a long antibiotic course in acute osteomyelitis of childhood (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 0.75–4.64). Meta-regression found a higher proportion of Staphylococcus aureus infection was related to a higher risk of treatment failure in patients with vertebral osteomyelitis (Coef. = 4.996; P = 0.032). Short-course antibiotics are safe and effective in children with acute osteomyelitis. Long-course antibiotics may still be preferred in vertebral osteomyelitis, especially in patients with S. aureus infection. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; cholestasis; chronic osteomyelitis; comparative effectiveness; diarrhea; dosage schedule comparison; drug safety; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; hematogenous osteomyelitis; human; meta analysis; nausea; osteomyelitis; priority journal; Review; spondylitis; Staphylococcus infection; systematic review; treatment duration; vomiting; adolescent; adult; aged; child; female; infant; male; middle aged; osteomyelitis; preschool child; Staphylococcus aureus; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Osteomyelitis; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Intracranial Responses to Afatinib at Different Doses in Patients With EGFR-mutated Non–small-cell Lung Carcinoma and Brain Metastases","2019","Background: As the first-line treatment, afatinib is commonly used in patients with EGFR-mutated non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, dose adjustments are frequently required. The optimal dose of afatinib for brain metastasis has seldom been investigated. Patients and Methods: From May 2014 to March 2017, treatment-naive patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC and brain metastases at diagnosis who received afatinib therapy were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical data was reviewed and analyzed, including age, gender, performance status, smoking history, EGFR mutation status, initial doses of afatinib, average daily doses of afatinib, and best intracranial treatment responses. Results: A total of 74 patients were included for analysis. The overall intracranial objective response rate (IORR) and intracranial disease control rate (IDCR) were 81.1% and 95.9%, respectively. For patients treated with afatinib alone (N = 45), no significant difference between an initial daily dose of 30 mg (N = 15) and 40 mg (N = 30) (30 mg vs. 40 mg, IORR: 86.7% vs. 80.0%; P = .581 and IDCR: 93.3% vs. 93.3%; P = 1.000, respectively). The IORRs were 75.0%, 91.7%, 80.0%, and 85.7% (P = .707), and the IDCRs were 93.8%, 100.0%, 90.0%, and 85.7% (P = .638) in patients with an average daily dose of 40 mg (N = 16), < 40 mg and > 30 mg (N = 12), 30 mg (N = 10), and < 30 mg and > 20 mg (N = 7), respectively. No significant differences in intracranial treatment responses between groups treated with afatinib alone or afatinib plus local treatments. Conclusion: Dose reduction may not affect intracranial treatment responses to afatinib therapy, either alone or combined with local treatments, in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC and brain metastases. Afatinib is commonly used for advanced EGFR-mutated non–small-cell lung cancer, and dose reduction is frequently required. The effect of dose reduction on brain metastasis was seldom investigated. This retrospective multicenter study analyzed different daily doses of afatinib used in treatment-naive patients with EGFR-mutated non–small-cell lung cancer and brain metastases, which demonstrated that dose reduction may not affect intracranial responses to afatinib therapy. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","afatinib; vasculotropin; adult; age; aged; Article; brain metastasis; cancer control; dose response; drug efficacy; female; gender; gene mutation; human; intracranial drug administration; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; retrospective study; smoking; treatment response"
"Iron sulfide minerals as potential active capping materials for mercury-contaminated sediment remediation: A minireview","2019","Several innovative approaches have been proposed in recent years to remediate contaminated sediment to reduce human health and environmental risk. One of the challenges of sediment remediation stems from its unfeasible high cost, especially when ex situ strategies are selected. Therefore, in situ methods such as active capping have been emerging as possible options for solving sediment problems. Active capping methods have been extensively tested in field-scale sediment remediation for organic pollutants (e.g., PCBs, PAHs, DDT) contamination with good sequestration efficiency; however, these methods have not been widely tested for control of heavy metal pollutants, such as mercury (Hg). In this review, the potentials of using iron sulfide minerals to sequestrate Hg were discussed. Iron sulfide minerals are common in the natural environment and have shown good effectiveness in sequestrating Hg by adsorption or precipitation. Iron sulfides can also be synthesized in a laboratory and modified to enhance their sequestration ability for Hg. Some of the potential advantages of iron sulfides are pointed out here. Additional tests to understand the possibility of applying iron sulfides as active caps to remediate complicated environment systems should be conducted. ? 2019 by the authors.","adsorption; environmental risk; iron sulfide; mercury (element); organic pollutant; pollutant removal; public health; sediment capping; sediment pollution"
"Effects of febuxostat on renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Hyperuricemia has been proven to be an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the role of hyperuricemia in the progression of CKD remains unclear. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of febuxostat, a first line urate-lowering agent, in CKD patients with hyperuricemia. METHODS: We have systematically searched for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of febuxostat versus control in CKD patients with hyperuricemia through MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. All statistical analyses were conducted by using the statistical package Review Manager, version 5.3.5. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q and I tests and summary statistics were reported with 95% confidence interval. Two-tailed test was used for analysis and a P value of <.05 is considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Eleven eligible trials with 1317 participants were included in the meta-analysis. A significant reduction in serum uric acid was found in the febuxostat treated group. Also, a significant higher eGFR was found in the febuxostat treated group among CKD stage 3 and 4 patients. No significant difference of major complication or death was identified between treatment and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis showed that other than its urate-lowering effect, febuxostat presented a reno-protective effect in CKD patients. More studies with larger sample sizes and higher quality are required to clarify the role of febuxostat use in the progression of CKD.","antigout agent; febuxostat; uric acid; blood; chronic kidney failure; disease exacerbation; drug effect; glomerulus filtration rate; human; meta analysis; pathophysiology; Disease Progression; Febuxostat; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Uric Acid"
"Fast analysis of ketamine using a colorimetric immunosorbent assay on a paper-based analytical device","2019","In this study, we designed a rapid colorimetric sensing system using competitive ELISA test on a microfluidic paper-based analytical device for the detection of ketamine, a frequently abused drug. Oral fluid was selected for the test to facilitate the collection of samples based on its advantages of low infection risk, noninvasiveness of sample collection, and decreased chance of sample adulteration. After optimization of the operation parameters, including reaction temperature, vibration washing time, reaction time, and antibody concentration, the resulting assay can be completed in as little as 6 min with a detection limit of 0.03 ng/mL. Moreover, we developed an Android smartphone app to analyze and measure the results of the test, further enhancing the test's portability, and image recording and data transmission capabilities. In order to test the feasibility and performance of the optimized colorimetric assay, 90 oral fluid samples from drug abuse patients were tested. The paper-based platform features 90% sensitivity (confidence interval (CI): 76.34–97.21%) and 92% specificity (CI: 80.77–97.78%) for ketamine analysis.

"Thermal cycling as a novel thermal therapy to synergistically enhance the anticancer effect of propolis on PANC?1 cells","2019","Hyperthermia (HT) has shown potential in cancer therapy. In particular, it appears to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. However, a major concern associated with HT is that the thermal dosage applied to the tumor cells may also harm the normal tissue cells. Besides, the drugs used in HT are conventional chemotherapy drugs, which may cause serious side effects. The present study demonstrated a novel methodology in HT therapy called thermal cycle (TC)-HT. With this strategy, a therapeutic window with a maximum synergistic effect was created by combining TC-HT with natural compounds, with minimal unwanted cell damage. The natural compound propolis was selected, and the synergistic anticancer effect of TC-HT and propolis was investigated in pancreatic cancer cells. The present results demonstrated for the first time that TC-HT could enhance the anticancer effect of propolis on PANC-1 cancer cells through the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway and cell cycle arrest. Combined treatment greatly suppressed mitochondrial membrane potential, which is an important indicator of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria. Furthermore, the cell cycle-regulating protein cell division cycle protein 2 was downregulated upon combined treatment, which prevented cellular progression into mitosis. The present study offers the first report, to the best of our knowledge, on the combination of TC-HT with a natural compound for pancreatic cancer treatment. It is anticipated that this methodology may be a starting point for more sophisticated cancer treatments and may thereby improve the quality of life of many patients with cancer. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Is Antipsychotic Treatment Associated with Risk of Pneumonia in People with Serious Mental Illness?: The Roles of Severity of Psychiatric Symptoms and Global Functioning","2019","Background Most pneumonia-related researches in people with severe mental illness were based on insurance claims data. This study aimed for a comprehensive analysis of factors potentially associated with risk of pneumonia in psychiatric inpatients. Methods Inpatients at a large psychiatric hospital diagnosed with pneumonia during the course of hospitalization were enrolled as cases. Controls were matched by ward and date. The diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed by physicians based on clinical features, chest radiographs, and blood tests. A stepwise conditional logistic regression model was used to identify potential risk factors for pneumonia. Results Seventy-five pneumonia cases and 436 matched controls were enrolled. Conditional logistic regression revealed 3 variables significantly associated with an increased risk of pneumonia: a higher score on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]. 1.5-9.1), a higher score on the Charlson comorbidity index (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.2), and a longer duration of antipsychotic treatment (aOR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.0-1.0). Two variables were significantly associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia: a higher score on the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (aOR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9) and an older age of onset (aOR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.9-1.0). After adjusting for potential confounders, use of antipsychotic or other psychotropic medications was not found to be a significant risk factor for pneumonia. Conclusions Physical comorbidities, long duration of antipsychotic treatment, early onset, severe psychiatric symptoms, and poor global functioning are associated with pneumonia in people with serious mental illness. ?

"Lumbar puncture for non-HIV-infected non-transplant patients with cryptococcosis: Should it be mandatory for all?","2019","Background The indications for lumbar puncture in non-HIV-infected, non-transplant (NHNT) patients with cryptococcosis without meningeal signs need to be more fully defined. Objectives This study was designed to determine the optimal predictors of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in adult NHNT patients with cryptococcosis. Methods The study population consisted of adult NHNT patients with culture-confirmed cryptococcosis who sought care at a university hospital in Taiwan from 2002 to 2016. We used a case-control method to identify the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings associated with CNS involvement in patients who underwent a diagnostic lumbar puncture. In the sensitivity analysis, we included additional control patients who did not undergo lumbar puncture, but were followed beyond 12 months without the development of CNS involvement in the absence of exposure to any fungicidal agents. Results We entered 270 NHNT adult patients into the study during the 15-year period. CNS involvement was confirmed in 66 (71.0%) of 93 patients who underwent lumbar puncture. A multivariable analysis revealed that presence of neurological manifestations and elevated serum CRAG titers were independently associated with a 23.97-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.37–182.23) and 1.53-fold (per 2-fold increment, 95% CI 1.26–1.92) increased odds ratio for CNS involvement, respectively. Headache and focal neurologic signs were independently associated with CNS involvement. A cut-off serum CRAG titer of 1:64 provided the highest diagnostic performance by Youden index (sensitivity 83% and specificity 65%). Similar findings were noted in the sensitivity analysis including 198 (73%) patients. Conclusion Lumbar puncture is indicated for NHNT patients with cryptococcosis who have neurologic manifestations or a serum CRAG titer of 1:64. ? 2019 Huang et al.

"International validation of the revised European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Head and Neck Cancer Module, the EORTC QLQ-HN43: Phase IV","2019","Background: We validated the new European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Head and Neck Module (EORTC QLQ-HN43). Methods: We enrolled 812 patients with head and neck cancer from 18 countries. Group 1 completed the questionnaire before therapy, and 3 and 6 months later. In group 2 (survivors), we determined test–retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's Alpha, the scale structure with confirmatory factor analysis, and discriminant validity with known-group comparisons. Results: Cronbach's alpha was >0.70 in 10 of the 12 multi-item scales. All standardized factor loadings exceeded 0.40. The ICC was >0.70 in all but two scales. Differences in scale scores between known-groups were >10 points in 17 of the 19 scales. Sensitivity to change was found to be sufficient in 18 scales. Conclusions: Evidence supports the reliability and validity of the EORTC QLQ-HN43 as a measure of quality of life. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",""
"Differential Organ-Specific Tumor Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Hepatocellular Carcinoma","2019","Background and Aims: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) exhibit significant clinical activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study explored whether tumor response to ICIs in HCC varies among different organs. Methods: We reviewed the data of patients with advanced HCC who had received ICIs. Patients with measurable diseases were enrolled. Organ-specific response criteria, adapted from RECIST 1.1 and immune-related RECIST, were used to evaluate the objective response to ICIs in tumors located in the liver, lung, lymph node, and other intra-abdominal sites. Results: Of the 75 enrolled patients with advanced HCC, 51 and 11 patients had chronic hepatitis B virus and chronic hepatitis C virus infection, respectively. Regarding ICI treatment, 58, 1, and 16 patients had undergone anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) alone, anti-CTLA4 mAb alone, and anti-PD-1 mAb plus anti-CTLA4 mAb, respectively; 20 and 55 patients had received ICIs as first-line or ?second-line therapy. The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 28.0%. In total, 58, 34, 19, and 18 patients had measurable hepatic tumors and lung, lymph node, and other intra-abdominal metastases, and the corresponding organ-specific ORRs were 22.4, 41.2, 26.3, and 38.9%, respectively. Of the 39 patients who had both hepatic and extrahepatic tumors, 12 had disease control in extrahepatic tumors while progressive disease (PD) in hepatic tumors, whereas only 4 exhibited disease control in hepatic tumors while PD in extrahepatic tumors (p = 0.046, McNemar test). Of the 16 patients with only evaluable tumors in the liver and lungs at baseline, 8 had disease control in the lungs while PD in the liver, and none experienced disease control in the liver while PD in the lungs (p = 0.005). Conclusions: The hepatic tumors of HCC may be less responsive to ICIs than extrahepatic lesions. Lung metastases responded most favorably to ICIs. The mechanisms underlying this differential response to ICIs warrant further investigation. ? 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

"Cost-effectiveness of preventing hepatitis B virus reactivation in patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection","2020","Background/Purpose: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation may occur in >10% of patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection who undergo rituximab-containing chemotherapy. Preventive strategies may have marked impact on resource allocation in HBV endemic areas. This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness between prophylactic antiviral therapy and HBV DNA monitoring for the prevention of HBV-related complications. Methods: Data sources are studies of HBV-related events and survival for patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection published since 2006. Decision tree analysis was used to compare the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of preventing HBV-related death or liver decompensation for patients who undergo first-line rituximab-containing chemotherapy. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of the preventive efficacy, the duration of prophylactic antiviral therapy, and the cost of different interventions. The direct medical cost was derived from the database of the NHI Administration, Taiwan. The time frame of our analysis was set to 3 years after the completion of chemotherapy. Results: The median ICER of prophylactic antiviral therapy, according to current practice guidelines, ranged between USD 150,000 and 250,000 if we apply the guidelines generally. When a long-course (12 months after completion of chemotherapy according to clinical guidelines) prophylactic therapy was assumed, Option A was cheaper and more effective only in the anti-HBs-negative subgroup (median ICER US$149,932 vs. US$161,526, p = 0.013). Conclusion: Identification of anti-HBs-negative subgroups is critical to improve the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antiviral therapy in lymphoma patients with resolved HBV infection. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin plus prednisolone plus rituximab plus vincristine; hepatitis B surface antibody; antiviral therapy; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer survival; chemotherapy; clinical outcome; clinical study; cost effectiveness analysis; decompensated liver cirrhosis; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; disability-adjusted life year; endemic disease; follow up; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; hospital patient; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; national health insurance; nonhuman; outcome assessment; overall survival; population; practice guideline; prophylaxis; resource allocation; survival; treatment duration; virus reactivation; World Health Organization"
"Lymphocyte Antigen 6 Complex, Locus C+ Monocytes and Kupffer Cells Orchestrate Liver Immune Responses Against Hepatitis B Virus in Mice","2019","To understand the mechanism(s) of age-dependent outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in humans, we previously established an age-related HBV mouse model in which 6-week-old (N6W) C3H/HeN mice exhibited virus tolerance whereas 12-week-old (N12W) counterparts presented virus clearance. By investigating the hepatic myeloid cell dynamics in mice of these two ages, we aim to identify factors associated with HBV clearance. C3H/HeN mice were transfected with an HBV plasmid by hydrodynamic injection. Serum HBV markers were monitored weekly. Hepatic leucocyte populations and their cytokine/chemokine productions were examined at baseline, day 3 (D3), day 7 (D7), and day 14 after injection. C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) antagonist and clodronate (CLD) were respectively administered to N12W and N6W mice to study the roles of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C (Ly6C)+ monocytes and Kupffer cells (KCs) in viral clearance. N12W mice had a significantly higher number of TNF-α–secreting Ly6C+ monocytes and fewer IL-10–secreting KCs at D3 in the liver than their younger N6W counterparts after HBV transfection. In addition, the elevated number of interferon-γ+TNF-α+ CD8+ T cells at D7 was only seen in the older cohort. The enhanced Ly6C+ monocyte induction in N12W mice resulted from elevated C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) secretion by hepatocytes. CCR2 antagonist administration hampered Ly6C+ monocyte recruitment and degree of KC reduction and delayed HBV clearance in N12W animals. Depletion of KCs by CLD liposomes enhanced Ly6C+ monocyte recruitment and accelerated HBV clearance in N6W mice. Conclusions: Ly6C+ monocytes and KCs may, respectively, represent the resistance and tolerance arms of host defenses. These two cell types play an essential role in determining HBV clearance/tolerance. Manipulation of these cells is a promising avenue for immunotherapy of HBV-related liver diseases. ? 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","alanine aminotransferase; caspase 3; chemokine receptor CCR2 antagonist; clodronic acid; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; liposome; lymphocyte antigen; lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus c; lymphotoxin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; transcription factor 3; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; virus antigen; antigen specificity; Article; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell population; controlled study; cytokine production; genetic transfection; Hepatitis B virus; immune response; immunofluorescence; Kupffer cell; liver; male; monocyte; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; transmission electron microscopy; viral clearance"

The structures of the new compounds were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and spectroscopic data comparison with related structures. The rare capnosane diterpenoids were isolated herein from the genus Klyxum for the first time. The cytotoxicity of compounds 1 to 7 against the proliferation of a limited panel of cancer cell lines was assayed. The isolated diterpenoids also exhibited anti-inflammatory activity through suppression of superoxide anion generation and elastase release in the N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine/cytochalasin B (fMLF/CB)-stimulated human neutrophils. Furthermore, 1 and 7 also exhibited cytotoxicity toward the tested cancer cells, and 7 could effectively inhibit elastase release.

"Aging effects on the mechanical energy transfer through the lower extremity joints during the swing phase of level walking","2019","Age-related changes of gait performance have been evidenced by the altered kinetic coordination of the lower extremity. However, a systematic approach to explore the gait control in terms of the mechanical energy transfer across multiple segments throughout the gait phases is still not well documented. Ten healthy elderly and ten young adults were asked to walk along a 10-meter walkway at the self-selected and fast walking speeds. The visualized energy flow model of the swing leg was established and the factor analysis was then applied to extract the high-dimensional energy flow characteristics of the swing leg. The results showed that the young adults have similar energy flow characteristics of the swing leg for both fast and self-selected walking speeds, while the elderly showed an opposite energy flow pattern especially at the fast walking speed. The hip power and the knee power were also found to mainly correspond to the swing acceleration and deceleration, respectively. This study demonstrated a valuable tool to explore the change of the gait characteristics in the elderly and could help to facilitate the understanding of the neuromuscular adaptation due to aging. ? 2019, The Author(s).","adult; aged; aging; article; clinical article; controlled study; deceleration; energy transfer; factor analysis; female; hip; human; human experiment; knee; male; walking speed; young adult"
"Metformin Prolongs Survival in Type 2 Diabetes Lung Cancer Patients With EGFR-TKIs","2019","Background: Metformin use reportedly reduces cancer risk and improves survival in lung cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of metformin use in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and lung cancer receiving epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy.

From January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012, a total of 373 metformin and 1260 non-metformin lung cancer cohorts with type 2 DM and EGFR-TKI treatment were studied. Results: Metformin use was significantly associated with a reduced risk of death (hazard ratio: 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.85, P <.001), as well as a significantly longer median progression-free survival (9.2 months, 95% CI: 8.6-11.7, vs 6.4 months, 95% CI: 5.9-7.2 months, P <.001) and median overall survival (33.4 months, 95% CI: 29.4-40.2, vs 25.4 months, 95% CI: 23.7-27.2 months, P < 0.001). Conclusions: In conclusion, metformin may potentially enhance the therapeutic effect and increase survival in type 2 DM patients with lung cancer receiving EGFR-TKI therapy. ?

"Involuntary smoking and the risk of head and neck cancer in an East Asian population","2019","Background: Although tobacco involuntary smoking is an established risk factor for lung cancer, the association with head and neck cancer (HNC) is not established. We aimed to investigate this potential association in an East Asian population. Methods: We conducted a multicenter case-control study in East Asia including eight centers. We restricted our analysis to never tobacco smokers (303 cases and 459 controls) and to never tobacco smokers/never alcohol drinkers (243 cases and 403 controls). Results: Among never tobacco smokers, involuntary smoking was associated with a 1.47-fold increase in risk of HNC (95%CI = 1.02, 2.13) and a 1.8-fold increase in the risk of oral cavity cancer (95%CI = 1.14, 2.92). Among never tobacco smokers who were also never alcohol drinkers, increased risks were detected for more than 3 h per day of involuntary smoking exposure and for 15 or more years of exposure. A dose-response relation was suggested for frequency of exposure (p for trend = 0.014) and for years of exposure (p for trend = 0.010) for oral cavity cancer. We did not detect strong increases in the risk of the other HNC subsites. Conclusions: Our study supports the association between involuntary smoking and the risk of HNC. The association may be stronger for oral cavity cancer than for other HNC subsites. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; cancer risk; case control study; controlled study; East Asian; female; head and neck cancer; human; hypopharynx cancer; larynx cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth cancer; oropharynx cancer; passive smoking; priority journal; smoking; tongue cancer; tonsil cancer; uvula"
"Primary malignant epithelioid and rhabdoid tumor of bone harboring ZNF532-NUTM1 fusion: the expanding NUT cancer family","2019","NUTM1 gene rearrangement is the genetic hallmark of NUT carcinoma, an aggressive tumor that most commonly affects the thoracic and head and neck regions and often exhibits squamous differentiation. The most common fusion partner gene is BRD4, followed by BRD3 and NSD3. Recently, NUTM1 gene rearrangement has been identified in rare tumors from soft tissues, intracranial locations, and other visceral organs. These tumors often show high grade malignant epithelioid to round cell histomorphology and lack evidence of squamous and/or epithelial differentiation. Therefore, their relationship with classic NUT carcinoma is still uncertain. Here, we present a primary mandible bone tumor of a 21-year-old female exhibiting monotonous epithelioid and rhabdoid cytomorphology, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. The initial immunohistochemical workup was non-specific, showing only CD34 positivity while being negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), EMA, p63, etc. INI-1 expression was retained. RNA sequencing was performed and identified a rare ZNF532-NUTM1 gene fusion, which had only been reported in a single case of pulmonary NUT carcinoma. The fusion was confirmed by FISH for NUTM1 gene rearrangement and supported by diffuse and strong NUT immunoreactivity. MYC mRNA up-regulation and immunoreactivity, a common finding in NUT carcinoma, was also observed in this tumor, suggesting a possible common pathogenetic mechanism and potential treatment target. The patient presented with a non-metastatic disease status and received hemimandibulectomy, selective neck dissection (level Ib), and post-operative radiation therapy. She remained disease free 3.6 years after the initial diagnosis. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","CD34 antigen; adjuvant radiotherapy; adult; Article; case report; clinical article; female; fibula graft; fluorescence in situ hybridization; fusion gene; gene; gene fusion; gene rearrangement; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; mandible resection; mandible tumor; neck dissection; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; NUTM1 gene; oncogene myc; priority journal; rhabdoid tumor; RNA sequence; surgical margin; young adult; ZNF532 NUTM1 fusion gene"
"TBC1D24-TLDc-related epilepsy exercise-induced dystonia: rescue by antioxidants in a disease model","2019","Genetic mutations in TBC1D24 have been associated with multiple phenotypes, with epilepsy being the main clinical manifestation. The TBC1D24 protein consists of the unique association of a Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain and a TBC/lysin motif domain/catalytic (TLDc) domain. More than 50 missense and loss-of-function mutations have been described and are spread over the entire protein. Through whole genome/exome sequencing we identified compound heterozygous mutations, R360H and G501R, within the TLDc domain, in an index family with a Rolandic epilepsy exercise-induced dystonia phenotype (http://omim.org/entry/608105). A 20-year long clinical follow-up revealed that epilepsy was self-limited in all three affected patients, but exercise-induced dystonia persisted into adulthood in two. Furthermore, we identified three additional sporadic paediatric patients with a remarkably similar phenotype, two of whom had compound heterozygous mutations consisting of an in-frame deletion I81_K84 and an A500V mutation, and the third carried T182M and G511R missense mutations, overall revealing that all six patients harbour a missense mutation in the subdomain of TLDc between residues 500 and 511. We solved the crystal structure of the conserved Drosophila TLDc domain. This allowed us to predict destabilizing effects of the G501R and G511R mutations and, to a lesser degree, of R360H and potentially A500V. Next, we characterized the functional consequences of a strong and a weak TLDc mutation (TBC1D24G501R and TBC1D24R360H) using Drosophila, where TBC1D24/Skywalker regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking. In a Drosophila model neuronally expressing human TBC1D24, we demonstrated that the TBC1D24G501R TLDc mutation causes activity-induced locomotion and synaptic vesicle trafficking defects, while TBC1D24R360H is benign. The neuronal phenotypes of the TBC1D24G501R mutation are consistent with exacerbated oxidative stress sensitivity, which is rescued by treating TBC1D24G501R mutant animals with antioxidants N-acetylcysteine amide or α-tocopherol as indicated by restored synaptic vesicle trafficking levels and sustained behavioural activity. Our data thus show that mutations in the TLDc domain of TBC1D24 cause Rolandic-type focal motor epilepsy and exercise-induced dystonia. The humanized TBC1D24G501R fly model exhibits sustained activity and vesicle transport defects. We propose that the TBC1D24/Sky TLDc domain is a reactive oxygen species sensor mediating synaptic vesicle trafficking rates that, when dysfunctional, causes a movement disorder in patients and flies. The TLDc and TBC domain mutations' response to antioxidant treatment we observed in the animal model suggests a potential for combining antioxidant-based therapeutic approaches to TBC1D24-associated disorders with previously described lipid-altering strategies for TBC domain mutations. ?

"The self-care coping process in patients with chronic heart failure: A qualitative study","2019","Aim: To understand the self-care coping process among chronic heart failure patients. Background: Previous studies have been carried out to understand the experience and the challenges of living with chronic heart failure. However, the coping processes that patients use to overcome self-care challenges are less understood. Design: A qualitative design with qualitative content analysis of data was employed. Methods: Purposive sampling was conducted to recruit inpatients with chronic heart failure between March 1, 2014–March 1, 2015, in a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Semi-structured interviews (N?=?27) were completed, and a content analysis was performed using an inductive method to explore the self-care coping processes in patients with chronic heart failure. Results: The findings were categorised into three themes: (a) responding to chronic heart failure self-care (dealing with negative emotions, accepting reality and struggling between a self-care regime and self preference), (b) finding ways to live with chronic heart failure (enhancing understanding and knowledge about chronic heart failure, maintaining outer and inner self, engaging positively/negatively with others and relying on religious thoughts and seeking consolation) and (c) reinterpreting chronic heart failure and performing meaning-oriented coping (re-evaluating the meaning of life, assigning a new perspective for chronic heart failure and discovering a deeper meaning behind it). Conclusion: Self-appearance concerns should be given more attention by healthcare professionals. Meaning-oriented coping was found to be helpful to cope with the challenges of chronic heart failure. Thus, there is a need to develop interventions associated with meaning-oriented coping to enhance coping strategies for chronic heart failure patients. Relevance to clinical practice: It is suggested for healthcare professionals to understand an individual's coping process and support people with chronic heart failure who struggle with self-care coping. Furthermore, specific interventions including meaning-oriented interventions might benefit people with chronic heart failure to cope more successfully. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; aged; body image; chronic disease; coping behavior; female; heart failure; human; male; middle aged; psychology; qualitative research; self care; Taiwan; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Body Image; Chronic Disease; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Self Care; Taiwan"
"Chronic viral hepatitis signifies the association of premixed insulin analogues with liver cancer risks: A nationwide population-based study","2019","This study sought to determine whether chronic hepatitis B or C would modify the association between insulin analogues and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risks. We conducted a nationwide nested case-control study for HCC cases and matched controls from 2003 to 2013 among newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients on any antidiabetic agents in Taiwan before and after exclusion of chronic viral hepatitis, respectively. A total of 5832 and 1237 HCC cases were identified before and after exclusion of chronic viral hepatitis, respectively. Incident HCC risks were positively associated with any use of premixed insulin analogues (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.27; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.55) among total participants, especially among current users (adjusted OR, 1.45; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.89). However, the association between HCC occurrence and premixed insulin analogues diminished among participants without chronic viral hepatitis (adjusted OR, 1.35; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.98). We also observed a significant multiplicative interaction between chronic viral hepatitis and premixed insulin analogues on HCC risks (P = 0.010). Conclusions: Chronic viral hepatitis signifies the role of premixed insulin analogues in HCC oncogenesis. We recommend a closer liver surveillance among patients prescribed premixed insulin analogues with concomitant chronic viral hepatitis. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Quantitative diagnosis of rotator cuff tears based on sonographic pattern recognition","2019","The lifetime prevalence of shoulder pain is nearly 70% and is mostly attributable to subacromial disorders. A rotator cuff tear is the most severe form of subacromial disorders, and most occur in the supraspinatus. For clinical examination, shoulder ultrasound is recommended to detect supraspinatus tears. In this study, a computer-aided tear classification (CTC) system was developed to identify supraspinatus tears in ultrasound examinations and reduce inter-operator variability. The observed cases included 89 ultrasound images of supraspinatus tendinopathy and 102 of supraspinatus tear from 136 patients. For each case, intensity and texture features were extracted from the entire lesion and combined in a binary logistic regression classifier for lesion classification. The proposed CTC system achieved an accuracy rate of 92% (176/191) and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) of 0.9694. Based on its diagnostic performance, the CTC system has promise for clinical use. ? 2019 Public Library of Science.

"Increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders in children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) receiving sensory integration therapy: a population-based cohort study","2019","Parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been found to prefer sensory integration (SI) training rather than guideline-recommended ADHD treatment. This study investigated whether SI intervention for children with ADHD was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent mental disorders. From children < 8-years-old newly diagnosed with ADHD in a nationwide population-based dataset, we established a SI cohort and a non-SI cohort (N?= 1945) matched by propensity score. Incidence and hazard ratios of subsequent psychiatric disorders were compared after a maximum follow-up of 9?years. The incidence of psychiatric disorders was 1.4-fold greater in the SI cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.41 (95% confidence interval 1.20–1.67), comparing to the non-SI cohort. Risks were elevated for emotional disturbances, conduct disorders, and adjustment disorders independent of age, gender, or comorbidity. Among children with only psychosocial intervention, the incidence of psychiatric disorders was 3.5-fold greater in the SI cohort than in the non-SI cohort. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders for children with ADHD who received SI compared to those who did not. Potential adverse effects of SI for ADHD children should be carefully examined and discussed before practice. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adjustment disorder; Article; attention deficit disorder; child; cohort analysis; conduct disorder; controlled study; emotional disorder; female; follow up; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; mental disease; occupational therapy; population research; preschool child; risk assessment; school child; sensory integration therapy; adolescent; attention deficit disorder; behavior therapy; child parent relation; comorbidity; conduct disorder; mental disease; mood disorder; proportional hazards model; psychology; risk factor; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Behavior Therapy; Child; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Conduct Disorder; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Mental Disorders; Mood Disorders; Parents; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors"
"The spectrum of 45,X/46,XY mosaicism in Taiwanese children: The experience of a single center","2019","Background/Purpose: 45,X/46,XY mosaicism is a rare sex chromosome abnormality. Here, we present our experience in the management of 45,X/46,XY Taiwanese children. Patients and Methods: We enrolled 19 patients from January 1981 to September 2016. The diagnosis of 45,X/46,XY mosaicism was made by karyotyping peripheral blood lymphocytes. All medical records were thoroughly reviewed. Results: Of the 19 patients, 16 were reared as females and 3 as males. The age at diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 15 years and 9 months. Atypical genitalia, short stature, and Turner stigmata were common manifestations. No patient exhibited a cardiac malformation but 29% had renal malformations and 12.5% had autoimmune thyroid disease who developed thyroid dysfunction later. Nine girls with short stature received growth hormone therapy and their height standard deviation score rose from ?3.4 ± 1.1 to ?1.4 ± 0.9 in adulthood (P < 0.01). The gonadal phenotypes included bilateral streak gonads in nine patients, a streak gonad with contralateral gonadal agenesis in one, mixed gonadal dysgenesis in five, bilateral dysgenetic testes in two, and bilateral gonadoblastomas in one. Conclusion: The 45,X/46,XY phenotype varies widely and a high index of suspicion is important to ensure early diagnosis. Cardiac and renal malformations should be screened ultrasonically at diagnosis and thyroid status should be monitored annually. Growth hormone effectively improves adult height in short girls. Prophylactic gonadectomy is indicated for those with intra-abdominal streaks or dysgenetic gonads to prevent the development of a malignancy. ? 2018","estrogen; growth hormone; growth hormone; 45,X/46,XY mosaicism; adolescent; adulthood; Article; autoimmune thyroiditis; child; clinical article; clitoromegaly; cryptorchism; estrogen therapy; female; genital system disease; gonadal agenesis; gonadectomy; hormonal therapy; human; human cell; human tissue; hypospadias; infant; karyotyping; kidney malformation; male; mixed gonadal dysgenesis; peripheral lymphocyte; phenotype; preschool child; short stature; Taiwanese; thyroid disease; Turner syndrome; body height; disorder of sex development; genetics; gonadoblastoma; mosaicism; Taiwan; Adolescent; Body Height; Child; Child, Preschool; Disorders of Sex Development; Female; Gonadal Dysgenesis, Mixed; Gonadoblastoma; Growth Hormone; Humans; Infant; Karyotyping; Male; Mosaicism; Taiwan; Turner Syndrome"
"Statins improve the long-term prognosis in patients who have survived sepsis: A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan (STROBE complaint)","2019","Most patients diagnosed with sepsis died during their first episode, with the long-term survival rate upon post-sepsis discharge being low. Major adverse cardiovascular events and recurrent infections were regarded as the major causes of death. No definite medications had proven to be effective in improving the long-term prognosis. We aimed to examine the benefits of statins on the long-term prognosis of patients who had survived sepsis.Between 1999 and 2013, a total of 220,082 patients who had been hospitalized due to the first episode of sepsis were included, with 134,448 (61.09%) of them surviving to discharge. The surviving patients who were subsequently prescribed statins at a concentration of more than 30 cumulative Defined Daily Doses (cDDDs) during post-sepsis discharge were defined as the users of statin.After a propensity score matching ratio of 1:5, a total of 7356 and 36,780 surviving patients were retrieved for the study (statin users) and comparison cohort (nonstatin users), respectively. The main outcome was to determine the long-term survival rate during post-sepsis discharge.HR with 95% CI was calculated using the Cox regression model to evaluate the effectiveness of statins, with further stratification analyses according to cDDDs.The users of statins had an adjusted HR of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.27-0.31) in their long-term mortality rate when compared with the comparison cohort. For the users of statins with cDDDs of 30-180, 180-365, and >365, the adjusted HRs were 0.32, 0.22, and 0.16, respectively, (95% CI, 0.30-0.34, 0.19-0.26, and 0.12-0.23, respectively), as compared with the nonstatins users (defined as the use of statins <30 cDDDs during post-sepsis discharge), with the P for trend <.0001. In the sensitivity analysis, after excluding the surviving patients who had died between 3 and 6 months after post-sepsis discharge, the adjusted HR for the users of statins remained significant (0.35, 95% CI 0.32-0.37 and 0.42, 95% CI 0.39-0.45, respectively).Statins may have the potential to decrease the long-term mortality of patients who have survived sepsis.

"Calreticulin regulates MYCN expression to control neuronal differentiation and stemness of neuroblastoma","2019","Oncogenic N-MYC (MYCN) is widely used as a biomarker in clinics for neuroblastoma (NB) patients; nevertheless, mechanism that underlines MYCN regulation remains elusive. In the present study, we identified calreticulin (CRT) as a novel MYCN suppressor that downregulated MYCN promoter activity and protein expression to modulate neuronal differentiation and stemness. Our data showed that CRT-mediated MYCN suppression led to increased neurite length and commensurate elevation in differentiation marker GAP-43. We examined effect of radiotherapy and discovered that ionizing radiation (IR) was able to augment CRT expression dose-dependently in NB. Interestingly, neuronal differentiation and neurosphere formation (NSF) of NB were not only co-modulated by IR and CRT but were also dependent on Ca 2+ -buffering domain (C-domain) of CRT. Mutagenesis analysis showed that C-domain was indispensable for CRT-mediated MYCN regulation in NB differentiation and NSF. Of note, IR-induced formation of neural stem-like neurospheres (NS) was significantly impaired in CRT-overexpressed NB cells. The occupancy of CRT on MYCN 5′ proximal promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, revealing potential CRT binding sites that coincided with transcription factor E2F1 binding elements. In addition, we identified a physical interaction between CRT and E2F1, and demonstrated that CRT occupancy on MYCN promoter prevented E2F1-mediated MYCN upregulation. In line with in vitro findings, hampered tumor latency and retarded tumor growth in xenograft model corroborated IR and CRT co-mediated neuronal differentiation of NB. Together, our data delineated a novel mechanism of CRT-mediated MYCN regulation and warranted further preclinical investigation towards new therapeutic strategy for NB. CRT suppresses MYCN expression and promotes neuronal differentiation in NB. CRT regulates MYCN via interaction with E2F1 and direct binding to MYCN promoter. Ca 2+ -buffering domain of CRT is critical in MYCN regulation and NB differentiation. CRT-MYCN axis impacts on NB stemness by modulating neurosphere formation. Xenograft model corroborates in vitro NB differentiation mediated by CRT and IR. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","calcium ion; calreticulin; N Myc proto oncogene protein; neuromodulin; transcription factor E2F1; 5' untranslated region; animal experiment; animal model; Article; binding site; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer stem cell; chromatin immunoprecipitation; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; ionizing radiation; mouse; mutagenesis; nerve cell differentiation; neurite; neurite outgrowth; neuroblastoma; neuroblastoma cell line; nonhuman; oncogene c myb; promoter region; protein expression; protein protein interaction; receptor down regulation; SK-N-BE(2) cell line; SK-N-SH cell line; tumor growth; tumor suppressor gene; tumor xenograft"
"Allergy accelerates the disease progression of chronic rhinosinusitis","2019","Background: The role of allergy in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in East Asians is not clear. Aims/objectives: The aim was to investigate the impact of allergies in the clinical characteristics of chronic rhinosinusitis. Material and methods: A total of 138 CRS patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery were included. A brief history of rhinosinusitis symptoms, blood eosinophil count, blood-specific allergen tests, computed tomography (CT) scan findings, Lund-Mackay (LM) CT scores, and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) Questionnaire scores, and sinoscopy findings at 3 and 6?months postoperatively. Results: The ImmunoCAP test was positive in 71(51%) patients and negative in 67(49%) patients. The mean age of those who received endoscopic sinus surgery was 7-years younger in the allergic group compared with the non-allergic group (p =.008). The peripheral eosinophil count in the allergic group was higher than that of the non-allergic group (p =.008). The LM scores and SNOT-22 scores were not significantly different between the two groups. The recurrence rate of nasal polyps in the allergic group was higher but without statistical significance. Conclusions and significance: Allergy may accelerate the disease progression of CRS.

"Chloramphenicol induces autophagy and inhibits the hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha pathway in non-small cell lung cancer cells","2019","Chloramphenicol is an inexpensive and excellent bactericidal antibiotic. It is used to combat anaerobic infections in the Third World countries, whereas its systemic application has been abandoned in developed countries. However, in recent years, clinicians have reintroduced chloramphenicol in clinical practice. In this study, chloramphenicol was found to repress the oxygen-labile transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), in hypoxic A549 and H1299 cells. Furthermore, it suppressed the mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 1, eventually decreasing VEGF release. Chloramphenicol initiated the autophagy pathway in treated cells, as observed by the increase in formation of Atg12-Atg5 conjugates, and in beclin-1 and LC3-II levels. The chloramphenicol-mediated HIF-1α degradation was completely reverted by autophagic flux blockage. In HIF-1α-overexpressing cells, the formation of HIF-1α/SENP-1 (Sentrin/SUMO-specific protease 1) protein complex seemed to facilitate the escape of HIF-1α from degradation. Chloramphenicol inhibited HIF-1α/SENP-1 protein interaction, thereby destabilizing HIF-1α protein. The enhancement in HIF-1α degradation due to chloramphenicol was evident during the incubation of the antibiotic before hypoxia and after HIF-1α accumulation. Since HIF-1α plays multiple roles in infections, inflammation, and cancer cell stemness, our findings suggest a potential clinical value of chloramphenicol in the treatment of these conditions. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Using a patient-centered approach to identify symptom clusters among adolescents with cancer","2019","Background Prior studies identifying symptom clusters used a symptom-centered approach to demonstrate the relationship among symptoms. Latent profile analysis (LPA) is a patient-centered approach that classifies individuals from a heterogeneous population into homogeneous subgroups, helping prioritize interventions to focus on clusters with the most severe symptom burden. Objective The aim of this study was to use LPA to determine the best-fit models and to identify phenotypes of severe symptom distress profiles for adolescents with cancer who are undergoing treatment and in survivorship. Methods We used estimated means generated by the LPA to predict the probability of an individual symptom occurring across on- and off-treatment groups for 200 adolescents with cancer. Results The 3-profile solution was considered the best fit to the data for both on- and off-treatment groups. Adolescents on treatment and classified into the severe profile were most likely to report distress in appetite, fatigue, appearance, nausea, and concentration. Adolescents off treatment and classified into the severe profile were most likely to report distress in fatigue, pain frequency, and concentration. Conclusions Latent profile analysis provided a cluster methodology that uncovered hidden profiles from observed symptoms. This made it possible to directly compare the phenotypes of severe profiles between different treatment statuses. Implications for Practice The co-occurring 13-item Symptom Distress Scale symptoms found in the severe symptom distress profiles could be used as items in a prespecified severe symptom distress cluster, helping evaluate a patient's risk of developing varying degrees of symptom distress. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Hematinic deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia in gastric parietal cell antibody-positive or gastric and thyroid autoantibodies-negative atrophic glossitis patients","2019","Background/Purpose: Our previous study found that 177 of 1064 atrophic glossitis (AG) patients have serum gastric parietal cell antibody (GPCA) positivity only (so-called GPCA+AG patients). This study assessed whether serum GPCA positivity or AG itself was a significant factor causing hematinic deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia in GPCA+AG or GPCA-negative, thyroglobulin antibody (TGA)-negative, and thyroid microsomal antibody (TMA)-negative AG (GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG) patients. Methods: The mean blood hemoglobin (Hb), iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, and homocysteine levels were measured and compared between any two of three groups of 177 GPCA+AG patients, 476 GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG patients, and 532 healthy control subjects. Results: GPCA+AG patients had significantly lower mean blood Hb and iron (for women only) levels and a significantly higher mean serum homocysteine level than healthy control subjects. Moreover, GPCA+AG patients had significantly greater frequencies of blood Hb, iron, and vitamin B12 deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia than healthy control subjects. GPCA+AG patients have a lower mean serum vitamin B12 level and a significantly higher mean serum homocysteine level as well as significantly greater frequencies of vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia than GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG patients. Moreover, GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG patients did have significantly lower mean blood Hb and iron levels and significantly greater frequencies of blood Hb, iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia than healthy control subjects. Conclusion: The GPCA is a major factor causing vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocyteinemia in GPCA+AG patients. AG itself does play a significant role in causing anemia, hematinic deficiencies, and hyperhomocysteinemia in both GPCA+AG and GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG patients. ? 2019","cyanocobalamin; folic acid; homocysteine; iron; parietal cell antibody; thyroid antibody; autoantibody; cyanocobalamin; folic acid; hemoglobin; iron; thyroid microsomal antibodies; adult; anemia; Article; B12 deficiency; blood cell count; controlled study; female; folic acid blood level; folic acid deficiency; glossitis; hemoglobin blood level; human; hyperhomocysteinemia; iron blood level; iron deficiency anemia; macrocytic anemia; major clinical study; male; megalocytosis; microcytic anemia; microcytosis; pernicious anemia; thalassemia; vitamin blood level; aged; anemia; atrophy; blood; glossitis; hyperhomocysteinemia; immunology; mean corpuscular volume; middle aged; stomach parietal cell; Taiwan; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anemia; Atrophy; Autoantibodies; Erythrocyte Indices; Female; Folic Acid; Glossitis; Hemoglobins; Humans; Hyperhomocysteinemia; Iron; Male; Middle Aged; Parietal Cells, Gastric; Taiwan; Vitamin B 12; Young Adult"
"Tuberculosis among migrant workers in Taiwan","2019","Background: Although the worldwide incidence of tuberculosis (TB) has been slowly decreasing, the migrant workers remains an important gap for regional TB control. In Taiwan, the numbers of the migrant workers from countries with high TB incidence increase significantly in past decades and the impact on public health remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the difference of TB incidence between Taiwanese and the migrant workers. Methods: The migrant workers are obligated to receive pre-arrival, post-arrival and regular chest X-ray screening during their stay in Taiwan. We retrospectively collected these data extracted from the Alien Workers Health Database in Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan from Jan. 1, 2004 to Dec. 31, 2013. Poisson regression models were used to compare the hazard ratios of TB between Taiwanese and the migrant workers after adjusting gender and age groups. Results: The total migrant workers in Taiwan reached 314,034 persons in 2004 and 489,134 persons in 2013, accounting for 2% of Taiwan population. The TB incidence of migrant workers was similar to Taiwanese (53-73.7 per 105 vs 45.5-76.8 per 105). Comparing with Taiwanese, the TB risk was significantly lower in male migrant workers (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70-0.83, P &lt; 0.001), but higher in female migrant workers (HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.35-1.46, P &lt; 0.001). Besides, we found that the TB risk in migrant workers was 5.30-fold (95% CI: 4.83-5.83, P &lt; 0.001) in youngest group (?24 year-old) comparing with Taiwanese. Conclusions: Migrant workers in Taiwan have higher TB incidence than Taiwanese in young groups, especially in females. The mainstay young laborers with latent tuberculosis infection risk is an important vulnerability for public health. Further investigation and health screening are warranted. ? 2019 The Author(s).","gender relations; health risk; health services; migrant worker; public health; regression analysis; tuberculosis; young population; adult; Article; female; hazard ratio; human; major clinical study; male; migrant worker; morbidity; Poisson distribution; priority journal; retrospective study; screening; sex difference; Taiwan; Taiwanese; thorax radiography; tuberculosis; incidence; middle aged; migration; statistics and numerical data; tuberculosis; young adult; Taiwan; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Taiwan; Transients and Migrants; Tuberculosis; Young Adult"
"Fluoroquinolones versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Fluoroquinolones are a popular alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections. Objectives: To compare the effects of fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on mortality of S. maltophilia infections. Data sources: PubMed and EMBASE. Study eligibility criteria: Clinical studies reporting mortality outcomes of S. maltophilia infections. Participants: Patients with clinical infections caused by S. maltophilia. Interventions: Fluoroquinolone monotherapy in comparison with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole monotherapy. Methods: Systematic review with meta-analysis technique. Results: Seven retrospective cohort and seven case–control studies were included. Three cohort studies were designed to compare the two drugs, whereas others had other purposes. A total of 663 patients were identified, 332 of which were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (50.1%) and 331 with fluoroquinolones (49.9%). Three cohort studies were designed to compare the effect of the two drugs, whereas the others had other purposes. Levofloxacin was most frequently used among fluoroquinolones (187/331, 56.5%), followed by ciprofloxacin (114/331, 34.4%). The overall mortality rate was 29.6%. Using pooled ORs for the mortality of each study, fluoroquinolone treatment (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39–0.99) was associated with survival benefit over trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment, with low heterogeneity (I 2 = 18%). Specific fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17–1.12) and levofloxacin (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48–1.26) did not show a significant difference in comparison with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In the sub-group analyses of adult and bacteraemic patients, significant differences in mortality were not observed between fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Conclusions: Based on a meta-analysis of non-randomized studies, fluoroquinolones demonstrated comparable effects on mortality of S. maltophilia infection to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, supporting the use of fluoroquinolones in clinical S. maltophilia infections. Although the pooled analysis of overall studies favoured fluoroquinolones over trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the studies included were observational, and sub-group analyses of certain fluoroquinolone agents did not show statistical differences with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Randomized clinical studies are needed to address these issues. ? 2018 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","cotrimoxazole; levofloxacin; quinolone derivative; antiinfective agent; cotrimoxazole; quinolone derivative; antibacterial activity; bacterial infection; comparative effectiveness; disease severity; hospital mortality; human; meta analysis; mortality rate; priority journal; Review; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection; survival; systematic review; adolescent; adult; aged; child; comparative study; drug effect; female; Gram negative infection; infant; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; retrospective study; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; survival analysis; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Fluoroquinolones; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination; Young Adult"
"Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae: An update on therapeutic options","2019","Carbapenems are considered as last-resort antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. With the increasing use of carbapenems in clinical practice, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant pathogens now poses a great threat to human health. Currently, antibiotic options for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are very limited, with polymyxins, tigecycline, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides as the mainstays of therapy. The need for new and effective anti-CRE therapies is urgent. Here, we describe the current understanding of issues related to CRE and review combination therapeutic strategies for CRE infections, including high-dose tigecycline, high-dose prolonged-infusion of carbapenem, and double carbapenem therapy. We also review the newly available antibiotics which have potential in the future treatment of CRE infections: ceftazidime/avibactam, which is active against KPC and OXA-48 producers; meropenem/vaborbactam, which is active against KPC producers; plazomicin, which is a next-generation aminoglycoside with in vitro activity against CRE; and eravacycline, which is a tetracycline class antibacterial with in vitro activity against CRE. Although direct evidence for CRE treatment is still lacking and the development of resistance is a concern, these new antibiotics provide additional therapeutic options for CRE infections. Finally, we review other potential anti-CRE antibiotics in development: imipenem/relebactam and cefiderocol. Currently, high-dose and combination strategies that may include the new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors should be considered in severe CRE infections to maximize treatment success. In the future, when more treatment options are available, therapy for CRE infections should be individualized and based on molecular phenotypes of resistance, susceptibility profiles, disease severity, and patient characteristics. More high-quality studies are needed to guide effective treatment for infections caused by CRE. ? 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Association Between Pioglitazone Use and Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Case-Control Study in the Han Population","2019","To date, few epidemiologic studies have investigated the relationship between pioglitazone use and prostate cancer. The available studies show conflicting findings. This case-control study explored the association between prior pioglitazone usage and prostate cancer using a large, population-based data set. Data were derived from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 in Taiwan, a population-based sample of National Health Insurance enrollees with longitudinal claims data since 1995. Cases were 3513 patients with prostate cancer aged over 40?years, and the controls were 3513 patients without prostate cancer, matched with prostate cancer cases on age, and having a medical care utilization episode in the year of the index prostate cancer (1 control per case). We performed conditional logistic regression to examine the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals for prior pioglitazone use between cases and controls. Analysis showed that 178 of the total sample patients (2.53%) had used pioglitazone prior to the index date. Prior pioglitazone use was found in 72 (2.05%) cases and 106 (3.02%) controls. The crude odds ratio of prior pioglitazone usage for cases was 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.91) compared to controls. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities, the negative association of prior pioglitazone with prostate cancer persisted (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.80). We concluded that there was an inverse association between prior pioglitazone usage and prostate cancer in this study. ? 2018, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology","pioglitazone; adult; aged; cancer control; case control study; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; drug use; Han Chinese; health care utilization; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; national health insurance; population based case control study; prostate cancer; very elderly"
"Outcome assessment of apical surgery: A study of 234 teeth","2019","Background/Purpose: Apical surgery is an option for management of endodontically-treated tooth with persistent periapical lesions or symptom and sign. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between the demography, preoperative, postoperative factors and healed rate of apical surgery. Methods: Subjects were retrospectively collected from patients who received apical surgery/apicoectomy at the Endodontic Department, National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2013 to June 2015. The standard apical surgery procedures were performed. The demography, preoperative clinical and radiographic examination data as well as postoperative variables were collected. The outcome assessment was carried out after surgery. Statistical analysis was performed by chi square test to evaluate the potential outcome predictors. Results: Total 187 patients and 234 teeth receiving apical surgery were included. 53 male and 134 female patients were collected. The age was ranged between 17 and 89 years old and the mean age was 43.64 years old. Better healed rate with significant differences were observed in female patient (p < 0.05), age ?60 years old (p < 0.01), preoperative root canal filling material >2 mm short of apex (p < 0.01), lesion size from ?2 mm to ?12 mm (p < 0.05) and follow-up period ≧12 months (p < 0.01) groups. Conclusion: Gender, age, preoperative root canal filling material extent, lesion size and follow-up period may affect the outcome of apical surgery. Tooth type, post, prosthesis, and lesion area showed no marked effect on apical healing. These results provide more detailed information for the clinical practitioners to make treatment plans and are important for clinical endodontic practices. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","root canal filling material; root canal filling material; adolescent; adult; aged; apicoectomy; Article; clinical examination; dental surgery; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; molar tooth; outcome assessment; premolar tooth; preoperative evaluation; retrospective study; root canal obturation; Taiwan; tooth apex; tooth periapical disease; tooth radiography; very elderly; child; diagnostic imaging; tooth apex; tooth pulp disease; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Apicoectomy; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Radiography, Dental; Retrospective Studies; Root Canal Filling Materials; Taiwan; Tooth Apex; Tooth, Nonvital; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Assessment of liver cirrhosis for patients with Child's A classification before hepatectomy using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI","2019","AIM: To determine the feasibility of semi-quantitative haemodynamic parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess liver fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients with Child's A classification (males/females=24/51; average age, 58 years; range, 30–80 years) received DCE-MRI 3 days prior to hepatectomy. Semi-quantitative haemodynamic parameters, including the wash-in slope, wash-out slope, and time-to-peak, were calculated from DCE-MRI data. Liver fibrosis of the resected non-tumour liver was graded pathologically from F0 (no fibrosis) to F6 (cirrhosis) in the regions corresponding to those assessed by DCE-MRI. RESULTS: The wash-out slope showed higher interobserver and intra-observer reliabilities than the wash-in slope and time-to-peak. There was a significant positive correlation between the wash-out slope and pathological grade of fibrosis (Spearman's correlation coefficient: r=0.5331, p<0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.8066 when using the wash-out slope to differentiate cirrhosis (grade F6) from non-cirrhosis (grades F0–5). Using the cut-off point that maximised specificity, the sensitivity was 62.07%, specificity was 91.30%, positive predictive value was 81.81%, negative predictive value was 79.25%, and accuracy was 80%. CONCLUSIONS: The wash-out slope derived from DCE-MRI might be potentially useful in assessing liver cirrhosis in patients with Child's A classification before hepatectomy. ? 2019","gadolinium pentetate meglumine; adult; aged; Article; clinical assessment; contrast enhancement; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; fatty liver; female; hemodynamic parameters; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; image analysis; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; liver hemangioma; liver resection; major clinical study; male; practice guideline; predictive value; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly"
"Functional correlates of resting-state connectivity in the default mode network of heroin users on methadone treatment and medication-free therapeutic community program","2019","The treatment of heroin addiction is a complex process involving changes in addictive behavior and brain functioning. The goal of this study was to explore the brain default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and decision-making performance based on the Cambridge gambling task in heroin-dependent individuals undergoing methadone treatment (MT, n = 11) and medication-free faith-based therapeutic community program (TC, n = 11). The DMN involved the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left inferior parietal lobe (IPLL), right inferior parietal lobe (IPLR), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) subregions for all participants inboth the MT and TC groups. Compared with MT, TC had an increased functional connectivity in IPLL-IPLR and IPLR-PCC and decreased functional connectivity in mPFC-IPLL and IPLL-PCC. Both groups exhibited no significant difference in the regional rs-fMRI metric [i.e., amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)]. In the analysis of the neural correlates for decision-making performance, risk adjustment was positively associated with ALFF in IPLL for all participants considering the group effects. The involvement of IPL in decision-making performance and treatment response among heroin-dependent patients warrants further investigation.

"Relationships between body image, sexual dysfunction, and health-related quality of life among middle-aged women: A cross-sectional study","2019","Objectives: To examine whether body image, sexual function, and relationship with a partner influence health-related quality of life (HRQoL)among middle-aged women, as well as to identify the association with menopausal symptoms. Main outcome measures: Physical component summary and mental component summary of HRQoL. Methods: This was an analysis of 1026 women (2013–2014); data regarding demographic characteristics, sexual function, body image, relationship with partner, menopausal symptoms and HRQoL during middle age were collected. HRQoL, sexual function, body image, relationship with partner, and menopausal symptoms were measured using the Medical Outcomes Study SF-12, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scale, the Relationship Assessment Scale, and the Greene Climacteric Scale, respectively. A multivariate regression was used to examine factors influencing HRQoL. Results: After adjusting for covariates, significant factors predicting the physical component summary (PCS)of HRQoL among middle-aged women included the orgasm domain of the FSFI (β = 0.69; p = 0.023), appearance evaluation (β = 0.93; p = 0.037), and menopausal symptoms (β = ?0.25; p < 0.001). The factors predicting the mental component summary (MCS)of HRQoL included the satisfaction domain of the FSFI (β = 0.70; p = 0.014), appearance evaluation (β = 2.09; p < 0.001), self-classified weight (β = 1.21; p < 0.001), relationship with partner (β = 0.16; p = 0.034), and menopausal symptoms (β = ?0.36; p < 0.001). Conclusion: The results indicated that negative appearance evaluation and menopausal symptoms predicted poor HRQoL among middle-aged women. Higher frequency of orgasm predicted better PCS; sexual satisfaction and satisfaction with relationship with a partner predicted better MCS of HRQoL. ? 2019","adult; alcohol consumption; Article; body image; body mass; chronic disease; cross-sectional study; dyspareunia; educational status; employment status; exercise; female; female sexual dysfunction; Female Sexual Function Index; gynecologic disease; hormonal therapy; household income; human; hysterectomy; major clinical study; marriage; menopausal syndrome; menopause; middle aged; orgasm; ovariectomy; personal income; quality of life; sexual arousal; sexual function; sexual satisfaction; Short Form 12; vaginal lubrication; aged; questionnaire; satisfaction; sexual dysfunction; sexuality; Adult; Aged; Body Image; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Menopause; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Sexual Partners; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"The role of GRHL2 and epigenetic remodeling in epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity in ovarian cancer cells","2019","Cancer cells exhibit phenotypic plasticity during epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) involving intermediate states. To study genome-wide epigenetic remodeling associated with EMT plasticity, we integrate the analyses of DNA methylation, ChIP-sequencing of five histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27Ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3) and transcriptome profiling performed on ovarian cancer cells with different epithelial/mesenchymal states and on a knockdown model of EMT suppressor Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2). We have identified differentially methylated CpG sites associated with EMT, found at promoters of epithelial genes and GRHL2 binding sites. GRHL2 knockdown results in CpG methylation gain and nucleosomal remodeling (reduction in permissive marks H3K4me3 and H3K27ac; elevated repressive mark H3K27me3), resembling the changes observed across progressive EMT states. Epigenetic-modifying agents such as 5-azacitidine, GSK126 and mocetinostat further reveal cell state-dependent plasticity upon GRHL2 overexpression. Overall, we demonstrate that epithelial genes are subject to epigenetic control during intermediate phases of EMT/MET involving GRHL2. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Prevalence and risk factors for colonization by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing or ST 131 escherichia coli among asymptomatic adults in community settings in Southern Taiwan","2019","Purpose: Fecal carriage of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) is common in Asia, especially in China and Southeast Asia. There are no data about fecal carriage of ESBL-EC and mcr-1-positive E. coli in Taiwan, and few studies focusing on the risk factors of asymptomatic fecal carriage of epidemic ST131 E. coli have been published. Patients and methods: From healthy inhabitants attending health examinations at a medical center in southern Taiwan in 2017, we collected 724 stool samples, which were examined for ESBL-EC fecal carriage using chromogenic medium. ST131 and mcr1-positive E. coli were also investigated using multiplex PCR. Clinical data from all participating adults were collected to analyze the risk factors for fecal ESBL-EC or ST131 E. coli carriage. Results: The prevalence rate of asymptomatic ESBL-EC fecal carriage in adults was 1.9% (14/724). ST131 was found in 22 (3.0%) adults and mcr-1-positive E. coli was found in three (0.4%) adults. A multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with ESBL-EC carriage were diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–22.7), a history of colonic polyps (aOR: 6.4, 95% CI: 1.6–24.9), and chronic renal insufficiency (aOR: 20.7, 95% CI: 1.4–305.7). Underlying cancer (aOR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.0–22.5) and stroke (aOR: 18.0, 95% CI: 1.6–207.5) were associated with ST131 E. coli fecal carriage. In our cohort, travel to Asian countries and food habit were not associated with ST131 or ESBL-EC fecal carriage. Conclusions: The ESBL-EC or ST131 E. coli fecal carriage rate is low among asymptomatic adults in Taiwan. Certain underlying medical conditions were associated with their fecal carriage. ? 2019 Wu et al.","adult; Article; asymptomatic disease; bacterial colonization; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium identification; cerebrovascular accident; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; colon polyp; community assessment; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; epidemic; Escherichia coli infection; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Escherichia coli; feces analysis; female; human; male; malignant neoplasm; mcr 1 gene; medical history; multivariate analysis; prevalence; risk factor; Taiwan"

"Real-world effectiveness and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in Asian patients with chronic hepatitis C","2019","Background: Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) is a pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Real-world data of GLE/PIB in Asian patients other than Japanese are limited. We thus investigated the effectiveness and safety profile of GLE/PIB in Taiwanese patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Methods: CHC patients who received 8, 12, or 16 weeks of GLE/PIB between August and October of 2018 were consecutively enrolled. The treatment duration was determined according to drug label. The hepatic fibrosis was staged according to liver histology, transient elastography, fibrosis index based on 4 factors (FIB-4), or findings of ultrasonography/endoscopy. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response at week 12 off therapy (SVR12). The safety profiles were also assessed. Results: A total of 110 CHC patients with 51% of males were enrolled. The median age was 70 years. A majority (82%) of patients were infected with HCV genotype 2. Forty-six (42%) and 64 (58%) patients had advanced hepatic fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis, respectively. Forty-five (41%) non-cirrhotic patients were treated for 8 weeks. The overall SVR12 rates were 100%, regardless of baseline clinical characteristics. The common adverse events (AEs) were pruritus (12%), anorexia (6%), and fatigue (5%). Nine (8%) serious AEs unrelated to GLE/PIB occurred. Three (2%) patients had Grade 3 elevation of total bilirubin level. None had premature treatment termination, hepatic decompensation, or death. Conclusion: Interferon-free GLE/PIB regimen is highly effective and safe for Asian chronic hepatitis C patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","bilirubin; glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir; abdominal infection; adult; aged; anorexia; antiviral therapy; Article; Asian; bacteremia; chronic hepatitis C; cohort analysis; compensated liver cirrhosis; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug safety; echography; fatigue; female; femur fracture; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; human; liver fibrosis; liver histology; major clinical study; male; pruritus; retrospective study; salmonellosis; side effect; sustained virologic response; Taiwanese; transient elastography; treatment duration; unspecified side effect"
"Antiplatelet, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects of hydroquinone","2019","Platelets play crucial roles in thrombosis and hemostasis through platelet activation and aggregation that are crucial in cardiovascular diseases. Hydroquinone (HQ) and its derivatives are present in many dermatological creams, paints, motor fuels, air, microorganisms, and plant products like wheat bread, fruit, coffee, and red wine. The effect of HQ on humans is not clear. In this study, we found that HQ (>25 μM) inhibited arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation. HQ suppressed AA-induced thromboxane B2 production of platelets. HQ (>10 μM) also attenuated ex vivo platelet-rich plasma aggregation. HQ prevented the interleukin (IL)-1β-induced 8-isoprostane, and PGE2 production, but not IL-8 production of pulp cells. These results indicate that HQ may have an antiplatelet effect via inhibition of thromboxane production. HQ has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, and possible inhibition of COX. Exposure and consumption of HQ-containing products, food or drugs may have antiplatelet, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; antithrombocytic agent; arachidonic acid; cyclooxygenase 2; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; hydroquinone; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 8; isoprostane derivative; prostaglandin E2; thromboxane; thromboxane B2; animal cell; animal experiment; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; antiplatelet activity; Article; bread; cardiovascular system; coffee; cream; cytotoxicity; drug use; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; ex vivo study; food intake; fruit; IC50; mouse; nonhuman; plant product; platelet aggregation assay; priority journal; protein expression; red wine; thrombocyte; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte function; thrombocyte rich plasma; tooth pulp; Western blotting; wheat"
"Correlations between visual acuity and macular microvasculature quantified with optical coherence tomography angiography in diabetic macular oedema","2019","Purpose: To explore the impact of macular ischaemia on vision in diabetic macular oedema (DMO) by analysing the correlations between visual acuity and macular microvascular parameters using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods: OCTA was performed in 81 eyes of 48 patients with DMO, and 3 × 3-mm2 en face OCTA images of the superficial capillary plexus and deep capillary plexus in the central macula were retrospectively collected. Microvascular parameters including the number of microaneurysms, area of foveal avascular zone (FAZ), acircularity index of FAZ, vessel density, skeleton density, vessel density index and fractal dimension were measured. Central retinal thickness (CRT) and the presence of ellipsoid zone disruption at the fovea were also recorded. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the correlations between best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and the microvascular parameters. Results: After adjustment for CRT and ellipsoid zone disruption at the fovea, lower skeleton density and lower fractal dimension in the deep capillary plexus were correlated with poorer BCVA (P = 0.030 and 0.024, respectively). None of the microvascular parameters of the superficial capillary plexus were correlated with BCVA after adjustment for CRT and ellipsoid zone disruption (all, P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: For eyes with DMO, low skeleton density and low branching complexity in the deep capillary plexus of central macula were correlated with poor vision. OCTA could offer quantified parameters of macular microvasculature to measure the impact of macular ischaemia on visual acuity in DMO. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.",""

Results: A total of 336 participants (118 uninfected contacts, 105 LTBI, 113 active TB) were included. The concordance rate of QFT-GIT and QFT-Plus was high (n = 300, 89.3%). The kappa value was 0.811 among contacts and 0.708 among active TB. While TB1 and TB2 quantitative responses were not different between active TB and LTBI (TB1: 1.74 ± 2.73 IU/ml vs. 2.03 ± 2.28 IU/ml, p = 0.403; TB2: 2.21 ± 3.09 IU/ml vs. 2.15 ± 2.40 IU/ml, p = 0.867), CD8 response was higher in active TB than LTBI (0.47 ± 1.53 IU/ml vs. ?0.06 ± 1.47 IU/ml, p = 0.011). Culture-confirmed TB had a higher CD8 response compared with LTBI (0.63 ± 1.74 IU/ml vs. ?0.05 ± 1.47 IU/ml, p = 0.004). Conclusions: This study demonstrated specific CD8 responses among uninfected contacts, LTBI as well as active TB. ? 2019","CD8 antigen; tuberculostatic agent; adult; aged; Article; bacterium culture; controlled study; female; human; immune response; intermethod comparison; latent tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; population research; prospective study; quantitative analysis; Taiwan; treatment response; very elderly"

"Patients with head and neck cancer may need more intensive pain management to maintain daily functioning: a multi-center study","2019","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of pain, pain management, and impact of recent pain on daily functioning in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) and patients with other cancers. Methods: This multi-center survey was conducted by using Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire to evaluate pain status and its impact on daily functioning. Results: A total of 3289 patients were analyzed including 708 HNC patients and 2581 patients with other cancers. The overall pain prevalence was 69.17%. A higher percentage of HNC patients had recent pain (60.59 vs. 44.01%, P < 0.001), required pain management (86.29 vs. 72.03%, P < 0.001), and used any analgesics (53.81 vs. 34.52%, P < 0.001). HNC patients with pain management had a higher prevalence of recent pain (85.83 vs. 81.14%, P = 0.044) and a slightly lower satisfaction rate (74.00 vs. 79.70%, P = 0.070). Regarding the impact of pain on daily functioning, HNC patients had a lower mean interference score for general activity such as walking, normal work, sleep, and life enjoyment. Conclusions: The HNC patients may need more intensive pain management to achieve optimal pain control and maintain daily functioning. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","analgesic agent; adult; aged; analgesia; Article; bone; brain; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer pain; cancer patient; disease course; distant metastasis; female; head and neck cancer; human; life; liver; lung; lymph node; major clinical study; male; metastasis; multicenter study; pain intensity; pain severity; patient satisfaction; prevalence; priority journal; residential area; sleep; soft tissue; Taiwan; tumor invasion; tumor localization; walking; work; analgesia; cancer pain; clinical trial; daily life activity; head and neck tumor; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; quality of life; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Activities of Daily Living; Cancer Pain; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Management; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"

"Echinocandins as alternative treatment for HIV-infected patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia","2019","Objectives:Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is often associated with adverse effects. Echinocandins, by inhibiting the cyst form of Pneumocystis jirovecii, may be an alternative therapy for PCP. However, clinical experience with echinocandins in the treatment of PCP remains limited among HIV-infected patients.Methods:From August 2013 to April 2018, data of HIV-infected patients with confirmed PCP who received echinocandins as alternative treatment because of intolerance or unresponsiveness to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were retrospectively reviewed to assess the effectiveness and safety of echinocandins alone or in combination with other agents.Results:In total, 34 patients were included, with a median CD4+ count of 27cells/μl [interquartile range (IQR), 20-93). Twenty-four patients (70.6%) presented with moderate-To-severe PCP. The most common adverse effects leading to withdrawal of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were hepatotoxicity (29.4%), gastrointestinal upset (23.5%), and rash (17.6%). Nine patients (26.5%) were switched to echinocandins after failure of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The median interval before switch from trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to echinocandins was 9.0 days (IQR 5.0-14.0). The all-cause and PCP-related in-hospital mortality rate of patients receiving echinocandins as alternative therapy was 20.6% (7/34) and 14.7% (5/34), respectively. The all-cause in-hospital mortality was 0% in mild PCP cases and 29% (7/24) in moderate-To-severe PCP cases. Patients who had failed to respond to first-line trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment tended to have a higher in-hospital mortality rate than those without first-line trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole failure (44.4% versus 12.0%, P=0.06).Conclusion:Echinocandin therapy might serve as an alternative option for HIV-infected patients with PCP who are intolerable to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Mining sequential patterns of diseases contracted and medications prescribed before the development of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome in Taiwan","2019","Medication is designed to cure diseases, but serious risks can arise from severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs can lead to emergency room visits and hospitalization, straining healthcare resources and, thus, they have strong implications for public health. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is one ADR and comprises the highest proportion of all drug relief cases in Taiwan. Pharmacovigilance involves the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention of ADRs, including SJS. Most medical specialists are not fully aware of the risk of drug-induced SJS. Consequently, various drugs may be prescribed to susceptible patients for a great variety of diseases and, in turn, cause SJS. In this research, medical records of SJS patients were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, and the Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) algorithm was used to find the sequential patterns of diseases before SJS onset. Then we mined the sequential patterns of medications prescribed in each disease pattern. Afterwards, we detected significant associations of each pattern of diseases and medications prescribed among age groups with statistical analysis. We found that, first, most patients developed SJS after being prescribed the causative medications fewer than four times. Second, Respiratory System Diseases (RSDs) appeared in disease sequential patterns of all lengths. Patterns involving RSDs were more frequent than others. Third, NSAIDs, H2-antagonists for peptic ulcer, penicillin antibiotics, theophylline bronchodilators, and cephalosporin antibiotics were the most frequent medications prescribed. Fourth, we found that patients in certain age groups had higher risks of developing SJS. This study aimed to mine the sequential patterns of diseases contracted and medications prescribed before patients developed SJS in Taiwan. This useful information can be provided to physicians so that they can stop the administration of suspected drugs to avoid evolution towards more severe cases. ? 2019 by the authors.",""
"Trends of mortality in diabetic patients in Taiwan: A nationwide survey in 2005–2014","2019","Background/Purpose: Diabetes mellitus has become a major cause of death worldwide. Many technologies have become available for managing diabetes and its complications. This study investigated the mortality trends in people with diabetes in Taiwan between 2005 and 2014. Methods: We used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, which is linked to the National Death Registry. Patients with at least three outpatient visits in 1 year or at least one hospital admission with the diagnosis of diabetes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] 250.x) were defined as diabetic patients. The main causes of death were classified using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM. Results: In 2005–2014, the number of diabetic patients increased from 1.3 to 2.2 million in Taiwan, and all-cause mortality in the patients decreased continuously across sexes and age groups (all, 3.45%–3.00%; women, 3.07%–2.70%; men, 3.82%–3.28%, all p < 0.001 for trends). The diabetic patients exhibited a shorter life expectancy than the entire population. The differences decreased from 2005 to 2014 (p < 0.001) and were greater when diabetes was diagnosed early in life. In 2014, the estimated loss of life was 2.6 and 3.2 years in the women and men, respectively, when diabetes was diagnosed at 40 years of age. The top five causes of death in diabetic patients were malignancy, diabetes, heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and pneumonia. Conclusion: The mortality and estimated loss of life of diabetic patients decreased significantly from 2005 to 2014, reflecting advancements in diabetes care in Taiwan. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cause of death; cerebrovascular disease; data base; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; disease registry; female; groups by age and sex; heart disease; hospital admission; human; ICD-10-CM; ICD-9-CM; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; mortality rate; national health insurance; outpatient care; pneumonia; Taiwan; trend study"
"Resistance index of hepatic artery can predict anastomotic biliary complications after liver transplantation in children","2019","Background/Purpose: Biliary complications remain a major morbidity after liver transplantation in children. Inadequate arterial supply to the bile duct after transplantation plays an important role in developing anastomotic biliary complications. We aimed to elucidate the relationship between the resistance index (RI) of hepatic artery and the anastomotic biliary complications after liver transplantation in children. Methods: This is a retrospective, case–control design study. We enrolled 11 pediatric patients under 18 years of age with anastomotic biliary complication after liver transplantation and another 26 matched pediatric transplanted patients without biliary complication as the control group. All patients received liver Doppler ultrasonography within 15 months after liver transplantation. We focused on the ultrasound parameters including waveforms, RI and acceleration time (AT) of hepatic artery. Results: We used the receiver operating characteristic curve to analyze the RI in these 37 patients and yielded a cutoff of RI ≦ 0.57 (63.6% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity) for the best prediction of anastomotic biliary complications. Patients with RI ≦ 0.57 have a higher chance of having biliary complications, with an Odds ratio of 21 (95% CI = 3.16–139.66). The Cox's proportional hazard analysis also confirmed the significance of RI ≦ 0.57 in predicting biliary complications (Hazard ratio = 8.11, 95% CI = 2.35–28.01, P = 0.001) after liver transplantation in children. Three (27.3%) patients with biliary complications received hepatojejunostomy reconstruction, and another 8 patients (72.7%) were successfully managed by percutaneous biliary intervention alone. Conclusion: The RI of hepatic artery ≦0.57 may serve as an important non-invasive predictor for anastomotic biliary complications after liver transplantation in children. ? 2018","acceleration; adolescent; anastomotic stricture; Article; bile duct fistula; bile leakage; biliary tract disease; biliary tract drainage; biliary tract surgery; child; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; Doppler ultrasonography; female; hepatic artery; hepatic artery stenosis; hepatic artery thrombosis; hepatobiliary parameters; hepatojejunostomy; human; infant; liver transplantation; male; postoperative complication; receiver operating characteristic; resistance index; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; waveform; anastomosis; bile duct atresia; case control study; diagnostic imaging; hepatic artery; Kaplan Meier method; liver transplantation; postoperative complication; preschool child; prognosis; severity of illness index; vascular resistance; Adolescent; Anastomosis, Surgical; Biliary Atresia; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hepatic Artery; Humans; Infant; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Liver Transplantation; Male; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Ultrasonography, Doppler; Vascular Resistance"
"Sensitivity to change of the EORTC quality of life module measuring cancer-related fatigue (EORTC QlQ-Fa12): Results from the international psychometric validation","2019","Objective: The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Group (EORTC QLG) has developed a multidimensional instrument measuring cancer-related fatigue, the EORTC QLQ-FA12. The analysis of sensitivity to change is an essential part of psychometric validation. With this study, we investigated the EORTC QLQ-FA12's sensitivity to change. Methods: The methodology follows the EORTC guidelines of EORTC QLG for phase IV validation of modules. We included cancer patients undergoing curative and palliative treatment at t1 and followed them up prospectively over the course of their treatment (t2) and 4 weeks after completion of treatment (t3). Data were collected prospectively at 17 sites in 11 countries. Sensitivity to change was investigated using analysis of variance. Results: A total sample of 533 patients was enrolled with various tumour types, different stages of cancer, and receiving either curative treatment (n=311) or palliative treatment (n=222). Over time all fatigue scores were significantly higher in the palliative treatment group compared with the curative group (p <.001). Physical fatigue increased with medium effect size over the course of treatment in the curative group (standardized response mean [SRM] (t1,t2) = 0.44]. After treatment physical [SRM (t2,t3) = 0.39], emotional [SRM (t2,t3)= 0.28] and cognitive fatigue (SRM [t2,t3] = 0.22) declined significantly in the curative group. In the palliative group, emotional (SRM [t2,t3] = 0.18) as well as cognitive [SRM [t2,t3] = 0.26) fatigue increases significantly. Conclusions: The EORTC-QLQ-FA12 proved to identify clinically significant changes in fatigue in the course of curative and palliative cancer treatment. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer fatigue; cancer hormone therapy; cancer palliative therapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cognitive fatigue; controlled study; emotional fatigue; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire FA12; female; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; physical fatigue; prospective study; quality of life"
"Burden of varicella in the Asia-Pacific region: a systematic literature review","2019","Introduction: Varicella is a highly contagious infection that can lead to serious complications, particularly in high-risk groups; however, it is vaccine preventable. Disease awareness and understanding of the disease burden can strongly influence vaccine coverage. This review provides insight into the current epidemiology and the importance of varicella from both public health and economic perspectives across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Areas covered: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies on the incidence, seroprevalence, fatality rate and complication rate of varicella. Economic burden studies were also captured. Altogether, 125 studies were identified across the region; these were supplemented by government reports (gray data). Reported vaccine coverage varied from 2.8% to 97%; a key influencing factor was inclusion of the varicella vaccine in national immunization programs. In general, varicella incidence in the unvaccinated population was highest in children ?5 years old and seroprevalence increased with age. Economic analyses highlighted the cost-saving potential of vaccination programs, especially from a societal perspective. Expert opinion: Varicella-related data varied greatly across the APAC region, highlighting the need to better understand the burden of varicella in this area, and particularly identified the need for better surveillance and reporting. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Hurdle Poisson Regression Model for Identifying Factors Related to Noncompliance and Waiting Time for Confirmatory Diagnosis in Colorectal Cancer Screening","2019","Objectives Population-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs that use a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) are often faced with a noncompliance issue and its subsequent waiting time (WT) for those FIT positives complying with confirmatory diagnosis. We aimed to identify factors associated with both of the correlated problems in the same model.Methods A total of 294,469 subjects, either with positive FIT test results or having a family history, collected from 2004 to 2013 were enrolled for analysis. We applied a hurdle Poisson regression model to accommodate the hurdle of compliance and also its related WT for undergoing colonoscopy while assessing factors responsible for the mixture of the two outcomes.Results The effect on compliance and WT varied with contextual factors, such as geographic areas, type of screening units, and level of urbanization. The hurdle score, representing the risk score in association with noncompliance, and the WT score, reflecting the rate of taking colonoscopy, were used to classify subjects into each of three groups representing the degree of compliance and the level of health awareness.Conclusion Our model was not only successfully applied to evaluating factors associated with the compliance and the WT distribution, but also developed into a useful assessment model for stratifying the risk and predicting whether and when screenees comply with the procedure of receiving confirmatory diagnosis given contextual factors and individual characteristics.

"T-cell aging in end-stage renal disease: an evolving story with CMV","2019","Established evidence from the last decade has suggested that chronic cytomegalovirus infection has strong impact on the human immune system, resulting in aggravated aging-associated T-cell changes that are associated with poorer vaccination responses, cardiovascular disease and shortened survival. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the most severe form of chronic kidney disease, exhibit premature aging phenotypes in almost all organ systems, including the immune system. Longitudinal studies of T-cell aging in healthy humans have been scanty because it requires a large number of study subjects and a study duration for decades. In recent years, it became clear that ESRD patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection exhibit enhanced aging-related immune changes than CMV-seropositive individuals without renal disease, including chronic inflammation, decreased numbers of na?ve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, increased clonality of memory T cells with skewed repertoire and shortened telomeres. These findings lead to the hypothesis that the uremic milieu and treatment for renal failure can lead to premature aging of T cells independent from CMV infection and suggest that ESRD can be an important disease model for studying human aging. Future studies deciphering the underlying mechanisms of accelerated T cell aging in ESRD patients may eventually reveal additional insights into T-cell persistence and function during aging in CMV-seropositive, non-ESRD individuals. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell aging; chronic inflammation; clonal variation; comorbidity; cytomegalovirus infection; disease association; effector cell; end stage renal disease; epigenetics; evidence based medicine; human; immune system; lymphocyte function; memory T lymphocyte; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; T lymphocyte; telomere; virus reactivation; chronic kidney failure; complication; cytomegalovirus infection; immunology; longitudinal study; T lymphocyte; Cellular Senescence; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Longitudinal Studies; T-Lymphocytes"
"Practice pattern of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in Japan, Korea and Taiwan: A Web-based survey","2019","Objectives: To investigate the treatment pattern of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients among urologists in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, with emphasis on compliance with important treatment guidelines. Methods: A Web-based questionnaire survey was conceived by representative members of each country's urological oncology society and was open from June 2016 to February 2017 to each society's members. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used. Results: A total of 2334 urologists were invited and 701 responded to the survey with a response rate of 30.0%. Instruments used during transurethral resection of bladder cancer varied significantly between countries and depended on their availability. The re-transurethral resection rate for pT1 or high-grade disease >50% of the time was significantly higher in Japan than in the other two countries, but the collective rate was just 49%. The frequency of intravesical therapy in intermediate- to high-risk disease was generally consistent across countries. However, the choice of agent between chemotherapy and bacillus Calmette–Gu?rin was significantly different between countries. Maintenance bacillus Calmette–Gu?rin was used <10% of the time by 45% of respondents, the most important reasons being fear of side-effects, followed by a lack of efficacy and shortage of drug supply. Conclusions: There are significant differences between Japan, Korea and Taiwan in the management of intermediate- to high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The results of this survey can serve as the basis for joint efforts to develop common clinical guidelines. ? 2019 The Japanese Urological Association","cisplatin; doxorubicin; epirubicin; mitomycin; pirarubicin; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer therapy; health survey; high risk patient; human; Japan; Korea; major clinical study; multiple choice test; Mycobacterium bovis BCG; non muscle invasive bladder cancer; priority journal; questionnaire; Taiwan; transurethral resection; urologist; web browser"
"Home-delivered attention bias modification training via smartphone to improve attention control in sub-clinical generalized anxiety disorder: A randomized, controlled multi-session experiment","2019","Background: Mogg and Bradley (2016) proposed that attentional bias (to threat stimuli) among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may be associated with the top-down attention control process. Additionally, some scholars (e.g., Enock & McNally, 2013) have designed mobile applications to enable patients to engage in home-delivered attentional bias modification (HD-ABM); however, many problems related to these training systems have not yet been addressed. Method: A total of 82 participants (61 women, mean age = 21.47 y) who received GAD diagnoses were randomly assigned to an HD-ABM (n = 30), placebo training (n = 30), or waiting list (n = 22) group. Both the HD-ABM and placebo groups were trained with the attention training application (through Android phones three times a day for four weeks). Results: (1) All measures of participants’ self-reported symptoms (except for trait anxiety) were significantly lower in Week 4 and in the follow-up. (2) Attentional network test (ANT) results demonstrated that all participants’ alerting scores significantly increased by Week 4. (3) Participants in the HD-ABM and placebo groups demonstrated significant increases in their self-reported attention control scores, decreases in their attention bias index (ABI) scores, and progress in their executive control abilities. Limitations: Self-report scales may have been insufficient for measuring effectiveness in the present study. Conclusions: This study helps to elucidate the mechanism underlying changes in attention processes after HD-ABM training implemented through a mobile application in GAD. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; attention; attention test; attentional bias; attentional bias modification training; cognition; cognitive therapy; controlled study; executive function; female; generalized anxiety disorder; home mental health care; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; mobile application; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; self report; treatment duration; young adult; anxiety disorder; attentional bias; cognitive behavioral therapy; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; questionnaire; smartphone; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Attentional Bias; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Self Report; Smartphone; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Viromimetic STING Agonist-Loaded Hollow Polymeric Nanoparticles for Safe and Effective Vaccination against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","2019","The continued threat of emerging, highly lethal infectious pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) calls for the development of novel vaccine technology that offers safe and effective prophylactic measures. Here, a novel nanoparticle vaccine is developed to deliver subunit viral antigens and STING agonists in a virus-like fashion. STING agonists are first encapsulated into capsid-like hollow polymeric nanoparticles, which show multiple favorable attributes, including a pH-responsive release profile, prominent local immune activation, and reduced systemic reactogenicity. Upon subsequent antigen conjugation, the nanoparticles carry morphological semblance to native virions and facilitate codelivery of antigens and STING agonists to draining lymph nodes and immune cells for immune potentiation. Nanoparticle vaccine effectiveness is supported by the elicitation of potent neutralization antibody and antigen-specific T cell responses in mice immunized with a MERS-CoV nanoparticle vaccine candidate. Using a MERS-CoV-permissive transgenic mouse model, it is shown that mice immunized with this nanoparticle-based MERS-CoV vaccine are protected against a lethal challenge of MERS-CoV without triggering undesirable eosinophilic immunopathology. Together, the biocompatible hollow nanoparticle described herein provides an excellent strategy for delivering both subunit vaccine candidates and novel adjuvants, enabling accelerated development of effective and safe vaccines against emerging viral pathogens. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Twice the effort: Ineffectiveness of selecting air pollution control targets with emission quantity for risk reduction","2019","Protection of human health from air pollution has been typically pursued primarily via regulations of air quality standards and emission standards. Although reducing air pollution from the largest sources and placing more stringent emission limits on the industries of focus is a criterion used by decision makers to control air pollution, it is not clear whether this criterion is the most effective and efficient in improving health protection. Pollutants released from sources into the environment are spatially fluctuating rather than uniformly distributed, and hence, health risk is an issue of geographic variability. To address this issue, this study used a representative example of lead (Pb) in Taiwan. This study implemented an IO-RA methodology to redefine the effectiveness of air pollution management and rank the control priorities of target industries using different perspectives, i.e., environmental responsibility, economic benefit and repercussion potential. This study also considered the potential differences in policy effectiveness based on the air pollution control targets and ranked the industries according to their effectiveness in health risk improvement across the three perspectives and pure emission quantities. After determining the cause-effect chain of health risk through IO-RA, authorities can partner with specific industries according to the chosen effectiveness criteria and thus facilitate better policy performance. ? 2018 The Authors","Air quality; Air quality standards; Decision making; Decision theory; Health; Health risks; Lead; Risk assessment; Economic benefits; Emission standard; Environmental responsibility; Geographic variability; Policy performance; Pollution management; Potential difference; Target industries; Air pollution control; lead; lead; air quality; atmospheric pollution; decision analysis; emission control; health risk; lead; pollution control; pollution exposure; risk assessment; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; economic aspect; environmental health; environmental management; health hazard; methodology; policy; priority journal; responsibility; risk assessment; risk management; risk reduction; Taiwan; air pollution; ecosystem restoration; human; prevention and control; procedures; Taiwan; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Humans; Lead; Risk Assessment; Taiwan"
"A Phenomenological Study of Italian Students’ Responses to Professional Dilemmas: A Cross-Cultural Comparison","2019","Phenomenon: Medical professionalism is a complex construct, based in social and cultural influences, yet little research has been done to show how culture influences the behaviors and attitudes of medical students. We presented Italian students with the same professional dilemmas used in a previous Canadian and Taiwanese cross-cultural study to look for similarities and differences and detect elements of Italian culture that influenced how students responded to dilemmas. The aim was to provide medical educators with some insights into students’ behavioral strategies and feelings when faced with a professional dilemma. Approach: Using Giorgi’s method, we performed a phenomenological analysis of 15 interviews of Italian medical students who responded to standardized video scenarios representing professional dilemmas. These videos were used in Canada and Taiwan and were translated into Italian. All students were from the same degree course, at Year 6, and were recruited on a voluntary basis at the beginning of the Internal Medicine course. Interview transcripts were anonymized before analysis. Findings: Scenarios were perceived as realistic and easy to envision in Italy. Four themes emerged: establishing priority among principles, using tactics to escape the dilemma, defending the self, and defending the relationships. When compared with previous studies, we noted that Italian students did not mention the principles of reporting inappropriate behavior, seeking excellence, or following senior trainees’ advice. Insights: This is the first cross-cultural study of professionalism that involves a Mediterranean country and the observed differences could be interpreted as expressions of Italian cultural traits: distrust toward authority and a cooperative rather than competitive attitude.

"Therapeutic targeting of non-oncogene dependencies in high-risk neuroblastoma","2019","Purpose: Neuroblastoma is a pediatric malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system with diverse clinical behaviors. Genomic amplification ofMYCNoncogene has been shown to drive neuroblastoma pathogenesis and correlate with aggressive disease, but the survival rates for those high-risk tumors carrying no MYCN amplification remain equally dismal. The paucity of mutations and molecular heterogeneity has hindered the development of targeted therapies for most advanced neuroblastomas. We use an alternative method to identify potential drugs that target nononcogene dependencies in high-risk neuroblastoma. Experimental Design: By using a gene expression-based integrative approach, we identified prognostic signatures and potentially effective single agents and drug combinations for high-risk neuroblastoma. Results: Among these predictions, we validated in vitro efficacies of some investigational and marketed drugs, of which niclosamide, an anthelmintic drug approved by the FDA, was further investigated in vivo. We also quantified the proteomic changes during niclosamide treatment to pinpoint nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3 (NME3) downregulation as a potential mechanism for its antitumor activity. Conclusions: Our results establish a gene expression-based strategy to interrogate cancer biology and inform drug discovery and repositioning for high-risk neuroblastoma. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","dactolisib; niclosamide; nucleoside diphosphate kinase; pyrvinium embonate; vinblastine; vincristine; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer prognosis; controlled study; down regulation; drug approval; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; drug targeting; event free survival; Food and Drug Administration; gene expression; high risk patient; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; neuroblastoma; nonhuman; oncogene c myb; overall survival; prediction; priority journal; proteomics; quantitative analysis; recurrence free survival"
"Clinical outcomes and secondary epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation among first-line gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib-treated non-small cell lung cancer patients with activating EGFR mutations","2019","Gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are approved for first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) bearing an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. However, the clinical outcomes among the three EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are still controversial. We aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes and secondary EGFR T790M mutation among the three EGFR TKIs. From May 2014 to January 2016, a total of 301 patients received treatment with gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib, for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with an activating EGFR mutation, based on their clinicians’ choice. The median overall survival (OS) was 37.0 months. Although the baseline characteristics of patients were unequal, progression-free survival and OS did not differ among the 3 groups. Multivariate analysis found that gefitinib (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.29, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–9.46, p = 0.027), EGFR TKI treatment duration more than 13 months (aOR 3.16, 95% CI, 1.20–8.33, p = 0.020), male (aOR 3.25, 95% CI, 1.10–9.66, p = 0.034), initial liver metastasis (aOR 4.97, 95% CI 1.18–20.96, p = 0.029) and uncommon EGFR mutation (aOR 0.14, 95% CI, 0.02–0.97, compared to EGFR deletion 19, p = 0.047) were independent factors for secondary T790M mutation. In real-world practice, choosing first line EGFR TKI based on the patients’ clinical characteristics yielded good clinical outcomes. First-line gefitinib, longer EGFR TKI treatment duration, male, initial liver metastasis and uncommon EGFR mutations may be independent factors for secondary EGFR T790M mutation. ? 2018 UICC","afatinib; erlotinib; gefitinib; afatinib; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; gefitinib; protein kinase inhibitor; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer survival; clinical outcome; clinician; EGFR T790M gene; female; gene; gene deletion; gene mutation; human; liver metastasis; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; retrospective study; treatment duration; disease exacerbation; drug effect; drug resistance; epidemiology; follow up; genetics; liver tumor; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; secondary; sex factor; Taiwan; time factor; Afatinib; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Disease Progression; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; ErbB Receptors; Erlotinib Hydrochloride; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gefitinib; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Progression-Free Survival; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Taiwan; Time Factors"

"Fluoroquinolone use and serious arrhythmias: A nationwide case-crossover study","2019","Aim: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death. We aimed to assess the temporal relationship of fluoroquinolone use and serious arrhythmias via a case-crossover analysis of a large cohort of serious arrhythmias patients. Methods: In a national administrative database, we compare the distributions of fluoroquinolone exposure for the same patient across a 30-day period before the serious arrhythmia event and 5 randomly selected 30-day periods before the serious arrhythmia event. Odds ratios (ORs)and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs)were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: From a total of 2 million participants, 7657 patients with serious arrhythmias were identified. Use of fluoroquinolones within the 30-day period before the event was significantly associated with increased risk for serious arrhythmia (OR:3.03, 95% CI:2.48, 3.71). The risk association was attenuated, but remained significant after adjustment for time-varying confounders (OR:1.48, 95% CI:1.18, 1.86). A consistent increase in risk of serious arrhythmia was observed for all time windows investigated (7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days and 90 days). Conclusions: Exposure to fluoroquinolones was substantially associated with serious arrhythmic events, independent of the temporal proximity of fluoroquinolone prescription. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ciprofloxacin; enoxacin; gemifloxacin; levofloxacin; lomefloxacin; moxifloxacin; norfloxacin; ofloxacin; pefloxacin; quinolone derivative; sparfloxacin; adult; aged; Article; clinical assessment; crossover procedure; disease association; drug exposure; female; heart ventricle arrhythmia; human; major clinical study; male; prescription; priority journal; resuscitation; sensitivity analysis; sudden cardiac death"
"Upcoming epidemic of asbestos-related malignant pleural mesothelioma in Taiwan: A prediction of incidence in the next 30 years","2019","Background/Purpose: Globally, asbestos-related diseases (ARDs) keep rising over the coming decades. The epidemic of ARDs will be a burden on public health. We aimed to predict the malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) incidence in the next 30 years for Taiwan based on historical asbestos consumption. Methods: We collected annual data on local asbestos consumption during 1939–2015 and sex-specific incidence of pleural cancer as a proxy for MPM during 1979–2013. We applied Poisson log-linear models to predict future MPM numbers under the assumption that latency periods between asbestos exposure and MPM incidence were between 25 and 45 years. Results: Asbestos consumption reached a peak in the 1980s, with a total of 668 thousand metric tons during 1939–2015. The observed number of MPM incidence increased by 9- and 6-fold in males and females during 1979–2013, with a cumulative number of 907. Given a latency period of 31 years, MPM incidences were expected to peak around 2012–2016 for males and 2016–2020 for females. In 2017–2046, the predicted total number of new MPM might reach 659 cases (95% confidence interval = 579–749); and the male to female ratios ranged from 1.8 to 2.8. Conclusion: The MPM epidemic in Taiwan will likely peak in 2012–2020 as a result of local asbestos consumption. Approximately 659 new MPM cases in the next 30 years warrant an urgent need to implement a total asbestos ban and put more resources on a comprehensive surveillance, diagnosis, and follow-up health care system for ARDs. ? 2018","asbestos; asbestos; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; child; environmental exposure; epidemic; female; follow up; health care system; human; infant; latent period; major clinical study; male; newborn; pleura mesothelioma; prediction; sex difference; Taiwan; very elderly; age distribution; chemically induced; forecasting; incidence; lung tumor; mesothelioma; middle aged; pleura tumor; preschool child; regression analysis; sex ratio; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asbestos; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mesothelioma; Middle Aged; Pleural Neoplasms; Regression Analysis; Sex Distribution; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Hemocompatibility and anti-fouling behavior of multilayer biopolymers immobilized on gold-thiolized drug-eluting cardiovascular stents","2019","To solve the thrombosis and restenosis problem in cardiovascular stent implantation for cardiovascular artery disease, chondroitin 6-sulfate (ChS) with heparin (HEP) have been used as drug carrier layers and alternatively covalently bonded on gold (Au)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)-thiolized cardiovascular metallic (SUS316 L stainless steel, SS) stents. Sirolimus, a model drug, was encapsulated in the ChS-HEP alternative layers. The behavior of the drug in releasing and suppressing the growth of smooth-muscle cells (SMCs) was evaluated with 5-layer CHS-HEP coating on the SS stents. Moreover, hemocompatibility of blood clotting time and platelet adhesion was performed. The results showed that the 5-layer ChS-HEP-modified SS stents displayed the greatest hemocompatibility, showing prolonged blood clotting time of the activated partial thrombin time (> 500 s) and less platelet adhesion to reduce thrombosis. Furthermore, sirolimus can be released continuously for more than 40 days with the 5-layer ChS-HEP coating and is beneficial for inhibiting the growth of SMCs; however, it does not affect the proliferation of endothelial cells, which can avoid restenosis formation. Therefore, the multilayers of ChS-HEP grafted onto the Au-DMSA-cardiovascular SS stents provide high potential for use as drug eluting stents. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adhesion; Biopolymers; Blood vessels; Coatings; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Endothelial cells; Gold; Multilayers; Platelets; Polysaccharides; Targeted drug delivery; Chondroitin; Hemocompatibility; Heparin; Metallic stents; Restenosis; Thrombosis; Stents; biopolymer; chondroitin 6 sulfate; gold; heparin; rapamycin; succimer; thiol; biocompatible coated material; chondroitin sulfate; gold; rapamycin; stainless steel; activated partial thromboplastin time; Article; biocompatibility; blood clotting time; cell proliferation; controlled drug release; controlled study; covalent bond; encapsulation; fouling control; human; human cell; HUVEC cell line; priority journal; thrombocyte adhesion; thrombosis prevention; vascular smooth muscle cell; blood clotting; cell culture; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; drug eluting stent; drug formulation; partial thromboplastin time; procedures; smooth muscle cell; thrombocyte rich plasma; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Blood Coagulation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Chondroitin Sulfates; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Drug Compounding; Drug-Eluting Stents; Gold; Heparin; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Partial Thromboplastin Time; Platelet Adhesiveness; Platelet-Rich Plasma; Sirolimus; Stainless Steel; Succimer"
"Time to Colonoscopy and Risk of Colorectal Cancer in Patients With Positive Results From Fecal Immunochemical Tests","2019","Background & Aims: In patients with positive results from a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), failure to receive a timely follow-up colonoscopy may be associated with higher risks of colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced-stage CRC. We evaluated the prevalence of any CRC and advanced-stage CRC associated with delays in follow-up colonoscopies for patients with positive results from a FIT. Methods: We collected data from 39,346 patients (age, 50–69 years) who participated in the Taiwanese Nationwide Screening Program from 2004 through 2012 and had completed a colonoscopy more than 1 month after a positive result from a FIT. Risks of any CRC and advanced-stage CRC (stage III-IV) were evaluated using logistic regression models and results expressed as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and corresponding 95% CIs. Results: In our cohort, 2003 patients received a diagnosis of any CRC and 445 patients were found to have advanced-stage disease. Compared with colonoscopy within 1–3 months (cases per 1000 patients: 50 for any CRC and 11 for advanced-stage disease), risks were significantly higher when colonoscopy was delayed by more than 6 months for any CRC (aOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04–1.64; 68 cases per 1000 patients) and advanced-stage disease (aOR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.43–3.06; 24 cases per 1000 patients). The risks continuously increased when colonoscopy was delayed by more than 12 months for any CRC (aOR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.44–3.26; 98 cases per 1000 patients) and advanced-stage disease (aOR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.43–5.64; 31 cases per 1000 patients). There were no significant differences for colonoscopy follow up at 3–6 months for risk of any CRC (aOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.86–1.12; 49 cases per 1000 patients) or advanced-stage disease (aOR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72–1.25; 10 cases per 1000 patients). Conclusions: In an analysis of data from the Taiwanese Nationwide Screening Program, we found that among patients with positive results from a FIT, risks of CRC and advanced-stage disease increase with time. These findings indicate the importance of timely colonoscopy after a positive result from a FIT. ? 2019 AGA Institute","adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer risk; cancer staging; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; disease association; disease course; feces analysis; female; follow up; human; immunochemistry; major clinical study; male; risk assessment; risk factor"
"Framework for determining optimal strategy for sustainable remediation of contaminated sediment: A case study in Northern Taiwan","2019","Contaminated sediment may pose a serious threat to human health and ecosystems. However, sediment remediation is typically an expensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, an effective decision-making process for the remediation of contaminated sediment is essential for identifying the optimal approach. Since a single assessment for sediment remediation may be insufficient, combining different analytical approaches is highly recommended. The objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive assessment framework based on the concept of green and sustainable remediation that considers various environmental, economic, and social aspects for the management of contaminated sediment. We propose a framework based on human health risk assessment (HHRA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and apply the multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to implement integrated and sustainable strategies for sediment management. We used the framework to determine the best alternative for managing heavy-metal-contaminated sediment in a river in Northern Taiwan. The results of the pre-remediation HHRA indicated an unacceptably high cancer risk to children, while the CBA revealed that a remediation project was economically feasible. Moreover, the results of the MCDA revealed that a strategy involving in-situ capping with anthracite-based activated carbon would be relatively inexpensive and result in low risk to human health. In addition, this strategy would have a higher environmental impact and greater public acceptance as compared to a method involving the dredging and washing of soil. Thus, in this case study, in-situ capping using anthracite-based activated carbon was identified as the preferable remediation alternative from multiple perspectives. The proposed framework should allow decision-makers to choose the optimal integrated management strategy for similar river sites with contaminated sediment. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Anthracite; Contamination; Decision making; Decision theory; Health; Health risks; Heavy metals; Life cycle; Risk assessment; River pollution; Sediments; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Comprehensive assessment; Contaminated sediment; Decision making process; Human health risk assessment; Integrated management; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multi-criteria decision analysis; Sustainable strategies; Cost benefit analysis; activated carbon; copper; heavy metal; nickel; zinc; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; environmental management; health risk; life cycle analysis; multicriteria analysis; remediation; risk assessment; sediment pollution; sustainability; Article; case study; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; dredging; environmental impact; green chemistry; health hazard; life cycle assessment; pollution control; priority journal; risk assessment; river; sediment; Taiwan; Taiwan"
"Pathophysiology of Leptospirosis Kidney Disease","2019","Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis globally and is caused by Leptospira interrogans. Its major animal hosts include rodents, dogs, cattle, sheep, pigs, and rabbits. Leptospirosis is a global public health issue, characterized by a sudden onset of fever, myalgia, conjunctival injection, and renal dysfunction. Renal dysfunction ranges from mild-to-severe acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring dialysis. Chronic infection with leptospirosis may progress to renal fibrosis and subsequent renal failure. The pathogenesis of leptospirosis-related CKD has been linked to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. Leptospirosis causes sodium transport dysregulation in the kidneys and decreased aquaporin 2 expression in the renal medulla, resulting in polyuria and natriuresis. Nonoliguria renal failure and hypokalemia are common because of tubular damage with transport defects in tubular epithelial cells. The clinical presentation of Leptospira infection is influenced by both the bacterial serotype and host immune system. A broad spectrum of renal pathological changes is possible, including direct bacterial invasion and interstitial nephritis and fibrosis caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, Leptospira outer membrane proteins may induce tubular injury and inflammation through activation of nuclear transcription factor kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and induction of cytokines and chemokines by the toll-like receptor-dependent pathways. This chapter describes current knowledge of Leptospira-host interactions in the kidney. ? 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.",""
"MicroRNA in lung cancer metastasis","2019","Tumor metastasis is a hallmark of cancer, with distant metastasis frequently developing in lung cancer, even at initial diagnosis, resulting in poor prognosis and high mortality. However, available biomarkers cannot reliably predict cancer spreading sites. The metastatic cascade involves highly complicated processes including invasion, migration, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that are tightly controlled by various genetic expression modalities along with interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix. In particular, microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, can influence the transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, with dysregulation of miRNA expression contributing to the regulation of cancer metastasis. Nevertheless, although miRNA-targeted therapy is widely studied in vitro and in vivo, this strategy currently affords limited feasibility and a few miRNA-targeted therapies for lung cancer have entered into clinical trials to date. Advances in understanding the molecular mechanism of metastasis will thus provide additional potential targets for lung cancer treatment. This review discusses the current research related to the role of miRNAs in lung cancer invasion and metastasis, with a particular focus on the different metastatic lesions and potential miRNA-targeted treatments for lung cancer with the expectation that further exploration of miRNA-targeted therapy may establish a new spectrum of lung cancer treatments. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Reinforcement of patient education improved physicians’ adherence to guideline-recommended medical therapy after acute coronary syndrome","2019","Background Prescription of guideline-recommended medicines after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been suboptimal. Tools for improving the use of medications have been developed, but they mainly targeted physicians. Objective We evaluated the effects of reinforcement of patient and family education on the usage of guideline-recommended secondary prevention medications. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected registry of patients with ACS who were admitted to a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan between February 2015 and April 2017. The control group included 76 patients discharged before implementing the electronic-based patient and family education (PFE) system. The intervention group included 206 patients discharged after implementation. The primary outcome was the prescription rate of all four guideline-recommended drugs. Predictors of adherence were also evaluated. Results The study cohort included 282 ACS patients (188 men and 94 women) with a mean age of 68.5 years (standard deviation, 14.2). The intervention group patients were younger, had more family history of premature cardiovascular disease, more dyslipidemia, and underwent more reperfusion therapy. The intervention group was prescribed more guideline-recommended drugs than the control group: dual antiplatelet agents, 79.61% vs. 47.37% (p<0.001); statins, 74.76% vs. 34.21% (p<0.001); beta-blockers, 81.07% vs. 46.05% (p<0.001); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, 62.62% vs. 38.16% (p<0.001); and a combination of all four medications, 39.32% vs. 14.47% (p<0.001). After adjusting baseline variables, the PFE system remained a significant contributor to adherence to these drugs use (P = 0.02). Conclusions Reinforcement of patient education was associated with significant improvements in physicians’ adherence to guideline-recommended medical therapy after acute coronary syndrome. ? 2019 Lee et al.

"Changes of balance control in individuals with lumbar degenerative spine disease after lumbar surgery: a longitudinal study","2019","Background Context: Lumbar degenerative spine disease (DSD) with neurological symptoms is the most common indication requiring lumbar surgery when nonoperative treatment is not effective. Individuals with lumbar DSD have sensory, proprioception, and musculoskeletal system alterations, which may result in balance impairment. However, evidence regarding balance recovery in individuals with lumbar DSD after lumbar surgery is limited. Purpose: To evaluate balance control, pain, and functional activities in individuals with lumbar DSD after lumbar surgery. Study Design/Setting: A prospective study with a cross-sectional control group. Patient Sample: Seventy individuals with lumbar DSD (DSD group) and 30 age-matched healthy adults (control group) were recruited. Participants in the DSD group were diagnosed by a neurological surgeon and received lumbar surgery according to relevant imaging findings and neurological symptoms. Outcome Measures: Clinical assessments, including a visual analogue scale (VAS), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), were performed in the DSD group only. Balance control was assessed in all participants using the root mean square (RMS) distance of the center of pressure (COP) in anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. Methods: All participants were instructed to stand in natural stance and Romberg stance with eyes open and eyes closed on a force platform for 35 seconds, respectively. The assessments were performed in the DSD group at four time points: preoperative phase (baseline), 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. In the age-matched healthy control group, only one assessment on the recruitment day was performed. Results: The VAS, ODI, and RMDQ scores of the DSD group significantly improved after lumbar surgery (p<.001). The RMS distance of COP in the DSD group significantly decreased after lumbar surgery (p<.017) compared with baseline in most of the testing conditions. However, the RMS distance of the COP in the DSD group after surgery was significantly greater than in the healthy control group (p<.05), especially 6 months and 12 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Balance control, pain, and functional activities of individuals with lumbar DSD showed improvement after lumbar surgery. However, balance control in individuals with lumbar DSD was still less stable than in age-matched healthy adults from 6 to 12 months after surgery. Therefore, individuals with lumbar DSD require fall prevention programs after lumbar surgery, including balance assessments and postoperative balance training. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; anterior posterior axis; anthropometric parameters; Article; body equilibrium; center of pressure; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; clinical trial (topic); controlled study; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; degenerative disease; degenerative spine disease; female; functional status; human; longitudinal study; low back pain; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; mediolateral axis; middle aged; neurologic disease; Oswestry Disability Index; outcome assessment; pain intensity; postoperative period; pressure; priority journal; prospective study; Roland Morris disability questionnaire; spinal cord decompression; spine disease; spine fusion; spine surgery; standing; visual analog scale"
"Effect Modification by Age on the Benefit or Harm of Antihypertensive Treatment for Elderly Hypertensives: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","BACKGROUND The influence of age on balance of benefit vs. potential harm of blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy for elderly hypertensives is unclear. We evaluated the modifying effects of age on BP lowering for various adverse outcomes in hypertensive patients older than 60 years without specified comorbidities. METHODS All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were systematically identified. Coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure (HF), cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), renal failure (RF), and all-cause death were assessed. Meta-regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between achieved systolic BP (SBP) and the risk of adverse events. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the estimates. RESULTS Our study included 18 RCTs (n = 53,993). Meta-regression analysis showed a lower achieved SBP related with a lower risk of stroke and cardiovascular death, but an increased risk of RF. The regression slopes were comparable between populations stratifying by age 75 years. In subgroup analysis, the relative risks of a more aggressive BP lowering strategy were similar between patients aged older or less than 75 years for all outcomes except for RF (P for interaction = 0.02). Compared to treatment with final achieved SBP 140-150 mm Hg, a lower achieved SBP (<140 mm Hg) was significantly associated with decreased risk of stroke (relative risk = 0.68; 95% confidence interval = 0.55-0.85), HF (0.77; 0.60-0.99), cardiovascular death (0.68; 0.52-0.89), and MACE (0.83; 0.69-0.99). CONCLUSIONS To treat hypertension in the elderly, age had trivial effect modification on most outcomes, except for renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function may be warranted in the management of elderly hypertension. ? American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2018.

"Is robotic hepatectomy cost-effective? In view of patient-reported outcomes","2019","Background: Robotic hepatectomy has been accepted as an alternative for patients needing surgery. However, few reports addressed the patient-reported outcomes and long-term quality of life (QoL) of patients having undergone robotic liver surgery. Methods: This study presented the QoL and cost-effectiveness associated with robotic and open hepatectomy by performing a comparative survey using two standardized questionnaires (Short Form-36 and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index). Results: One hundred patients completed the study. The robotic group tended to experienced longer operation time but shorter length of hospital stay compared to open group. Moreover, the robotic group had faster return to daily activities, less need of patient-controlled anesthesia, and less wound-related complaints in long-term follow-up. The robotic group incurred higher peri-operative expenses; however, the cost of inpatient care was lower. Conclusions: Our study suggested that robotic hepatectomy provided good post-operative QoL and recovery of daily activity. However, efforts for lowering the financial burden of medical care by reducing the cost of robotic surgery is necessary for further application. ? 2019","aged; convalescence; cost control; cost of illness; economics; female; follow up; human; length of stay; liver; liver resection; male; middle aged; operation duration; patient; patient controlled analgesia; patient satisfaction; procedures; psychology; quality of life; robotic surgical procedure; statistics and numerical data; surgery; time factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; Cost of Illness; Cost Savings; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatectomy; Humans; Length of Stay; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Patient Satisfaction; Patients; Quality of Life; Recovery of Function; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"The association between the sedative loads and clinical severity indicators in the first-onset major depressive disorder","2019","Background: High sedative use in a major depressive episode may imply specific clinical features. This study aims to examine the correlation between sedative use and clinical severity indicators in the initial treatment phase of first-onset major depressive disorder. Methods: A study cohort in the first episode of major depressive disorder was used to conduct pharmacological dissection. All participants had at least a 2-year follow-up period with a complete treatment record. The defined daily dose of antidepressants and augmentation agents were calculated as the antidepressant load and augmentation load, respectively. Sedative use, which was calculated as the equivalent dosage of lorazepam, were defined as the sedative load. These psychotropic loads were measured monthly and the averaged psychotropic loads for each day were obtained. Results: A total of 106 individuals (75.5% female) were included. The mean duration of disease course in participants was 5.5 ± 3.5 years. In the multiple regression analysis, after controlling for other classes of psychotropics and comorbid anxiety disorders, the sedative load independently correlated with higher number of antidepressants used, higher number of antidepressant used with an adequate dose and duration, more psychiatric emergency and outpatient visits within 2 years of disease onset.

"Higher intra-dialysis serum phosphorus reduction ratio as a predictor of mortality in patients on long-term hemodialysis","2019","Background: Rapid shifting between extracellular and intracellular phosphorus can occur during dialysis sessions, which can cause aberrant intracellular signaling in long-term hemodialysis (LTHD) patients. However, the effect of these intra-dialysis fluctuations of phosphorus on clinical outcomes has not been examined. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between intradialysis serum phosphorus reduction ratio (IDSPRR) and mortality in LTHD patients. Material/Methods: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study to assess the predictive power of IDSPRR (>0.63 vs. ?0.63) on mortality in a total of 805 LTHD patients. All these fatal events were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: After multivariable analysis, baseline IDSPRR higher than 0.63 was significantly predictive of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–2.26), but not for cardiovascular (CV) mortality (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 0.91–2.18). However, when time-varied IDSPRRs were applied, a value greater than 0.63 was not only significantly predictive of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.16–2.63), but also CV mortality (HR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.23–3.40). Conclusions: High IDSPRR (>0.63) is independently associated with increased all-cause and CV mortality, which shows the negative effect of rapid intracellular phosphorus-shifting on LTHD patients. ?

"Decoy Receptor 3 Expression Is Associated With Wild-Type EGFR Status, Poor Differentiation of Tumor, and Unfavorable Patient Outcome","2019","OBJECTIVES: The role of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) in lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma, has not been well studied. In this study, we aim to investigate the expression profile and the clinicopathologic implications of DcR3 expression in lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to examine DcR3 expression in 461 lung adenocarcinomas. The differences in DcR3 expression among the various histopathologic patterns were analyzed. The relationship between DcR3 expression and clinicopathologic parameters, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, was also investigated. RESULTS: DcR3 expression was more frequently expressed in solid, micropapillary, and acinar patterns (P < .0001) and in tumors with wild-type EGFR status (P = .018). In addition, DcR3 expression portends a less favorable disease-free survival in stage I patients (P = .012). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of DcR3 might be involved in the differentiation and progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, DcR3 may be applied clinically for prediction of tumor progression in stage I lung adenocarcinoma. ? American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019. All rights reserved.

"Nanodiamond-supported silver nanoparticles as potent and safe antibacterial agents","2019","Since its discovery nearly a century ago, antibiotics has been one of the most effective methods in treating infectious diseases and limiting pathogen spread. However, pathogens often build up antibiotic resistance over time, leading to serious failure of the treatment. Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) is an appealing alternative, but successful treatment of the bacterial infection requires a plentiful supply of AgNP, which can negatively impact human health if people are excessively exposed to the particles. Here, we present a method to overcome this challenge by synthesizing nanodiamond-supported AgNP noncovalently conjugated with albumin molecules to achieve enhanced antibacterial activity and strengthened biocompatibility. Using Escherichia coli as a model bacterium, we found that the albumin-conjugated silver-diamond nanohybrids showed a long-term bactericidal effect after 36 days of the treatment at the AgNP concentration of 250 ?g mL?1. Moreover, the toxicity of the nanohybrids to human cells (including human fibroblasts, lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, and breast adenocarcinoma cells) is low even at the particle concentration of 500 ?g mL?1. The method provides a general and practical solution to the concerns of bacterial resistance against AgNP and issues associated with the size, shape, aggregation, and toxicity of AgNP are largely resolved. Finally, we demonstrate that the nanohybrids can be readily incorporated into natural polysaccharides (such as guar gum) to form three-in-one hydrogels, showing promising applications in nanomedicine. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, betel quid chewing, and the risk of head and neck cancer in an East Asian population","2019","Background: The smoking prevalence among men in China is high, but the head and neck cancer incidence rates are low. This study's purpose was to investigate the impact of tobacco, betel quid, and alcohol on head and neck cancer risk in East Asia. Methods: A multicenter case-control study (921 patients with head and neck cancer and 806 controls) in East Asia was conducted. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using logistic regression. Results: Head and neck cancer risks were elevated for tobacco (OR = 1.58), betel quid (OR = 8.23), and alcohol (OR = 2.29). The total attributable risk of tobacco and/or alcohol was 47.2%. Tobacco/alcohol appeared to account for a small proportion of head and neck cancer among women (attributable risk of 2.2%). Betel quid chewing alone accounted for 28.7% of head and neck cancer. Conclusions: Betel quid chewing is the strongest risk factor for oral cavity cancer in this Chinese population. Alcohol may play a larger role for head and neck cancer in this population than in European or U.S. populations. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","alcohol; adult; aged; Article; betel quid; cancer risk; case control study; cigarette smoking; controlled study; drinking behavior; East Asian; female; head and neck cancer; human; hypopharynx cancer; larynx cancer; major clinical study; mastication; middle aged; mouth cancer; multicenter study; oropharynx cancer; priority journal; smoking"
"Effects of preferred music therapy on peer attachment, depression, and salivary cortisol among early adolescents in Taiwan [首?音??法?台?早期青少年同伴依?、抑郁和唾液皮?醇的影?]","2019","Aims: To explore the effects of preferred music therapy on peer attachment, depression, and salivary cortisol among early adolescents. Background: As adolescents enter puberty, they start to seek partnering relationships among peers. Peer attachment is central for adolescents and greatly influences their physical and psychological development. Design: A pre-test-posttest control group design. Methods: The data were collected from July - October 2016. A total of 65 individuals were included. The treatment group received 40?min of music therapy twice per week over the course of 10?weeks. The control group maintained its typical routine. The research data were collected using structured questionnaires, including basic information, the Inventory of Peer Attachment, the Beck Depression Inventory-II questionnaires, and salivary cortisol concentrations. Statistical analysis methods included percentages, chi-square tests, t tests, analyses of covariance, and the Johnson–Neyman technique. Results: There were statistically significant differences in peer attachment, depression, and salivary cortisol levels in the music group compared to the control group (p?<?0.05). Additionally, the findings showed that early adolescents with more severe depression experienced greater improvement through preferred music therapy. Conclusion: The results allude to the beneficial effects of receiving preferred music therapy in terms of the peer attachment, depression, and salivary cortisol levels of early adolescents. Adjustments should be made based on the characteristics of student groups to develop suitable and safe music therapy and to reduce the risks of poor mental health. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"Interactions between HIV-1 protease, silver nanoparticles, and specific peptides","2019","Use of silver nanoparticles (Ag NP's) as inhibitor for HIV-1 protease (PR) has practical interest. However, the interactions between the Ag NP's, HIV-1 PR, and the target peptides are not well demonstrated. This study experimentally revealed the interactions of the synthesized Ag NP's, HIV-1 PR, and five specific peptides with similar amino acid sequences to HIV's polyproteins. The Ag NP's can bind with either HIV-1 PR or the peptides. Incubating Ag NP's with peptide for 24 h can efficiently inhibit activity of HIV-1 PR. But HIV-1 PR would cleave peptides faster than the binding rate of Ag NP's and the peptides; therefore, late presence of Ag NP's would have no inhibition on the HIV-1 PR activity. ? 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers","Enzyme inhibition; Metal nanoparticles; Peptides; Amino acid sequence; Binding rate; Cleavage; HIV-1 protease; Polyproteins; Silver nanoparticles"
"Prostate cancer in Asia: design of a patient registry to inform real-world treatments, outcomes, and quality of life","2019","Background: The incidence of prostate cancer (PC) in Asian countries is increasing for reasons that are not clear. Data describing how PC is diagnosed and treated are fragmented across Asia, with marked intercountry and intracountry differences in outcome and knowledge gaps in clinical diagnostic and treatment practices. To address these knowledge gaps, we have established a PC disease registry with the aim of providing a comprehensive picture of PC diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and outcome, population characteristics, and comorbidities in real-world clinical practice in Asia. Methods: This is a multinational, multicenter, longitudinal, and observational registry of PC patients presenting to participating tertiary-care hospitals in eight Asian countries (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02546908. Registry Identifier: NOPRODPCR4001). Approximately 3500-4000 eligible patients with existing or newly diagnosed high-risk localized PC (cohort 1), nonmetastatic biochemically recurrent PC (cohort 2), or metastatic PC (cohort 3) will be consecutively enrolled and followed-up for 5 years. An enrollment cap of 600 patients each will be applied to cohorts 1 and 2. Disease status is collected at enrollment, and outcome variables captured at 3-monthly intervals include diagnostic/staging, treatments including reason for change, laboratory results, comorbidities, and concomitant medications. Treatments and survival outcomes will be captured real time until study end. Patient-reported quality-of-life will be measured every 6 months, and medical resource utilization summarized at study end. Data analysis will include exploratory analyses of potential associations between multiple risk factors and socioeconomic variables with disease progression and evaluation of various treatments for PC including novel therapies on clinical outcome and health-related quality-of-life outcomes. Results: 3636 men with PC were enrolled until July 2018; 416 in cohort 1, 399 in cohort 2 and 2821 in cohort 3. Discussion: A total of 3636 patients were enrolled until July 2018. The prospective disease registry will provide comprehensive and wide-ranging real-world information on how PC is diagnosed and treated in Asia. Such information can be used to inform policy development for best practice and direct clinical study design evaluating new treatments. ? 2019","adult; Article; Asia; biochemical recurrence; cancer diagnosis; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical outcome; clinical practice; cohort analysis; comorbidity; digital rectal examination; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate; Gleason score; high risk patient; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; metastasis; metastasis free survival; multicenter study; observational study; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; prostate cancer; quality of life; risk factor; young adult"
"Reliability of a stochastic intermodal logistics network under spoilage and time considerations","2019","In an intermodal logistics network, there is a carrier along each route whose capacity (number of available containers) is stochastic because the containers may be occupied by other customers. Hence this paper focuses on single commodity in a stochastic intermodal logistics network (SILN) with cargo terminals, transit stations, and routes. In particular, commodities may rot or be spoilt during delivery due to traffic accidents, collisions, natural disasters, weather, etc., and thus the intact commodities may not satisfy the market demand. The arrival time at the cargo terminal should be in the time window which is the interval between the earliest and latest acceptable arrival times. The delivery time depends on the number of containers and type of vehicle. So we propose an algorithm to evaluate the network reliability, the probability that the SILN can successfully deliver sufficient amount of commodity to meet market demand under the time and delivery spoilage constraints. Finally, a practical case of starting motor distribution between Taiwan and China is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",""
"Prenatal and perinatal risk factors and the clinical implications on autism spectrum disorder","2019","Prenatal and perinatal factors may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. However, little is known about whether unaffected siblings of probands with autism spectrum disorder also share the phenomenon and whether the prenatal/perinatal factors are related to the clinical severity of autistic symptoms. We compared the frequency of prenatal and perinatal factors among 323 probands with autism spectrum disorder (mean age ± standard deviation, 10.7 ± 3.5 years; males, 91.0%), 257 unaffected siblings (11.7 ± 4.5; 42.8%), and 1504 typically developing controls (8.9 ± 1.6 years; 53.1%); and investigated their effects on the severity of autistic symptoms. We found that probands with autism spectrum disorder and their unaffected siblings had more prenatal/perinatal events than typically developing controls with higher numbers of prenatal/perinatal factors in probands than in unaffected siblings. The prenatal/perinatal events were associated with greater stereotyped behaviors, social-emotional problems, socio-communication deficits, and overall severity. We also found that six prenatal/perinatal factors (i.e. preeclampsia, polyhydramnios, oligoamnios, placenta previa, umbilical cord knot, and gestational diabetes) were associated with the severity of autistic symptoms, particularly stereotyped behaviors and socio-communication deficits. Our findings suggest that prenatal and perinatal factors may potentially moderate the clinical expression of autism spectrum disorder. The underlying mechanism warrants further research. ?

"Stent-Based Antennas for Smart Stent Applications","2019","Recently, smart stents attract lots of attentions by integrating different sensors with cardiovascular stents for detecting vascular restenosis or measuring the blood flow condition including blood pressures and blood velocity. Then, the measured medial signals can be transferred to the external monitoring systems via wireless communications including the RF front ends and antennas. Different antenna designs have been studied including magnetic-field-coupled resonant antennas, miniaturized embedded antennas, and stents acting as antennas. In this research, we proposed a helix-like stent antenna by considering the whole stent as an antenna for better radiation performances. The stent antenna was designed at 2.4 GHz for the minimum loss when transmitting through the body and human tissues. Meanwhile, the stent antenna had a omnidirectional radiation pattern which would be beneficial for arbitrary receiving angles. ? 2018 KIEES.","Blood pressure; Diseases; Finite element method; Helical antennas; Microwave antennas; Monitoring; Omnidirectional antennas; Stents; Cardiovascular stents; Implantable antennas; Omnidirectional radiation pattern; Radiation performance; Real time monitoring system; Restenosis; smart stent; Wireless communications; Directional patterns (antenna)"
"Quantification of cardiac pumping mechanics in rats by using the elastance–resistance model based solely on the measured left ventricular pressure and cardiac output","2019","The cardiac pumping mechanics can be characterized by both the maximal systolic elastance (E max ) and theoretical maximum flow (Q max ), which are generated using an elastance–resistance model. The signals required to fit the elastance–resistance model are the simultaneously recorded left ventricular (LV) pressure and aortic flow (Q m ), followed by the isovolumic LV pressure. In this study, we evaluated a single-beat estimation technique for determining the E max and Q max by using the elastance–resistance model based solely on the measured LV pressure and cardiac output. The isovolumic LV pressure was estimated from the measured LV pressure by using a non-linear least-squares approximation technique. The measured Q m was approximated by an unknown triangular flow (Q tri ), which was generated by using a fourth-order derivative of the LV pressure. The Q tri scale was calibrated using the cardiac output. Values of E max triQ and Q max triQ obtained using Q tri were compared with those of E max mQ and Q max mQ obtained from the measured Q m . Healthy rats and rats with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus were examined. We found that the LV E max and Q max can be approximately calculated using the assumed Q tri , and they strongly correlated with the corresponding values derived from Q m (P &lt; 0.0001; n = 78): E max triQ = 51.9133 + 0.8992 × E max mQ (r 2 = 0.8257; P &lt; 0.0001); Q max triQ = 2.4053 + 0.9767 × Q max mQ (r 2 = 0.7798; P &lt; 0.0001). Our findings suggest that the proposed technique can be a useful tool for determining E max and Q max by using a single LV pressure pulse together with cardiac output. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"2019 focused update of the guidelines of the Taiwan society of cardiology for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure","2019","Heart failure is a growing epidemic, especially in Taiwan because of the aging population. The 2016 Taiwan Society of Cardiology - Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (TSOC-HFrEF) registry showed that the guidelinerecommended therapies were prescribed suboptimally both at the time of hospital discharge and during followup. We, therefore, conducted this 2019 focused update of the guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure to reinforce the importance of new diagnostic and therapeuticmodalities of heart failure. The 2019 focused update discusses new diagnostic criteria, pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacological management, and certain co-morbidities of heart failure. Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and If channel inhibitor is introduced as new and recommended medical therapies. Latest criteria of cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, heart transplantation, and ventricular assist device therapy are reviewed in the non-pharmacological management chapter. Co-morbidities in heart failure are discussed including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sleep-disordered breathing.We also explain the adequate use of oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation in heart failure management. A particular chapter for chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity is incorporated in the focused update to emphasize the importance of its recognition and management. Lastly, implications from the TSOC-HFrEF registry and post-acute care of heart failure are discussed to highlight the importance of guideline-directed medical therapy and the benefits of multidisciplinary disease management programs. With guideline recommendations, we hope that the management of heart failure can be improved in our society. ? 2019, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

"p21-Activated kinase 3 promotes cancer stem cell phenotypes through activating the Akt-GSK3β-β-catenin signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells","2019","Relative to several other p21-activated kinase (PAK) family members, the role of PAK3 in regulating cancer cell functions remains unclear. Our study obtained evidence that PAK3 regulates the Akt-GSK3β-β-catenin signaling by acting as Ser 473 -Akt kinase in several pancreatic cancer cell lines. Specifically, knockdown of PAK3 or overexpression of dominant-negative PAK3 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser 473 -Akt and GSK3β, resulting in the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. Conversely, overexpression of PAK3 led to activation of Akt signaling and increased β-catenin expression. These changes, however, were not noted with the silencing and/or overexpression of PAK1, PAK2, or PAK4, which underlies the impetus of PAK3 as a key effector in governing malignant phenotypes in these pancreatic cancer cells, including cancer stem cell (CSC) expansion. Accordingly, PAK3 depletion effectively suppresses tumorsphere formation, ALDH activity, and the expression of CSC surface markers. Moreover, we used a stable knockdown clone of AsPC-1 cells to demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of PAK3 inhibition in suppressing tumorigenesis and xenograft tumor growth. Together, these findings suggest the potential role of PAK3 as a target for pancreatic cancer therapy, which warrants further investigations. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","aldehyde dehydrogenase; beta catenin; cell surface marker; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; p21 activated kinase 1; p21 activated kinase 2; p21 activated kinase 3; p21 activated kinase 4; proteasome; protein kinase B; serine; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; AsPC-1 cell line; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cancer stem cell; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme deficiency; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme regulation; female; human; human cell; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; pancreatic cancer cell line; phenotype; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; stem cell expansion; tumor xenograft"
"Post-acute care regains quality of life among middle-aged and older stroke patients in Taiwan","2019","Objective: This study aims to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL)of middle-aged and older stroke patients receiving the stroke post care (PAC)program and to identify possible predictors. Design, setting and participants: This is a retrospective cohort study. Demographic characteristics and functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Concise Chinese Aphasia Test)were collected at enrollment. EQ-5D HRQoL questionnaires were administered at the beginning and the end of PAC, and health state utilities were compared. Results: The EQ-5D utilities of stroke patients aged 75–84 years and 85 years or above were estimated to be 0.091 and 0.159 lower than those aged less than 50 years. A decrease of the utility by 0.075 was observed among patients with the prior history of stroke. The EQ-5D utilities of patients having Barthel Index of 21–40, 41–60, and 61–100 were 0.1432, 0.1568, and 0.1387 higher than those having Barthel Index of 0–20, respectively. For patients reporting extreme problems in self-care or any dimension of EQ-5D questionnaires prior to PAC, increases in utilities by 0.0733 and 0.2875 were noted. The EQ-5D utility of PAC service duration rose by 0.0733 per one incremental day. Conclusions and implications: This study provides vital evidence regarding time-varying benefits of PAC services to HRQoL of stroke patients and to identify multiple predictors of HRQoL among stroke patients receiving PAC services. This study thus could serve as good reference to enhance quality of PAC services among stroke patients. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; age distribution; aged; Article; Barthel index; cerebrovascular accident; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; Concise Chinese Aphasia Test; demography; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; evidence based medicine; female; geriatric patient; health program; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; neurologic examination; patient care; priority journal; quality of life; Rankin scale; retrospective study; very elderly"

"4(1H)-quinolone derivatives overcome acquired resistance to anti-microtubule agents by targeting the colchicine site of β-tubulin","2019","Developing new therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance of cancer cells is an ongoing endeavor. From among 2 million chemicals, we identi?ed ethyl 4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-6-carboxylate (AS1712) as a low-toxicity inhibitor of lung cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. We show that AS1712 is active against broad cancer cell lines and is able to bind in the colchicine-binding pocket of β-tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule assembly and, consequently, inducing mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Our cell-based structure-activity relationship study identified a new lead compound, RJ-LC-15-8, which had a greater anti-proliferative potency for H1975 cells than did AS1712, while maintaining a similar mechanism of action. Notably, AS1712 and RJ-LC-15-8 overcame P-glycoprotein efflux pump and β-tubulin alterations that lead to acquired resistance against microtubule-targeting drugs of cancer cells.

"Long-term statin adherence in patients after hospital discharge for new onset of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: A population-based study of real world prescriptions in Taiwan","2019","Background: Despite the recommendations of statins treatment for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), treatment adherence and persistence are still a concern. This study examined the real world practice of long-term adherence and persistence to statins treatment initiated after hospital discharge for ASCVD, and their associated factors in a nationwide cohort. Methods: Post discharge statin prescriptions between 2006 and 2012 were extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims database. Good adherence, defined as proportion of days covered (PDC) ?0.8 and mean medication possession ratio (MPR), was measured every 180-day period. Non-persistence was defined on the date patients failed to refill statin for 90 days after the end of the last prescription. Their associations with influential factors were analyzed using a generalized estimating equation and Cox's proportional hazard model. Results: There was a total of 185,252 post-discharge statin initiations (from 169,624 patients) and followed for 467,398 patient-years in the study cohort. Percentage of good adherence (mean MPR) was 71% (0.87) at 6-months; declined to 54% (0.68), 47% (0.59), and 42% (0.50) at end of year 1, 2, and 7, respectively. Persistence in statin treatment was 86, 67, 50, and 25% at 6-month, 1-, 2-, and 7-year, respectively. Comparing the statin-cohort initiated from year 2006 to 2012, 1-year persistence increased from 58 to 73%, and 1-year good adherence improved from 45 to 61%. Factors associated with sub-optimal adherence and non-persistence included: prescription by primary care clinics or non-cardiology specialties; patients' age > 75 years; no history of previous statin use; ASCVD events with ischemic stroke diagnosis; comorbidities of renal disease, liver disease, depression, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conclusions: Despite the improving trends, long-term adherence and persistence of statin treatment were suboptimal in Taiwan. Strategies to maintain statin treatment adherence and persistence need to be implemented to further enhance the positive trend. ? 2019 The Author(s).","hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; adult; aged; Article; brain ischemia; case control study; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical practice; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; coronary artery atherosclerosis; depression; drug use; female; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; kidney disease; liver disease; long term care; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; patient compliance; prescription; priority journal; retrospective study; Taiwan; treatment duration"
"Spatial patterning, correlates, and inequality in suicide across 432 neighborhoods in Taipei City, Taiwan","2019","More than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas. Understanding the spatial distribution of suicide in these settings may inform prevention. Previous analyses of the spatial distribution of suicide in cities have largely been conducted in Western nations. We investigated the spatial pattern of suicide and factors associated with its spatial distribution in Taipei City, Taiwan. We estimated smoothed standardized mortality ratios for overall suicide and suicide by sex/age group across 432 neighborhoods (mean population size: 5500) in Taipei City (2004–2010) using Bayesian hierarchical models. A range of area-level characteristics including socioeconomic deprivation, social fragmentation, income inequality, and linking social capital were investigated for their associations with suicide mortality. Overall suicide rates were below average in the city center, whereas above average rates were found in some suburbs. The cartogram highlighted the concentration of suicide burden in one western area of the city. Male suicides demonstrated generally similar spatial patterning across age groups, while the geographic distribution of female suicides differed by age. After adjusting for other variables, two area characteristics were found to be associated with area suicide rates: the proportion of divorced/separated adults (rate ratio [RR] per one standard deviation increase = 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.16), an indicator of social fragmentation; and median household income (RR = 0.80, 0.73–0.86), an indicator of socioeconomic deprivation. There was a 1.8-fold difference in suicide rates between neighborhood quintiles with the lowest and the highest median household income, with middle-aged males showing the largest gradient (3.2-fold difference). The geography of suicide in Taipei City showed spatial patterning and socioeconomic correlates distinct from cities in Western nations. There is a need for future research to better understand the correlates of change in the geographic distribution of suicide throughout the process of urban development. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","pesticide; correlation; geographical distribution; mental health; neighborhood; quality of life; spatial analysis; suicide; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; city; controlled study; divorced person; female; groups by age; health disparity; household income; human; indigenous people; intoxication; male; middle aged; neighborhood; sex difference; sex ratio; social capital; social status; spatial analysis; suburban area; suffocation; suicide; Taiwan; Taipei; Taiwan"
"Instantaneous frequency as a new approach for evaluating the clinical severity of Duchenne muscular dystrophy through ultrasound imaging","2019","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) results in loss of ambulation for the patients. Ultrasound attenuation correlates with fat content in muscles, resulting in changes in signal frequency. The Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) allows time–frequency analysis with high time–frequency resolution. This study explored the feasibility of using the instantaneous frequency (IF) obtained from the HHT to diagnose the walking function of patients with DMD. Eighty-five participants (12 control and 73 patients with DMD) underwent a standard-care ultrasound examination of the gastrocnemius to acquire raw image data for ultrasound B-mode and IF calculations, which were compared with the DMD stage using Pearson correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. With increasing DMD stage, the median IF decreased from 7.25 to 7.01 MHz (the correlation coefficient r = ?0.73; the probability value p < 0.0001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.97 when using ultrasound IF to discriminate between ambulatory and nonambulatory patients (accuracy: 91.76%; sensitivity: 93.75%; and specificity: 90.57%). The study reveals that ultrasound IF has great potential in DMD evaluation and management. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Correlation methods; Mathematical transformations; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonics; Ultrasonography; Area under the ROC curve; Correlation coefficient; Duchenne muscular dystrophies; Instantaneous frequency; Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis; Time frequency analysis; Ultrasound attenuation; Ultrasound frequency; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; adolescent; case control study; child; diagnostic imaging; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; echography; female; human; male; pathophysiology; physiology; preschool child; procedures; severity of illness index; skeletal muscle; walking; young adult; Adolescent; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Severity of Illness Index; Ultrasonography; Walking; Young Adult"
"Synthesizing electronic health records using improved generative adversarial networks","2019","Objective: The aim of this study was to generate synthetic electronic health records (EHRs). The generated EHR data will be more realistic than those generated using the existing medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN) method. Materials and Methods: We modified medGAN to obtain two synthetic data generation models-designated as medicalWasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (medWGAN) and medical boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN)-and compared the results obtained using the three models. We used 2 databases: MIMIC-III and National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Taiwan. First, we trained the models and generated synthetic EHRs by using these three 3 models. We then analyzed and compared the models' performance by using a few statistical methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, dimension-wise probability for binary data, and dimension-wise average count for count data) and 2 machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction). Results: We conducted a comprehensive analysis and found our models were adequately efficient for generating synthetic EHR data. The proposed models outperformed medGAN in all cases, and among the 3 models, boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN) performed the best. Discussion: To generate realistic synthetic EHR data, the proposed models will be effective in the medical industry and related research from the viewpoint of providing better services. Moreover, they will eliminate barriers including limited access to EHR data and thus accelerate research on medical informatics. Conclusion: The proposed models can adequately learn the data distribution of real EHRs and efficiently generate realistic synthetic EHRs. The results show the superiority of our models over the existing model. ?

"New idea for hair transplantation to preserve more donor hair follicles","2019","Higher risk of rapid progression in alopecia or male pattern baldness was observed in men who had family history. This could result from accumulation of DHT in hair follicles. Hair follicles on frontal region are more vulnerable to DHT. With development of minimal invasive hair transplantation surgery, hair follicles transplantation could be performed from frontal or occipital region to frontal region. However, limited hair follicles remained a problem. With development of technology of vitrification, we suggested extracting hair follicles from frontal region without affecting the appearance and preserving them with vitrification when the patient was young. When alopecia progressively developed, these extracted hair follicles would increase the donor number of hair follicles used for transplantation, which could extend longer dense hair appearance. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","androstanolone; androgen; autoimmunity; blastocyst; cryopreservation; cryoprotection; crystallization; cytotoxicity; disease course; embryo development; family history; fertility preservation; hair follicle; hair growth; hair transplantation; human; in vitro fertilization; Letter; life expectancy; male type alopecia; malignant neoplasm; microinjection; oocyte maturation; skin donor; sperm preservation; survival rate; vitrification; alopecia; donor; hair; hair follicle; head; male; metabolism; physiology; theoretical model; transplantation; vitrification; Alopecia; Androgens; Hair; Hair Follicle; Head; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Tissue Donors; Vitrification"

"Assessing vascularity of osseous spinal metastases with dual-energy CT-DSA: A pilot study compared with catheter angiography","2019","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spine debulking surgery in patients with hypervascular spinal metastasis is associated with massive intraoperative blood loss, but currently, the vascularity of tumor is determined by invasive conventional angiography or dynamic contrast MR imaging. We aimed to investigate the usefulness of noninvasive dual-energy CT-DSA, comparing it with conventional angiography in evaluating the vascularity of spinal metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study from January to December 2018. A total of 15 patients with spinal metastasis undergoing dual-energy CT, conventional DSA, and subsequent debulking surgery were included. CT-DSA images were produced after rigid-body registration and subtraction between CT phases. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of tumor vascularity were conducted. Correlations between CT-DSA and conventional DSA results were evaluated using the Spearman coefficient. The mean enhancement in the estimated tumor volume and surgical blood loss was compared between hypervascular and nonhypervascular groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS: The CT-DSA and DSA results were strongly correlated, with ρ = 0.87 (P < .001). The DSA and the quantitative enhancement index also showed a strong correlation with ρ = 0.83 (P < .001). Wilcoxon rank sum testing between hypervascular and nonhypervascular CT-DSA groups showed a difference in enhancement indices (P=.0003). The blood loss between the hypervascular and nonhypervascular groups was nonsignificant (P = .09). CONCLUSIONS: Dual-energy CT-DSA correlates well with conventional DSA in assessing the vascularity of spinal metastasis. It may serve as a noninvasive preoperative evaluation option before debulking surgery. ? 2019 American Society of Neuroradiology.

"Health effects of seasonal variation in cardiovascular hemodynamics among workers in forest environments","2019","Seasonal variation in cardiovascular functions (CVFs) associated with climatic changes is an important emerging public health issue. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate seasonal variation in CVFs by comparing intra-individual differences between winter and summer among people working in a forest environment and to discuss the possible mechanisms accounting for the health effects of seasonal variation in cardiovascular hemodynamics. A total of 72 staff members of the Experimental Forest of National Taiwan University were recruited for continuous health monitoring during two seasons to investigate the intra-individual seasonal variation in CVFs, complete blood counts, and biochemical examinations. CVFs were assessed by measuring the arterial pressure waveform by a cuff sphygmomanometer using an oscillometric blood pressure device, and aortic stiffness was measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). The results showed that cholesterol levels, white and red blood cell counts, and platelet counts were higher in winter than in summer. Subjects showed not only higher vascular stress, as indicated by higher levels of brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), central end-SBP and DBP, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and baPWV, but also lower cardiac activities, including lower levels of heart rate, left ventricular contractility, and cardiac output in winter than in summer. The central and brachial BP, cardiac output, SVR, and baPWV were significantly associated with temperature changes in seasonal variation after controlling related confounding factors. This study provides evidence of higher vascular stress and susceptibility to atherothrombosis during winter compared with summer. ? 2018, The Japanese Society of Hypertension.","adult; ankle brachial index; arterial stiffness; artery compliance; artery resistance; Article; biochemical analysis; blood cell count; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; climate change; ecosystem monitoring; electrocardiography; environmental impact; environmental temperature; female; forest; glucose blood level; heart function; heart left ventricle contractility; heart output; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; middle aged; normal human; oral glucose tolerance test; oscillometry; physical activity; platelet count; public health problem; pulse wave; questionnaire; seasonal variation; sphygmomanometry; systemic vascular resistance; systolic blood pressure; thrombosis"
"Predictive value of PD-L1 and other clinical factors for chemoimmunotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer","2019","We investigate if PD-L1 expression and other clinical characteristics predict chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) benefits versus chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of CIT versus chemotherapy identified through electronic searches. In seven randomized controlled trials (n = 4170), CIT prolonged progression-free survival over chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.58-0.67; p < 0.00001). The treatment benefits differed between PD-L1-high (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.34-0.49) and PD-L1 low (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.55-0.72; interaction-p = 0.00002) and PD-L1-high and PD-L1-negative (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.65-0.80; interaction-p < 0.00001).

"Acute sensorineural hearing loss in patients with vestibular schwannoma early after cyberknife radiosurgery","2019","Objective: This study reviewed our experience in treating patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) who had acute sensorineural hearing loss (ASHL) early after radiosurgery. Patients and methods: Seventy VS patients underwent cyberknife radiosurgery. Of them, 6 patients had ASHL early (<6 m) after radiosurgery (Group A), accounting for 8.6% prevalence. The remaining 64 patients without ASHL were assigned to Group B. Another 10 VS patients with tiny tumor and serviceable hearing adopted observation policy (Group C). All patients underwent a test battery for inner ear function, and tumor size was measured via MR imaging. Results: The mean hearing level of Group A was 39 ± 16 dB before radiosurgery, which deteriorated to 67 ± 14 dB at the onset of ASHL after radiosurgery. Three months after treatment for ASHL, hearing improvement was noted in only one patient (17%). Mean tumor volumes of Group A before and after ASHL were 1.54 ± 1.48 cc and 1.33 ± 1.04 cc, respectively, showing non-significant difference. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff value for tumor size was 1.45 cm for predicting absence of ASHL, with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 67%. In contrast, Group C with mean tumor size of 0.64 ± 0.15 cm adopted observation policy, and none of them had ASHL two years after diagnosis. Conclusion: Prevalence of ASHL in VS patients early after radiosurgery is 8.6%, likely due to radiation injury to the cochlear nerve. Thus, when tumor size is <1.45 cm, serviceable hearing is the criteria for determining whether observation policy (with serviceable hearing) or radiosurgery (lack of serviceable hearing) is given. For those tumor sizes ranged 1.45–3.0 cm, radiosurgery is indicated regardless of hearing level. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","acetylcysteine; iohexol; plasma substitute; acoustic neuroma; acute disease; adult; Article; audiometry; controlled study; cyberknife radiosurgery; female; headache; hearing; hearing impairment; human; inner ear; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; perception deafness; prevalence; priority journal; radiosurgery; sensitivity and specificity; tinnitus; tumor volume; vertigo; vestibular test"

"Acute outcomes for cryoablation in pediatric patients with perinodal tachyarrhythmia: Single center report","2019","Background: Cryoablation is an alternative treatment for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and right anteroseptal and midseptal accessory pathways (APs) with a low complication rate. A high recurrence rate is still a concern in pediatric patients. Methods: From February 2015 to March 2017, all consecutive patients who underwent cryoablation for supraventricular tachycardia were included in this study. The demographic and clinical data of the patients were reviewed. Results: Fifty-two patients (AVNRT 43, anteroseptal and midseptal AP 9) were enrolled, including 24 males and 28 females. The median age at the time of the procedure was 15.6 years. For patients with AVNRT, 34 (79.1%) had the typical form, 5 had the atypical form (11.6%), and another 4 had both forms. For AP, four patients had right midseptal and 5 had right anteroseptal APs. The median total procedure time was 114 min (range 69-331 min), and the median fluoroscopy time was 25.9 min (range 9.2-99.6 min). After a median 6 attempts of cryomapping and 3 of cryoablation, the arrhythmia substrate was successfully ablated in 51 of 52 patients (98.1%). Ten developed transient second degree atrioventricular (AV) block and one developed transient third degree AV block, but none had permanent AV block or other complications. After a mean follow-up of 1.95 ± 0.54 years (range 1.1-2.86 years), there were three cases of recurrence (5.9%). The mean number of cryoablations decreased from 6.6 ± 6.4 (early group) to 3.1 ± 2.6 (late group) (p = 0.01) after a 1-year learning period. Conclusions: Cryoablation for AVNRT and anteroseptal and midseptal APs in pediatric and adolescent patients is safe and effective. ? 2019, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

"Exploratory subgroup analysis of patients with prior trastuzumab use in the ATTRACTION-2 trial: a randomized phase III clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in patients with advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer","2020","Background: Data on immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer are lacking. Because HER2 status was not captured in the ATTRACTION-2 trial, we used patients with prior trastuzumab use (Tmab+) as surrogate for HER2 expression status to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab as third- or later-line therapy in these patients. Methods: In ATTRACTION-2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 multicenter trial, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive nivolumab (3?mg/kg) or placebo every 2?weeks until disease progression or toxicity requiring study discontinuation. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety were assessed. Results: Of 493 enrolled patients, 81 (nivolumab, n = 59; placebo, n = 22) were Tmab+ and 412 (nivolumab, n = 271; placebo, n = 141) were Tmab?.

"Development and validation of a geometrically personalized finite element model of the lower ligamentous cervical spine for clinical applications","2019","Epidemiological and clinical studies show that the magnitude and scope of cervical disease are on the rise, along with the world's rising aging population. From a biomechanical perspective, the cervical spine presents a wide inter-individual variability, where its motion patterns and load sharing strongly depend on the anatomy. This study aimed to first develop and validate a geometrically patient-specific model of the lower cervical spine for clinical applications, and secondly to use the model to investigate the spinal biomechanics associated with typical cervical disorders. Based on measurements of 30 parameters from X-ray radiographs, the 3D geometry of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs (IVDs) were developed, and detailed finite element models (FEMs) of the lower ligamentous cervical spine for 6 subjects were constructed and simulated. The models were then used for the investigation of different grades of IVD alteration. The multi directional range of motion (ROM) results were in alignment with the in-vitro and in-Silico studies confirming the validity of the model. Severe disc alteration (Grade 3) presented a significant decrease in the ROM and intradiscal pressure (flexion, extension, and axial rotation) on the C5-C6 and slightly increase on the adjacent levels. Maximum stress in Annulus Fibrosus (AF) and facet joint forces increased for Grade 3 for both altered and adjacent levels. The novel validated geometrically-personalized FEM presented in this study potentially offers the clinical community a valuable quantitative tool for the noninvasive analyses of the biomechanical alterations associated with cervical spine disease towards improved surgical planning and enhanced clinical outcomes. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomechanics; Cervical spine; Clinical application; Disc alteration; Individual variability; Intradiscal pressures; Noninvasive analysis; Patient specific model; Personalized model; Finite element method; element; annulus fibrosus; Article; axial rotation; biomechanics; cervical spine; cervical spine injury; cervical spine radiography; cervical vertebra; clinical article; clinical outcome; computer model; extension; finite element analysis; flexion; geometry; human; in vitro study; intervertebral disk; intervertebral disk degeneration; ligament; mechanical stress; nucleus pulposus; priority journal; range of motion; spine malformation; spinous process; spondylolisthesis; transverse process; vertebra body"
"Oxygen desaturation during the 6-min walk test as a risk for osteoporosis in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis","2019","Background: Osteoporosis is a common comorbidity in non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis patients. We determined whether desaturation during 6-min walk test (6MWT) can be a predictor for osteoporosis risk. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. Sixty-six non-CF bronchiectasis patients were enrolled. Lung function, walking distance, the lowest oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), the fall in SpO 2 (ΔSpO 2 ), and the distance-saturation product (DSP) were determined during the 6MWT. Desaturators (n = 45) were defined as those with ΔSpO 2 &gt; 10% or the lowest SpO 2 &lt; 88%. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The severity of non-CF bronchiectasis was evaluated using high-resolution computed tomography. Results: Osteoporosis was evident in more desaturators (82%) than non-desaturators (43%, p &lt; 0.01). BMD at the level of the femoral neck was significantly lower in desaturators than in non-desaturators (- 3.6 ± 1.1 vs. - 2.4 ± 0.9, p &lt; 0.01). BMD was correlated positively with the lowest SpO 2 and negatively with ΔSpO 2 and severe exacerbations. In multivariate linear regression analysis, desaturation during 6MWT was the most significant predictive factor for osteoporosis (95% confidence interval - 1.60 to - 0.26, p = 0.01). Other risk factors included old age, low body mass index and severe exacerbation. Conclusions: Exertional desaturation during the 6MWT was a significant predictive factor for osteoporosis in Asian non-CF bronchiectasis patients. The 6MWT may be useful in identifying the osteoporotic phenotype of non-CF bronchiectasis and increasing clinician awareness to promote early intervention. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; adult; age distribution; age distribution; aged; aged; Article; Article; Asian; Asian; body mass; body mass; bone density; bone density; bronchiectasis; bronchiectasis; computer assisted tomography; computer assisted tomography; confidence interval; confidence interval; controlled study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cross-sectional study; disease exacerbation; disease exacerbation; disease severity; disease severity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; female; femoral neck; femoral neck; human; human; linear regression analysis; linear regression analysis; lung fibrosis; lung fibrosis; lung function; lung function; major clinical study; major clinical study; male; male; osteoporosis; osteoporosis; oxygen desaturation; oxygen desaturation; oxygen saturation; oxygen saturation; retrospective study; retrospective study; risk factor; risk factor; six minute walk test; six minute walk test; walking distance; walking distance; blood; bronchiectasis; comorbidity; complication; exercise tolerance; forced expiratory volume; middle aged; multivariate analysis; osteoporosis; pathophysiology; predictive value; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; walk test; x-ray computed tomography; oxygen; Aged; Bone Density; Bronchiectasis; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Osteoporosis; Oxygen; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Walk Test"
"Sodium thiosulfate enhances production of polysaccharides and anticancer activities of sulfated polysaccharides in Antrodia cinnamomea","2019","Sulfated polysaccharides (SPSs) are polysaccharides (PSs) with high sulfate functionalization and possess bioactivities. This study aimed to increase the sulfate content of SPSs in Antrodia cinnamomea through sulfate feeding. Feeding A. cinnamomea with sodium thiosulfate was found to increase yields of PSs and SPSs in A. cinnamomea. The SPSs thus obtained (ST-SPS) were further isolated, showing enhanced sulfate content of 2.5 mmol/g. Sodium thiosulfate induced changes in molecular weight from 320 kDa to 1342 kDa, and area percentage of low-molecular-weight ST-SPS (< 20 kDa) was decreased. Functional studies revealed that sodium thiosulfate increased the ST-SPS anticancer efficacy in cancer cells via inhibition of EGFR/AKT signaling. Moreover, the ST-SPS enhanced synergistically cisplatin-, gefitinib- and 5 FU-induced cytotoxic effects in lung cancer H1975 cells and colon cancer CT26 cells. This study is the first to demonstrate that sodium thiosulfate induced changes in properties of A. cinnamomea with the anticancer mechanisms of ST-SPS. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cell signaling; Diseases; Molecular weight; Polysaccharides; Sulfur compounds; Anti-cancer mechanism; Anticancer activities; Antrodia cinnamomea; Cytotoxic effects; Functionalizations; Low molecular weight; Sodium thiosulfate; Sulfated polysaccharides; Sodium compounds; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor; fluorouracil; gefitinib; polysaccharide; sodium thiosulfate; sulfate; thiosulfate; animal; Antrodia; apoptosis; biosynthesis; chemistry; drug effect; drug potentiation; human; IC50; isolation and purification; metabolism; molecular weight; mouse; phosphorylation; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Antrodia; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; Drug Synergism; ErbB Receptors; Fluorouracil; Gefitinib; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Mice; Molecular Weight; Phosphorylation; Polysaccharides; Signal Transduction; Sulfuric Acid Esters; Thiosulfates"

"Sleep Duration and Proteinuria Progression: A Population-Based Cohort Study","2019","Background: Extensive studies have demonstrated that sleep is an important modulator of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, its impact on renal function remains uncertain. Methods: A total of 26,249 adults aged ?20 years were recruited through voluntary health examinations in Taiwan. Sleep duration was self-reported by questionnaire. Proteinuria was graded semi-quantitatively by dipstick urine test. The associations of sleep duration with proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were analyzed. Results: After an average follow-up period of 2.62 years, the crude hazard ratio (HR) for proteinuria progression were 1.92 (95% CI 1.22-3.03), 1.23 (95% CI 1.09-1.39), and 1.18 (95% CI 1.00-1.39) for those with sleep duration < 4, 4-6, and > 8 h compared to those with sleep duration of 6-8 h (the reference group), respectively. The HR remained significant for those with sleep duration < 4 h (adjusted HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.05-2.61]) and 4-6 h (adjusted HR 1.19 [95% CI 1.06-1.35]) after adjustment for age, sex, blood pressure, fasting glucose, body mass index, cholesterols, triglycerides, uric acids, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, income/educational levels, and baseline eGFR.

"Establishing a quick screening method by using a microfluidic chip to evaluate cytotoxicity of metal contaminants","2019","Due to rapid industrialization and urbanization, the environment is exposed to many chemicals from natural or anthropogenic sources. The contaminants impact eco-system and human health via food chain. Animals, including humans, are likely to accumulate contaminants in their bodies from direct exposure or feeding behavior, resulting in toxicity. Therefore, evaluation of the toxicity of contaminants is an important issue. Metals are highly toxic but the toxicity depends on many factors, including the valance and the complex form of metals, the organic matter level in the environment, the reducing/oxidizing condition of the environment, and etc. Since the level of metal amount does not directly correlate to bioavailability, cell culture is usually used for toxicity evaluation. In this study, a microfluidic chip was developed to evaluate the cell toxicity from exposure to metals, copper and thallium. Compared to traditional cytotoxicity assay using static state culture with tetrazolium reagent, this microfluidic chip can generate various shear stresses by changing geometry of culture areas or flow rate. Enhancement of shear stresses could increase cell sensitivity toward metal exposure. Therefore, this platform provides a more sensitive platform for quantitative analysis of cell toxicity and could be applied to evaluate toxicity from environmental samples. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biochemistry; Cell culture; Contamination; Copper; Fluidic devices; Metals; Microfluidics; Shear flow; Shear stress; Thallium; Toxicity; Anthropogenic sources; Cell sensitivity; Cytotoxicity assays; Environmental sample; Feeding behavior; Metal contaminants; Microfluidic chip; Screening methods; Cytotoxicity; copper; thallium; anthropogenic source; bioavailability; copper; pollution exposure; quantitative analysis; shear stress; thallium; toxicity; Article; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell structure; controlled study; cytotoxicity; fibroblast; flow rate; human; human cell; lethality; microfluidic analysis; pollutant; priority journal; quantitative analysis; shear stress; Animalia"
"Ambient particulate air pollution and daily mortality in 652 cities","2019","BACKGROUND The systematic evaluation of the results of time-series studies of air pollution is challenged by differences in model specification and publication bias. METHODS We evaluated the associations of inhalable particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) and fine PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) with daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality across multiple countries or regions. Daily data on mortality and air pollution were collected from 652 cities in 24 countries or regions. We used overdispersed generalized additive models with random-effects meta-analysis to investigate the associations. Two-pollutant models were fitted to test the robustness of the associations. Concentration–response curves from each city were pooled to allow global estimates to be derived. RESULTS On average, an increase of 10 μg per cubic meter in the 2-day moving average of PM10 concentration, which represents the average over the current and previous day, was associated with increases of 0.44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.50) in daily all-cause mortality, 0.36% (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.43) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.58) in daily respiratory mortality. The corresponding increases in daily mortality for the same change in PM2.5 concentration were 0.68% (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.77), 0.55% (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.66), and 0.74% (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.95). These associations remained significant after adjustment for gaseous pollutants. Associations were stronger in locations with lower annual mean PM concentrations and higher annual mean temperatures. The pooled concentration–response curves showed a consistent increase in daily mortality with increasing PM concentration, with steeper slopes at lower PM concentrations. CONCLUSIONS Our data show independent associations between short-term exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 and daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality in more than 600 cities across the globe. These data reinforce the evidence of a link between mortality and PM concentration established in regional and local studies. (Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and others.)

"Development of a prediction model for breast cancer based on the national cancer registry in Taiwan","2019","Background: This study aimed to develop a prognostic model to predict the breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival for breast cancer patients in Asia and to demonstrate a significant difference in clinical outcomes between Asian and non-Asian patients. Methods: We developed our prognostic models by applying a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) data. A data-splitting strategy was used for internal validation, and a multivariable fractional polynomial approach was adopted for prognostic continuous variables. Subjects who were Asian, black, or white in the US-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were analyzed for external validation. Model discrimination and calibration were evaluated in both internal and external datasets. Results: In the internal validation, both training data and testing data calibrated well and generated good area under the ROC curves (AUC; 0.865 in training data and 0.846 in testing data). In the external validation, although the AUC values were larger than 0.85 in all populations, a lack of model calibration in non-Asian groups revealed that racial differences had a significant impact on the prediction of breast cancer mortality. For the calibration of breast cancer-specific mortality, P values < 0.001 at 1 year and 0.018 at 4 years in whites, and P values ? 0.001 at 1 and 2 years and 0.032 at 3 years in blacks, indicated that there were significant differences (P value < 0.05) between the predicted mortality and the observed mortality. Our model generally underestimated the mortality of the black population. In the white population, our model underestimated mortality at 1 year and overestimated it at 4 years. And in the Asian population, all P values > 0.05, indicating predicted mortality and actual mortality at 1 to 4 years were consistent. Conclusions: We developed and validated a pioneering prognostic model that especially benefits breast cancer patients in Asia. This study can serve as an important reference for breast cancer prediction in the future. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; area under the curve; Article; Asian; Black person; breast cancer; calibration; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cancer specific survival; cancer survival; Caucasian; female; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; overall survival; prediction; race difference; receiver operating characteristic; Taiwan; validation process"
"Effects of Support Interventions in Women Hospitalized With Preterm Labor","2019","This study was to examine the effects of support interventions on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in women hospitalized with preterm labor. A randomized, single-blind experimental design was used. Participants were recruited from maternity wards of one medical center in Taiwan. The control group (n = 103) received routine nursing care, and intervention group (n = 140) received interventional support during hospitalization. The Beck Anxiety Inventory, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire were used at admission and 2 weeks of hospitalization. For the control group, anxiety and depression scores increased significantly and quality of life decreased 2 weeks after hospitalization. Participants who received 2 weeks of support intervention had significantly lower anxiety and depression scores than controls. Thus, clinical nurses can offer support interventions to improve anxiety and depression for women with preterm labor during hospitalization. ? The Author(s) 2017.",""
"H. pylori isolates with amino acid sequence polymorphisms as presence of both HtrA-L171 & CagL-Y58/E59 increase the risk of gastric cancer","2019","Background: H. pylori CagL-Y58/E59 increase gastric cancer risk by stronger binding with integrin to faciliate type IV secretory system (T4SS). H. pylori can secrete high temperature requirement A (HtrA) to mediate E-Cadherin cleavage for gastric epithelial junction disruption, so H. pylori CagL can adhere to integrin located on basolateral side of epithelium. The study test whether H. pylori HtrA amino acid polymorphisms can increase gastric cancer risk synergistically with CagL-Y58/E59. Methods: One-hundred and sixty-four H. pylori-positive patients, including 71 with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), 63 with peptic ulcers (PU), and 30 with gastric cancers (GC), were enrolled to receive upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to obtain gastric biopsies for H. pylori culture and histology by the updated Sydney system. Each isolate was screened for htrA & cagL genotype by polymerase chain reaction and HtrA & CagL-Y58/E59 amino acid sequence polymorphisms by sequencing. Results: The prevalence rates of htrA & cagL gene were both 100%. The HtrA amino acid sequence polymorphisms were not different between NUD and PU. The H. pylori isolates of GC had higher rates of HtrA residue 171 as leucine than those of NUD (73.3% vs. 50.7%, P = 0.036, OR[95%CI] = 2.7[1.1-6.8]). The risk of the H. pylori-infected subjects to get gastric cancer was increased up to 15.4-fold, if the infected isolates had presence of both HtrA-L171 and CagL-Y58/E59 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The H. pylori isolates of gastric cancer subjects had a higher rate of HtrA-L171. H. pylori isolates with presence of both HtrA-171 & CagL-Y58/E59 can synergistically increase the risk of gastric cancer. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; amino acid sequence; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; CagL gene; cancer risk; dyspepsia; female; gastrointestinal endoscopy; gene; genetic association; genotype; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; histology; HtrA gene; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonhuman; peptic ulcer; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; sequence analysis; stomach biopsy; stomach cancer; amino acid sequence; chemistry; genetic polymorphism; genetics; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; metabolism; microbiology; risk; stomach tumor; Taiwan; bacterial protein; cagL protein, Helicobacter pylori; serine proteinase; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Polymorphism, Genetic; Prevalence; Risk; Serine Endopeptidases; Stomach Neoplasms; Taiwan"
"Blood sugar control among type 2 diabetic patients who travel abroad: A cross sectional study","2019","The dose adjustment of anti-diabetic drugs during traveling abroad remains an important issue for the diabetic patients. However, there are few studies exploring the changes in blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) when traveling abroad. The study aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic episodes, sugar control, and associated factors during travel among patients with T2DM.A questionnaire was administrated to T2DM patients visiting the family medicine clinic in a medical center from September 2016 to April 2017. The Chi-square test was used to examine the differences in risk factors of hypoglycemia between hypoglycemic group and non-hypoglycemic group. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the risk factors for the hypoglycemia.A total of 65 males and 74 females completed the questionnaire. The mean age was 59.3?±?12.1 year olds, the mean BMI was 28.1?±?5.9?kg/m, and the mean HbA1C was 7.4?±?1.1%. There was 8.6% of diabetic patients reporting hypoglycemic episodes during travel. The hypoglycemic episodes were significantly related to the numbers of crossing time zones after adjusting for possible confounders. Only 21.6% of subjects told physicians their travel plan whereas two third of the physicians did not provide pre-travel consultation.The hypoglycemic episodes sometimes occurred and were related to the numbers of crossing time zones in diabetic travelers. The proportion of pre-travel consultation was low in patients with T2DM. Besides, most of the physicians did not offer pre-travel education when patients mentioned their traveling plan. The willing and ability of physicians to offer the pre-travel diabetic education deserved further investigation.","glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; aged; body mass; complication; cross-sectional study; drug effect; female; glucose blood level; human; hypoglycemia; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient education; questionnaire; retrospective study; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; travel; Aged; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Travel"
"Effect of nephrology referrals and multidisciplinary care programs on renal replacement and medical costs on patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: A retrospective cohort study","2019","Evidence-based studies have revealed outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease that differed depending on the design of care delivery. This study compared the effects of 3 types of nephrology care: multidisciplinary care (MDC), nephrology care, and non-nephrology care. We studied their effects on the risks of requiring dialysis and the differences between these methods had on long-term medical resource utilization and costs.We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of (eGFR) ?45mL/min/1.73m2 from 2005 to 2007. Patients were divided into MDC, non-MDC, and non-nephrology referral groups. Between-group differences with regard to the risk of requiring dialysis and annual medical utilization and costs were evaluated using a 5-year follow-up period.In total, 661 patients were included. After other covariates and the competing risk of death were taken into account, we observed a significant (56%) reduction in the incidence of dialysis in both the MDC and non-MDC groups relative to the non-nephrology referral group. Costs were markedly lower in the MDC group relative to the other groups (average savings: US$ 830 per year; 95% confidence interval: 367-1295; P&lt;.001).For patients without nephrology referrals, MDC can substantially reduce their risk of developing end-stage renal disease and lower their medical costs. We therefore strongly advocate that all patients with an eGFR of ?45mL/min/1.73m2 should be referred to a nephrologist and receive MDC. ? 2019 the Author(s).

"Metformin and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in diabetes patients","2019","Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether metformin can affect risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Methods: T2D patients newly diagnosed during 1999–2005 were enrolled from the reimbursement database of Taiwan's National Health Insurance system and followed up to 31 December 2011. Analyses were conducted in an unmatched cohort (92,272 ever-users and 10,697 never-users of metformin) and a propensity score (PS) matched pair cohort (10,697 ever-users and 10,697 never-users). Cox regression incorporated into the inverse probability of treatment weighting using the PS was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Results: In the unmatched cohort, 2573 never-users and 13,840 ever-users developed COPD with respective incidences of 5994.64 and 3393.19 per 100,000 person-years. The overall HR was 0.560 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.537–0.584). HRs for the first (< 25.27 months), second (25.27–55.97 months) and third (> 55.97 months) tertiles of cumulative duration were 1.021 (0.975–1.070), 0.575 (0.548–0.603) and 0.265 (0.252–0.280), respectively. Analyses of the matched cohort showed an overall HR of 0.643 (0.605–0.682), with HRs of 1.212 (1.122–1.309), 0.631 (0.578–0.689) and 0.305 (0.273–0.340) for the respective tertiles.

"Clinical outcomes in patients with biopsy-proved diabetic nephropathy compared to isolated lupus or crescentic glomerulonephritis","2019","Aims: Diabetic nephropathy (DMN) is usually diagnosed clinically without pathology, and the prognosis of which compared to non-diabetic renal diseases has rarely been investigated especially in ethnic Chinese population. Here we reported the outcome of patients with biopsy-proved DMN compared to those with isolated crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) or lupus nephritis (LN). Methods: This retrospective observational study included patients with DMN (n = 55), crescentic GN (n = 48) and LN (n = 82) from an original cohort of 987 adult patients who underwent kidney biopsy. The median follow-up period was 8.3 years. The Cox regression model was used to identify factors associated with the outcome measures of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and all-cause mortality. Results: Patients with DMN and crescentic GN exhibited higher rates of ESRD than LN group (65.5%, 66.7% versus 32.9%, p < 0.001). After accounting for the competing risk of death, DMN versus LN, along with lower hemoglobin values, lower estimated glomerular filtration rates and severe proteinuria were independent predictors for ESRD. Patients with DMN and crescentic GN displayed higher mortality rates than LN patients following the development of ESRD (38.2% and 29.2% versus 9.8%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed old age (≧65 years) and lower serum albumin levels were independently associated with overall death. Conclusions: Patients with biopsy-proved DMN, but not crescentic GN, showed a greater risk of ESRD than LN counterparts. Given the grave renal prognosis of DMN, more meticulous follow-up is critical to ensure that best therapeutic strategies are used to avert progression to ESRD. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","albumin; hemoglobin; adult; aged; aging; albumin blood level; all cause mortality; Article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; diabetic nephropathy; disease association; disease course; disease severity; end stage renal disease; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; follow up; hemoglobin blood level; human; human tissue; kidney biopsy; lupus erythematosus nephritis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; mortality risk; observational study; outcome assessment; predictor variable; prognosis; proteinuria; rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis; retrospective study; acute disease; biopsy; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; complication; diabetic nephropathy; disease exacerbation; glomerulonephritis; kidney; lupus erythematosus nephritis; mortality; pathology; young adult; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Biopsy; Cohort Studies; Diabetic Nephropathies; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glomerulonephritis; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Lupus Nephritis; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult"
"Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors sensitize topoisomerase II inhibitors in killing prostate cancer through PDE5-independent impairment of HR and NHEJ DNA repair systems","2019","Human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a significant target of clinical research. The use of DNA-damaging agents has a long history in cancer chemotherapy but is limited by their toxicities. The combination with a safer drug can be a strategy in reducing dosage and toxicity while increasing anticancer activity in CRPC treatment. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are used to treat erectile dysfunction through the selective inhibition of PDE5 that is responsible for cGMP degradation in the corpus cavernosum. Several studies have reported that PDE5 inhibitors display protective effect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The combinatory treatment of CRPC with doxorubicin and PDE5 inhibitors has been studied accordingly. The data demonstrated that sildenafil or vardenafil (two structure-related PDE5 inhibitors) but not tadalafil (structure-unrelated to sildenafil) sensitized doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in CRPC cells with deteriorating the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, and amplifying caspase activation. Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair systems were inhibited in the apoptotic sensitization through detection of nuclear foci formation of Rad51 and DNA end-binding of Ku80. PDE5 knockdown to mimic the exposure to PDE5 inhibitors did not reproduce apoptotic sensitization, suggesting a PDE5-independent mechanism. Not only doxorubicin, sildenafil combined with other inhibitors of topoisomerase II but not topoisomerase I also triggered apoptotic sensitization. In conclusion, the data suggest that sildenafil and vardenafil induce PDE5-independent apoptotic sensitization to doxorubicin (or other topoisomerase II inhibitors) through impairment of both HR and NHEJ repair systems that are evident by a decrease of nuclear Rad51 levels and their foci formation in the nucleus, and an inhibition of Ku80 DNA end-binding capability. The combinatory treatment may enable an important strategy for anti-CRPC development. ? 2019 Chang, Hsu, Sheng, Leu, Yu, Chan, Chan, Hsu, Liu and Guh.","caspase; caspase 3; cyclic GMP; doxorubicin; gyrase inhibitor; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; phosphodiesterase V; phosphodiesterase V inhibitor; protein BAD; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; protein bcl xl; protein mcl 1; Rad51 protein; sildenafil; small interfering RNA; vardenafil; apoptosis; Article; cardiotoxicity; castration resistant prostate cancer; cell anchorage; cell cycle; colony formation; comet assay; corpus cavernosum; DNA end joining repair; DNA fragmentation; DNA repair; down regulation; drug protein binding; enzyme activation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; gene knockdown; genetic transfection; homologous recombination; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; male; phenotype; prostate cancer; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; sensitization; spectrophotometry; Western blotting"
"TRAIL suppresses gut inflammation and inhibits colitogeic T-cell activation in experimental colitis via an apoptosis-independent pathway","2019","Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces cell apoptosis by transducing apoptosis signals. Recently, accumulating evidence demonstrated that TRAIL regulates autoimmune inflammation and immune cell homeostasis in several autoimmune animal models, suggesting a novel immunoregulatory role of TRAIL in autoimmune diseases. However, the impact of TRAIL in inflammatory bowel disease is yet undefined. This study is to address the therapeutic effects and immunoregulatory role of TRAIL in autoimmune gut inflammation. We demonstrated herein that TRAIL significantly suppressed gut inflammation and reduced the severity of colitis in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model. Suppression of gut inflammation was not due to induction of apoptosis in colonic T cells, dendritic cells, or epithelium cells by TRAIL. In contrast, TRAIL directly inhibited activation of colitogenic T cells and development of gut inflammation in an adoptive transfer-induced colitis model. The anti-inflammatory effects of TRAIL on colitis were abolished when T cells from TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) knockout mice were adoptively transferred, suggesting that TRAIL regulates autoreactive colitogenic T-cell activation in the development of gut inflammation. Our results demonstrate that TRAIL effectively inhibited colonic T-cell activation and suppressed autoimmune colitis, suggesting a potential therapeutic application of TRAIL in human inflammatory bowel disease. ? 2019, The Author(s).","complement component C5a; CXCL9 chemokine; gamma interferon; interleukin 16; interleukin 17; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 33; RANTES; recombinant tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; stromal cell derived factor 1; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor; adoptive transfer-induced colitis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; dendritic cell; dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis; disease severity; enteritis; epithelium cell; experimental colitis; female; immunoregulation; knockout mouse; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein protein interaction; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation"
"Human leukocyte antigen and demographic characteristics in Chinese patients with active peripheral type psoriatic arthritis who had inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in a single dermatologic clinic","2019","Background Correlation between severity of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is inconsistent. Also, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Cw6 was found to be underrepresented in severe psoriasis who failed conventional systemic therapies, but the effect of HLA polymorphism on PsA severity needs to be confirmed. Objectives To describe the severity of psoriasis, demographic features and HLA polymorphism among Chinese patients with active peripheral type PsA who had inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Methods We included all patients with PsA who had at least 3 tender and swollen peripheral joints despite at least two conventional non-biologic treatments in our clinic. Demographic results were compared with global pivotal studies of biologics for PsA. HLA-Cw and HLA-DRB1 genotyping was also analyzed. Results We identified 60 patients who met our inclusion criteria. The male to female ratio was 1.31:1. The majority of patients presented with psoriasis first (81.7%). The mean interval between psoriasis and PsA was 7.2 ± 8.1 years (mean ± SD). The baseline number of tender and swollen joints was 14.9 ± 10.7 and 11.3 ±10.2, respectively. In total, 41.7% subjects had more than 3% body surface area involvement of psoriasis. Genotyping of HLA-Cw and HLA-DRB1 was performed in 47 subjects. HLA-Cw*0702 was the most frequent allele (29.8%), followed by HLA-Cw*01 (26.6%). The frequency of HLA-Cw*0602 allele was similar to normal population. The most frequent HLA-DRB1 allele was HLA-DRB1*04 (20.2%), followed by HLA-DRB1*08 (16.0%). No cases carrying HLA-DRB1*13 were detected. Conclusions Compared with Western population, our patients had less psoriasis and PsA burden. The frequencies of HLA-Cw*06, HLA-Cw*12, and HLA-DRB1*07 were not increased. In contrast, HLA-Cw*0702 and HLA-DRB1*08 allele frequencies were increased compared with psoriasis patients and normal population in Taiwan. Future studies are still needed to characterize the demographic and genetic features of high need PsA patients. ? 2019 Sin et al.

Patients: All patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for more than 90 days between 2000 and 2005 were recruited for this study. Pairwise matching (1:1) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker groups resulted in two similar subgroups with 5,959 patients in each. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was sepsis, and the secondary outcome was death. The occurrence rate of sepsis was 3.67 per 100 person-years for the patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 2.87 per 100 person-years for those receiving angiotensin receptor blockers. In addition, the patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had a higher risk of septic shock (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.26-1.67) and mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22-1.40) than those receiving angiotensin receptor blockers. No matter whether the patients had prior severe exacerbation before the index date, those receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had a higher risk of sepsis, septic shock, and mortality than those receiving angiotensin receptor blockers (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: Angiotensin receptor blockers were associated with lower rates of sepsis and mortality than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The similar findings were also noted in subgroup analysis. Copyright ? 2018 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Biofilms in Chronic Wounds: Pathogenesis and Diagnosis","2019","Chronic non-healing wounds have become a major worldwide healthcare burden. The impact of biofilms on chronic wound infection is well established. Despite increasing understanding of the underlying mechanism of biofilm formation in chronic wounds, current strategies for biofilm diagnosis in chronic wounds are still far from ideal. In this review, we briefly summarize the mechanism of biofilm formation and focus on current diagnostic approaches of chronic wound biofilms based on morphology, microbiology, and molecular assays. Innovative biotechnological approaches, such as wound blotting and transcriptomic analysis, may further shed light on this unmet clinical need. The continuous development of these sophisticated diagnostic approaches can markedly contribute to the future implementation of point-of-care biofilm detection in chronic wound care. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biotechnology; Diagnosis; Biofilm formation; Biotechnological approaches; Chronic wounds; Continuous development; Diagnostic approach; Molecular assays; Point of care; wound blotting; Biofilms; biofilm; chronic wound; clinical feature; human; infection risk; pathogenesis; point of care testing; priority journal; Review; risk factor; transcriptomics; wound care; wound healing; wound infection"
"Graphene oxide and carbon dots as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents-a minireview","2019","Due to the increasing global population, growing contamination of water and air, and wide spread of infectious diseases, antibiotics are extensively used as a major antibacterial drug. However, many microbes have developed resistance to antibiotics through mutation over time. As an alternative to antibiotics, antimicrobial nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their advantageous properties and unique mechanisms of action toward microbes. They inhibit bacterial growth and destroy cells through complex mechanisms, making it difficult for bacteria to develop drug resistance, though some health concerns related to biocompatibility remain for practical applications. Among various antibacterial nanomaterials, carbon-based materials, especially graphene oxide (GO) and carbon dots (C-Dots), are promising candidates due to the ease of production and functionalization, high dispersibility in aqueous media, and promising biocompatibility. The antibacterial properties of these nanomaterials can be easily adjusted by surface modification. They are promising materials for future applications against multidrug-resistant bacteria based on their strong capacity in disruption of microbial membranes. Though many studies have reported excellent antibacterial activity of carbon nanomaterials, their impact on the environment and living organisms is of concern due to the accumulatory and cytotoxic effects. In this review, we discuss antimicrobial applications of the functional carbon nanomaterials (GO and C-Dots), their antibacterial mechanisms, factors affecting antibacterial activity, and concerns regarding cytotoxicity. ?

"Complete non-puerperal uterine inversion caused by uterine hemangioma: A case report","2019","Objective: Uterine inversion is a rare postpartum complication. Non-puerperal uterine inversion is extremely rare. It mostly occurs with uterine tumors, especially leiomyoma. In most instances, the inversion may not be noticed until the time of surgery. The preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Case report: We report a case of non-puerperal complete uterine inversion that was initially diagnosed as cervical cancer. The uterine inversion was diagnosed preoperatively and she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy. The histological examination showed uterine hemangioma. Conclusion: Accurate diagnosis of the non-puerperal uterine inversion is important. Surgical intervention is necessary and it provides good prognosis. Hemangioma may be one of the causes of non-puerperal uterine inversion. ? 2019","abdominal hysterectomy; adult; Article; case report; cavernous hemangioma; clinical article; disease association; female; histology; human; human tissue; leiomyoma; operative blood loss; preoperative period; prognosis; punch biopsy; salpingooophorectomy; uterine cervix cancer; uterine hemangioma; uterus inversion; uterus myoma; uterus tumor; vagina bleeding"
"Combined virtual-assisted lung mapping (VAL-MAP) with CT-guided localization in thoracoscopic pulmonary segmentectomy","2019","Background/Objective: Virtual assisted lung mapping (VAL-MAP) is a bronchoscopic lung marking technique developed to assist in navigational lung resection. It can be used for nodule localization and segmental identification. This article presents our initial experience of thoracoscopic pulmonary segmentectomy using combined VAL-MAP and computed tomography (CT)-guided localization. Material and methods: Markings with India Ink were made bronchoscopically, before surgery, using a virtual bronchoscopy system (LungPoint? Planner) without fluoroscopy guidance. Post VAL-MAP CT scans localized the actual markings. All data on patients, markings, and outcomes were retrospectively collected, and the contribution of VAL-MAP to the operation was graded by the surgeon. Results: From March 2017 to September 2017, 24 consecutive patients received the VAL-MAP marking procedure before thoracoscopic segmentectomy. Nineteen patients also received pre-operative CT-guided percutaneous localization after VAL-MAP; fifteen patients received CT-guided localization with dye (patent blue V) and microcoil, and four patients received with dye only. Of the 101 marking attempts made in all the patients, 71 (70.3%) were identified as contributing to the surgery. No clinically evident complications were associated with the procedure. A total of 24 segmentectomies were thoracoscopically conducted for 18 cases of lung cancer and six cases of benign diseases. Conclusion: The combination of VAL-MAP and CT-guided percutaneous localization contribute to precise thoracoscopic pulmonary segmentectomy. ? 2018","adult; aged; bronchoscopy; computer assisted surgery; diagnostic imaging; female; human; lung; lung resection; lung tumor; male; middle aged; procedures; thoracoscopy; virtual reality; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Bronchoscopy; Female; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonectomy; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Thoracoscopy; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Virtual Reality"
"Does awareness of death strengthen awareness of self? The effects of existential threat on self-focus","2019","Drawing on Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory, which suggests that human constructs typically contain their opposites. This study proposed that people facing death threat might be prompted to concern their existence, therefore pay more attentions on themselves. Two studies were conducted to explore the effects of death threat on self-focus. Study one analyzed data of six mortality salience experiments by using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program. Study two was a case study analyzing a cancer patient’s writings. Both studies found that people use more first-person singular pronouns when reminded of their mortality. The results indicated that death threat increases self-focus. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Targeting ROS and cPLA2/COX2 expressions ameliorated renal damage in obese mice with endotoxemia","2019","Obesity is associated with metabolic endotoxemia, reactive oxygen species (ROS), chronic inflammation, and obese kidney fibrosis. Although the fat-intestine-kidney axis has been documented, the pathomechanism and therapeutic targets of obese kidney fibrosis remain unelucidated. To mimic obese humans with metabolic endotoxemia, high-fat-diet-fed mice (HF group) were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to yield the obese kidney fibrosis-metabolic endotoxemia mouse model (HL group). Therapeutic effects of ROS, cytosolic phospholipases A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were analyzed with a quantitative comparison of immunohistochemistry stains and morphometric approach in the tubulointerstitium of different groups. Compared with basal and HF groups, the HL group exhibited the most prominent obese kidney fibrosis, tubular epithelial lipid vacuoles, and lymphocyte infiltration in the tubulointerstitium. Furthermore, inhibitors of nonspecific ROS, cPLA2 and COX-2 ameliorated the above renal damages. Notably, the ROS-inhibitor-treated group ameliorated not only oxidative injury but also the expression of cPLA2 and COX-2, indicating that ROS functions as the upstream signaling molecule in the inflammatory cascade of obese kidney fibrosis. ROS acts as a key messenger in the signaling transduction of obese kidney fibrosis, activating downstream cPLA2 and COX-2. The given antioxidant treatment ameliorates obese kidney fibrosis resulting from a combined high-fat diet and LPS-ROS could serve as a potential therapeutic target of obese kidney fibrosis with metabolic endotoxemia. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The association of indoxyl sulfate with fibroblast growth factor-23 in cats with chronic kidney disease","2019","Background: Indoxyl sulfate (IS) has been reported not only to increase with the severity of impaired renal function, but also possibly to be a factor associated with bone abnormalities linked to fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) in humans with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is not yet known whether this correlation between IS and FGF-23 holds true for cats with CKD. Hypothesis: Accumulation of IS is related to FGF-23 secretion in cats with CKD. Animals: Twenty clinically healthy cats and 73 cats with CKD cases were evaluated retrospectively. Methods: The concentrations of IS and FGF-23 in plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and ELISA, respectively. Progression was defined as an increment of 0.5 mg/dL of serum creatinine concentration within 3 months. Results: Plasma IS and FGF-23 concentrations were significantly increased concurrently with decreasing renal function. Higher concentration of FGF-23 was significantly associated with higher concentration of IS after adjusting for various confounding factors including creatinine and phosphate. Furthermore, the correlation between IS and phosphate was higher than that between FGF-23 and phosphate. When the renal progression group was compared with the non-progression group, both IS and FGF-23 were found to be significantly increased (P <.05). In addition, the area under receiver operator curve of the combination of IS and FGF-23 predicted renal progression at a level >0.9. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Both FGF-23 and IS are associated with phosphate metabolism and CKD progression. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Applied image processing techniques in video laryngoscope for occult tumor detection","2020","This study implemented image processing techniques for detecting small tumors in a video laryngoscope, as small tumor lesions often appear in the video for only a very short duration, and can even be missed. The aim of this research was to develop a larynx tumor detection system that could accurately mark the position of a tumor. In the laryngoscope images, the glottis and epiglottis images have apparent geometric and brightness features for image segmentation. According to the relevant positions of the two regions, the laryngeal part of the pharynx is divided into the radix linguae, hypopharynx, epiglottis, and glottis regions for marking the tumor. It could be adapted in laryngoscope images and effectively segmented the tumor contour in different locations. The tumor-correlated image processing procedure could then be implemented, and the tumor contour could be segmented. This study analyzed video laryngoscope data from 359 confirmed laryngeal cancer films, and the methods used were centered on image color space conversion, image enhancement, threshold selection, region-based segmentation, and dynamic information-based segmentation. This study demonstrated that the proposed system is a powerful tool for video laryngoscope analysis, especially for small and easily unnoticed tumors. The system identified and marked laryngeal tumors instantly and automatically with an accuracy of 97%. Overall, the system could ease and speed up the process of tumor detection as well as minimize the possibility of ENT doctors missing small or early-stage tumors. By being able to give timely and opportune treatment, patient quality of life could be improved. ? 2019","Cartilage; Color; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Patient treatment; Tumors; Video signal processing; Color space conversion; Dynamic information; Region-based segmentation; Threshold selection; Video laryngoscope; Color image processing; Article; cancer diagnosis; epiglottis tumor; glottis tumor; human; hypopharynx tumor; image processing; larynx tumor; priority journal; radix linguae tumor"
"From white to beige adipocytes: Therapeutic potential of dietary molecules against obesity and their molecular mechanisms","2019","The global incidence of obesity and its complications continue to rise along with a demand for novel therapeutic approaches. In addition to classic brown adipose tissue (BAT), the formation of brown-like adipocytes called beige adipocytes, within white adipose tissue (WAT), has attracted much attention as a therapeutic target due to its inducible features when stimulated, resulting in the dissipation of extra energy as heat. There are various dietary agents that are able to modulate the beige-development process by interacting with critical molecular signaling cascades, leading to the enhancement of thermogenesis. Although challenges still remain regarding the origin of the beige adipocytes, the crosstalk with activation of BAT and induction of the beiging of white fat may provide attractive potential strategies for management of obesity. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Molecules; Tissue; Adipose tissue; Development process; Molecular mechanism; Molecular signaling; Strategies for managements; Therapeutic potentials; Therapeutic targets; White adipose tissues; Nutrition; animal; beige adipocyte; diet; drug effect; energy metabolism; human; obesity; physiology; white adipocyte; Adipocytes, Beige; Adipocytes, White; Animals; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Obesity"
"PhantomLegs: Reducing virtual reality sickness using head-worn haptic devices","2019","Virtual Reality (VR) sickness occurs when exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to motion sickness, and has been one of the major user experience barriers of VR. To reduce VR sickness, prior work has explored dynamic field-of-view modification and galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) that recou-ples the visual and vestibular systems. We propose a new approach to reduce VR sickness, called PhantomLegs, that applies alternating haptic cues that are synchronized to users' footsteps in VR. Our prototype consists of two servos with padded swing arms, one set on each side of the head, that lightly taps the head as users walk in VR. We conducted a three-session, multi-day user study with 30 participants to evaluate its effects as users navigate through a VR environment while physically being seated. Results show that our approach significantly reduces VR sickness during the initial exposure while remaining comfortable to users. ? 2019 IEEE.","Biped locomotion; Diseases; User interfaces; Centered computing; Dynamic fields; Haptics; Human; Interaction techniques; Motion sickness; User experience; Vestibular system; Virtual reality"
"Two Cases of De Novo Pathological Gambling Associated With Aripiprazole","2019","Objectives Pathological gambling can be potentiated by treatment with dopamine agonists. Aripiprazole, bearing a partial agonist activity at dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, has also been linked to such a behavioral aberration, usually on subjects predisposed with tendency of impulsive or addictive behaviors. Methods Review of patient's medical records and literature review. Results Two young patients' pathological gambling emerged simply due to exposure to aripiprazole, neither related to manic or psychotic symptoms nor with history of addictive or impulsive behaviors. Their pathological gambling disappeared soon after switching aripiprazole to other antipsychotics. One patient has tested such a relationship by reexposure to aripiprazole while his compulsion to gamble recurred. Conclusions In addition to previously recognized risk factors, pathological gambling might occur in young patients whose history did not reveal an addictive tendency while they were sensitive to the pharmacological effect, as well as adverse effects, of psychotropic agents. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Phthalates and organophosphorus insecticide residues in shrimp determined by liquid/gas chromatography–Tandem mass spectrometry and a health risk assessment","2019","Shrimps are the most widely and increasingly cultured crustaceans in land-based ponds in Taiwan. However, few studies have investigated the phthalate contamination of and insecticide residues in shrimp. In this study, we applied a validated method to analyze the phthalate and 18 insecticides residues in shrimp. A total of 46 samples of whiteleg, grass, or giant river shrimp were collected from aquafarms and production areas in Taiwan. We detected 0.02–0.70 mg/kg of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in three shrimps; 0.02–0.03 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos in three shrimps, and 0.03 mg/kg of trichlorfon in one shrimp, indicating that 6.52% and 8.70% of the samples contained phthalate and insecticide residues, respectively. Furthermore, the assessed risk was negligible and indicated no immediate health risk associated with shrimp consumption. Continual monitoring of the residues in shrimps is critical for further assessment of possible effects on human health. ? 2019","Esters; Health; Health risks; Insecticides; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Risk assessment; Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate; Organophos-phorus pesticides; Organophosphorus insecticides; Phthalates; Residues; Shrimp; Tandem mass spectrometry; Validated methods; Shellfish; chlorpyrifos; metrifonate; organophosphate insecticide; phthalic acid; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; insecticide; organophosphorus compound; pesticide residue; phthalic acid; phthalic acid derivative; crustacean; gas chromatography; health risk; insecticide; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; organophosphorus pesticide; pesticide residue; phthalate; risk assessment; adult; Article; biological monitoring; female; food intake; giant river shrimp; health hazard; human; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; Palaemon pugio; Penaeus vannamei; residue analysis; risk assessment; shrimp; Taiwan; Taiwanese; analysis; animal; aquaculture; chemistry; liquid chromatography; mass fragmentography; Penaeidae; tandem mass spectrometry; water pollutant; Taiwan; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Animals; Aquaculture; Chromatography, Liquid; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Insecticides; Organophosphorus Compounds; Penaeidae; Pesticide Residues; Phthalic Acids; Risk Assessment; Taiwan; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Water Pollutants, Chemical"
"Persistence and adherence to rivastigmine in patients with dementia: Results from a noninterventional, retrospective study using the National Health Insurance research database of Taiwan","2019","Introduction: The objective of the study was to assess adherence and persistence of patients treated with rivastigmine versus donepezil. Methods: Persistence was calculated as the time from the first prescription date of rivastigmine/donepezil until discontinuation/medication switch/end of available data, whichever occurred first. Adherence was calculated as proportion of days covered and medication possession ratio. Results: A majority of patients persisted on 4.5 and 6 mg of rivastigmine for 429 and 468 days, respectively, versus 443 and 441 days for patients receiving 5 and 10 mg of donepezil daily, respectively. Patients who initially received 1.5 mg of oral rivastigmine required a shorter time to reach a stable dose compared with those who initiated treatment at a higher dose of rivastigmine. Patients at a stable dose of 4.5 or 6 mg of rivastigmine were observed to persist longer than those at a lower dose of rivastigmine and donepezil. Discussion: Although results indicate significant difference in persistence between rivastigmine and donepezil groups, clinical significance remains undetermined. ? 2018 The Authors","donepezil; rivastigmine; adult; Article; comparative study; controlled study; dementia; drug dose increase; female; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; national health insurance; patient compliance; prescription; priority journal; retrospective study; Taiwan; treatment duration; treatment outcome"
"Simple aminophenol-based electrochemical probes for non-enzymatic, dual amperometric detection of NADH and hydrogen peroxide","2019","Non enzymatic detection of NADH and H2O2 is of practical significance for both environmental and biological prospective. However, there is no simple, straight forward electrochemical sensor available for sensing of them in real samples. Addressing this challenge, we report a simple stimuli responsive aminophenol, pre-anodized screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE*/AP) based electrochemical probes for dual detection of NADH and H2O2. Aminophenol prepared and adsorbed on the electrode from aminophenylboronic acid via boronic acid deprotection with H2O2. The SPCE*/AP fabricated with this process was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Amperometric detection results showed that SPCE*/AP electrodes exhibited linearity from 50 ?M to 500 ?M and from 200 ?M to 2 mM with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 4.2 ?M and 28.9 ?M for NADH and H2O2, respectively. Excellent reproducibility and selectivity for NADH and H2O2 were observed for this electrochemical platform. In addition, the matrix effect was investigated further using the same technique to analyze NADH and H2O2 in human urine samples, human serum samples, cell culture medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum, FBS), and environmental water samples (tap water and rain water). Also, the present sensor demonstrated promising outcomes with living cells (normal cells and cancer cells). ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Body fluids; Cell culture; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrodes; Mammals; Probes; Scanning electron microscopy; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Aminophenol; Aminophenylboronic acid; Amperometric; H2O2; NADH; Preanodization; Screen-printed carbon electrodes; Electrochemical sensors; aminophenol derivative; carbon; fluorescent dye; hydrogen peroxide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; 3T3 cell line; animal; chemistry; electrochemical analysis; electrode; human; mouse; tumor cell line; 3T3 Cells; Aminophenols; Animals; Carbon; Cell Line, Tumor; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Mice; NAD"
"Autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma: Post-transplant outcomes of Taiwan Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry","2019","Background/Purpose: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal plasma cell malignancy. The primary choice of treatment for MM is induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). This study aimed to analyze the treatment efficacy of ASCT in a Taiwanese cohort and evaluate possible prognostic factors. Methods: From the database of the Taiwan Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, data on 396 patients with MM who underwent ASCT were reviewed. Results: The average age of participants was 54.8 years, and there were more men than women (57.6% vs. 42.4%). Most patients were diagnosed with IgG-type myeloma (52.4%), followed by IgA-type (23.2%) and light-chain type (21.4%). Patients with Durie Salmon Staging System (DSS) III disease accounted for 61.9% of the study cohort, while 23.7% had stage II and 14.4% had stage I disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after ASCT were 46.5 months and 70.4 months, respectively. DSS III was a poor prognostic factor affecting both PFS and OS with a duration of 35.9 months and 69.0 months, respectively, compared with the other two stages (p = 0.006 and p = 0.03, respectively). In addition, patients with better treatment response before ASCT had better PFS and OS compared with those who did not show a response (both p < 0.0001). The overall incidence of organ toxicities associated with transplantation was low. Conclusion: In conclusion, our cohort showed that myeloma patients with early DSS and better treatment response before ASCT had better long-term survival outcomes. ? 2018","immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin light chain; melphalan; antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; bloodstream infection; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cause of death; cohort analysis; cytomegalovirus infection; drug megadose; female; herpes zoster; human; long term survival; major clinical study; male; mucosa inflammation; multiple myeloma; organ injury; overall survival; pneumonia; progression free survival; register; skin infection; transplantation conditioning; treatment response; adolescent; autotransplantation; epidemiology; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; middle aged; mortality; multiple myeloma; multivariate analysis; remission; retrospective study; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Multivariate Analysis; Registries; Remission Induction; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Intensive care unit admission and survival in stage IV cancer patients with septic shock: A population-based cohort study","2019","Background: The impact of intensive care unit (ICU) admission during life-threatening critical illness on survival of patients with advanced cancer remains unknown. Methods: We identified incident stage IV cancer patients from Taiwan Cancer Registry during 2009-2013 and ascertained the first episode of septic shock after cancer diagnosis. Patient was classified as ICU admission and no ICU admission during the index hospitalization. Primary outcome of interest was overall survival. Propensity score (PS) and proportional hazards regression were used to control potential confounders. Results: A total of 11,825 stage IV cancer patients with septic shock were identified. Among them, 6,089 (51.5%) patients were admitted to ICU during the index hospitalization and 3,626 (30.7%) patients survived the index hospitalization. A 1:1 propensity score (PS)-matched cohort of 7,186 patients were created for patients with/without ICU admission among the total study population. Both the PS-stratified analysis among the overall population (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.81) and analysis among the PS-matched population (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.72-0.79) showed association between ICU admission and better overall survival. ICU admission was also associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality in both PS-stratified analysis (pooled odds ratio [OR]: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.75) and PS-matched analysis (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.55-0.68). In PS-stratified analysis for long-term survival after discharge among hospital survivors, ICU admission was associated with improved long-term survival after discharge (pooled HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.68-0.80). Also ICU admission was associated with better long-term survival after discharge (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.85) in PS-matched analysis. Conclusions: Though ICU admission with aggressive treatment may be associated with improved survival, the majority (70%) of stage IV cancer patients with septic shock were unable to survive until hospital discharge. ?

"Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Morbidly Obese Bariatric Patients with Concurrent Hepatitis C Viral Infection","2019","Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of liver cirrhosis and its complications. The safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in patients with HCV infection is not clear. Methods: Charts were reviewed to identify patients with HCV infection before bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgical patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and without NASH (non-NASH) were recruited as comparative groups. Demographic variables, perioperative data, follow-up, and HCV-related parameters were extracted and compared. Results: Forty-seven bariatric patients between 2000 and 2016 that suffered from HCV infection were identified. The mean age and body mass index (BMI) at baseline were 34.5 ± 9.9?years and 40.4 ± 7.7?kg/m 2 , respectively. The HCV(+) group was associated with female sex, older age, lower BMI, and waist circumference than both NASH and non-NASH groups. Both HCV(+) and NASH groups had higher liver function tests and incidence of metabolic syndrome than non-NASH group. The HCV(+) group had lower uric acid and albumin level than the NASH group. Early major postoperative complication occurred in 1 (2.1%) patient of the HCV(+) group. At follow-up, the mean BMI decreased to 29.1 ± 7.1?kg/m 2 and total weight loss was 25% for the HCV(+) group at 5?years after surgery. The weight loss curves were similar between the HCV(+) group and NASH group. During follow-up, no patients died but one patient with HCV(+) developed flare up of hepatitis after gastric bypass. The mean liver transaminase level remained in normal range for the HCV(+) group. Conclusion: Co-existence of HCV infection does not influence the outcome of bariatric surgery but continued monitoring of the liver function is indicated. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; cholesterol; gamma glutamyltransferase; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; low density lipoprotein; peginterferon; ribavirin; triacylglycerol; uric acid; adult; age; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bariatric surgery; blood pressure; body mass; body weight loss; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical outcome; concurrent infection; disease severity; female; follow up; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; gastric bypass surgery; glucose blood level; hepatitis C; human; hypoproteinemia; insulin blood level; liver cirrhosis; liver function test; male; malnutrition; medical record review; metabolic syndrome X; morbid obesity; nonalcoholic fatty liver; priority journal; sleeve gastrectomy; triacylglycerol blood level; uric acid blood level; waist circumference"
"Incidence of hepatitis B reactivation during epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in non–small-cell lung cancer patients","2019","Background: Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a documented risk during cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer. Cases of HBV reactivation in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment have been reported; however, the incidence of HBV reactivation in patients treated with EGFR TKIs has not yet been reported. Materials and methods: We enrolled 171 patients who were diagnosed as having NSCLC from 2011 through 2017 and who also had positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). All patients had received EGFR TKIs as anticancer treatment for at least 2 weeks during their treatment course. Reactivation of HBV is defined as one of the following: an increase in HBV DNA by at least 10-fold compared to baseline or an absolute increase to >10?5 IU/mL with abnormal liver function. Results: The median duration of EGFR TKI treatment was 10.5 months (95% con?dence interval: 8.2–12.8). Sixteen (9.36%) patients met the criteria of HBV reactivation during EGFR TKI treatment, with an annual incidence of 7.86%. HBV reactivation occurred during erlotinib treatment in 6 patients, followed by 5 patients with gefitinib treatments, 3 patients with osimertinib treatment and 2 with afatinib treatment. No independent risk factor for HBV reactivation was identified. Conclusion: NSCLC patients receiving EGFR TKI treatment may have a clinically meaningful risk of HBV reactivation during the treatment period. Thus, monitoring liver function, HBV viral load and serology of HBV (i.e., HBeAg and anti-HBc) during EGFR TKI therapy is recommended for NSCLC patients with positive HBsAg. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","afatinib; carboplatin; cisplatin; docetaxel; erlotinib; gefitinib; gemcitabine; hepatitis B surface antigen; osimertinib; paclitaxel; pemetrexed; vinorelbine tartrate; virus DNA; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; female; hepatitis; hepatitis B; human; incidence; liver function; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; serology; virus load; virus reactivation"
"Distribution of mercury and methylmercury in surface water and surface sediment of river, irrigation canal, reservoir, and wetland in Taiwan","2019","In Taiwan, because of the co-use of some irrigation and drainage canals, a portion of industrial wastewater was directly discharged into irrigation canals or even flowed into rivers or wetlands, causing the heavy metal pollution in waters and sediments. Mercury (Hg) contamination in rivers, irrigation canals, and wetlands has been found in Taiwan, but a thorough investigation on the distribution of Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) in these waters and sediments, which may be present in a greater level with elevating total Hg (THg) concentration and markedly impact human health, is still lacking. In this study, surface waters and surface sediments were sampled from five major rivers, two irrigation canals, two reservoirs, and one wetland in Taiwan, and their THg and MeHg concentrations were quantified. Additionally, statistical analysis was carried out to understand the relationship between sediment properties and MeHg levels. The results showed that irrigation canal sediments were relatively more polluted by Hg and the THg concentrations of some sampling points exceeded the upper limit (i.e., 0.87?mg?kg?1) of sediment quality index (SQI) for THg promulgated by Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration, which may be attributed to the co-use of irrigation and drainage canals. Furthermore, the MeHg concentration in irrigation canal sediments was the highest; rivers came in second followed by wetlands. In addition, the Siangshan Wetland was analyzed to have the greatest THg and MeHg concentrations in its surface water. Linear regression analysis also indicated that total organic carbon and clay content substantially affected the MeHg production in sediments. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","fluvial deposit; irrigation; mercury (element); methylmercury; reservoir; spatial distribution; surface water; wastewater treatment; wetland; Taiwan; mercury; methylmercury derivative; analysis; environmental monitoring; river; sediment; Taiwan; water pollutant; wetland; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Mercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Rivers; Taiwan; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Wetlands"
"Phomaketide A inhibits lymphangiogenesis in human lymphatic endothelial cells","2019","Lymphangiogenesis is an important biological process associated with cancer metastasis. The development of new drugs that block lymphangiogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Marine fungus-derived compound phomaketide A, isolated from the fermented broth of Phoma sp. NTOU4195, has been reported to exhibit anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its anti-lymphangiogenic activity has not been clarified to date. In this study, we showed that phomaketide A inhibited cell growth, migration, and tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) without an evidence of cytotoxicity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that phomaketide A reduced LECs-induced lymphangiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), protein kinase C (PKC), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signalings. Furthermore, human proteome array analysis indicated that phomaketide A significantly enhanced the protein levels of various protease inhibitors, including cystatin A, serpin B6, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). Importantly, phomaketide A impeded tumor growth and lymphangiogenesis by decreasing the expression of LYVE-1, a specific marker for lymphatic vessels, in tumor xenograft animal model. These results suggest that phomaketide A may impair lymphangiogenesis by suppressing VEGFR-3, PKC, and eNOS signaling cascades, while simultaneously activating protease inhibitors in human LECs. We document for the first time that phomaketide A inhibits lymphangiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, which suggests that this natural product could potentially treat cancer metastasis. ? 2019 by the authors.","antineoplastic agent; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; fungal extract; phomaketide A; protein kinase C delta; rapamycin; unclassified drug; vasculotropin receptor 3; angiogenesis inhibitor; antinematodal agent; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; FLT4 protein, human; NOS3 protein, human; polyketide; PRKCD protein, human; protein kinase C delta; vasculotropin receptor 3; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; controlled study; drug identification; drug isolation; drug mechanism; drug structure; endothelium cell; human; human cell; lung adenocarcinoma; lymph vessel endothelium; lymphangiogenesis; male; metastasis inhibition; migration inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; Phoma; tumor vascularization; A-549 cell line; animal; aquatic species; Ascomycetes; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; drug screening; endothelium cell; isolation and purification; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel; lymphangiogenesis; metabolism; neoplasm; nude mouse; pathology; signal transduction; A549 Cells; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Antinematodal Agents; Aquatic Organisms; Ascomycota; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphatic Metastasis; Lymphatic Vessels; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neoplasms; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Polyketides; Protein Kinase C-delta; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Smoking and Hepatitis B Virus–Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma Risk: The Mediating Roles of Viral Load and Alanine Aminotransferase","2019","Smoking interacts with hepatitis B virus (HBV) to increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which might be explained by its role in antiviral immunity. We evaluated the potential mediating role of viral load and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the relation of smoking with HBV-associated HCC risk. Using multiple mediation analyses to analyze data from 209 HCC cases and 1,256 controls nested within a cohort of 4,841 male HBV carriers, we found that the effect of smoking on the risk of subsequent HCC was substantially mediated through viral load (percent mediated, 31.7%; P = 0.0054), and a significant mediation effect by both viral load and ALT was also evidenced. Among the 1,143 subjects with repeated measures of viral load and ALT over periods of up to 16 years, we further observed that a higher number of pack-years of smoking was associated with higher viral load, maintenance of a high viral load (>4.39 log copies/mL), more severe hepatotoxicity grade, and increased likelihood of ALT ?80 U/L (odds ratio, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-9.64; odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-33.25, respectively, for 10-19 and ?20 pack-years versus nonsmokers) during follow-up. Furthermore, plasma interferon-γ levels were reduced in smokers compared with nonsmokers (interferon-γ-positive rate, 14.9% versus 28.7%; P < 0.0001) at baseline. Smoking was also associated with a reduced natural killer (NK) cell frequency in peripheral blood, characterized by reduced NK function through a systems immunology approach, after long-term follow-up in a subsample (n = 171). The combination of smoking and reduced NK cell frequency further increased viral load and the likelihood of ALT ?80 U/L. Conclusion: The data highlight a role of smoking in HBV viral load, underlining the importance of smoking prevention and cessation in hepatitis B management. ? 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","alanine aminotransferase; CD19 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD56 antigen; CD8alpha antigen; gamma interferon; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; transcriptome; virus DNA; adult; Article; blood analysis; cancer risk; case control study; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; evidence based practice; female; follow up; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; high risk population; human; immune response; immunology; liver cell carcinoma; liver toxicity; long term care; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; natural killer cell; priority journal; protein blood level; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking; smoking cessation; smoking prevention; virus load"
"Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor Acts as the Potential Target of a Newly Synthesized Compound, 1-(9′-methyl-3′-carbazole)-3, 4-dihydro-β-carboline","2019","For a newly synthesized compound, identifying its target protein is a slow but pivotal step toward understand its pharmacologic mechanism. In this study, we systemically synthesized novel manzamine derivatives and chose 1-(9′-methyl-3′-carbazole)-3, 4-dihydro-β-carboline (MCDC) as an example to identify its target protein and function. MCDC had potent toxicity against several cancer cells. To identify its target protein, we first used a docking screen to predict macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as the potential target. Biochemical experiments, including mutation analysis and hydrogen-deuterium exchange assays, validated the binding of MCDC to MIF. Furthermore, MCDC was shown by microarrays to interfere with the cell cycle of breast cancer MCF7 cells. The activated signaling pathways included AKT phosphorylation and S phase-related proteins. Our results showed MIF as a potential direct target of a newly synthesized manzamine derivative, MCDC, and its pharmacologic mechanisms. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Survival differences in multiple myeloma in Latin America and Asia: a comparison involving 3664 patients from regional registries","2019","In previous observational studies, we have separately characterized patients with multiple myeloma (MM) both from Latin America (LA) and from Asia. Here, we analyze these two datasets jointly, in order to assess the overall survival (OS) in these two world regions. Data were available from 3664 patients (1968 from LA and 1696 from Asia); all of whom diagnosed between 1998 and 2007. Approximately, 26% of patients in both world regions underwent transplantation. OS (from diagnosis of MM) was explored with Kaplan–Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models. Patients from LA were significantly younger and had hypercalcemia more often than Asian patients, who in turn had higher proportions of anemia and International Staging System (ISS) stage III disease. The median OS was 56?months in LA, and 47?months in Asia (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.91; P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, age, ISS stage III, anemia, hypercalcemia, and world region remained significantly associated with OS (P < 0.001 for all covariates). These results were largely driven by patients not undergoing transplantation, as no difference in OS emerged between the two world regions in univariable or multivariable analysis for transplanted patients. Despite adverse prognostic features differentially favoring each region, and adjusting for such differences, we found an OS advantage for patients from LA, in comparison with contemporaneous patients from Asia. Whether this is due to different biological features, differences in access to novel agents (especially thalidomide in earlier periods of the study), unmeasured confounders, or the play of chance, remain unknown. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; age; anemia; Article; Asia; autotransplantation; cancer staging; confidence interval; controlled study; covariance; demography; disease association; female; hazard ratio; health survey; human; hypercalcemia; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; multiple myeloma; multivariate analysis; overall survival; priority journal; South and Central America; survival analysis; aged; clinical trial; comparative study; disease free survival; epidemiology; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; multiple myeloma; register; survival rate; Aged; Asia; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Latin America; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Neoplasm Staging; Registries; Survival Rate"
"Dispositional mindfulness, self-compassion, and compassion from others as moderators between stress and depression in caregivers of patients with lung cancer","2019","Objective: The present study aimed to identify the most important protective factors predicting caregivers' depressive symptoms among factors of caregivers' dispositional mindfulness, self-compassion, compassion from others, and patients' dispositional mindfulness and their moderator effects on the relationship between caregiving stress and depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 72 lung cancer outpatients and their family caregivers participated in this study. Family caregivers completed the Kingston Caregiver Stress Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-Compassion Scale, and Compassion from Others Scale. Patients completed the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), BDI-II, and FFMQ. Results: After controlling for patients' factors (treatment status, symptom distress, and depressive symptoms) and caregivers' health status, caregivers' stress and dispositional mindfulness, the domain of mindful awareness, and self-compassionate action were significantly associated with their depressive symptoms. Further analysis indicated that mindful awareness or self-compassionate action could buffer the effect of caregiving stress on depressive symptoms. When the two moderators, mindful awareness and self-compassionate action, were tested simultaneously, only self-compassionate action remained as a significant moderating effect. Conclusions: Caregivers' mindful awareness and self-compassionate action were protective factors, which mitigate the impact of caregiving stress on their depressive symptoms. Therefore, the future supportive program aims at training the competencies of self-compassionate action with mindful awareness, which may enhance caregivers' coping resources. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; cancer patient; caregiver; caregiver burden; compassion; depression; empathy; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30; female; Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire; health status; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mindfulness; outpatient; psychological rating scale; questionnaire; self compassion; Self Compassion Scale; stress; symptom"

"Comparison between COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores for evaluation of clinical symptoms, comorbidities and medical resources utilization in COPD patients","2019","Background: The 2011 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) proposed a new severity assessment system for emphasizing clinical symptom evaluation by COPD Assessment Test (CAT) or modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of two scoring systems in evaluating COPD patients. Methods: A population based cross-sectional study employing computer-assisted telephone interviewing system (CATI) for surveying the epidemiology of COPD in Taiwan. Among 6600 subjects recruited (age > 40), 404 subjects (6.1%) were diagnosed as COPD. The comorbidities, COPD-related symptoms, health care resources utilization were compared between CAT and mMRC. Results: There were significant differences in all co-morbidities, symptom severity in favor of CAT as compared to mMRC. When comparing health care resources utilization, CAT and mMRC have equal effectiveness in evaluating patients with regular medical treatment. There were significant differences in emergency room visit and hospitalization in favor of mMRC. However, CAT was more effective in evaluating patients with ICU admission (P = 0.005). Conclusion: Compared with CAT and mMRC, there are individual benefits in the evaluation of clinical symptoms, co-morbidities and medical resources utilization for ER, hospitalization and ICU admission in COPD patients. ? 2018","adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; chest tightness; chronic obstructive lung disease; comparative effectiveness; COPD Assessment Test; coughing; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; dyspnea; female; health care utilization; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Score; population research; respiratory tract disease assessment; sleep disordered breathing; Taiwan; telephone interview; tuberculosis; wheezing; aged; area under the curve; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; comparative study; dyspnea; forced expiratory volume; lung; middle aged; pathophysiology; practice guideline; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; severity of illness index; standards; symptom assessment; vital capacity; Adult; Aged; Area Under Curve; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dyspnea; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Symptom Assessment; Taiwan; Vital Capacity"

"Methylene-blue-encapsulated liposomes as photodynamic therapy nano agents for breast cancer cells","2019","Methylene blue (MB) is a widely used dye and photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent that can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) after light exposure, triggering apoptosis. However, it is hard for the dye to penetrate through the cell membrane, leading to poor cellular uptake; thus, drug carriers, which could enhance the cellular uptake, are a suitable solution. In addition, the defective vessels resulting from fast vessel outgrowth leads to an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which gives nanoscale drug carriers a promising potential. In this study, we applied poly(12-(methacryloyloxy)dodecyl phosphorylcholine), a zwitterionic polymer-lipid, to self-assemble into liposomes and encapsulate MB (MB-liposome). Its properties of high stability and fast intracellular uptake were confirmed, and the higher in vitro ROS generation ability of MB-liposomes than that of free MB was also verified. For in vivo tests, we examined the toxicity in mice via tail vein injection. With the features found, MB-liposome has the potential of being an effective PDT nano agent for cancer therapy. ? 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",""

"The detrimental effect of asymmetric dimethylarginine on cholesterol efflux of macrophage foam cells: Role of the NOX/ROS signaling","2019","Background: Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor and has been proposed to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, little is known about its role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effect of ADMA on cholesterol metabolism and its underlying molecular mechanism. Methods: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced macrophage foam cells were used as an in vitro model. Apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE?/?) hyperlipidemic mice were used as an in vivo model. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate protein expression. Luciferase reporter assays were used to assess the activity of promoters and transcription factors. Conventional assay kits were used to measure the levels of ADMA, cholesterol, triglycerides, and cytokines. Results: Treatment with oxLDL decreased the protein expression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 (DDAH-2) but not DDAH-1. Incubation with ADMA markedly increased oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophages. ADMA impaired cholesterol efflux following oxLDL challenge and downregulated the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 by interfering with liver X receptor α (LXRα) expression and activity. Additionally, this inhibitory effect of ADMA on cholesterol metabolism was mediated through the activation of the NADPH oxidase/reactive oxygen species pathway. In vivo experiments revealed that chronic administration of ADMA for 4 weeks exacerbated systemic inflammation, decreased the aortic protein levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1, and impaired the capacity of reverse cholesterol transport, ultimately, leading to the progression of atherosclerosis in apoE?/? mice. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the ADMA/DDAH-2 axis plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol metabolism in macrophage foam cells and atherosclerotic progression. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","ABC transporter A1; ABC transporter G1; apolipoprotein E; dimethylargininase; dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1; dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2; liver X receptor alpha; n(g),n(g) dimethylarginine; oxidized low density lipoprotein; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aorta; Article; atherosclerosis; cholesterol metabolism; cholesterol transport; controlled study; down regulation; foam cell; human; human cell; in vivo study; inflammation; lipid storage; macrophage; macrophage foam cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction"
"Standardize the Surgical Technique and Clarify the Relevant Anatomic Concept for Complete Mobilization of Colonic Splenic Flexure Using da Vinci Xi ? Robotic System","2019","Background: The present study is to set up a standardized approach for complete mobilization of colonic splenic flexure using da Vinci Xi ? robotic system, based on clarification of the mesenteric structures of distal transverse colon. Methods: The surgical outcomes and relevant anatomic structures of 104 consecutive patients undergoing robotic resection of primary colorectal cancer with the intent of complete mobilization of colonic splenic flexure using da Vinci Xi ? robotic system were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Complete mobilization of colonic splenic flexure can be efficiently performed by the Xi ? robotic system, as demonstrated by short operation time, minimal intra-operative blood loss, and few surgical complications. Xi ? robotic system has overcome the drawbacks of Si ? robotic system for the mobilization of colonic splenic flexure. The present study defined the following anatomic hallmarks for the colonic splenic flexure: (1) The transverse mesocolon distal to the inferior mesenteric vein adheres to the low border of pancreas by the avascular fibrous connective tissues, which have been inappropriately named as “mesenteric root”; (2) The colonic splenic flexure abuts closely to spleen with an acute angle in 78.85% (n = 82/104); (3) Only a minority of patients presented with the Riolan branch (15.38%, n = 16/104) or the Moskowitz artery (8.65%, n = 9/104). Conclusion: With increased maneuverability of Xi ? robotic arms and the clarification of relevant anatomic concept, the surgical technique for the complete mobilization of colonic splenic flexure can be standardized; and the standardization of surgical technique is the first step toward the enhanced automation in the rapidly evolving robotic systems. ? 2018, Soci?t?

"Impact of MELD score and cardiopulmonary bypass duration on post-operative hypoxic hepatitis in patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing open heart surgery","2019","Background: The outcome of open-heart surgery for patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) varies widely, indicating multifactorial influences on liver injury after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Methods: This observational single center study evaluated adult LC patients receiving open heart surgery with CPB during 2007 and 2017. The primary endpoint was post-operative hypoxic hepatitis (POHH), defined by post-operative serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase more than 10 times the pre-operative value. Results: In total, 61 patients were included in the study, of whom 14 (18.7%) developed POHH. Hospital mortality of non-POHH group (4.3%) was similar to that estimated using Euroscore II (4.0%), but that of the POHH group (21.4%) was 2.7 times as that estimated using Euroscore II (8.0%). Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and CPB duration were found as independent risk factors for POHH by multivariate logistic regression. POHH incidence was 0.0% if MELD <5 and 80.0% of MELD >20 regardless of CPB duration. For those with MELD between 5 and 20, POHH incidence increases as CPB duration increases. Conclusion: For LC patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, the incidence of POHH is highly associated with MELD score and CPB duration. To prevent POHH, the CPB duration should be shortened for those with MELD score between 5 and 20, and CPB be avoid for those with MELD >20. ? 2019",""

Methods: Detailed electronic database searches were performed to identify reports of RCTs that comparing LDCT to any other type of lung cancer screening. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using random effects models. Results: We identified nine RCTs (n = 97,244 participants). In pooled analyses LDCT reduced lung cancer mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.90, I2 = 1%) but had no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-1.00). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) confirmed the results of our meta-analysis. Subgroup defined by high quality trials benefitted from LDCT screening in reducing lung cancer mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.91, I2 = 7%), whereas no benefit observed in other low quality RCTs. LDCT was associated with detection of a significantly higher number of early stage lung cancers than the control. No significant difference (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.30-1.33) was found in mortality after invasive procedures between two groups. Conclusions: In meta-analysis based on sufficient evidence demonstrated by TSA suggests that LDCT screening is superiority over usual care in lung cancer survival. The benefit of LDCT is expected to be heavily influenced by the risk of lung cancer in the different target group (smoking status, Asian) being screened. ? 2019 The Author(s).","all cause mortality; Article; cancer mortality; cancer screening; cancer staging; computer assisted tomography; data base; data extraction; diagnostic imaging; human; low energy radiation; lung cancer; meta analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk benefit analysis; sequential analysis; statistical analysis; systematic review; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; lung tumor; mortality; x-ray computed tomography; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"Fibrillin-1, a novel TGF-beta-induced factor, is preferentially expressed in metaplastic carcinoma with spindle sarcomatous metaplasia","2019","TGF-β induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is involved in tumour progression. This study aims to identify and characterise novel factors potentially related to TGF-β-mediated tumour aggression in breast cancer. We treated the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A with TGF-β and observed TGF-β-dependent upregulation of FBN1, involving demethylation of CpG sites, in MCF10A cells undergoing EMT. The biological importance of fibrillin-1, encoded by FBN1, was evaluated through immunohistochemistry on 225 breast cancer specimens of various subtypes. Fibrillin-1 expression was observed only in metaplastic carcinoma of the breast (MCB) (51.7%), and the expression was observed in spindle sarcomatous metaplasia (SSM), but not in other metaplasia, including matrix-producing, pleomorphic, and squamous metaplasia, and carcinomatous components of both MCB and non-MCB. Fibrillin-1 expression was also restricted to the SSM of non-mammary carcinosarcomas of various organs. Overall, fibrillin-1 expression was enriched in MCB and non-mammary carcinosarcoma with SSM (93.7% and 93.3%, respectively), but not in MCBs and non-mammary carcinosarcoma without SSM. FBN1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells with high FBN1 expression did not compromise migration, invasion, and tumourigenesis, and did not alter the expression of other EMT-related markers. In conclusion, fibrillin-1 is a novel TGF-β-induced marker. Fibrillin-1 expression in SSM, but not in other metaplasia and carcinomatous components, in both MCBs and non-mammary carcinosarcomas, together with the inability of FBN1-knockdown to compromise migration and invasion, indicates that fibrillin-1 is a marker induced solely in spindle metaplasia during EMT and does not induce EMT nor lead to tumour aggressiveness. ? 2019 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia","cdh2 protein; fibrillin 1; fn protein; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; protein; protein kinase B; snai1 protein; stress activated protein kinase; synaptophysin; transcription factor Slug; transcription factor ZEB1; Twist related protein 1; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vim protein; vimentin; fibrillin 1; transforming growth factor beta; Article; breast carcinoma; breast epithelium cell; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; carcinosarcoma; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; DNA demethylation; down regulation; gene expression; gene knockdown; human; human cell; human tissue; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; MDA-MB-468 cell line; metaplastic carcinoma; microarray analysis; priority journal; promoter region; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SK-BR-3 cell line; spindle sarcomatous metaplasia; squamous cell metaplasia; T-47D cell line; upregulation; breast; breast tumor; cell transformation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; epithelium cell; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; metaplasia; pathology; sarcoma; tumor cell line; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinosarcoma; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Epithelial Cells; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Fibrillin-1; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Metaplasia; Sarcoma; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Up-Regulation"
"Impact of a home health care program for disabled patients in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based cohort study","2019","The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of home health care (HHC) for disabled patients.We conducted a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study. A total of 5838 disabled patients with HHC were identified to match by propensity score with 15,829 disabled patients without HHC receiving tube or catheter care (tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube, urinary catheter, cystostomy tube, nephrostomy tube) or stage 3 or 4 pressure sore care from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database between 2005 and 2009. After 1:1 matching, 2901 subjects in the HHC group and 2901 subjects in the non-HHC group were selected and analyzed. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to compare the risk of health outcomes (rate of hospitalization and emergency services use) and the healthcare expenditure between the 2 groups.Compared to those in the non-HHC group, the patients in the HHC group had significantly higher risk for hospitalization (odds ratio [OR]=18.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.62-21.75, P<.001) and emergency services use (OR=3.72, 95% CI: 3.32-4.17, P<.001) 1 year before the index date. However, 1 year after the index date, the risk for hospitalization (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.41-1.83, P<.001) and emergency services use (OR=1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.30, P<.05) attenuated significantly. Regarding the comparison of total healthcare expenditure 1 year before and after the index date, our study showed an insignificant decrease of US$1.5 per person per day and a significant increase of US$5.2 per person per day (P<.001) in the HHC and non-HHC groups, respectively.The HHC for disabled patients has a potential role to reduce hospitalization and emergency services use. Besides, the improvement of healthcare quality through HHC was not accompanied by increased healthcare expenditure. The clinical impact of HHC emphasizes the importance for public health officials to promote HHC model to meet the needs of disabled patients. Copyright ? 2019 the Author(s).

"Prognostic factors and treatment outcomes of malignant pleural mesothelioma in Eastern Asian patients – A Taiwanese study","2019","Background/Purpose: There are scarce reports on the prognostic factors and treatment outcomes of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) in Asia. This study aimed to address these matters in a real-world setting. Methods: Medical records of patients with histologically proven MPM diagnosed between 1977 and 2016 at the National Taiwan University Hospital were reviewed. Variables including age, gender, performance status, asbestos exposure, smoking history, histology subtype, staging, and treatment received were recorded. All patients were followed until death or March 1st, 2017. Survival and prognostic factors were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meir method and the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: A total of 93 patients was identified, including 65 men and 28 women. An increasing trend of MPM cases diagnosed was observed in the past 40 years. Stage I/II disease (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13–0.46) and epithelioid histology (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23–0.75) were associated with favorable prognosis, whereas age ?70 years (HR 2.66, 95% CI 1.36–5.22) and ECOG ?2 (HR 5.03, 95% CI 2.69–9.4) were poor prognostic factors. After adjustment for prognostic factors, surgery in stage I-III MPM (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15–0.83) and systemic therapy in stage III/IV disease (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19–0.94) conferred a survival benefit. Conclusion: This is one of the largest case series of MPM reported in Asia outside of Japan. Prognostic factors in the study population included age, performance status, stage, and histology subtype. Surgery in potentially resectable disease and systemic therapy in advanced MPM confer a survival benefit in Asian patients. ? 2018","adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; disease association; East Asian; electrocorticography; environmental exposure; female; follow up; human; Japan; lung resection; major clinical study; male; medical history; medical record; overall survival; pleura mesothelioma; pleurectomy; population; progression free survival; proportional hazards model; smoking; systemic therapy; Taiwanese; treatment outcome; university hospital; epidemiology; factual database; lung tumor; mesothelioma; middle aged; mortality; pleura tumor; prognosis; survival analysis; Taiwan; Aged; Databases, Factual; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mesothelioma; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Pleural Neoplasms; Prognosis; Survival Analysis; Taiwan"
"Assessing Japan Imported Food Products Radiation Doses and Exposure Risk Following the Fukushima Nuclear Accident","2019","Abstract: During the period of 2011–2018, more than 14,000 batches of Japanese foodstuffs that were imported into Taiwan were inspected. Among these, only trace levels of radiation were detected in 224 batches. Nevertheless, there is growing concern in Taiwan about the threat posed by radionuclide contamination to food safety. To assess this risk, we conducted a detailed investigation of this issue entailing an estimation of the internal radiation dose and lifetime cancer risk associated with food ingestion among Taiwan’s population. Our results indicated that in the worst-case scenario, the highest exposure level of the annual committed effective dose (CED) from ingestion of cesium radionuclides within males aged 15–19?years was 0.0057?mSv per year. This value was well below the CED of 1?mSv per year for radionuclides. Moreover, in 19–65?years male consumer only-max group, the nominal risks for solid cancers, leukemia, and thyroid cancer were 5.32, 1.36, and 0.23 per 10,000 cases, respectively, calculated on the basis of conservative assumptions (worst-case scenario). In 19–65?years female whole group-mean group, the nominal risks for solid cancers, leukemia, thyroid, and breast cancer were 0.14, 0.04, 0.03, and 0.19 per 10,000 cases, respectively. In the general situation, we posit that in the current regulatory policy and radioactivity exposure scenario, radionuclides present in food pose no significant safety risk in Taiwan.

"Incidence of hospitalization for infection among patients with hepatitis B or C virus infection without cirrhosis in Taiwan: A cohort study","2019","Background: Infection is a major complication in liver cirrhosis and causes major morbidity and mortality. However, the incidence and mortality related to these conditions in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are unclear, as is whether antiviral therapy could change their infection risk. Methods and findings: In this community-based cohort study, a total of 115,336 adults (mean age 52.2 years; 35.6% men) without cirrhosis participating in the New Taipei City Health Screening in 2005-2008 were classified as having noncirrhotic HCV (NC-HCV) (n = 2,839), noncirrhotic hepatitis B virus (NC-HBV) (n = 8,316), or no HBV or HCV infection (NBNC) (n = 104,181). Participants were followed to their first hospitalization for infection or death after data linkage with the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and Death Registry. A Cox proportional hazard regression model, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, education level, diabetes, renal function, systemic steroids, and history of hospitalization, was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall and individual sites of infection and infection-related mortality. The reference group was NBNC participants with normal to mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (<1.5 times upper normal limit [UNL]) levels. To further address the impact of antiviral treatment on infection risk, we conducted analyses of data from the nationwide NHIRD and compared the risks for hospitalization because of infections and infection-related deaths between patients with HCV who received antiviral therapy (n = 20,264) and those who remained untreated (n = 104,360). During a median 8.2-year followup, the incidence of hospitalization for infection was substantially higher in NC-HCV patients. Compared to the reference group, NC-HCV was associated with a significantly higher risk for hospitalization because of overall infections (adjusted HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.12-1.33), but we observed no increased risk for patients in the NC-HBV (adjusted HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88-1.01) or NBNC group with moderate to markedly elevated ALT levels (adjusted HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.93-1.14). For specific sites of infection, the NC-HCV group had increased risks for septicemia and lower respiratory tract, reproductive, and urinary tract infections. We noted no increased risk for infection-related death among patients with NC-HCV. Patients with HCV who received antiviral therapy had significantly reduced infection-related hospitalization and death risks (adjusted HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.73-0.84 for infection-related hospitalization and adjusted HR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04-0.16 for infection-related deaths). Study limitations include the exclusion of patients with cirrhosis from the cohort, the possibility of unmeasured confounding, and the lack of information on direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). Conclusions: In this study, patients with NC-HCV were at increased risk for hospitalization for infection, while no increased risk was observed for NC-HBV-infected patients.

"Prenatal and childhood exposure to phthalate diesters and neurobehavioral development in a 15-year follow-up birth cohort study","2019","Objective: Longitudinal studies on neurobehavioral development in relation to prenatal and postnatal exposure to phthalates in school-age children and adolescents are limited. We investigated the association of prenatal and childhood phthalate exposure with the development of behavioral syndromes in 8–14-year-old children. Method: We recruited 430 pregnant women from 2000 to 2001 and followed their children at the ages of 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 years, yielding 153 mother–child pairs in total. Urine samples from pregnant women in the third trimester and from children at 2–8 years of age were analyzed for the concentrations of seven urinary phthalate metabolites: monomethyl phthalate, monoethyl phthalate, monobutyl phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and three di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, namely mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate. Behavioral syndromes in children aged 8–14 years were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist. We constructed mixed models to examine these associations after adjustments for potential covariates. Results: Maternal urinary MEHP levels were associated with higher scores for internalizing problems (β = 0.028, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0004, 0.055) and externalizing problems (β = 0.040, 95% CI: 0.013, 0.066). Associations of the maternal urinary sum of DEHP metabolite levels with delinquent behavior scores and externalizing problems scores were positive (β = 0.035, 95% CI: 0.013, 0.057 for delinquent behavior; β = 0.026, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.050 for externalizing problems). Furthermore, children's urinary MBzP levels were associated with higher scores for social problems (β = 0.018, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.035). Similar patterns were observed for borderline and clinical ranges. Conclusion: Early-life exposure to phthalates may influence behavioral syndrome development in children. Future studies are needed to replicate these findings, and efforts to reduce exposures to phthalates during critical early life stages may be warranted. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","creatinine; drug metabolite; mono(2 ethyl 5 hydroxyhexyl)phthalate; mono(2 ethyl 5 oxohexyl)phthalate; monobenzyl phthalate; monobutyl phthalate; monoethyl phthalate; monomethyl phthalate; phthalic acid; phthalic acid 2 ethylhexyl monoester; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; unclassified drug; ester; phthalic acid derivative; adolescence; biological development; child development; child health; cohort analysis; concentration (composition); ester; phthalate; pollution exposure; pregnancy; sampling; urine; womens health; adolescent; adult; aggression; Article; behavior; behavior disorder; borderline state; child; Child Behavior Checklist; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; delinquency; disease association; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; pilot study; postnatal care; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; priority journal; prospective study; social problem; third trimester pregnancy; urinalysis; urine sampling; drug effect; environmental exposure; nervous system; pollutant; pregnancy; preschool child; toxicity; urine; Adolescent; Adult; Behavior; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Esters; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Nervous System; Phthalic Acids; Pregnancy; Social Problems"
"Standardized MR perfusion scoring system for evaluation of sequential perfusion changes and surgical outcome of moyamoya disease","2019","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Simple-but-precise evaluation of cerebral perfusion is crucial for the treatment of Moyamoya disease. We aimed to develop a standardized scoring system for MR perfusion suitable for Moyamoya disease evaluation and investigate the postoperative serial changes and outcome predictors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2013 to December 2016, patients diagnosed with Moyamoya disease and receiving indirect revascularization were recruited prospectively. Clinical data and serial imaging studies were analyzed. The TTP maps were standardized using cerebellar reference values. We developed a scoring system of standardized TTP maps: 14 points for each hemisphere with higher points indicating better perfusion. RESULTS: In total, 24 children (4 -17 years of age, 41 hemispheres) and 20 adults (18 -51 years of age, 34 hemispheres) were included. The mean preoperative TTP scores were higher in children (7.34 plusmn; 3.90) than in adults (4.88 plusmn; 3.24). The standardized TTP maps revealed dynamic improvement with an increase in the corresponding scores at the 1-, 3-, and 6-month postoperative follow-ups; the scores stabilized after 6 months. The mean improvement in the 6-month scores of the pediatric and adult groups was 4.15plusmn;3.55 and 6.03plusmn;3.04, respectively. The 6-month TTP score improvements were associated with Matsushima grades. If we took score improvement as the outcome, the preoperative TTP score was the only significant predictor in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The standardized TTP maps and scoring system facilitated the quantification of the sequential perfusion changes during Moyamoya disease treatment. The preoperative perfusion status was the only predictor of indirect revascularization outcome. ? 2019 American Society of Neuroradiology.

"Impact of prior pulmonary tuberculosis in treatment outcomes of HCAP and CAP patients in intensive care units","2019","Background/purpose: It is controversial whether healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) belongs to a unique clinical entity or it shares common characteristics with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The impact of prior pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in clinical presentation and treatment outcome of ICU-admitted CAP and HCAP patients also remains unknown. Methods: We report a nationwide, multi-center, retrospective study. ICU-admitted CAP and HCAP patients from six medical centers in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. Patients were defined as either CAP or HCAP cases, and with and without prior PTB, according to the database of Taiwan CDC. The disease severity, microbiologic characteristics, and treatment outcomes between CAP and HCAP patients with or without prior PTB were compared and analyzed. Results: A total of 414 ICU-admitted patients, including 176 CAP cases and 238 HCAP cases were included for analysis during the study period. In both CAP and HCAP subgroups, the pneumonia severities, proportions of organ dysfunction, and microbiologic characteristics were similar between patients with and without prior PTB. In survival analysis, patients with prior PTB had higher 30-day mortality than those without prior PTB (38.9% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.021) in the CAP population. Multivariate analysis revealed that a history of prior PTB was an independent clinical factor associated with higher 30-day mortality rate in CAP patients (HR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.81–10.98, P = 0.001). Conclusion: History of prior PTB is an independent clinical factor for increased 30-day mortality rate in ICU-admitted CAP patients, but not in ICU-admitted HCAP patients. ? 2018","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter baumannii; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic lung disease; clinical evaluation; community acquired pneumonia; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; Enterobacter; Enterococcus faecium; female; health care associated pneumonia; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; intensive care unit; Klebsiella pneumoniae; length of stay; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mortality rate; multicenter study; nonhuman; pathogen load; Pneumonia Severity Index; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; respiratory failure; retrospective study; septic shock; smoking habit; Staphylococcus aureus; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; adult; clinical trial; community acquired infection; comorbidity; demography; epidemiology; hospital; hospitalization; lung tuberculosis; microbiology; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; pneumonia; regression analysis; risk factor; severity of illness index; statistical model; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Community-Acquired Infections; Comorbidity; Demography; Female; Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Multivariate Analysis; Pneumonia; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Young Adult"
"Harnessing immunotherapy for liver recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a review from a transplant oncology perspective","2019","Without stringent criteria, liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can lead to high cancer recurrence and poor prognosis in the current treatment context. Checkpoint inhibitors can lead to long survival by targeting coinhibitory pathways and promoting T-cell activity; thus, they have great potential for cancer immunotherapy. Therapeutic modulation of cosignaling pathways may shift paradigms from surgical prevention of recurrence to oncological intervention. Herein, we review the available evidence from a therapeutic perspective and focus on immune microenvironment perturbation by immunosuppressants and checkpoint inhibitors. Partial and reversible interleukin-2 signaling blockade is the mainstream strategy of immunosuppression for graft protection. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is abundantly expressed on human liver allograft-infiltrating T-cells, which proliferate considerably after programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade. Clinically, checkpoint inhibitors are used in heart, liver, and kidney recipients with various cancers. Rejection can occur after checkpoint inhibitor administration through acute T-cell-mediated, antibody-mediated, or chronic allograft rejection mechanisms. Nevertheless, liver recipients may demonstrate favorable responses to treatment for HCC recurrence without rejection. Pharmacodynamically, substantial degrees of receptor occupancy can be achieved with lower doses, with favorable clinical outcomes. Manipulation of the immune microenvironment is a therapeutic niche that balances seemingly conflicting anticancer and graft protection needs. Additional translational and clinical studies emphasizing the comparative effectiveness of signaling networks within the immune microenvironment and conducting overall assessment of the immune microenvironment may aid in creating a therapeutic window and benefiting future liver recipients with HCC recurrence. ?

"One size fits all? In search of the desirable caption display for second language learners with different caption reliance in listening comprehension","2019","Existing research has established captions as effective second-language (L2) or foreign language (FL) listening comprehension aids. However, due to the transient nature of captions, not all learners are capable of attending to captions in all cases. Previous work posited that to leverage the impact of technologies in learning and instruction, a better understanding of the interplay between technology and cognition is warranted. In this vein, the current study set out to investigate the effects of four different caption modes (full vs. partial vs. real-time vs. control) on the listening comprehension of 95 high-intermediate Taiwanese learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) with different caption reliance (i.e. more-caption-reliant vs. less-caption-reliant). The results showed no significant difference between the participants’ listening comprehension outcomes under the four caption conditions when their caption reliance was not considered. However, when this was considered, the differences among the four caption conditions became salient, which was suggestive of the selective effect of captions on L2 learners with different caption reliance. While less-caption-reliant L2 learners had the best listening comprehension outcome under the partial-caption condition and the worst under the full-caption condition, more-caption-reliant L2 learners exhibited the best performance under the full-caption condition yet the worst under the partial-caption condition. The finding underscores the importance of considering L2 learners’ processing profiles when utilizing captioned videos as multimodal instructional/learning materials and speaks to the need of utilizing differentiated video materials for optimal listening outcomes. ?

"miR-103/107 prolong Wnt/β-catenin signaling and colorectal cancer stemness by targeting Axin2","2019","Cancer stemness drives tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, recurrence, and therapy resistance. However, mechanisms that potentiate the acquisition and maintenance of stemness fate of cancer cells remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that miR-103/107 stimulate multiple stem-like features in colorectal cancer, including expression of stem-like markers, appearance of side-population cells, and capabilities in self-renewal, tumor initiation, recurrence, and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, these stemness-promoting functions are mediated by miR-103/107-dependent repression of Axin2, a negative feedback regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Through inhibiting Axin2, miR-103/107 trigger a prolonged duration of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and a sustained induction of Wnt responsive genes. In colorectal cancer patients, miR-103/107 expression correlates inversely with Axin2 expression and a signature of miR-103/107 high and Axin2 low expression profile correlates with poor prognosis. Together, our study identifies a novel function of miR-103/107 in promoting colorectal cancer stemness by targeting Axin2 and elucidates the clinical relevance and prognostic value of this axis in colorectal cancer. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Knowledge of medications among patients with glaucoma in Taiwan","2019","Background/Purpose: To investigate the knowledge and learning ability of glaucoma patients regarding their anti-glaucoma topical medications. Methods: Patients on regular follow-up at the Glaucoma Clinic at Hsin-Chu General Hospital were recruited. After detailed ocular examinations, the participants were asked to recall and identify their glaucoma eye drops. The same test was repeated 3 months later. The results of both tests, the learning ability of patients regarding their glaucoma drugs, and the relationship between learning ability and demographic variables were evaluated. Results: Two hundred eighty-seven glaucoma patients participated in this study. Of the study population, 25.8% and 57.1% could recall their topical mediation at the first and second tests, whereas 72.1% and 88.5% could identify their prescribed eye drops at the first and second tests, respectively. Approximately 34% of the participants showed improved knowledge at the repeat test, whereas 40% of the participants showed no improvement. Participants with a better learning ability were more likely to be younger, with a higher level of education, and with less visual field impairment. Conclusion: The knowledge of glaucoma patients regarding their prescribed medication was deficient in Taiwan. Physician effort could improve knowledge on the prescribed drugs. Patient-centered education should be considered, targeting elderly individuals, illiterate individuals, and those with loss of visual function to increase compliance with glaucoma medication. ? 2018","antiglaucoma agent; eye drops; eye drops; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; best corrected visual acuity; color vision; educational status; eye examination; female; glaucoma; high school; human; intraocular pressure; knowledge; learning; major clinical study; male; prescription; primary school; Taiwan; topical treatment; visual acuity; visual field defect; attitude to health; drug monitoring; glaucoma; medication compliance; middle aged; prospective study; questionnaire; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Drug Monitoring; Female; Glaucoma; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Logistic Models; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Ophthalmic Solutions; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"
"Modulated electro-hyperthermia-enhanced liposomal drug uptake by cancer cells","2019","Purpose: Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) stands to be a significant technological advancement in the hyperthermia field, utilizing autofocusing electromagnetic power on the cell membrane to create massive apoptosis. Since mEHT possesses the unique ability to excite cell membranes, we hypothesized that mEHT could enhance the uptake of liposomal drugs by enhancing phagocytic activity. Materials and methods: Water bath control and mEHT were used to compare the enhancement of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (Lipodox?) uptake by cancer cells. Cancer cells were made visible by doxorubicin fluorescence to investigate drug uptake. Viable cell yield was determined via the Trypan Blue exclusion method. Various substrates were used to investigate the mechanism of drug-uptake enhancement. The murine colon carcinoma model, CT26, was used to confirm the tissue infiltration of Lipodox? and its therapeutic effect. Results: mEHT treatment showed a significant enhancement of Lipodox? uptake of doxorubicin fluorescence compared with 37°C or 42°C water bath treatment. Tumor tissue sections also confirmed that mEHT treatment achieved the highest doxorubicin concentration in vivo (1.44±0.32 ?g/g in mEHT group and 0.79±0.32 ?g/g in 42°C water bath). Wortmannin was used to inhibit the macropinocytosis effect and 70 kDa dextran-FITC served as uptake substance. The uptake of dextran-FITC by cancer cells significantly increased after mEHT treatment whereas such enhancement was significantly inhibited by wortmannin. Conclusion: The result showed mEHT-induced particle-uptake through macropinocytosis. mEHT-enhanced uptake of Lipodox? may amplify the therapeutic effect of liposomal drugs. This novel finding warrants further clinical investigation. ? 2019 Tsang et al.","doxorubicin; wortmannin; antineoplastic antibiotic; doxorubicin; macrogol; Article; cancer cell; cancer growth; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; drug screening; drug uptake; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liposomal delivery; macropinocytosis; modulated electro hyperthermia; outcome assessment; thermotherapy; A-549 cell line; analogs and derivatives; animal; apoptosis; Bagg albino mouse; cell membrane; cell survival; colon tumor; disease model; drug effect; Hep-G2 cell line; neoplasm; particle size; pathology; pinocytosis; signal transduction; A549 Cells; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Apoptosis; Cell Membrane; Cell Survival; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Doxorubicin; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neoplasms; Particle Size; Pinocytosis; Polyethylene Glycols; Signal Transduction"
"White matter microstructural alterations in amblyopic adults revealed by diffusion spectrum imaging with systematic tract-based automatic analysis","2019","Background/aim We investigated the microstructural changes in white matter of adults with amblyopia using diffusion spectrum imaging with systematic tract-based automatic analysis of the whole brain. Methods Ten adults with amblyopia (six women and four men, 33.6±10.6 years old on average) and 20 age-and sex-matched normal-sighted controls were enrolled. The mean generalised fractional anisotropy (GFA) was measured in 76 white matter tracts and compared between the experimental and control groups using a threshold-free cluster-weighted method and t-test. A 2-percentile cut-off was used to identify segments with the greatest differences between the two groups. Results Participants with amblyopia had significantly lower GFA values than the controls in 11 segments located in nine white matter tracts, which included the following: left arcuate fasciculus, left frontal aslant tract, left fornix and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus of the association fibres; left thalamic radiations of the auditory nerve and bilateral optic radiations of the projection fibres; and genu and middle temporal gyrus of the callosal fibres. Amblyopic participants had statistically higher GFA values in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus than those of the controls. Conclusion This preliminary study using whole-brain tractographic analysis of white matter reveals association between abnormal early visual processing and alterations in brain architecture, which may be related to various higher-level deficits, such as audiovisual integration and hand'eye coordination in patients with amblyopia. ?

"Keratin scaffolds with human adipose stem cells: Physical and biological effects toward wound healing","2019","Keratin, a natural biomaterial derived from wool or human hair, has the intrinsic ability to interact with different types of cells and the potential to serve as a controllable extracellular matrix that can be used a scaffold for tissue engineering. In this study, we demonstrated a simple and fast technique to construct 3D keratin scaffolds for accelerated wound healing using a lyophilization method based on extraction of keratin from human hair. The physical properties of the keratin scaffolds such as water uptake, pore size, and porosity can be adjusted by changing the protein concentrations during the fabrication process. The keratin scaffolds supported human adipose stem cells (hASCs) adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. In vivo study performed on ICR mice showed that keratin scaffolds with hASCs shortened skin wound healing time, accelerated epithelialization, and promoted wound remodeling. Therefore, keratin scaffolds alone or together with hASCs may serve as therapeutic agents for repairing wounded tissue. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","alpha smooth muscle actin; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; transcription factor RUNX2; vasculotropin; water; adipocyte; adipose derived stem cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; endothelium cell; epithelization; extraction; freeze drying; human; human cell; in vivo study; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; male; mouse; myofibroblast; nonhuman; osteocyte; porosity; priority journal; protein expression; tissue repair; water transport; wound healing"
"Impact of varying anatomic sites on advanced stage and survival of oral cancer: 9-year prospective cohort of 27 717 cases","2019","Background: To elucidate the impact of varying anatomic sites on advanced stage of and death from oral cancer. Methods: A total of 27 717 oral cancers mainly from a population-based visual inspection program in Taiwan from 2004 to 2009 was followed until the end of 2012. Results: Using lip cancer as reference, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) of advanced stage of cancer were 2.20 (1.92-2.51) for tongue, 2.60 (2.28-2.97) for buccal, 2.68 (2.20-3.28) for floor of mouth, 2.96 (2.52-3.47) for hard palate, 6.04 (5.17-7.05) for gingiva, and 10.83 (9.20-12.74) for oropharynx. The estimated hazard ratios (95% CI) for oral cancer death increased from 1.48 (1.31-1.67) in buccal, 1.61 (1.43-1.82) in tongue, 1.68 (1.41-1.99) in floor of mouth, 1.79 (1.57-2.05) in gingiva, 1.97 (1.71-2.26) in hard palate, and 2.15 (1.89-2.45) in oropharynx.

"Mild cognitive impairment in combination with comorbid diabetes mellitus and hypertension is negatively associated with health-related quality of life among older persons in Taiwan","2019","Purpose: To fill the gap in knowledge about associations of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with comorbid diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and/or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly, we explored associations of comorbid DM, HTN, and/or MCI with HRQoL. Methods: Data for this study were from a population-based cross-sectional survey of elderly Taiwanese (? 65?years old). Participants (N = 4,634; 47.9% male) were categorized into eight chronic-illness groups: DM only (n = 224); HTN only (n = 1226); DM and HTN (n = 365); MCI only (n = 497); DM and MCI (n = 58); HTN and MCI (n = 303); DM, HTN, and MCI (n = 101); and none (healthy; n = 1860). Associations were examined between the eight chronic-illness groups and HRQoL (measured by EQ-5D scores) using binary logistic regression analyses and generalized linear models adjusted for covariates. Index scores were calculated from EQ-5D scores using Taiwan’s general population-preference weights. Results: Compared to the healthy group, after adjusting covariates, MCI alone or with other comorbidities was significantly, negatively associated with HRQoL. Among all chronic-illness groups, comorbid DM, HTN, and MCI exhibited the lowest HRQoL. After adjusting covariates, between-group odds ratios for index scores were significant when comparing comorbid DM and MCI to DM only, comparing comorbid HTN and MCI to HTN only and comorbid DM, comparing HTN and MCI to comorbid DM and HTN, suggesting that MCI additively affects HRQoL. Conclusions: HRQoL of older Taiwanese adults was negatively associated with having MCI. Thus, clinicians managing older persons with chronic illnesses should assess their cognitive function to identify high-risk groups needing HRQoL assistance. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","aged; anxiety disorder; Article; comorbidity; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; diabetes mellitus; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; priority journal; quality of life; sleep quality; adult; chronic disease; cognition; cognitive defect; comorbidity; complication; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; middle aged; pathology; physiology; psychology; quality of life; statistical model; Taiwan; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chronic Disease; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Taiwan"
"Molecular epidemiology and clinical features of adenovirus infection in Taiwanese children, 2014","2019","Background/purposes: Human adenovirus (HAdV) infection is prevalent and has an important clinical impact on children. We aim to investigate the molecular epidemiology of HAdV infection and discover the correlations between clinical features and HAdV species in an HAdV outbreak of 2014. Methods: This is a retrospective study, enrolling patients under 19 years of age with HAdV infection at the National Taiwan University Hospital in 2014. We gathered the demographic and clinical data, carried out molecular typing and constructed a phylogenetic tree. Statistical analyses were performed in terms of HAdV species and hospitalization. Results: A total of 531 patients with HAdV infection were identified. HAdV-B accounted for the largest proportion (n = 387, 73%). On average, patients infected with HAdV-E were oldest, whereas those with HAdV-C infection were youngest (p < 0.001). Patients with HAdV-B (HAdV-3) infection were associated with a lower incidence of co-infection with other viruses (p < 0.001). Complications occurred in 203 (38%) patients. There were 149 (28%) patients requiring hospitalization. The risk factors for hospitalization included underlying neurological abnormalities, prematurity and the diagnosis of pneumonia. Five patients (1%) had severe HAdV infection requiring intensive care; all of them fully recovered. The phylogenetic study showed that the partial hexon genes of HAdV-1, HAdV-3, HAdV-4 and HAdV-5 remain stable over time. Conclusion: We established the molecular epidemiology of HAdV infection and demonstrated the relationship between clinical features and HAdV species. ? 2018","adenovirus infection; adolescent; Article; child; clinical feature; epidemic; female; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; Human adenovirus B; Human adenovirus C; Human adenovirus E; infant; intensive care; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; molecular diagnosis; molecular epidemiology; molecular typing; neurologic disease; newborn; outpatient; pediatric patient; phylogenetic tree; pneumonia; prematurity; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwanese; virus isolation; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; human adenovirus infection; incidence; molecular typing; pathogenicity; phylogeny; preschool child; prevalence; Taiwan; virology; virus gene; capsid protein; hexon capsid protein, Adenovirus; virus DNA; Adenovirus Infections, Human; Adenoviruses, Human; Adolescent; Capsid Proteins; Child; Child, Preschool; Coinfection; Disease Outbreaks; DNA, Viral; Female; Genes, Viral; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Molecular Epidemiology; Molecular Typing; Phylogeny; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Taiwan"
"Standards of diagnostic colonoscopy for early-stage neoplasia: Recommendations by an Asian private group","2019","Background and Aim: In recent years, the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing, and it is now becoming the major cause of cancer death in Asian countries. The aim of the present study was to develop Asian expert-based consensus to standardize the preparation, detection and characterization for the diagnosis of early-stage colorectal neoplasia. Methods: A professional group was formed by 36 experts of the Asian Novel Bio-Imaging and Intervention Group (ANBI2G) members. Representatives from 12 Asia–Pacific countries participated in the meeting. The group organized three consensus meetings focusing on diagnostic endoscopy for gastrointestinal neoplasia. The Delphi method was used to develop the consensus statements. Results: Through the three consensus meetings with debating, reviewing the literature and regional data, a consensus was reached at third meeting in 2016. The consensus was reached on a total of 10 statements. Summary of statements is as follows: (i) Adequate bowel preparation for high-quality colonoscopy; (ii) Antispasmodic agents for lesion detection; (iii) Image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) for polyp detection; (iv) Adenoma detection rate for quality indicators; (v) Good documentation of colonoscopy findings; (vi) Complication rates; (vii) Cecal intubation rate; (viii) Cap-assisted colonoscopy (CAC) for polyp detection; (ix) Macroscopic classification using indigocarmine spray for characterization of colorectal lesions; and (x) IEE and/or magnifying endoscopy for prediction of histology. Conclusion: This consensus provides guidance for carrying out endoscopic diagnosis and characterization for early-stage colorectal neoplasia based on the evidence. This will enhance the quality of endoscopic diagnosis and improve detection of early-stage colorectal neoplasia. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Microangiopathy underlying mixed-location intracerebral hemorrhages/microbleeds: A PiB-PET study","2019","ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that patients with concomitant lobar and deep intracerebral hemorrhages/microbleeds (mixed ICH) have predominantly hypertensive small vessel disease (HTN-SVD) rather than cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), using in vivo amyloid imaging.MethodsEighty Asian patients with primary ICH without dementia were included in this cross-sectional study. All patients underwent brain MRI and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging. The mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated using cerebellum as reference. Forty-six patients (57.5%) had mixed ICH. Their demographic and clinical profile as well as amyloid deposition patterns were compared to those of 13 patients with CAA-ICH and 21 patients with strictly deep microbleeds and ICH (HTN-ICH).ResultsPatients with mixed ICH were younger (62.8 ± 11.7 vs 73.3 ± 11.9 years in CAA, p = 0.006) and showed a higher rate of hypertension than patients with CAA-ICH (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with mixed ICH had lower PiB SUVR than patients with CAA (1.06 [1.01-1.13] vs 1.43 [1.06-1.58], p = 0.003). In a multivariable logistic regression model, mixed ICH was associated with hypertension (odds ratio 8.9, 95% confidence interval 1.4-58.4, p = 0.02) and lower PiB SUVR (odds ratio 0.03, 95% confidence interval 0.001-0.87, p = 0.04) compared to CAA after adjustment for age. Compared to HTN-ICH, mixed ICH showed a similar mean age (62.8 ± 11.7 vs 60.1 ± 14.5 years in HTN-ICH) and risk factor profile (all p &gt; 0.1). Furthermore, PiB SUVR did not differ between mixed ICH (values presented above) and HTN-ICH (1.10 [1.00-1.16], p = 0.45).Conclusions:Patients with mixed ICH have much lower amyloid load than patients with CAA-ICH, while being similar to HTN-ICH. Overall, mixed ICH is probably caused by HTN-SVD, an important finding with clinical relevance. ? 2019 American Academy of Neurology.","Pittsburgh compound B; 2-(4'-(methylamino)phenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole; aniline derivative; thiazole derivative; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; Asian; brain hemorrhage; cerebellum; confidence interval; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; female; human; hypertension; in vivo study; major clinical study; male; microangiopathy; multivariate logistic regression analysis; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; odds ratio; positron emission tomography; priority journal; risk factor; standardized uptake value ratio; vascular amyloidosis; brain; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular disease; complication; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; Taiwan; vascular amyloidosis; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aniline Compounds; Brain; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intracranial Hemorrhage, Hypertensive; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Taiwan; Thiazoles"
"Pan-Asian adapted ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with metastatic gastric cancer: A JSMO-ESMO initiative endorsed by CSCO, KSMO, MOS, SSO and TOS","2019","The most recent version of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of gastric cancer (GC) was published in 2016, and covered the management and treatment of local, locoregional, locally advanced and metastatic disease. At the ESMO Asia Meeting in November 2017 it was decided by both ESMO and The Japanese Society of Medical Oncology (JSMO) to convene a special guidelines meeting immediately after the JSMO Annual Meeting in 2018. The aim was to adapt the ESMO 2016 guidelines to take into account the ethnic differences associated with the treatment of metastatic GC in Asian patients. These guidelines represent the consensus opinions reached by experts in the treatment of patients with metastatic GC representing the oncological societies of Japan (JSMO), China (CSCO), Korea (KSMO), Malaysia (MOS), Singapore (SSO) and Taiwan (TOS).

"Gender differences with dose-response relationship between serum selenium levels and metabolic syndrome-a case-control study","2019","Few studies have investigated the association between selenium and metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to explore the associations between the serum selenium level and metabolic syndrome as well as examining each metabolic factor. In this case-control study, the participants were 1165 adults aged ?40 (65.8 ± 10.0) years. Serum selenium was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The associations between serum selenium and metabolic syndrome were examined by multivariate logistic regression analyses. The least square means were computed by general linear models to compare the serum selenium levels in relation to the number of metabolic factors. The mean serum selenium concentration was 96.34 ± 25.90 ?g/L, and it was positively correlated with waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in women, but it was only correlated with fasting glucose and HOMA-IR in men. After adjustment, the odds ratios (ORs) of having metabolic syndrome increased with the selenium quartile groups (p for trend: <0.05), especially in women. The study demonstrated that the serum selenium levels were positively associated with metabolic syndrome following a non-linear dose-response trend. Selenium concentration was positively associated with insulin resistance in men and women, but it was associated with adiposity and lipid metabolism in women. The mechanism behind this warrants further confirmation. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Effects of removing reimbursement restrictions on targeted therapy accessibility for non-small cell lung cancer treatment in Taiwan: An interrupted time series study","2019","Interventions: Targeted therapies have been proven to provide clinical benefits to patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib was initially approved and reimbursed as a third-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC by the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) in 2004; subsequently it became a second-line therapy (in 2007) and further a first-line therapy (in 2011) for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. Another targeted therapy, erlotinib, was initially approved as a third-line therapy in 2007, and it became a second-line therapy in 2008. Objectives: This study is aimed towards an exploration of the impacts of the Taiwan NHI reimbursement policies (removing reimbursement restrictions) related to accessibility of targeted therapies. Setting: We retrieved 2004-2013 claims data for all patients with lung cancer diagnoses from the NHI Research Database. Design and outcome measures: Using an interrupted time series design and segmented regression, we estimated changes in the monthly prescribing rate by patient number and market shares by cost following each modification of the reimbursement policy for gefitinib and erlotinib for NSCLC treatment. Results: Totally 92 220 patients with NSCLC were identified. The prescribing rate of the targeted therapies increased by 15.58%, decreased by 10.98% and increased by 6.31% following the introduction of gefitinib as a second-line treatment in 2007, erlotinib as a second-line treatment in 2008 and gefitinib as as first line treatment in 2011, respectively. The average time to prescription reduced by 65.84% and 41.59% following coverage of erlotinib by insurance and gefitinib/erlotinib as second-line treatments in 2007-2008 and following gefitinib as the first-line treatment in 2011. Conclusions: The changes in reimbursement policies had a significant impact on the accessibility of targeted therapies for NSCLC treatment. Removing reimbursement restrictions can significantly increase the level and the speed of drug accessibility. ? 2019 Author(s).","erlotinib; gefitinib; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer research; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; molecularly targeted therapy; national health insurance; non small cell lung cancer; outcome assessment; patient identification; prescription; reimbursement; Taiwan; trend study"
"Two separate functions of NME3 critical for cell survival underlie a neurodegenerative disorder","2019","We report a patient who presented with congenital hypotonia, hypoventilation, and cerebellar histopathological alterations. Exome analysis revealed a homozygous mutation in the initiation codon of the NME3 gene, which encodes an NDP kinase. The initiation-codon mutation leads to deficiency in NME3 protein expression. NME3 is a mitochondrial outer-membrane protein capable of interacting with MFN1/2, and its depletion causes dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics. Consistently, the patient’s fibroblasts were characterized by a slow rate of mitochondrial dynamics, which was reversed by expression of wild-type or catalytic-dead NME3. Moreover, glucose starvation caused mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death in the patient’s cells. The expression of wild-type and catalytic-dead but not oligomerization-attenuated NME3 restored mitochondrial elongation. However, only wild-type NME3 sustained ATP production and viability. Thus, the separate functions of NME3 in mitochondrial fusion and NDP kinase cooperate in metabolic adaptation for cell survival in response to glucose starvation. Given the critical role of mitochondrial dynamics and energy requirements in neuronal development, the homozygous mutation in NME3 is linked to a fatal mitochondrial neurodegenerative disorder. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"Trends in antidiabetic medical treatment from 2005 to 2014 in Taiwan","2019","Background/Purpose: Several new antidiabetic drugs have been introduced in Taiwan. However, the trends in antidiabetic treatment remain unexamined. Methods: We studied data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to identify outpatient prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs from 2005 to 2014. The patterns in antidiabetic treatment and the number of different classes of antidiabetic drugs were analyzed. The proportions of prescriptions of antidiabetic monotherapy, combination therapy, or insulin therapy were further analyzed. Results: The total and mean prescriptions gradually increased during the study period. Prescription of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) only or insulin-only therapy decreased slightly. Prescriptions of monotherapy and dual therapy decreased, whereas those of triple or higher order combinations increased. Prescriptions of sulfonylureas (SUs) decreased, whereas those of metformin and dipeptidyl peptidease-4 (DPP4) inhibitors increased. Insulin prescriptions increased but accounted for only 13.07% of prescriptions in 2014. Among monotherapy prescriptions, SU prescriptions decreased, but metformin and DPP4 inhibitor prescriptions increased. Among dual OAD prescriptions, those including SUs decreased, and those of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors increased. Although prescriptions of the metformin–SU combination decreased, they remained the most common among all dual OAD prescriptions, followed by the metformin–DPP4 inhibitor combination. Prescriptions of human insulin decreased and those of insulin analogs increased considerably; those of basal insulin increased, and those of mixed insulin decreased. However, mixed insulin was prescribed more than basal–bolus insulin. Conclusion: Antidiabetic treatment has become complex in Taiwan. Although combination therapy would become the major treatment strategy gradually, the underuse of insulin therapy must improve. ? 2019","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; human insulin; insulin; insulin derivative; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; short acting insulin; sulfonylurea derivative; Article; combination drug therapy; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; drug utilization; human; insulin treatment; major clinical study; monotherapy; national health insurance; outpatient care; prescription; Taiwan; trend study"

"Determination of Pyruvate Metabolic Fates Modulates Head and Neck Tumorigenesis","2019","Even with increasing evidence for roles of glycolytic enzymes in controlling cancerous characteristics, the best target of candidate metabolic enzymes for lessening malignancy remains under debate. Pyruvate is a main glycolytic metabolite that could be mainly converted into either lactate by Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA)or acetyl-CoA by Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 component α subunit (PDHA1)catalytic complex. In tumor cells, accumulating lactate is produced whereas the conversion of pyruvate into mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is less active compared with their normal counterparts. This reciprocal molecular association makes pyruvate metabolism a potential choice of anti-cancer target. Cellular and molecular changes were herein assayed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)cells in response to LDHA and PDHA1 loss in vitro, in vivo and in clinic. By using various human cancer databases and clinical samples, LDHA and PDHA1 levels exhibit reversed prognostic roles. In vitro analysis demonstrated that decreased cell growth and motility accompanied by an increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents was found in cells with LDHA loss whereas PDHA1-silencing exhibited opposite phenotypes. At the molecular level, it was found that oncogenic Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt)and Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)singling pathways contribute to pyruvate metabolism mediated HNSCC cell growth. Furthermore, LDHA/PDHA1 changes in HNSCC cells resulted in a broad metabolic reprogramming while intracellular molecules including polyunsaturated fatty acids and nitrogen metabolism related metabolites underlie the malignant changes. Collectively, our findings reveal the significance of pyruvate metabolic fates in modulating HNSCC tumorigenesis and highlight the impact of metabolic plasticity in HNSCC cells. ? 2019 The Authors","lactate dehydrogenase; lactate dehydrogenase A; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein kinase B; pyruvate dehydrogenase; pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component alpha; pyruvic acid; unclassified drug; lactate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; LDHA protein, human; pyruvate dehydrogenase; pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit; pyruvic acid; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer prognosis; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell motility; controlled study; gene silencing; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; MAPK signaling; metabolism; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; priority journal; protein depletion; protein expression; animal; cell proliferation; genetics; glycolysis; metabolism; mitochondrion; pathology; tumor cell line; xenograft; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Glycolysis; Heterografts; Humans; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lactic Acid; Mice; Mitochondria; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide); Pyruvic Acid; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck"
"Thoracic aortic calcification across the clinical dysglycemic continuum in a large Asian population free of cardiovascular symptoms","2019","Thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) is tightly linked to pathological atherosclerosis and associated with certain cardiovascular diseases. While diabetes mellitus (DM) is known as a coronary heart disease equivalent, we examined the presence of TAC across the dysglycemic spectrum of diabetes mellitus (DM). We consecutively studied 3003 asymptomatic ethnic Asians underwent annual cardiovacular health survey, and further categorized them into: 1) 1760 normo-glycemic, 2) 968 pre-diabetic, and 3) 274 overt DM based on dysglycemic indices and medical histories. Several TAC parameters were assessed using non-contrast multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), and related to dysglycemic indices or diabetes mellitus status. A remarkably graded increases of adjusted total TAC calcium burden, volume and density were seen across Non-diabetes, Pre-diabetes, and diabetes mellitus categories and positively correlated with all dysglycemic profiles (all p<0.001). Multi-variate logistic and linear regression models demonstrated independent associations between greater TAC density and all dysglycemic indices (Coef: 2.5, 1.4, 6.8 for fasting, postprandial sugar and HbA1c) and diabetes mellitus status (all p<0.05). Furthermore, Receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) showed fasting sugar and postprandial sugar set at 103mg/ dL and 111mg/dL, separately, with HbA1c set at 5.8% all predict the presence of aortic calcification. Dysglycemic status, even without overt diabetes mellitus, were tighly linked to sub-clinical, pathological thoracic aortic calcification. ? 2019 Tsai et al.

"Diabetic status and the relationship of blood glucose to mortality in adults with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteremia","2019","Background/Purpose: Diabetes is associated with increased mortality in Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) complex infection. This study investigated the risk factors and relationship of diabetic status and glycemic indices to mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant (CR) AB complex bacteremia. Methods: Relationship of glycemic indices to mortality were compared in adult diabetes (DM) and nondiabetes (non-DM) patients with CRAB complex bacteremia hospitalized from January 2010 to December 2015 in MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Results: Of 317 patients with CRAB complex bacteremia, 146 (46.06%) had diabetes. DM patients were elderly (mean age of 69.23 years) and the mortality rate was higher (64.38% vs. 52.05%, p = 0.036) than in non-DM patients. By multivariate analysis, septic shock was associated with increased mortality in DM patients. Hypoglycemia was associated with increased mortality in non-DM patients only (100% vs. 50.33%, p = 0.006). The lowest mortality was for the blood glucose range 70–100 mg/dL in non-DM patients (43.24%) and 100–140 mg/dL for DM patients (56.52%). Increased glycemic variability (coefficient of variation (CV) > 40% compared to < 20%) was associated with increased mortality in non-DM patients (86.36% vs. 47.12%, p = 0.003). Conclusion: Effects of dysglycemia on mortality due to CRAB complex bacteremia differ according to diabetic status. Mortality was higher in DM patients. In non-DM patients, hypoglycemia and increased CV were associated with increased mortality. The lowest mortality was for the blood glucose range 70–100 mg/dL in non-DM patients and 100–140 mg/dL for DM patients. ? 2018","amikacin; antibiotic agent; ceftazidime; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; colistin; corticosteroid; cotrimoxazole; gentamicin; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; imipenem; immunosuppressive agent; piperacillin; piperacillin plus tazobactam; prednisolone; sulfamethoxazole; sultamicillin; tetracycline; tigecycline; antiinfective agent; carbapenem derivative; Acinetobacter infection; adult; aged; Article; blood glucose monitoring; carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; dysglycemia; female; glucose blood level; glycemic control; hospitalization; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; infection risk; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; observational study; outcome assessment; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; septic shock; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter infection; analysis; antibiotic resistance; bacteremia; blood; diabetic complication; drug effect; epidemiology; glucose blood level; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; middle aged; mortality; physiology; Taiwan; very elderly; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter Infections; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Blood Glucose; Carbapenems; Diabetes Complications; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Female; Humans; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Large-area blade-coated organic solar cells processed from halogen-free solvent","2019","High performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are generally prepared by halogenated solvents, which are detrimental to the environment and human health. The replacement of hazardous halogenated solvents is a priority in the commercialization of solution-processed OSCs. In this study, poly[4,8?bis(5?(2?ethylhexyl)thiophen?2?yl)benzo[1,2?b;4,5?b’]dithiophene?2,6?diyl?alt?(4?(2?ethylhexyl)?3?fluorothieno[3,4?b]thiophene?)?2?carboxylate?2?6-diyl)] (PBDTTT?EFT):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)-based device processed with binary halogen-free solvents (toluene and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) is fabricated by blade-coating method. Through the combination of morphological manipulation of active layer and interfacial engineering, the resulting OSCs deliver a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.09%. Importantly, large-area (216 cm2) blade-coated bulk-heterojunction OSCs is also demonstrated, and the resulting devices deliver a high PCE up to 5.03%, which is comparable to those of the devices processed with halogenated solvents (PCE = 5.20%). Additionally, the devices processed with halogen-free solvents also exhibit superior stability, maintaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 3960 h of continuous operation. More encouragingly, halogen-free solvents-based manufacturing process can also be performed under ambient conditions, and a moderate PCE of 3.67% is attained for large-area (216 cm2) OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 3.67% represents the highest efficiency ever reported for air-processed large-area OSCs. This work paves the way towards the realization of environmentally-friendly large-area OSCs with high performance and long-term stability. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Butyric acid; Carboxylation; Coatings; Efficiency; Halogenation; Heterojunctions; Organic solvents; Air processing; Blade coatings; Halogen-free; Large area; Manufacturing process; Morphological manipulations; N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; Power conversion efficiencies; Organic solar cells"
"Serum pepsinogen as a predictor for gastric cancer death A 16-year community-based cohort study","2019","Goals: The purpose of this article is to validate the long-term association between initial serum pepsinogen (PG) measurements and subsequent gastric cancer-specific deaths from a long-term longitudinal cohort. Background: Endoscopic surveillance can be effective and efficient in reducing gastric cancer mortality if a biomarker such as serum PG is available to identify high-risk individuals and if the biomarker also is specific to gastric cancer risk. Study: Between 1995 and 1998, a gastric cancer-screening program was conducted in a high-risk population: The first stage involved PG testing, and the second stage involved upper endoscopy. The outcome was gastric cancer death, which was monitored until December 31, 2010; results were expressed as the hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Other causes of death were used as comparators. Results: Among participants (n=3514) aged ?30 years, 1682 (47.9%) were screened to determine serum PG levels. After 16 years of followup, 14 deaths from gastric cancer were documented. Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, and Helicobacter pylori serological positivity showed that PG-I <30 μg/L and PG-I <30 μg/L or PG-I/II ratio <3 were significantly associated with the risk of gastric cancer death (HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.11-9.61 and HR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.18-10.12, respectively). In contrast, there were no significant associations between PG and other causes of death, including neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Conclusion: This long-term cohort study shows the usefulness of PG measurement as a biomarker that is specific to the risk of gastric cancer death.

"A novel DNA repair inhibitor, diallyl disulfide (DADS), impairs DNA resection during DNA double-strand break repair by reducing Sae2 and Exo1 levels","2019","Combining natural products with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may increase the efficacy of cancer treatment. It has been hypothesized that natural products may inhibit DNA repair and sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage-based cancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these activities remain unclear. In this study, we found that diallyl disulfide (DADS), an organosulfur compound, increased the sensitivity of yeast cells to DNA damage and has potential for development as an adjuvant drug for DNA damage-based cancer therapy. We induced HO endonuclease to generate a specific DNA double-strand break (DSB) by adding galactose to yeast and used this system to study how DADS affects DNA repair. In this study, we found that DADS inhibited DNA repair in single-strand annealing (SSA) system and sensitized SSA cells to a single DSB. DADS impaired DNA repair by inhibiting the protein levels of the DNA resection-related proteins Sae2 and Exo1. We also found that the recruitment of MRX and the Mec1-Ddc2 complex to a DSB was prevented by DADS. This result suggests that DADS counteracts G2/M DNA damage checkpoint activation in a Mec1 (ATR)- and Tel1 (ATM)-dependent manner. Only by elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which DADS influences DNA repair will we be able to discover new adjuvant drugs to improve chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","diallyl disulfide; double stranded DNA; endonuclease; exo1 protein; galactose; mec1 ddc2 complex protein; mec1 protein; mrx protein; nuclease; sae2 protein; tel1 protein; unclassified drug; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cancer cell; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; double stranded DNA break; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; nonhuman; priority journal; yeast cell"
"The emerging roles and functions of circular RNAs and their generation","2019","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are closed long non-coding RNAs, in which the 5' and 3' termini are covalently linked by back-splicing of exons from a single pre-mRNA. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs are broadly expressed in mammalian cells and show cell type- or tissue-specific expression patterns. Importantly, circRNAs have been shown to participate in regulating various biological processes. Functionally, circRNAs can influence cellular physiology through various molecular mechanisms, such as serving as a decoy for microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins to modulate gene expression or translation of regulatory proteins. The biogenesis of circRNAs is known to be tightly regulated by cis- (intronic complementary sequences) and/or trans-factors (splicing factors) that constitute a cell- and context-dependent regulatory layer in the control of gene expression. However, our understanding of the regulation and function of circRNAs is still limited. In this review, we summarize the current progress in elucidating the functional roles, mechanisms and biogenesis of circRNAs. We also discuss the relationship between regulation and formation of circRNAs. ? 2019 The Author(s).","APC protein; APC2 protein; circular RNA; cyclin dependent kinase 2; cyclin dependent kinase 6; interleukin 6 receptor; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 107; microRNA 1261; microRNA 130a; microRNA 138; microRNA 145; microRNA 214; microRNA 22 3p; microRNA 34a; microRNA 3619; microRNA 4302; microRNA 7; octamer transcription factor 4; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1; protein p21; RNA; transcription factor FKHRL1; transcription factor NANOG; transcription factor Sox2; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 4; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; long untranslated RNA; RNA; RNA, circular; transcription factor; transcriptome; apoptosis; biogenesis; cancer growth; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cellular distribution; down regulation; endothelium cell; enzyme inhibition; epithelial mesenchymal transition; exon; human; internal ribosome entry site; intron; intronic complementary sequence; myoblast; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein RNA binding; Review; signal transduction; upregulation; animal; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; physiology; Animals; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; RNA; RNA, Long Noncoding; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome"
"The prevalence and association of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction and complete left bundle-branch block in Taiwan","2019","Background/Purpose: A deleterious effect of complete left bundle-branch block (cLBBB) on left ventricular (LV) function has been established. The underutilization of cardiac resynchronization therapy has been noted in Taiwan and the Asian-Pacific area, but the reasons remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and association of cLBBB and impaired LV ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). Methods: We enrolled 164,049 patients who underwent standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) between January 2010 and December 2013 at NTUH. Echocardiographic examinations within one year of the index ECG were analyzed. Baseline clinical characteristics, electrocardiography and ECG parameters, in patients with cLBBB were compared among those with three different LVEFs (EF <35%, 35%? EF<50%, and EF ?50%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis were conducted to identify independent predictors of impaired LVEF in patient with cLBBB. Results: The prevalence of cLBBB was 0.4% (648 patients), and it increased with age. The estimated prevalence of cLBBB and LVEF <35% was about 0.1%. The effects of age on the distributions of patients with cLBBB by three different EF statuses were significantly disparate. In patients with cLBBB aged >80 years, 64% had a normal EF. However, in those aged between 40 and 60 years, the risk of EF <35% was as high as 45%, and the risk of EF <50% was even higher at 60%. Conclusion: Patients in Taiwan had a low prevalence of LVEF<35% and cLBBB. About three-fourth of patients with cLBBB did not experience HF events, and 56% of them had a normal LVEF. The development of an effective triage strategy for these patients is warranted. ? 2018","adult; age; aged; Article; cardiovascular risk; clinical feature; disease association; electrocardiography; evaluation study; female; heart disease; heart left bundle branch block; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; prevalence; Taiwan; university hospital; age distribution; cardiac resynchronization therapy; echocardiography; heart bundle branch block; heart failure; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; procedures; statistical model; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bundle-Branch Block; Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy; Echocardiography; Electrocardiography; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prevalence; Stroke Volume; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Young Adult"
"Prenatal perfluorooctanoic acid exposure and glutathione s-transferase T1/M1 genotypes and their association with atopic dermatitis at 2 years of age","2019","Background Perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure was found associated with atopic diseases. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a childhood skin disorder. However, the effect of interaction between PFASs and glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1/M1 genotype on AD remains unclear. Objective To investigate the association between gene-environmental interaction and childhood AD using a birth cohort study. Methods From 2001 to 2005, 1,264 mother–newborn pairs were recruited from eight Taiwanese maternity hospitals. PFAS levels and Genotypes were analysed from cord blood. Information on children’s health status including AD occurrence was obtained via phone interviews at 6 months and 2 years. Cord plasma concentrations of nine PFASs were measured via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. GSTT1/M1 was genotyped (null/present) via polymerase chain reaction. Environment-gene interaction effects on AD were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results Overall, 839 mother–newborn pairs completed all measurements. The prevalence of ever having physician-diagnosed AD by 2 years of age was 5.4%. Among PFASs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was positively associated with AD adjusted for potential confounders. After grouping PFOA levels into three groups: undetected, below and above the median in those with detected, children in above the median group who had the GSTT1-null, or GSTM1-null genotype exhibited a higher odds ratio for AD (OR [95%CI] = 3.45 [1.26–9.99] and 2.92 [1.12–7.91], respectively) as compared to the undetected group. Conclusions Our data demonstrated that in-utero PFOA exposure with GSTT1/M1 null genotype were associated with AD. Minimizing early-life PFAS exposure may help against AD development, especially in genetically susceptible individuals. ? 2019 Wen et al.

"Trends in the management of peritonsillar abscess in children: A nationwide population-based study in Taiwan","2019","Objective: Population-based studies analyzing peritonsillar abscess in children are lacking. In this study, a population-based survey of the epidemiology of pediatric peritonsillar abscess in Taiwan was conducted. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. All cases of inpatient pediatric peritonsillar abscess (age &lt; 18 years) in Taiwan between 2000 and 2012 were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Incidence rates of inpatient peritonsillar abscess in children were calculated. Characteristics such as age, gender, hospital level, treatment modalities, imaging studies, drug administration, and length of hospital stays during the study period were analyzed. Results: A total of 12,965 children with peritonsillar abscess were included (mean age, 6.6 years [standard deviation, 4.8 years]; 56.5% boys). The overall incidence was 18 per 100,000 children. Incidence rates decreased from 2000 to 2012 (19.1/100,000 to 8.3/100,000 children) (ptrend &lt; 0.001). During the study period, the proportion of peritonsillar abscess treatments at medical centers increased from 4.6% to 15.0%. The proportion of treatments involving incision and drainage or needle aspiration increased significantly (1.3%–4.1% and 49.4%–65.6%, respectively), whereas treatments with antibiotics only decreased significantly (48.9%–29.0%). The use of computed tomography (CT) increased (1.4%–12%, ptrend &lt; 0.001). The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and penicillin increased during the study period. The mean length of hospital stays increased from 3.78 to 4.67 days. Conclusions: The incidence of peritonsillar abscess in children decreased between 2000 and 2012 in Taiwan. Moreover, increasing trends were observed in the use of CT, the rates of incision and drainage and needle aspiration procedures, and the length of hospital stay in this study cohort. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; penicillin derivative; steroid; antiinfective agent; antiinflammatory agent; corticosteroid; abscess drainage; age; Article; child; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; cross-sectional study; female; fine needle aspiration biopsy; gender; health survey; hospitalization; human; human tissue; ICD-9; incidence; incision; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical parameters; peritonsillar abscess; priority journal; Taiwan; trend study; adolescent; infant; paracentesis; peritonsillar abscess; preschool child; x-ray computed tomography; Adolescent; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drainage; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Length of Stay; Male; Paracentesis; Penicillins; Peritonsillar Abscess; Taiwan; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"Identification of a metastatic lung adenocarcinoma of the palate mucosa through genetic and histopathological analysis: A rare case report and literature review","2019","Background: Cancers of unknown primary origin (CUPs) are reported to be the 3-4th most common causes of cancer death. Recent years have seen advances in mutational analysis and genomics profiling. These advances could improve accuracy of diagnosis of CUPs and might improve the prognosis of patients with CUPs. Case presentation: A 76-year old male with an adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin in the lung presented with another tumor of the palate mucosa. The tumor cells in the pleural effusion were all negative for immunohistochemical markers (TTF-1 and Napsin A) and lung-specific oncogenic driver alterations (EGFR mutation and ALK translocation). The tumor of the palate mucosa was likewise identified as an adenocarcinoma, and the cells showed cytological similarities with the tumor cells in the pleural effusion; TTF-1, Napsin A, EGFR mutation and ALK translocation were all negative. This result suggested that origins of the tumors of the palate mucosa and in the lung were the same, even though the origin had not yet been determined. Next, we addressed whether the tumor of the palate mucosa was a primary tumor or not. Secretory carcinoma (SC), which is a common type of minor salivary gland tumor (MSGT), was suspected; however, mammaglobin was negative and ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion was not observed. Other MSGTs were excluded based on histological and immunohistochemical findings. Furthermore, an additional examination demonstrated an oncogenic KRAS mutation at codon 12 (p.G12D) in both palate tumor and in pleural effusion. KRAS mutation is known to exist in one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs), but quite rare in MSGTs. The possibility of metastasis from other organs was considered unlikely from the results of endoscopic and imaging studies. This result indicated that the primary site of the CUP was indeed the lung, and that the tumor of the palate mucosa was a metastasis of the LUAD. Conclusions: A tumor of the palate mucosa that showed diagnostic difficulties was determined to be a metastatic LUAD by genomic alterations and histopathological findings. ? 2019 The Author(s).","anaplastic lymphoma kinase; biological marker; carboplatin; carcinoembryonic antigen; epidermal growth factor receptor; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; homeobox protein Nkx 2.1; mammaglobin; napsin A; paclitaxel; unclassified drug; ALK protein, human; anaplastic lymphoma kinase; cytokeratin 7; epidermal growth factor receptor; KRAS protein, human; protein p21; tumor marker; aged; ALK gene; bone metastasis; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer of unknown primary site; carcinogenesis; case report; clinical article; codon; cytology; EGFR gene; endoscopy; ETV6 NTRK3 gene; gene fusion; gene mutation; gene translocation; genetic analysis; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lung adenocarcinoma; lung nodule; lymph node metastasis; male; medical history; metastatic lung adenocarcinoma; minor salivary gland tumor; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oncogene K ras; palate; palate mucosa; palate mucosa tumor; physical examination; pleura effusion; pleural dissemination; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; Review; salivary gland tumor; secretory carcinoma; thorax pain; tumor cell; tumor classification; diagnostic imaging; dna mutational analysis; genetic screening; genetics; lung adenocarcinoma; metabolism; mouth mucosa; mutation; palate; pathology; x-ray computed tomography; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Aged; Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase; Biomarkers, Tumor; DNA Mutational Analysis; ErbB Receptors; Genetic Testing; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Keratin-7; Male; Mouth Mucosa; Mutation; Palate; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"A salivary protein of Aedes aegypti promotes dengue-2 virus replication and transmission","2019","Although dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in humans, no effective medication or vaccine is presently available. Previous studies suggested that mosquito salivary proteins influence infection by the dengue virus (DENV) in the mammalian host. However, the effects of salivary proteins on DENV replication within the Aedes aegypti mosquito remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of a specific salivary protein (named AaSG34) on DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) replication and transmission. We showed that transcripts of AaSG34 were upregulated in the salivary glands of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes after a meal of blood infected with DENV2. Transcripts of the dengue viral genome and envelop protein in the salivary glands were significantly diminished after an infectious blood meal when AaSG34 was silenced. The effect of AaSG34 on DENV2 transmission was investigated in Stat1-deficient mice. The intradermal inoculation of infectious mosquito saliva induced hemorrhaging in the Stat1-deficient mice; however, saliva from the AaSG34-silenced mosquitoes did not induce hemorrhaging, suggesting that AaSG34 enhances DENV2 transmission. This is the first report to demonstrate that the protein AaSG34 promotes DENV2 replication in mosquito salivary glands and enhances the transmission of the virus to the mammalian host. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",""

"Identification of Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting Novel Conformational Epitopes of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus Spike Protein","2019","Since 2010, newly identified variants of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) have caused high mortality in neonatal piglets which has devastated the swine industry. The spike (S) glycoprotein of PEDV contains multiple neutralizing epitopes and is a major target for PEDV neutralization and vaccine development. To understand the antigenicity of the new PEDV variant, we characterized the neutralizing epitopes of a new genotype 2b PEDV isolate from Taiwan, PEDV Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT), by the generation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs). Two NmAbs, P4B-1, and E10E-1–10 that recognized the ectodomain of the full-length recombinant PEDV S protein and exhibited neutralizing ability against the PEDV-PT virus were selected. Recombinant truncated S proteins were used to identify the target sequences for the NmAbs and P4B-1 was shown to recognize the C-terminus of CO-26K equivalent epitope (COE) at amino acids (a.a.) 575–639 of the PEDV S. Interestingly, E10E-1–10 could recognize a novel neutralizing epitope at a.a. 435–485 within the S1 A domain of the PEDV S protein, whose importance and function are yet to be determined. Moreover, both NmAbs could not bind to linearized S proteins, indicating that only conformational epitopes are recognized. This data could improve our understanding of the antigenic structures of the PEDV S protein and facilitate future development of novel epitope-based vaccines. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

A cross-sectional study was conducted on postpartum women who returned to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic for routine examination from January 2016 to September 2017. A total of 344 women received assessments based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). An EPDS score of ?10 indicated the presence of postpartum depressive symptoms (PPDS). A total of 97 women without such symptoms and 23 with PPDS completed nutritional parameter analyses and questionnaires. The results showed that the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) was 8.4%. The proportion was 70% for those who practiced confinement at home, significantly higher than for those in the non-PPDS group (45%). The overall psychological stress score was significantly higher and the postpartum care satisfaction score was significantly lower in those with PPDS compared to those without. In terms of nutritional biomarkers, the plasma riboflavin levels in the PPDS group were significantly lower than those in their symptomless counterparts (13.9%). The vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency rates in the non-PPD and PPDS groups were 35%, 41%, 48%, 26%, respectively. However, compared with those in the non-PPDS group, those with PPDS had significantly higher ratios of Σn-6/Σn-3, C20:3n-6/C18:3n-6, and C20:4n-6/(C20:5n-3 + C22:6n-3) (by 8.2%, 79.7%, and 8.8%, respectively), whereas they had lower ratios of C22:6n-3/C22:5n-6 (by 15.5%). Higher plasma riboflavin and erythrocyte C16:1n-9, C24:1n-9, C18:3n-6, and C20:5n-3 levels and lower Σn-6 fatty acid and C22:5n-6 levels decreased the risk of PPD after type of confinement, overall mental stress scores, and postpartum care satisfaction scores were adjusted for the logistic regression analysis. In conclusion, the plasma riboflavin level and erythrocyte fatty acid composition are potentially major contributors to PPD development. ? 2019 by the authors.

"A phase IV, randomized, multicenter, open-label trial comparing efficacy and systemic exposure for a standard weight-based dose versus a fixed dose of plerixafor in combination with G-CSF in patients with Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma weighing ?70 kg","2019","A randomized, multicenter, open-label study explored the effect of a fixed-dose (FD) of plerixafor versus the approved weight-based (WB) dose for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and a body weight of ?70 kg. After mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 10 μg/kg/day for 4 days, patients were randomized 1:1 to either plerixafor FD 20 mg (n = 30) or WB 0.24 mg/kg (n = 31) on the evening of Day 4. Co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving ?5 × 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg in ?4 days of apheresis, and total systemic exposure to plerixafor (area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 10 h [AUC 0–10 ]). There was no statistically significant difference between the proportion of patients attaining the primary efficacy endpoint (60% FD arm, 55% WB arm; P = 0.395). Exposure to plerixafor was greater in the FD arm relative to the WB arm; however, there was no appreciable difference regarding fold increases of peripheral blood CD34 + cells. The safety profile was similar between treatment groups. These results suggest there is no statistically significant difference in HSC mobilization with a standard WB dosing regimen of plerixafor plus G-CSF in patients with low body weight compared with an FD regimen. ? 2018, The Author(s).","filgrastim; plerixafor; adult; aged; anemia; apheresis; area under the curve; Article; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; body weight; CD34 selection; controlled study; diarrhea; dose response; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug safety; evening dosage; female; hematopoietic stem cell; human; hypocalcemia; hypokalemia; major clinical study; male; maximum concentration; morning dosage; multicenter study; nausea; nonhodgkin lymphoma; phase 4 clinical trial; plasma concentration-time curve; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; stem cell mobilization; thrombocytopenia; time to maximum plasma concentration"
"Protective effects of antioxidant egg-chalaza hydrolysates against chronic alcohol consumption-induced liver steatosis in mice","2019","BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction is highly related to some human chronic diseases. There are approximately 400 metric tons of chalazae produced yearly after the processing of the liquid-egg production, which are disposed of as waste. The objectives of this study were to look for the optimal production condition of antioxidant crude chalaza hydrolysates and evaluate the in vivo antioxidant capacity via a chronic alcohol consumption mouse model. RESULTS: Antioxidant crude chalaza hydrolysates (CCH-As) could be produced by protease A at 1:100 ratio (w/w) and 0.5 h hydrolytic period. After our analyses, CCH-As were rich in leucine, arginine, phenylalanine, valine, lysine and antioxidant dipeptides (anserine and carnosine), and the major molecular masses were lower than 15 kDa. Regarding protective effects of CCH-As against oxidative damage in alcoholic-liquid-diet-fed mice, alcohol-fed mice had lower (P < 0.05) liver antioxidant capacities, and higher (P < 0.05) liver lipid contents, serum lipid/liver damage indices and IL-1β/IL-6 values. CCH-A supplementation reversed (P < 0.05) liver antioxidant capacities and reduced (P < 0.05) serum/liver lipids in alcohol-fed mice, which may result from increased (P < 0.05) fecal lipid output, upregulated (P < 0.05) fatty acid β-oxidation and downregulated (P < 0.05) lipogenesis in the liver. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this CCH-A should benefit the liquid-egg industry, while also offering consumers a choice of healthy ingredients from animal sources. ? 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. ? 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","antioxidant; interleukin 6; protein hydrolysate; reactive oxygen metabolite; analysis; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; chicken; drinking behavior; drug effect; egg yolk; fatty liver; human; liver; male; metabolism; mouse; waste; Alcohol Drinking; Animals; Antioxidants; Chickens; Egg Yolk; Fatty Liver; Humans; Interleukin-6; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Protein Hydrolysates; Reactive Oxygen Species; Waste Products"
"A simple method to estimate prediction intervals and predictive distributions: Summarizing meta-analyses beyond means and confidence intervals","2019","A systematic review and meta-analysis is an important step in evidence synthesis. The current paradigm for meta-analyses requires a presentation of the means under a random-effects model; however, a mean with a confidence interval provides an incomplete summary of the underlying heterogeneity in meta-analysis. Prediction intervals show the range of true effects in future studies and have been advocated to be regularly presented. Most commonly, prediction intervals are estimated assuming that the underlying heterogeneity follows a normal distribution, which is not necessarily appropriate. In this article, we provide a simple method with a ready-to-use spreadsheet file to estimate prediction intervals and predictive distributions nonparametrically. Simulation studies show that this new method can provide approximately unbiased estimates compared with the conventional method. We also illustrate the advantage and real-world significance of this approach with a meta-analysis evaluating the protective effect of vaccination against tuberculosis. The nonparametric predictive distribution provides more information about the shape of the underlying distribution than does the conventional method. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","algorithm; computer simulation; confidence interval; human; literature; meta analysis (topic); normal distribution; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; statistical analysis; statistical model; tuberculosis; vaccination; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Confidence Intervals; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Models, Statistical; Normal Distribution; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Review Literature as Topic; Tuberculosis; Vaccination"
"Assessing causality between childhood adiposity and early puberty: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization and longitudinal study","2019","Aims: Obesity and early puberty have been reported to be mutually causative. We investigated the causal relationship between adiposity and early puberty by performing bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and longitudinal data analyses. Methods: We used information from the Taiwan Children Health Study (3109 adolescents aged 11–12 years) with 17 body mass index (BMI)- and 10 puberty-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to produce genetic instrumental variables (IVs). The two-stage least squares (2SLS) method, MR sensitivity analysis, and survival analysis were used to explore and confirm causality. Results: Regression estimates from IVs revealed that significantly increased association of BMI with early puberty was noted (coefficients: 0.13, 0.10, and 0.09; 95% CI: 0.07–0.19, 0.02–0.19, and 0.02–0.16 for all participants, male adolescents, and female adolescents, respectively). Genetic IVs for puberty were not associated with BMI. MR sensitivity and two-sample MR analyses produced similar results. Longitudinal analysis results revealed that prepubertal overweight and obesity could predict early onset of puberty. However, after excluding children with a history of overweight and obesity at the age of 7–12 years, early puberty was not found to trigger new-onset of overweight and obesity at the age of 18 years in either sex. Conclusions: Higher adiposity may lead to early puberty. However, the causal effects of early puberty on adiposity accumulation were not supported by our data. Targeted interventions to reduce childhood obesity are strongly recommended to prevent obesity-related comorbidities, as well as early puberty onset. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adolescent; Article; body composition; body mass; causality; child; childhood obesity; cohort analysis; fat free mass; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; male; menarche; Mendelian randomization analysis; obesity; priority journal; puberty; school child; sensitivity analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; survival analysis"
"Oblique views of chest radiography from a designed rotation angle recommendation increase the contrast ratio between obscured lesions and surrounding structures","2019","Background: Chest radiography (CXR) is the main tool used to detect pulmonary nodules. Lateral views of CXR are less effective and the aim of our study was to develop a rotation angle recommendation model to obtain the best oblique CXR with significantly increased contrast between lesions and surrounding normal structures in order to enhance the detection rate for potential obscured lesions on traditional posterior and anterior (PA) CXR. Methods: A total of 140 subjects receiving low-dose lung computed tomography (CT) screening were enrolled from the health check-up database. An additional 14 cases with lung lesions on chest CT were included. Demography was also reviewed. Gross, left and right cardiothoracic ratios (CTR) were measured. All CT images were transformed to CXR to detect the best rotation angles and produce different views of CXR. Contrast ratio was calculated in the transformed CXR from CT with lesions. Comparison of contrast ratio among oblique, posterior-anterior and lateral views was performed. Results: CXR shows smaller gross CTR and left CTR but larger heart width and thoracic width in men than in women. Correlation evaluation displays gross CTR, heart width and left CTR are positively correlated with age only for the women group. The most important factor for the best rotation angle is right CTR for left rotation angle and left CTR for right rotation angle. The contrast ratio of the lesion to surrounding structures is significantly better on the oblique views in the designed angles than that on the traditional views. Conclusion: CXR oblique views in the assigned angle from the 10-degree rotation angle recommendation are able to enhance contrast ratio between the possible obscured lesions and surrounding structures on CXR. ? 2019 The Authors.

"CpG Island Methylator Phenotype May Predict Poor Overall Survival of Patients with Stage IV Colorectal Cancer","2019","Objective: We aimed to study the prognostic role of CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in patients with different stages of colorectal cancer (CRC). Material and Methods: We analyzed CIMP in stage I-IV CRC specimens from patients who were diagnosed between 2005 and 2013. CIMP status was determined using a 5-gene MethyLight-based assay. The clinicopathologic characteristics were reviewed and the overall survival (OS) was compared between patients with CIMP-high CRC and those with CIMP-low/negative CRC. Results: Among 450 CRC specimens with successfully determined CIMP statuses, 74 (16.4%) were CIMP-high CRC. Although there was no difference in OS between patients with CIMP-high and CIMP-low/negative CRC across all stages (p = 0.4526), intriguingly, patients with stage IV CIMP-high CRC had significantly worse OS than those with stage IV CIMP-low/negative CRC (p = 0.0047). In a multivariate analysis, CIMP status remained an independent prognostic factor for overall mortality (HR = 5.60, 95% CI: 2.12-14.79, p = 0.0005) in metastatic CRC after adjusting for clinicopathologic variables and anti-cancer therapies. Conclusion: Our results revealed that the presence of CIMP independently predicts poor OS in patients with stage IV CRC. ? 2018 S.

"Prognostic factors of early stage epithelial ovarian carcinoma","2019","We aimed to determine prognostic factors of early stage (I/II) epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) including clinicopathologic and chemotherapeutic regimens. Four hundred and thirty-seven women who underwent primary staging surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed from two medical centers. The prognostic factors were determined from multivariate survival analyses using Cox regression models. The majority of women were diagnosed with stage Ic (244/437, 55.8%). The histopathologic types were clear cell (37.5%), endometrioid (27.2%), serous (14.0%), and mucinous (13.3%). Fifty-seven percent (249/437) of the women received taxane-based (platinum plus paclitaxel) regimens and 43.0% received non-taxane (platinum plus cyclophosphamide) regimens as frontline adjuvant chemotherapy. Clear cell tumors (adjusted Hazard ratio (aHR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.73, p = 0.001) showed better 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) than serous tumors. Women diagnosed at FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage II (aHR 5.97, 95% CI = 2.47-14.39, p < 0.001), grade 3 tumor without clear cell (aHR 2.28, 95% CI = 1.02-5.07, p = 0.004) and who received 3-5 cycles of non-taxane regimens (aHR 3.29, 95% CI = 1.47-7.34, p = 0.004) had worse 5-year overall survival (OS). Clear cell histology treated with taxane-based regimens showed significantly higher 5-year DFS (91.2% vs. 82.0%, aHR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21-0.93, p = 0.043) and 5-year OS (93.5% vs. 79.0%, aHR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.13-0.70, p = 0.005) than those treated with non-taxane-based regimens. We conclude that stage, tumor grade, and chemotherapeutic regimens/cycles are independent prognostic factors for early stage ovarian cancer. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Antidepressant use and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatitis C who had received interferon therapy: A population-based cohort study","2019","Background: Using data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) of Taiwan, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to investigate the association between antidepressant (ATD) use and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who had received interferon (IFN) therapy. Methods: This study included a total of 274,952 HCV-infected patients without hepatitis B virus infection who were enrolled in the NHI program between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2013. Among these patients, only 10,713 (age ?18 years) had received IFN therapy between 2004 and 2008. Among the patients who had received IFN therapy, 2014 had received ATDs, and 8684 had not. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied after adjusting for age, sex, income, urbanization, medical comorbidity, and medication use. Results: Compared with non-ATD-treated patients, ATD-treated patients were more likely to receive a diagnosis of alcohol-related disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. ATD-treated patients had a significantly lower incidence of HCC than non-ATD-treated patients (P = 0.0019). Female, older (age ?50 years), and non-DM patients who had received cumulative high doses of ATDs had a significantly lower risk of HCC than non-ATD-treated patients. After adjustment, only high-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use was inversely associated with HCC risk (adjusted hazard ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.19–0.71, P = 0.0027). Conclusions: Our study showed that ATD use, especially a relatively high cumulative dose of SSRIs, in HCV-infected patients who had received IFN was associated with reduced HCC risk. Future clinical studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and to apply them to newer direct-acting antiviral agent treatments. ? 2019","acetylsalicylic acid; antidepressant agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; interferon; mirtazapine; monoamine oxidase inhibitor; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; tricyclic antidepressant agent; triple reuptake inhibitor; adult; alcoholism; Article; cancer prevention; cancer risk; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drug megadose; drug use; female; follow up; hepatitis C; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; immunotherapy; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; population research; priority journal; risk reduction"
"Prognostic factors and treatment outcomes of adult patients with rhabdomyosarcoma after multimodality treatment","2019","Background: Adults with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) have a worse clinical outcome compared to pediatric cases. In the present study, the failure pattern and clinical outcome of adult patients with RMS who received multimodality treatment at our Institution was assessed. Patients and Methods: Data were retrospectively recorded and analyzed from 20 adult patients, aged 19 years or more, who were treated for RMS at our Institution between 2004 and 2015. Disease-free (DFS) and overall (OS) survival after starting treatment were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The relationship of these outcome measures with the following variables was then assessed: Primary site, tumor stage, lymph node involvement, histological subtype, radiotherapy (RT), and duration of chemotherapy. Results: Sixteen patients had localized RMS, and four had metastatic disease. For the whole patient cohort, the 3-year DFS and OS rates were 20%, and 45%, respectively. Patients with alveolar histological subtype had a better 3-year OS than those with other subtypes (p=0.038). The median OS rates for those with localized and metastatic disease were 53.2 (95% confidence interval(CI)=14.7-91.8) months, and 21.7 (95% CI=0-45.7) months, respectively (p=0.047). In patients with localized RMS, those who received RT (n=13) had a better median DFS (24.6 versus 6.0 months, p=0.009) and OS (53.2 versus 11.4 months, p=0.009) than those who did not (n=3). For patients receiving RT, concurrent chemotherapy with vincristine and cyclophosphamide (n=11) was associated with better 3-year DFS (36.4% versus 0%, p<0.001) and OS (81.8% versus 0%, p<0.001) compared with RT alone (n=2). Administration of chemotherapy for more than 19 weeks significantly correlated with better 3-year DFS (44% versus 0%, p=0.001) and OS (53.3% versus 0%, p<0.001) in those with localized RMS. Conclusion: In addition to staging and histological subtype, our results indicate that concurrent chemoradiotherapy and longer duration of chemotherapy were associated with significantly improved DFS and OS in adult patients with localized RMS. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Particle toxicology and health - Where are we?","2019","Background: Particles and fibres affect human health as a function of their properties such as chemical composition, size and shape but also depending on complex interactions in an organism that occur at various levels between particle uptake and target organ responses. While particulate pollution is one of the leading contributors to the global burden of disease, particles are also increasingly used for medical purposes. Over the past decades we have gained considerable experience in how particle properties and particle-bio interactions are linked to human health. This insight is useful for improved risk management in the case of unwanted health effects but also for developing novel medical therapies. The concepts that help us better understand particles' and fibres' risks include the fate of particles in the body; exposure, dosimetry and dose-metrics and the 5 Bs: bioavailability, biopersistence, bioprocessing, biomodification and bioclearance of (nano)particles. This includes the role of the biomolecule corona, immunity and systemic responses, non-specific effects in the lungs and other body parts, particle effects and the developing body, and the link from the natural environment to human health. The importance of these different concepts for the human health risk depends not only on the properties of the particles and fibres, but is also strongly influenced by production, use and disposal scenarios. Conclusions: Lessons learned from the past can prove helpful for the future of the field, notably for understanding novel particles and fibres and for defining appropriate risk management and governance approaches. ? 2019 The Author(s).","asbestos; coal; nanoparticle; silicic acid; mineral fiber; nanoparticle; bioaccumulation; biosphere; chemical composition; disease burden; dosimetry; environmental exposure; health hazard; human; molecular interaction; nanotoxicology; nonhuman; particle size; particle toxicology; physical development; pneumoconiosis; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk management; toxicology; adverse event; air pollutant; chemistry; exposure; particulate matter; surface property; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Mineral Fibers; Nanoparticles; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Surface Properties"
"Design, fabrication, and feasibility analysis of a colorimetric detection system with a smartphone for self-monitoring blood glucose","2019","Maintaining appropriate insulin levels is very important for diabetes patients. Effective monitoring of blood glucose can aid in maintaining the body's insulin level, and thus reduce disease severities, secondary complications, and related mortalities. However, existing blood glucose measurement devices are inconvenient to carry and involve complex procedures, reducing the willingness of diabetes patients to regularly measure blood glucose. We aim to provide a rapid, convenient, and portable meter for diabetes patients. We introduce an integrated blood glucose detection device (IBGDD) that has no electronic component and uses the optical sensing module of a smartphone to inspect colorimetric blood strips. To demonstrate accuracy conformance of the developed device to the ISO 15197:2013 standard for blood glucose measurement, 20 diabetes mellitus patients used the IBGDD with smartphones to measure their blood glucose level. The measurement results revealed an accuracy of 100%, completely satisfying the requirements of the ISO 15197:2013 standard. Overall, our specially designed IBGDD with a smartphone could achieve high accuracy and convenient usage for the measurement of blood glucose concentration. Furthermore, the device is highly portable and simple to operate. This contributes toward achieving self-monitoring of blood glucose by diabetes patients and improved mobile health in the future. ? 2019 The Authors.","Color; Colorimetric analysis; Colorimetry; Glucose; Insulin; ISO Standards; Medical problems; Smartphones; Surface plasmon resonance; Blood glucose; Blood glucose concentration; Blood glucose detection; Blood glucose measurements; colorimetric blood strip; Colorimetric detection; Feasibility analysis; Self-monitoring blood glucose; Blood"
"Experimental investigation of sterilization efficacy of green nails symptom and gray nails using an argon-based round atmospheric-pressure plasma jet","2019","In recent years, plasma biomedicine has attracted increasing attention as a promising method of sterilization and other biomedical applications. This research aims to develop and characterize an argon-based non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) with an application of sterilization and nail disease treatment. We characterized the electric properties by an electrical measurement system and quantified the active species in APPJ by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The gas temperature of plasma jet is below 37°C, which is generally free of thermal damage for the human body. The results of OES measurement indicate that this APPJ has a high intensity of hydroxyl radicals (OH?), which has shown promise in killing microorganisms. The preliminary result from inactivation experiments also show that APPJ efficiently kills bacteria (P. aeruginosa) and yeast (C. albicans). Furthermore, we used bovine hoof as a surrogate model for human nails for penetration tests. The results demonstrated that argon APPJ is good in inhibition of P. aeruginosa (90% in 5 min) and C. albicans (76% in 5 min) on agar plates. In addition, antimicrobial tests showed that approximately 2-log and 4-log reduction can be reached for P. aeruginosa and C. albicans in 5 min, respectively, when the argon APPJ was applied with them deposited at the back of the bovine hoof. We attribute the latter which contradicts with the former may be caused by many possible factors, which include the biofilm formation of the P. aeruginosa on the bovine hoof, the nature and the size difference of these two pathogens. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agar; hydroxyl radical; animal experiment; Article; bovine; Candida albicans; green nail syndrome; hoof and claw; human; low level laser therapy; nail disease; nonhuman; optical emission spectroscopy; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; scanning electron microscopy; spectroscopy; temperature"
"Development and Validation of the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q)","2019","There currently exist no self-report measures of social camouflaging behaviours (strategies used to compensate for or mask autistic characteristics during social interactions). The Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) was developed from autistic adults’ experiences of camouflaging, and was administered online to 354 autistic and 478 non-autistic adults. Exploratory factor analysis suggested three factors, comprising of 25 items in total. Good model fit was demonstrated through confirmatory factor analysis, with measurement invariance analyses demonstrating equivalent factor structures across gender and diagnostic group. Internal consistency (α = 0.94) and preliminary test–retest reliability (r = 0.77) were acceptable. Convergent validity was demonstrated through comparison with measures of autistic traits, wellbeing, anxiety, and depression.

"Immune checkpoint Ab enhances the antigen-specific anti-tumor effects by modulating both dendritic cells and regulatory T lymphocytes","2019","We determined the anti-tumor effects and possible mechanisms of an antigen-specific DNA vaccine combined with PD-1 or CTLA-4 blockade. Using the HPV16 E6/E7+ syngeneic mouse tumor model, we investigated whether anti-CTLA-4 antibody (Ab) or anti-PD-1 Ab increases the antigen-specific anti-tumor effects and immune response induced by CTGF/E7 chimeric DNA vaccine and the possible mechanisms. Anti-PD-1 Ab or anti-CTLA-4 Ab combined with E7-specific DNA vaccine generated more potent antigen-specific immunity, including anti-E7 Abs and the number and cytotoxic activity of E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, and anti-tumor effects than E7-specific DNA vaccine alone. In addition, the number of systemic and intratumoral Tregs was lower with the anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 Ab and E7-specific DNA vaccine. Furthermore, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 Abs could enhance the maturation and abilities of intratumoral DCs to activate E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Immune checkpoint blockade overcomes the immunosuppressive status of the tumor-microenvironment to enhance the antigen-specific immunity and anti-tumor effects generated by an antigen-specific DNA vaccine. Antigen-specific immunotherapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade can be a novel strategy in clinical cancer therapy. ? 2018","antineoplastic monoclonal antibody; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; DNA vaccine; Ki 67 antigen; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; monoclonal antibody 9D9; monoclonal antibody RMP1 14; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 receptor; unclassified drug; CTLA4 protein, human; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; DNA vaccine; monoclonal antibody; PDCD1 protein, human; programmed death 1 receptor; tumor antigen; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antigen expression; antigen presentation; antineoplastic activity; Article; body weight; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; cytotoxicity; dendritic cell; ex vivo study; female; flow cytometry; histopathology; human; human cell; immune response; immunofluorescence test; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung cancer; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory T lymphocyte; spleen cell; survival; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; animal; apoptosis; C57BL mouse; cell proliferation; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; dendritic cell; drug screening; immunology; immunotherapy; neoplasm; pathology; regulatory T lymphocyte; tumor cell culture; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, Neoplasm; Apoptosis; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Proliferation; CTLA-4 Antigen; Dendritic Cells; Female; Humans; Immunotherapy; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neoplasms; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Tumor Microenvironment; Vaccines, DNA; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Metabolome analysis for investigating host-gut microbiota interactions","2019","Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is associated with host health conditions. Many diseases have shown to have correlations with imbalanced microbiota, including obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and even neurodegeneration disorders. Metabolomics studies targeting small molecule metabolites that impact the host metabolome and their biochemical functions have shown promise for studying host-gut microbiota interactions. Metabolome analysis determines the metabolites being discussed for their biological implications in host-gut microbiota interactions. To facilitate understanding the critical aspects of metabolome analysis, this article reviewed (1) the sample types used in host-gut microbiome studies; (2) mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical methods and (3) useful tools for MS-based data processing/analysis. In addition to the most frequently used sample type, feces, we also discussed others biosamples, such as urine, plasma/serum, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, exhaled breaths, and tissues, to better understand gut metabolite systemic effects on the whole organism. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS), three powerful tools that can be utilized to study host-gut microbiota interactions, are included with examples of their applications. After obtaining big data from MS-based instruments, noise removal, peak detection, missing value imputation, and data analysis are all important steps for acquiring valid results in host-gut microbiome research. The information provided in this review will help new researchers aiming to join this field by providing a global view of the analytical aspects involved in gut microbiota-related metabolomics studies. ? 2018","blood sampling; breath analysis; capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry; cerebrospinal fluid; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; data processing; feces; host microbe interaction; human; intestine flora; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass fragmentography; metabolomics; nonhuman; plasma; Review; saliva; saliva analysis; serum; tissues; urine; urine sampling; information processing; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; procedures; specimen handling; Electronic Data Processing; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Host Microbial Interactions; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics; Specimen Handling"
"Predictors of lymphoceles in women who underwent laparotomic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early gynecologic cancer: A retrospective cohort study","2019","Background: Lymphoceles could represent a detrimental complication after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Our aim was to elucidate predictors of lymphoceles. Methods: Between 2011 and 2017, medical records of consecutive women who underwent laparotomic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for FIGO stage I or II gynecologic cancer were reviewed. Results: A total of 204 women, including those with lymphoceles (n = 31) and symptomatic lymphoceles (n = 7), were reviewed. According to multivariable analysis, parity (odds ratio = 0.59, p = 0.003), adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy (odds ratio = 2.60, p = 0.039), and peritoneal nonclosure without pelvic drainage (odds ratio = 2.31, p = 0.048) were predictors of lymphoceles. In addition, parity (odds ratio = 0.73, p = 0.03), hypertension (odds ratio = 2.62, p = 0.02), and peritoneal partial closure with pelvic drainage (odds ratio = 0.27, p = 0.02) were predictors of complications. Conclusion: Low parity, adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy, and peritoneal nonclosure without pelvic drainage were associated with increased lymphocele formation. In addition, a lower complication rate was found in the peritoneal partial closure with pelvic drainage group; thus, peritoneal partial closure with pelvic drainage might be suggested for women who undergo laparotomic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Serum homocysteine, folate and vitamin B 12 levels in patients with psoriasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Patients with psoriasis are at increased risk for cardiovascular comorbidities. Previous studies examined the possible contribution of serum homocysteine, folate and vitamin B 12 to cardiovascular risks in patients with psoriasis but had conflicting conclusions. Objectives: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on serum homocysteine, folate and vitamin B 12 levels in patients with psoriasis. Methods: Online databases were searched on 15 February 2018 to include studies comparing serum homocysteine, folate and vitamin B 12 levels between patients with psoriasis and controls. A random effects model was adopted to estimate odds ratios for dichotomous data and standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous data. Results: A comprehensive literature search identified 24 studies eligible for inclusion. Compared with controls, patients with psoriasis had a significantly higher serum homocysteine level [SMD 0·41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·21–0·61; I 2 = 76·7%, 18 studies], a higher prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia (odds ratio 3·48, 95% CI 2·08–5·83; I 2 = 41·1%, seven studies) and a lower serum folate level (SMD ?0·94, 95% CI ?1·49 to ?0·40; I 2 = 95·6%, 14 studies). However, there was no difference in serum vitamin B 12 levels between patients with psoriasis and the control group (SMD 0·004, 95% CI ?0·49 to 0·50; I 2 = 92%, 11 studies). Metaregression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between the SMD of homocysteine levels and folate levels. Conclusions: Patients with psoriasis might have higher serum homocysteine and lower folate levels than control patients without psoriasis. However, due to significant heterogeneity and other limitations, the associations require further examinations in more studies. ? 2018 British Association of Dermatologists","cyanocobalamin; folic acid; homocysteine; methotrexate; disease severity; folic acid blood level; human; meta analysis; priority journal; psoriasis; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; psoriatic arthritis; Review; systematic review; vitamin blood level"
"Shigellosis outbreak among MSM living with HIV: A case-control study in Taiwan, 2015-2016","2019","Objectives: Outbreaks of shigellosis among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported since the late 1990s. HIV infection is an important risk factor. Since 2014, the global shigellosis epidemic has intensified. Whether chemsex (the use of crystal methamphetamine, γ-hydroxybutyrate or mephedrone to enhance sex) is a new risk factor has not been previously examined. Methods: We conducted a population-based, case-control study in Taiwan. Acute shigellosis cases diagnosed during the 2015 outbreak among MSM living with HIV were compared with those without shigellosis. CD4 + counts, plasma viral load (pVL), gonorrhoea, syphilis and amoebiasis records were obtained from the Notifiable Disease Surveillance System database. We invited cases/controls to provide information on illicit drug use and sexual behaviours, using a structured questionnaire. Results: Seventy-five shigellosis cases were compared with 225 controls. High pVL (>100 000 copies/mL; adjusted OR (aOR): 4.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 16.9), gonorrhoea (aOR: 29.4, 95% CI 2.3 to 340.2) and syphilis (aOR: 4.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 11.6) were independent risk factors of shigellosis. Twenty shigellosis cases and 59 controls completed the questionnaire. Oral-to-anal sex (aOR: 15.5, 95% CI 3.6 to 66.7), chemsex (aOR: 5.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 22.7) and poppers use (aOR: 10.9, 95% CI 1.9 to 64.2) within 12 months were independent behavioural risk factors of shigellosis. Conclusions: Chemsex is a new risk factor for shigellosis among MSM living with HIV, as identified in the 2015-2016 outbreak. Additional risk factors include poppers use, sexual risk behaviours and high pVL. Further studies on chemsex among MSM, which is a rising public health concern, are urgently required. ? 2019 Article author(s) (or their employer(s)).","4' methylmethcathinone; ampicillin; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; ciprofloxacin; hydroxybutyric acid; trimethoprim; methamphetamine; oxybate sodium; adult; amebiasis; antibiotic therapy; antiretroviral therapy; Article; case control study; controlled study; disease surveillance; gonorrhea; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection risk; major clinical study; male; men who have sex with men; population based case control study; priority journal; risk factor; sexual behavior; shigellosis; structured questionnaire; syphilis; Taiwan; virus load; analogs and derivatives; blood; drug dependence; epidemic; gonorrhea; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; mixed infection; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; sexual and gender minority; shigellosis; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; syphilis; virus load; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Coinfection; Disease Outbreaks; Dysentery, Bacillary; Gonorrhea; HIV Infections; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Methamphetamine; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Risk Factors; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior; Sodium Oxybate; Substance-Related Disorders; Syphilis; Taiwan; Viral Load"
"Postoperative hemorrhage following tonsillectomy in adults: Analysis of population-based inpatient cohort in Taiwan","2019","Objective: Because of the lack of population-based analyses, this study elucidated the epidemiology and 30-day postoperative complications of inpatient adult tonsillectomies in Taiwan. Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified all inpatient adult tonsillectomies (age > 20 years) in Taiwan during 1997–2012 through International Codes of Diseases, 9th Revision. Trend of the inpatient tonsillectomy in adult during the study period was explored. Major complications of readmission, reoperation, and mortality within 30 days after tonsillectomies were identified. Factors associated with major complications were analyzed using multivariate logistic model. Results: In total, 27,365 adults received inpatient tonsillectomies (mean age, 38.4 ± 13.0 years; 57.2% male). The overall incidence was 10.2 per 100,000 population per year among adults. Incidence rates increased from 1997 (8.2/100,000 adults) to 2012 (11.2/100,000 adults) (P trend < 0.001). The rate of readmission for any reason, readmission for bleeding, reoperation for bleeding, and mortality were 4.9%, 2.2%, 1%, and 0.1%, respectively. Young age increased the risk of bleeding-related readmission and reoperation, whereas old age increased the risk of readmission for any reason and mortality. Male gender increased the risk of all major complications. Hypertension was associated with an increased risk of bleeding-related readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.68–2.92) and reoperation (OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.44–3.27). Existing catastrophic illness increased the risk of readmission (OR = 4.28; 95% CI 3.60–5.08) for any reason and mortality (OR = 3.24; 95% CI 1.37–7.65). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids were associated with an increased risk of readmission or reoperation for bleeding. Conclusion: Incidence rates of inpatient adult tonsillectomy increased during 1997–2012 in Taiwan. Age, gender, comorbidity, and drug administration characteristics were associated with major complications of adult tonsillectomies in this cohort. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; steroid; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; disease association; female; hospital patient; hospital readmission; human; hypertension; ICD-9-CM; incidence; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; population research; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative pain; reoperation; risk factor; sex difference; surgical mortality; surgical risk; Taiwan; terminal disease; tonsillectomy; trend study; age; hypertension; mortality; postoperative hemorrhage; sex factor; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Patient Readmission; Postoperative Hemorrhage; Reoperation; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Taiwan; Tonsillectomy; Young Adult"
"Weaning outcome of solid cancer patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit","2019","Background: Whether the weaning outcome of solid cancer patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is comparable to that in non-cancer patients is unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the weaning outcomes between non-cancer patients and patients with different types of cancer. Methods: We studied patients requiring MV during ICU stay for medical reasons between 2012 and 2014. Cancer patients were grouped into those with lung cancer (LC), head and neck cancer (HNC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and other cancers (OC). The primary endpoint was successful weaning at day 90 after the initiation of MV, and the main secondary endpoints were 28-day and 90-day mortality after ICU admission. Results: Five hundred and eighteen patients with solid cancers and 1362 non-cancer patients were recruited. The rate of successful weaning at day 90 was 57.9% in cancer patients, which was lower than 68.9% in non-cancer patients (p < 0.001). Compared to non-cancer patients, LC was associated with a lower probability of weaning at day 90 (hazard ratio 0.565, 95% CI 0.446 to 0.715), while HNC, HCC, and OC had similar probabilities. The 28-day and 90-day mortality rates were higher in cancer patients than in non-cancer patients (45.2% vs. 29.4%, and 65.6% vs. 37.7%, respectively, both p < 0.001). Conclusion: Among mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU, those with LC were associated with a lower probability of weaning at day 90 compared to non-cancer patients. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","hypertensive factor; adult; Article; artificial ventilation; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer survival; comparative study; controlled study; female; head and neck cancer; hospital admission; human; intensive care unit; liver cell carcinoma; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; outcome assessment; prospective study; retrospective study; treatment duration; ventilator weaning; aged; complication; epidemiology; hospital mortality; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; middle aged; mortality; respiratory failure; survival analysis; Taiwan; time factor; treatment failure; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Respiratory Insufficiency; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Time Factors; Treatment Failure; Ventilator Weaning"
"Development of upconversion nanoparticle-conjugated indium phosphide quantum dot for matrix metalloproteinase-2 cancer transformation sensing","2019","Aim: Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) plays an important role in extracellular matrix remodeling, that is, it increases significantly during cancer progression. In this regard, MMP2 monitoring is important. Experiment: A well-designed MMP2-sensitive polypeptide chain was used to link indium phosphide quantum dots (InP QDs) with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) to form a nanocomposite that was utilized as biosensor. Results: We produced a biosensor that can be recognized by MMP2 and determined the presence or absence of MMP2 in cells by identifying difference in fluorescence wavelength. The InP QDs modified the arginylglycylaspartic acid molecules as targeting ligand based on chitosan. Conclusion: The MMP2-based biosensor, named UCNP-p@InP-cRGD, is sensitive and can be applied for biosensing probes. ? 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.","arginylglycylaspartic acid; chitosan; gelatinase A; indium; indium phosphide; ligand; nanocomposite; polypeptide; quantum dot; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; upconversion nanoparticle; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Ca9-22 cell line; cell transformation; controlled study; fluorescence; HSC-4 cell line; in vivo study; malignant transformation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; synthesis"
"Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for clinical stage I gastric adenocarcinoma: Techniques evolution and oncological outcomes of the first 100 cases","2019","Background/Purpose: While gaining more acceptance, the use of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) to treat gastric cancer were still limited in Taiwan. This study reviewed our experience about the technique evolution and outcome of using LDG for the patients with clinical stage (c-stage) I gastric cancers. Methods: A retrospective review of the patients undergoing LDG for c-stage I gastric cancers at a medical center of Taiwan was performed. The demographics, peri-operative parameters, reconstruction methods, morbidities, pathologic and oncological outcomes were analyzed. Results: A total of 100 patients with c-stage I gastric cancers between October 2005 and September 2016 were enrolled. Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) was performed in the initial 69 cases. Total laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) was done in the following 31 cases. There was no conversion of procedures, nor surgical mortality. The surgical morbidity rate was 13%, including 3 major complications. The ratio of using Billroth I reconstruction (83.9% versus 43.5%, p < 0.01) and the mean number of harvested lymph nodes (38.6 ± 14.8 versus 31.2 ± 15.2, p = 0.02) were both higher in the TLDG group than in the LADG group. The pathologic examination confirmed 78 patients were stage I, while 22 were stage II disease. Seven of the 24 patients with lymph node metastasis received adjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients had recurrence of diseases. The 3-year recurrence-free and overall survival were 93.3% and 95.8% separately. Conclusion: These results suggested that laparoscopic gastrectomy could be performed safely and feasibly for patients with early gastric cancers. LADG is recommended for the establishment of the demanding technique. ? 2018","abdominal abscess; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; Article; chylous ascites; clinical outcome; colon fistula; female; gastrectomy; gastrectomy Billroth I; human; infarction; laparoscopic distal gastrectomy; laparoscopic surgery; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; overall survival; pleura effusion; pneumonia; postoperative complication; recurrence free survival; recurrent disease; retrospective study; skin fistula; stomach adenocarcinoma; stomach disease; stomach paresis; surgical infection; Taiwan; transverse colon; adenocarcinoma; comparative study; epidemiology; gastrectomy; gastroenterostomy; laparoscopy; lymph node; middle aged; mortality; pathology; postoperative complication; procedures; stomach tumor; survival analysis; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Female; Gastrectomy; Gastroenterostomy; Humans; Laparoscopy; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Stomach Neoplasms; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"Regulation of lipid droplets in live preadipocytes using optical diffraction tomography and Raman spectroscopy","2019","Lipid droplets have gained strong interest in recent years to comprehend how they function and coordinate with other parts of the cell. However, it remains challenging to study the regulation of lipid droplets in live preadipocytes using conventional microscopic techniques. In this paper, we study the effects of fatty acid stimulation and cell starvation on lipid droplets using optical diffraction tomography and Raman spectroscopy by measuring size, refractive index, volume, dry mass and degree of unsaturation. The increase of fatty acids causes an increase in the number and dry mass of lipid droplets. During starvation, the number of lipid droplets increases drastically, which are released to mitochondria to release energy. Studying lipid droplets under different chemical stimulations could help us understand the regulation of lipid droplets for metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes. ? 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement","Diffraction; Fatty acids; Optical systems; Raman spectroscopy; Refractive index; Tomography; Chemical stimulation; Degree of unsaturations; Dry mass; Lipid droplets; Metabolic disorders; Microscopic techniques; Optical diffraction tomography; Preadipocytes; Drops"
"Local Control and Clinical Outcome of High-risk Pediatric Neuroblastoma Patients after Receiving Multimodality Treatment and Helical Tomotherapy","2019","Background/Aim: The local control and clinical outcome of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated with tomotherapy as part of a modern multimodality paradigm was assessed. Patients and Methods: Twenty-four high-risk neuroblastoma patients who received radiotherapy (RT) to the primary site using helical tomotherapy (median 21.6 Gy) were included. Local failure (LF) was correlated with biological and clinical prognostic factors. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: After a median followup of 43.5 months, the 3-year cumulative incidence of LF, EFS, and OS were 21.1%, 45.8%, and 62.9%, respectively. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase ?1,500 U/l was associated with worse LF (p=0.02). There was no 3-year LF noted for patients with gross residual disease (GRD) who received more than 21.6 Gy. Conclusion: We demonstrated favorable local control of tomotherapy for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. Dose escalation of RT for patients with GRD should be investigated. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Diagnosis of mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis using endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration with rinse fluid polymerase chain reaction","2020","Background/Purpose: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has been gradually introduced in the diagnosis of mediastinal tuberculous (TB) lymphadenitis. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the utility of polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB-PCR) using EBUS-TBNA rinse fluid and to explore the factors that influence the accuracy of EBUS-TBNA. Methods: A retrospective study with prospective data collection was carried out with patients with unselected mediastinal lymphadenopathy who underwent EBUS-TBNA and a TB-PCR study from April 2010 to July 2017. Patients without TB were excluded. The diagnostic accuracy rate for each diagnostic modality (pathology, smear, culture, and TB-PCR) was calculated respectively. The characteristics of the lymph node (LN) and the pathologic findings were analyzed as possible impact factors. Results: 240 consecutive patients who received EBUS-TBNA were enrolled, and in the end, 21 patients with a diagnosis of TB lymphadenitis were included. When combined with histologic results and traditional microbiologic studies, the diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNA was 57.1%. If TB-PCR was also utilized, the diagnostic accuracy would significantly increase to 71.4% (p < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis revealed that pathology showing necrosis had a higher positive microbiologic result when using EBUS-TBNA rinse fluid. Conclusion: EBUS-TBNA is a valuable tool for diagnosis of mediastinal TB lymphadenitis. Using TB-PCR assay and targeting LNs with a necrotic component would improve the diagnostic performance of EBUS-TBNA. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",""

"Development of a transgenic Flammulina velutipes oral vaccine for hepatitis b","2019","Orally administered fungal vaccines show promise for the prevention of infectious diseases. Edible mushrooms are deemed appropriate hosts to produce oral vaccines due to their low production cost and low risk of gene contamination. However, their low expression level of antigens has limited the potential development of oral vaccines using mushrooms. The low expression level might result from impurity of the transgenic mycelia since dikaryotic mycelia are commonly used as transformation materials. In this study, stable transgenic hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in Flammulina velutipes transformants was obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, followed by fruiting and basidiospore mating. The formation of HBsAg was detected by western blot analysis. The expression levels of HBsAg in transgenic F. velutipes fruiting bodies were (129.3±15.1), (110.9±1.7) and (161.1±8.5) ng/g total soluble protein. However, the values may be underestimated due to incomplete protein extraction. Two of the four pigs in the experimental group produced positive anti- HBsAg-specific IgG after being fed the HBsAg transgenic F. velutipes fruiting bodies for 20 weeks, while no anti-HBsAg antibody was detected in the control group. One of the positive pigs had HBsAg titres of 5.36 and 14.9 mIU/mL in weeks 10 and 14, respectively, but expression faded thereafter. The other positive pig displayed HBsAg titres of 9.75, 17.86 and 39.87 mIU/mL in weeks 14, 18 and 20, respectively. The successful immunogenicity in pigs fed transgenic F. velutipes fruiting bodies demonstrated the potential of using the fungus as an oral vaccine. ? 2018 University of Zagreb.","Antigens; Diseases; Electrophoresis; Fungi; Mammals; Proteins; Viruses; Agrobacterium mediated transformations; Experimental groups; Flammulina velutipes; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis b virus surface antigens; Mating; Total soluble protein; Western-blot analysis; Vaccines"
"The Toldt fascia: A historic review and surgical implications in complete mesocolic excision for colon cancer","2019","To clarify the anatomic concept of Toldt fascia, based on the literature review and the surgical anatomic dissection using laparoscopic or robotic approach. We undertook review of the historic literature and surgical videos from 250 patients with colorectal cancer operated on laparoscopically or robotically to discuss the surgical implications of Toldt fascia in complete mesocolic excision for colon cancer. Toldt fascia, sandwiched by the overlying mesothelial layer of the mesocolon and underlying mesothelial layer of the retroperitoneum, comprised loose fibrous tissues with minute vessels inside, and was contiguous from the ileocecal mesentery radix to the upper rectum. Surgical dissection plane is readily developed within the Toldt fascia; however, any attempt to dissect along the interface between Toldt fascia and the overlying mesocolon or underlying retroperitoneum failed. Within the anatomic territory of kidney, Toldt fascia fused with Gerota fascia, and then extended in all directions: upward to the dosal surface of the duodenum, liver and pancreas; medially to fuse with the adventitia layer of the abdominal aorta; laterally, it tapered at the area below the reflection of visceral and parietal peritoneum; and downward, it became a thin membranous structure covering the gonadal vessels, ureters and retroperitoneal structures and ended at the upper rectum, where it met the junction of endopelvic fascia and proper fascia of the rectum. The present study demonstrated that Toldt fascia is a natural embryonic dissection plane for the precise conduction of complete mesocolic excision for colon cancer. ? 2018","abdominal surgery; anatomy and histology; colon tumor; fascia; human; laparoscopy; mesocolon; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; Colonic Neoplasms; Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Fascia; Humans; Laparoscopy; Mesocolon; Robotic Surgical Procedures"
"Conditional Overexpression of rtn4al in Muscle of Adult Zebrafish Displays Defects Similar to Human Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","2019","The protein level of muscle-specific human NogoA is abnormally upregulated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice and patients. On the other hand, while the presence of miR-206 in muscle cells delays onset and death in ALS, the relationship between these two phenomena remains unclear. Mammalian NogoA protein, also known as Reticulon 4a (Rtn4a), plays an important role in inhibiting the outgrowth of motor neurons. Our group previously identified zebrafish rtn4al as the target gene of miR-206 and found that knockdown of miR-206 increases rtn4al mRNA and Rtn4al protein in zebrafish embryos. It can be concluded from these results that neurite outgrowth of motor neurons is inhibited by Rtn4a1, which is entirely consistent with overexpression of either human NogoA or zebrafish homolog Rtn4al. Since an animal model able to express NogoA/rtn4al at the mature stage is unavailable, we generated a zebrafish transgenic line, Tg(Zα:TetON-Rtn4al), which conditionally and specifically overexpresses Rtn4al in the muscle tissue. After doxycycline induction, adult zebrafish displayed denervation at neuromuscular junction during the first week, then muscle disintegration and split myofibers during the third week, and, finally, significant weight loss in the sixth week. These results suggest that this zebrafish transgenic line, representing the inducible overexpression of Rtn4a1 in muscle, may provide an alternative animal model with which to study ALS because it exhibits ALS-like phenotype. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Brain; Disintegration; Mammals; Muscle; Neurodegenerative diseases; Proteins; Amyotrophic lateral scleroses (ALS); Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Motor neurons; Neuromuscular junctions; NogoA; Rtn4al; Zebrafish; Zebrafish embryos; Neurons; cell organelle; cyprinid; embryo; gene expression; muscle; phenotype; protein; RNA; Animalia; Danio rerio; Mammalia; Mus; antisense oligonucleotide; doxycycline; microRNA; MIRN206 microRNA, human; morpholino oligonucleotide; myelin protein; protein Nogo; Rtn4a protein, zebrafish; zebrafish protein; agonists; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; embryology; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; metabolism; motoneuron; neuromuscular junction; nonmammalian embryo; pathology; pathophysiology; phenotype; plasmid; skeletal muscle; transgenic animal; zebra fish; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Disease Models, Animal; Doxycycline; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; MicroRNAs; Morpholinos; Motor Neurons; Muscle, Skeletal; Myelin Proteins; Neuromuscular Junction; Nogo Proteins; Oligonucleotides, Antisense; Phenotype; Plasmids; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins"
"IL-29 promoted obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance","2019","Adipocyte-macrophage crosstalk plays a critical role to regulate adipose tissue microenvironment and cause chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity. Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in metabolic disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1β, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced insulin sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/M2 macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance, and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating obesity and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic disorders. ? 2019, CSI and USTC.",""
"Assessment of dermal exposures for synthetic musks from personal care products in Taiwan","2019","Over the past decades, synthetic musks have been widely used as fragrances for enhancing scent and covering odor in many personal care products (PCPs). The presence of synthetic musk is of potential concern since health effects, such as photo-allergic reactions and neurotoxicity due to the exposures have been observed. To assess the associate health risks from possible exposures of synthetic musks in Taiwan, headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometers (GC/MS/MS) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used to determine 10 synthetic musks in total 109 PCPs samples. The results showed that the higher levels of synthetic musks were found in perfume, body lotion and hair care products. Galaxolide (HHCB) and Tonalide (AHTN) were found in every category of the PCPs samples. The median concentrations in 109 samples measured were 958.19 μg g ?1 and 674.03 μg g ?1 for HHCB and AHTN, respectively. Cashmeran (DPMI) was also found in all the samples collected with a median concentration of 144.62 μg g ?1 , except for categories of facial essences. Musk ketone (MK) was found in several PCPs categories, including perfume, body lotion, hair care product, and shower bath products, with a median concentration of 693.27 μg g ?1 . In addition, dermal exposures of synthetic musks were also estimated for people in Taiwan. The daily exposure of total synthetic musks through applications of PCPs was estimated to be 22.54 μg kg ?1 body weight day ?1 . The results indicate that the skin contact of perfume and body lotion were the major sources for human exposures to synthetic musks in Taiwan. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Gas chromatography; Health risks; Ketones; Risk assessment; Allergic reactions; Dermal exposure; Headspace solid phase microextraction; Median concentration; Multiple-reaction monitoring modes; Personal care products; Solid-phase microextraction; Synthetic musks; Extraction; cashmeran; dermatological agent; galaxolide; hair care product; musk; musk ketone; perfume; personal care product; shower bath product; tonalide; unclassified drug; cosmetic; monounsaturated fatty acid; musk; allergy; assessment method; concentration (composition); gas chromatography; health risk; PPCP; skin; toxicity; Article; concentration (parameter); cutaneous parameters; dermal exposure; environmental exposure; headspace solid phase microextraction; health hazard; lotion; mass fragmentography; multiple reaction monitoring; priority journal; risk assessment; Taiwan; gas chromatography; human; skin; solid phase extraction; tandem mass spectrometry; Taiwan; Chromatography, Gas; Cosmetics; Environmental Exposure; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; Humans; Skin; Solid Phase Extraction; Taiwan; Tandem Mass Spectrometry"
"International best practice for the evaluation of responsiveness to sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients with phenylketonuria","2019","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disease caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. As the resulting high blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration can have detrimental effects on brain development and function, international guidelines recommend lifelong control of blood Phe concentration with dietary and/or medical therapy. Sapropterin dihydrochloride is a synthetic preparation of tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4), the naturally occurring cofactor of PAH. It acts as a pharmacological chaperone, reducing blood Phe concentration and increasing dietary Phe tolerance in BH4-responsive patients with PAH deficiency. Protocols to establish responsiveness to sapropterin dihydrochloride vary widely. Two meetings were held with an international panel of clinical experts in PKU management to develop recommendations for sapropterin dihydrochloride response testing. At the first meeting, regional differences and similarities in testing practices were discussed based on guidelines, a literature review, outcomes of a global physician survey, and case reports. Statements developed based on the discussions were sent to all participants for consensus (>70% of participants) evaluation using a 7-level rating system, and further discussed during the second meeting. The experts recommend sapropterin dihydrochloride response testing in patients with untreated blood Phe concentrations of 360–2000 μmol/L, except in those with two null mutations. For neonates, a 24-h sapropterin dihydrochloride loading test is recommended; responsiveness is defined as a decrease in blood Phe ?30%. For older infants, children, adolescents, and adults, a test duration of ?48 h or a 4-week trial is recommended. The main endpoint for a 48-h to 7-day trial is a decrease in blood Phe, while improved Phe tolerance is the endpoint to be assessed during a longer trial. Longer trials may not be feasible in some locations due to lack of reimbursement for hospitalization, while a 4-week trial may not be possible due to limited access to sapropterin dihydrochloride or public health regulation. A 48-h response test should be considered in pregnant patients who cannot achieve blood Phe ?360 μmol/L with a Phe-restricted diet. Durability of response and clinical benefits of sapropterin dihydrochloride should be assessed over the long term. Harmonization of protocols is expected to improve identification of responders and comparability of test results worldwide. ? 2019 The Authors","phenylalanine; sapropterin; biopterin; sapropterin; adolescent; adult; child; drug indication; general practice; human; infant; loading test; medical history; newborn; newborn period; nutritional assessment; phenylketonuria; practice guideline; pregnant woman; priority journal; program evaluation; Review; social aspect; treatment response; consensus; diet; female; international cooperation; phenylketonuria; physician; pregnancy; Biopterin; Consensus; Diet; Female; Humans; Internationality; Phenylketonurias; Physicians; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pregnancy"
"Differential Proteomics Reveals Discrete Functions of Proteins Interacting with Hypo- versus Hyper-phosphorylated NS5A of the Hepatitis C Virus","2019","Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification that regulates many biological processes in almost all living forms. In the case of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is believed to transit between hypo- and hyper-phosphorylated forms that interact with host proteins to execute different functions; however, little was known about the proteins that bind either form of NS5A. Here, we generated two high-quality antibodies specific to serine 235 nonphosphorylated hypo- vs serine 235 phosphorylated (pS235) hyper-phosphorylated form of NS5A and for the first time segregated these two forms of NS5A plus their interacting proteins for dimethyl-labeling based proteomics. We identified 629 proteins, of which 238 were quantified in three replicates. Bioinformatics showed 46 proteins that preferentially bind hypo-phosphorylated NS5A are involved in antiviral response and another 46 proteins that bind pS235 hyper-phosphorylated NS5A are involved in liver cancer progression. We further identified a DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) that binds hypo-phosphorylated NS5A. Inhibition of DNA-PK with an inhibitor or via gene-specific knockdown significantly reduced S232 phosphorylation and NS5A hyper-phosphorylation. Because S232 phosphorylation initiates sequential S232/S235/S238 phosphorylation leading to NS5A hyper-phosphorylation, we identified a new protein kinase that regulates a delicate balance of NS5A between hypo- and hyper-phosphorylation states, respectively, involved in host antiviral responses and liver cancer progression. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","antivirus agent; nonstructural protein 5A; protein kinase; serine; sodium thiosulfate; Article; bioinformatics; cancer growth; controlled study; Hepatitis C virus; Huh-7 cell line; human; human cell; liver cancer; priority journal; protein analysis; protein binding; protein function; protein interaction; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; proteomics"

"Risankizumab compared with adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (IMMvent): a randomised, double-blind, active-comparator-controlled phase 3 trial","2019","Background: Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that affects approximately 100 million people worldwide, and is a disease that can be ameliorated by anti-cytokine treatment. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of risankizumab with adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Methods: IMMvent was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-comparator-controlled trial completed at 66 clinics in 11 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using interactive response technology to receive 150 mg risankizumab subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4 or 80 mg adalimumab subcutaneously at randomisation, then 40 mg at weeks 1, 3, 5, and every other week thereafter during a 16-week double-blind treatment period (part A). For weeks 16–44 (part B), adalimumab intermediate responders were re-randomised 1:1 to continue 40 mg adalimumab or switch to 150 mg risankizumab. In part A, participants and investigators were masked to study treatment. Randomisation was stratified by weight and previous tumour necrosis factor inhibitor exposure. Co-primary endpoints in part A were a 90% improvement from baseline (PASI 90) and a static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 at week 16, and for part B was PASI 90 at week 44 (non-responder imputation). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in the safety population (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug or placebo). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02694523. Findings: Between March 31, 2016, and Aug 24, 2017, 605 patients were randomly assigned to receive either risankizumab (n=301, 50%) or adalimumab (n=304, 50%). 294 (98%) of patients in the risankizumab group and 291 (96%) in the adalimumab group completed part A, and 51 (96%) of 53 patients re-randomised to risankizumab and 51 (91%) of 56 patients re-randomised to continue adalimumab completed part B. At week 16, PASI 90 was achieved in 218 (72%) of 301 patients given risankizumab and 144 (47%) of 304 patients given adalimumab (adjusted absolute difference 24·9% [95% CI 17·5–32·4]; p<0·0001), and sPGA scores of 0 or 1 were achieved in 252 (84%) patients given risankizumab and 252 (60%) patients given adalimumab (adjusted absolute difference 23·3% [16·6–30·1]; p<0·0001). In part B, among adalimumab intermediate responders, PASI 90 was achieved by 35 (66%) of 53 patients switched to risankizumab and 12 (21%) of 56 patients continuing adalimumab (adjusted absolute difference 45·0% [28·9–61·1]; p<0·0001) at week 44. Adverse events were reported in 168 (56%) of 301 patients given risankizumab and 179 (57%) of 304 patients given adalimumab in part A, and among adalimumab intermediate responders, adverse events were reported in 40 (75%) of 53 patients who switched to risankizumab and 37 (66%) of 56 patients who continued adalimumab in part B. Interpretation: Risankizumab showed significantly greater efficacy than adalimumab in providing skin clearance in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. No additional safety concerns were identified for patients who switched from adalimumab to risankizumab. Treatment with risankizumab provides flexibility in the long-term treatment of psoriasis.

"Cranial Irradiation for Patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutant Lung Cancer Who Have Brain Metastases in the Era of a New Generation of EGFR Inhibitors","2019","Background: Immediate whole brain radiation (WBRT) has been the standard for patients with lung cancer with brain metastases. The study aims to evaluate the effect of immediate cranial irradiation in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant lung cancer in the era of a new generation of EGFR inhibitors. Materials and Methods: Medical records of 198 patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer and brain metastases at initial metastatic diagnosis were reviewed. Patients were categorized into four groups: immediate WBRT, immediate cranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), delayed radiation upon progression of cranial lesions (DRT), and never cranial irradiation (NRT). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival related to EGFR inhibitors were analyzed. Results: The SRS group had the fewest brain metastases and fewest extracranial lesions, and the DRT and NRT groups had the smallest brain metastases. Median survival were 18.5, 55.7, 21.1, and 18.2 months for the WBRT, SRS, DRT, and NRT groups, respectively. Patients who had received EGFR T790M inhibitors survived longer (41.1 vs. 19.8 months). In multivariate analysis, the OS of patients in the SRS group was longer than that in the NRT group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.315). Patients who had fewer extracranial lesions and who had received EGFR T790M inhibitor treatments also survived longer (aHR: 0.442 and 0.357, respectively). Conclusion: Immediate stereotactic radiosurgery but not whole brain radiation was associated with longer survival. Because of patient heterogeneity and the introduction of EGFR T790M inhibitors, the timing and modality of cranial irradiation should be determined individually, and cranial irradiation may be omitted for selected patients. Implications for Practice: Immediate whole brain radiation has been the standard for patients with lung cancer with brain metastases. In this study, it was observed that, for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant advanced lung cancer who had brain metastases, there was no difference in survival between patients who never received cranial irradiation and those who received whole brain radiation immediately. Patients who received immediate stereotactic radiosurgery or who had ever received EGFR T790M inhibitors survived longer. Patients who received immediate stereotactic radiosurgery have fewer brain metastases. These findings suggest that the timing and modality of cranial irradiation should be determined individually, and cranial irradiation may be omitted in selected patients. ?

"Do informed consumers in Taiwan favour larger hospitals? A 10-year population-based study on differences in the selection of healthcare providers among medical professionals, their relatives and the general population","2019","Objectives Exploring whether medical professionals, who are considered to be a  informed consumers' in the healthcare system, favour large providers for elective treatments. In this study, we compare the inclination of medical professionals and their relatives undergoing treatment for childbirth and cataract surgery at medical centres, against those of the general population. Design Retrospective study using a population-based matched cohort data. Participants Patients who underwent childbirth or cataract surgery between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2013. Primary and secondary outcomes measures We used multiple logistic regression to compare the ORs of medical professionals and their relatives undergoing treatment at medical centres, against those of the general population. We also compared the rate of 14-day re-admission (childbirth) and 14-day reoperation (cataract surgery) after discharge between these groups. Results Multivariate analysis showed that physicians were more likely than patients with no familial connection to the medical profession to undergo childbirth at medical centres (OR 5.26, 95% CI 3.96 to 6.97, p<0.001), followed by physicians' relatives (OR 2.68, 95% CI 2.20 to 3.25, p<0.001). Similarly, physicians (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.19, p<0.01) and their relatives (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.81, p<0.01) were also more likely to undergo cataract surgery at medical centres. Physicians also tended to select healthcare providers who were at the same level or above the institution at which they worked. We observed no significant difference in 14-day re-admission rates after childbirth and no significant difference in 14-day reoperation rates after cataract surgery across patient groups. Conclusions Medical professionals and their relatives are more likely than the general population to opt for service at medical centres. Understanding the reasons that medical professionals and general populations both have a preferential bias for larger medical institutions could help improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery. ?

"Multiparametric graph theoretical analysis reveals altered structural and functional network topology in Alzheimer's disease","2019","Alzheimer's disease (AD), an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, is the most common type of dementia in elderly people. This present study incorporated multiple structural and functional connectivity metrics into a graph theoretical analysis framework and investigated alterations in brain network topology in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. By using this multiparametric analysis, we expected different connectivity metrics may reflect additional or complementary information regarding the topological changes in brain networks in MCI or AD. In our study, a total of 73 subjects participated in this study and underwent the magnetic resonance imaging scans. For the structural network, we compared commonly used connectivity metrics, including fractional anisotropy and normalized streamline count, with multiple diffusivity-based metrics. We compared Pearson correlation and covariance by investigating their sensitivities to functional network topology. Significant disruption of structural network topology in MCI and AD was found predominantly in regions within the limbic system, prefrontal and occipital regions, in addition to widespread alterations of local efficiency. At a global scale, our results showed that the disruption of the structural network was consistent across different edge definitions and global network metrics from the MCI to AD stages. Significant changes in connectivity and tract-specific diffusivity were also found in several limbic connections. Our findings suggest that tract-specific metrics (e.g., fractional anisotropy and diffusivity) provide more sensitive and interpretable measurements than does metrics based on streamline count. Besides, the use of inversed radial diffusivity provided additional information for understanding alterations in network topology caused by AD progression and its possible origins. Use of this proposed multiparametric network analysis framework may facilitate early MCI diagnosis and AD prevention. ? 2019 The Authors","adult; Alzheimer disease; analytical parameters; Article; axial diffusivity; body mass; brain function; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; echo planar imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; limbic system; major clinical study; male; Markov chain; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; multiparametric graph theoretical analysis; priority journal; radial diffusivity"
"Association of weight change patterns in late adolescence with young adult wage differentials: A multilevel longitudinal study","2019","Background Numerous studies have demonstrated that different weight change patterns from adolescence to adulthood may exert different effects on opportunities from which individuals subsequently benefit. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the association of weight change patterns from late adolescence to young adulthood with monthly wage in young adulthood for both genders in Taiwan. Methods A nationally representative retrospective panel of 3730 young people (1707 men and 2023 women) from the Taiwan Educational Panel Survey (2001-2014) was included. Individuals were divided into four weight-change-pattern categories based on changes in their body mass index at two time points that were 7 years apart, between late adolescence (aged 18-19 years) and young adulthood (aged 25-26 years). These categories were (1) no obesity, (2) obesity reversal, (3) developing obesity, and (4) persistent obesity. Cross-classified, hierarchical linear regression modeling analysis was performed to explore the association of weight change patterns with monthly wage in young adulthood, after adjustment for both individual- and contextual-level variables. Results Of the weight-change-pattern categories for both genders, individuals with persistent obesity had the lowest monthly wage. For women, the mean monthly wage decreased progressively for the categories of no obesity, obesity reversal, developing obesity, and persistent obesity (test for difference, P = 0.016; test for trend, P = 0.026). Women with persistent obesity earned 20% less per month than did those who were never obese (P = 0.024), after controlling for individual and contextual factors. For men, no association was found between weight change patterns and monthly wage. Conclusion Persistent obesity from late adolescence to young adulthood is associated with low monthly wage in young adulthood in women but not in men. These findings highlight the urgency of addressing persistent obesity early in life, especially for women. ? 2019 Huang, Chen.

"Resistant maltodextrin ameliorates altered hepatic lipid homeostasis via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in a high-fat diet-fed rat model","2019","Many studies have shown that resistant maltodextrin (RMD) possesses blood cholesterol lowering and anti-obesity effects. In order to investigate the effect of RMD on lipid metabolism in the liver, rats were fed with a high-fat (HF) diet for 7 weeks to induce hyperlipidemia and fatty liver. Normal control rats were fed with a normal diet. HF-diet-fed rats were treated with 5% RMD for 8 weeks. The results showed that the increased plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, the increased hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol levels, and fatty liver in HF-diet-fed rats were significantly decreased after supplementation with RMD. Supplementation with RMD significantly (1) induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation; (2) inhibited the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR); (3) suppressed the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-γ; (4) increased β-oxidation of fatty acids by increasing the protein expression carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1α (CPT-1α) in the livers of HF-diet-fed rats. Taken together, supplementation of RMD was capable of inhibiting lipogenic enzyme activities and inducing fatty acid β-oxidation through increasing AMPK activation, thereby reducing lipid accumulation in the liver. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Understanding synergies and trade-offs between water and energy production at landfill sites","2019","Landfills provide the most commonly used waste disposal solution. They are designed to reduce the risk of environmental or public health hazards due to waste disposal, and are used for waste management purposes in many places around the world. Depending on the design of the site and recovery methods, landfill sites can work as a potential reserve of energy and water for society. Landfill biogas is a source of renewable energy, and surface water can be collected in a retention pond. Although researchers broadly agree on the importance of incorporating the concept of the energy and water nexus into policy strategies and decision-making, the lack of studies focused on how governance methods that incorporate energy-water linkages at landfill sites can improve the provision of these two essential services has hindered progress in this direction. This study analyzes the links between water-energy nexus at a restored landfill site in Taipei City, Taiwan. The study tracks leachate and methane production at the site over the time periods when the landfill was actively receiving waste and after its closure and since its restoration. The results of model simulation of leachate yield and methane collection under different conditions show that energy and water production changed considerably during the time span under consideration. We identified an increasing trend of water and energy production in the landfill operation phase and a decreasing trend of water and energy production in the landfill restoration phase. In addition, we also identify a synergy between energy generation and water volume during the operation phase, and show that no trade-offs between energy generation and water volume were observed during any of the phases studied. These observations imply that greater water volumes will always lead to greater energy production, which can help inform future landfill design and governance practices. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biogas; Commerce; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Health hazards; Health risks; Mergers and acquisitions; Methane; Restoration; Surface waters; Energy productions; Landfill operations; Landfill restoration; Leachates; Methane production; Synergy; Water and energies; Water energy; Leachate treatment; methane; alternative energy; biogas; governance approach; landfill; leachate; methane; recovery; surface water; synergism; waste disposal; Article; ecosystem restoration; energy yield; environmental management; landfill; landfill leachate; priority journal; Taiwan; water content; water energy nexus; water management; Taipei; Taiwan"
"mTOR inhibitors can enhance the anti-tumor effects of DNA vaccines through modulating dendritic cell function in the tumor microenvironment","2019","The life span of dendritic cells (DCs) can become short following induced activation, which is associated with metabolic transition due to the regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of inhibiting mTOR to modulate DC functions for elevating the anti-tumor effects of DNA vaccines. Therefore, the influences of various inhibitors of mTOR (mTORi) on the expressions of DC maturation markers, the abilities of antigen presenting and processing of BMM-derived DCs and the tumor killing effects of E7-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes activated by BMM-derived DCs were in vitro examined. The anti-tumor effects of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)/E7 DNA vaccine and/or mTORi were also in vivo analyzed. In our study, suppressive effects of mTORi on the DC maturation markers expressed on BMMCs could be reversed. The mTORi-treated mature BMM-derived DCs tended to be non-apoptotic. These mTORi-treated BMM-derived DCs could have better antigen presenting and processing abilities. The E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes could have more potent tumoricidal activity following activation of mTORi-treated BMM-derived DCs. For tumor-bearing mice, those treated with CTGF/E7 DNA vaccine and mTORi indeed can have higher percentages of mature DCs in the TME, better disease control and longer survivals. Consequently, application of mTORi can be a pharmacological approach for temporally increasing life span, antigen presenting and antigen processing of DCs to strengthen the therapeutic outcome of cancer immunotherapy. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

A cross-shaped tube with symmetric discharge electrodes is used to generate dielectric barrier discharge to produce ionized gas charging nonpolar molecules, while a coaxial capillary is placed at the center of the cross-shaped tube for generating electrospray discharge. Since there is no floating voltage at the outlet of the cross-shaped tube, the potential interference for the ESI can be excluded. Results show that dual-ion source can stably produce high-intensity ions of 10 9 ion cm -3 . Moreover, the relationship between the measured ion intensity and the gas flow rate, gas temperature, and applied voltage for ESI are systematically investigated. Various samples including volatile organic compounds, pesticides, Chinese herbal medicines, and vitamins are used for evaluating the sensing performance of the dual-ion source in plasma mode, electrospray mode, and dual-ion source mode, respectively. Results show that the developed dual source is efficient to simultaneously detect both the polar and nonpolar compounds. ? 1973-2012 IEEE.","Atmospheric ionization; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Electric fault currents; Electron tubes; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Flow of gases; Ion sources; Ionization; Mass spectrometry; Medicine; Pesticides; Plasma (human); Plasma sources; Volatile organic compounds; Ambient mass spectrometries; Atmospheric plasma sources; Atmospheric plasmas; Chinese herbal medicines; Dielectric barrier discharges; Electrospray ionization (ESI); Pesticide detection; Potential interferences; Electrospray ionization"
"A KDM6A–KLF10 reinforcing feedback mechanism aggravates diabetic podocyte dysfunction","2019","Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Although dysfunction of podocytes, also termed glomerular visceral epithelial cells, is critically associated with diabetic nephropathy, the mechanism underlying podocyte dysfunction still remains obscure. Here, we identify that KDM6A, a histone lysine demethylase, reinforces diabetic podocyte dysfunction by creating a positive feedback loop through up-regulation of its downstream target KLF10. Overexpression of KLF10 in podocytes not only represses multiple podocyte-specific markers including nephrin, but also conversely increases KDM6A expression. We further show that KLF10 inhibits nephrin expression by directly binding to the gene promoter together with the recruitment of methyltransferase Dnmt1. Importantly, inactivation or knockout of either KDM6A or KLF10 in mice significantly suppresses diabetes-induced proteinuria and kidney injury. Consistent with the notion, we also show that levels of both KDM6A and KLF10 proteins or mRNAs are substantially elevated in kidney tissues or in urinary exosomes of human diabetic nephropathy patients as compared with control subjects. Our findings therefore suggest that targeting the KDM6A–KLF10 feedback loop may be beneficial to attenuate diabetes-induced kidney injury. ? 2019 The Authors.

"The biosimilar pathway in the USA: An analysis of the innovator company and biosimilar company perspectives and beyond","2019","In order to improve access to costly biological treatments, a biosimilar pathway in the United States of America (USA) was enacted under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act) of 2009. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the health policy, the establishment of the biosimilar pathway, influenced related companies by studying their respective perspectives and strategies revealed in literatures and publicly available resources. Perspectives of companies reveal the points of concern for the biosimilar pathway, such as data requirements, patents, interchangeability, naming, and exclusivity. Innovator companies may utilize expedited programs for serious conditions, enhance patent protection, launch programs for life-cycle extension, and develop biosimilars as well. The biosimilar companies overcoming technical barriers might need to gather convincing evidence to facilitate market penetration as well as to distinguish their products from those of other biosimilar competitors. More challenges are expected for innovator companies if international harmonization takes place, which might be worth further investigation. ? 2019","biological product; biosimilar agent; filgrastim; generic drug; drug industry; drug information; drug labeling; drug marketing; drug safety; drug storage; health care policy; human; immunogenicity; patent; pharmacovigilance; Review; United States"
"Hierarchically targetable polysaccharide-coated solid lipid nanoparticles as an oral chemo/thermotherapy delivery system for local treatment of colon cancer","2019","Although oral formulations of anticancer chemotherapies are clinically available, the therapeutic action relies mostly on drug absorption, being inevitably accompanied with systemic side effects. It is thus desirable to develop oral therapy systems for the local treatment of colon cancers featured with highly selective delivery to cancer cells and minimized systemic drug absorption. The present study demonstrates the effective accumulation and cell uptake of the doxorubicin and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles-loaded solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) delivery system for chemo/magnetothermal combination therapy at tumors by hierarchical targeting of folate (FA) and dextran coated on SLN surfaces in a sequential layer-by-layer manner. Both the in vitro and in vivo characterizations strongly confirmed that the dextran shells on SLN surfaces not only retarded the cellular transport of the FA-coated SLNs by the proton-coupled FA transporter on brush border membranes in small intestine, but also enhanced the particle residence in colon by specific association with dextranase. The enzymatic degradation and removal of dextran coating led to the exposure of the FA residues, thereby further facilitating the cellular-level targeting and uptake of the SLNs by the receptor-mediated endocytosis. The evaluation of the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the hierarchically targetable SLN therapy system by oral administration showed the effective inhibition of primary colon tumors and peritoneal metastasis in terms of the ascites volume and tumor nodule number and size, along with the absence of systemic side effects. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cell membranes; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Dextran; Diseases; Iron oxides; Molecular biology; Nanoparticles; Tumors; Anti-cancer chemotherapy; Brush border membranes; Combination therapy; Hierarchical targeting; Oral formulations; Receptor-mediated endocytosis; Solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN); Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles; Targeted drug delivery; dextran; dextranase; doxorubicin; folic acid; polysaccharide; solid lipid nanoparticle; superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; A-549 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; ascites cell; cancer chemotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell transport; cell volume; colon cancer; controlled study; CT26 cell line; drug accumulation; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug reexposure; drug release; drug synthesis; endocytosis; enzymatic degradation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; nonhuman; peritoneum metastasis; priority journal; small intestine; target cell; thermotherapy; tumor volume"
"Long-term virological and serologic responses of chronic hepatitis B virus infection to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimens in patients with HIV and hepatitis B coinfection","2019","Background: Data regarding the durability of HBV viral suppression with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) combined with lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients are scarce in hyperendemic areas of chronic HBV infection. Methods: Between 2004 and 2016, HIV/HBV-coinfected Taiwanese with available baseline HBV DNA load were retrospectively reviewed. Determinations of plasma HBV DNA load, HBV serologic markers (HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe), and liver function were performed after initiation of cART. Factors associated with time to undetectable HBV DNA load were explored. Results: A total of 366 patients were included according to cART history: Group 1, 3TC as the only anti-HBV therapy (n = 73); Group 2, TDF-containing cART as initial therapy (n = 127); and Group 3, switch of 3TC-based to TDF-containing cART (n = 166). At year 5, HBV suppression was achieved in 77.8%, 95.7%, and 95.7% of Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, TDF (± 3TC or FTC) but not 3TC alone as initial anti-HBV therapy was significantly associated with HBV suppression (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.635; 95% CI 1.720–4.037), while HBeAg positivity at baseline was associated with failure to achieve HBV suppression (aHR 0.293; 95% CI 0.178–0.482). Loss of HBsAg occurred in 15 patients (4.1%), with 7 (1.9%) seroconversion to anti-HBs positivity, while HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 11 (16.9%) of 65 HBeAg-positive patients. Conclusions: TDF-containing cART achieved durable HBV viral suppression in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients and HBeAg positivity at baseline was associated with failure to achieve HBV suppression despite long-term TDF-containing cART. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.","emtricitabine; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; lamivudine; tenofovir disoproxil; adult; Article; chronic hepatitis B; controlled study; enzyme immunoassay; female; follow up; hazard ratio; Hepatitis B virus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; liver function; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; nonhuman; observational study; population research; priority journal; protein blood level; retrospective study; seroconversion; Taiwan; Taiwanese; treatment response; virus load"
"Clonal relationship and the association of the ST218 strain harboring bla OXA-72 gene to mortality in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia","2019","Background/purpose: In 2017, the World Health Organization categorized carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) as a priority 1, critical antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This study analyzed the clinical outcomes and investigated the molecular epidemiology of CRAB bacteremia in a medical center in Northern Taiwan. Methods: We collected 62 blood isolates from patients with CRAB bacteremia from January 2014 to December 2015 at MacKay Memorial Hospital and determined the clonal relationship using the PCR-based technique for molecular epidemiology. Medical charts were reviewed for clinical outcomes. Results: Fifty-six isolates harbored the bla OXA-51-like and bla OXA-23-like carbapenemase genes, 4 isolates harbor the bla OXA-51-like and bla OXA-24-like carbapenemase genes and 2 isolates harbored only the bla OXA-51-like gene. After sequencing, all four isolates of bla OXA-24-like carbapenemase gene were confirmed to be isolates of bla OXA-72 carbapenemase genes. In multivariate analysis in the 60 patients, the independent mortality risk factors of CRAB bacteremia included ?65 years (elderly) (Odds ratio, 4.04, 95% CI, 1.10–14.83, p = 0.035), chronic kidney disease (4.36, 1.14–16.72, p = 0.032). Isolates harboring the bla OXA-72 gene had the same sequence type (ST218) and PFGE pulsotype raising the possibility of intra-hospital transmission, and all infected patients died. Conclusion: This study showed the clonal relationship of isolates harboring the carbapenemase gene in CRAB bacteremia. Patients with the ST218 strain harboring bla OXA-72 gene had high mortality. This warrants further research to determine the mechanism of virulence and risk factors in order to reduce mortality. ? 2018","carbapenemase; colistin; imipenem; antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; beta lactamase; beta-lactamase OXA-23; beta-lactamase OXA-24; beta-lactamase OXA-51, Acinetobacter baumannii; carbapenem derivative; OXA-72 carbapenemase, Acinetobacter baumannii; virulence factor; Acinetobacter infection; adult; aged; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; artificial ventilation; bacteremia; bacterial gene; bacterial transmission; bacterial virulence; bacterium isolate; bla oxa 72 gene; blood culture; carbapenem resistance; carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; central venous catheterization; chronic kidney failure; clinical outcome; comorbidity; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; female; gene insertion sequence; healthcare associated infection; human; invasive procedure; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; minimum inhibitory concentration; molecular epidemiology; mortality rate; mortality risk; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; Taiwan; very elderly; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter infection; bacteremia; epidemiology; genetics; hospital; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; mortality; multidrug resistance; multivariate analysis; pathogenicity; risk factor; virulence; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter Infections; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactamases; Carbapenems; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Epidemiology; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Multivariate Analysis; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Virulence; Virulence Factors"
"Psychological Work Environment and Suicidal Ideation Among Nurses in Taiwan","2019","Purpose: Nurses are exposed to a poor psychological work environment; this may cause poor mental health, which is a risk factor for suicidal ideation. We investigated the association between psychological work environment and suicidal ideation among hospital nurses in Taiwan. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Taiwan female nurses using stratified sampling by region (north, central, south, and east) to select representative centers for this study. Methods: A self-report questionnaire including items on demographic data, the psychological work environment, and suicidal ideation was sent to nurses working in hospitals. Multiple logistic regression and population attributable risk analyses were performed to assess the effect of the psychological work environment on suicidal ideation. Findings: A total of 2,734 eligible questionnaires (76.8%) were returned. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 18.3%, and higher risk was found to be associated with the educational level of junior college or below, higher personal burnout, higher client-related burnout, and always feeling stressed at work. Estimation of population attributable risk showed that higher personal burnout, client-related burnout, and always feeling stressed at work were the most crucial factors among nurses, accounting for 19.4%, 8.6%, and 10.5% of suicidal ideation, respectively. Conclusions: A considerable proportion of nurses developed suicidal ideation. A poor psychological work environment was a relevant factor for suicidal ideation. Clinical Evidence: This study provides relevant knowledge for nursing management levels in preventing the development of suicidal ideation among nurses. Not only for nurses’ mental health, but for patient safety and care quality, further studies in improving nurses’ psychological work environment are warranted. ? 2018 Sigma Theta Tau International",""
"Optimal timing for postsurgical adjuvant therapy in patients with gastric cancer: A propensity score matching study","2019","Background: In clinical trials, adjuvant therapy (AT) has been shown to improve the prognosis in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who undergo curative gastrectomy and adequate lymph node dissection. However, the optimal timing for initiating AT is still unclear. Method: We collected data from 538 patients with stage II-III gastric cancer who underwent curative gastrectomy and AT in two tertiary hospitals from 2006 to 2013. Patients were divided into the early group (?8 weeks, n=393) and the late group (>8 weeks, n=145), based on the interval between gastrectomy and initiation of AT. Propensity score matching was applied according to baseline characteristics. Results: After 1:1 propensity score matching, an even distribution of characteristics in both groups (143:143) was achieved. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 56.6% and 40.2% in the matched early and late groups, respectively (p=0.062), while the corresponding 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 57.6% and 46.4%, respectively (p=0.028). The time to AT initiation was correlated with RFS and had a positive association with OS. The 5-year distant metastasis-free survival was also significantly better (HR 0.682, 95% CI 0.472.0.985, p=0.040), suggesting an early AT results in a better outcome in patients. Conclusion: We observed that initiation of AT within 8 weeks of curative gastrectomy produces better disease control and may contribute to better overall survival. ? 2018 Ivyspring International Publisher.","capecitabine plus oxaliplatin; cisplatin; fluorouracil; folinic acid; tegafur; uracil; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer control; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer survival; computer assisted tomography; diarrhea; distant metastasis; distant metastasis free survival; fatigue; febrile neutropenia; female; gastrointestinal symptom; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hypertransaminasemia; intensive care; leukopenia; local recurrence free survival; lymph node dissection; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; male; metastasis free survival; nausea; overall survival; perineural invasion; postoperative complication; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; stomach adenocarcinoma; thorax radiography; thrombocytopenia; time to treatment; total stomach resection; vomiting"

"High PD-L1 expression correlates with primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in treatment na?ve advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients","2019","Objectives: The main objective was to investigate the relationship between Programmed cell Death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels and the frequency of primary resistance to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) in treatment na?ve advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients. Materials and methods: From 2012–2017, we enrolled advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients who displayed primary resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy, along with patients with disease control, and patients experiencing either stable disease or partial response to EGFR-TKI treatment. Results: Sixty-six patients were enrolled as the primary resistance group, while 57 patients were included as the disease control group. Fifteen-five (22.7%) patients had a PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≧50% in the primary resistance group, with only one patient (1.8%) having that score in the disease control group (P＜0.001). Twenty (30.3%) patients had a PD-L1 ≧25% in the primary resistance group, with 2 (3.5%) patients having that level in the disease control group (P＜0.001). Thirty (45.5%) patients had a PD-L1 ≧1% in the primary resistance group, with 7 (12.3%) patients at that level in the disease control group (P = 0.001). Patients with a PD-L1≧1% displayed a higher incidence of primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs than those with a PD-L1＜1% (Odds Ratio (OR), 5.95; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 2.35–15.05; P＜0.001). The phenomenon existed still when the cutoff value was changed to both 25% (OR, 11.96; 95% CI, 2.65–53.87; P = 0.001) and 50% (OR, 16.47; 95% CI, 2.10–129.16; P = 0.008). The estimated median Progression-free Survival (PFS) rate was 7.3 months in patients with a PD-L1＜1%, 2.1 months in patients with a PD-L1≧1%, 1.8 months in patients with a PD-L1≧25%, and 1.6 months in patients with a PD-L1≧50%. Conclusions: Treatment for advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients displaying a higher PD-L1 expression level experienced a higher frequency of primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","afatinib; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; erlotinib; gefitinib; programmed death 1 ligand 1; antineoplastic agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; PDCD1 protein, human; programmed death 1 receptor; protein kinase inhibitor; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer resistance; controlled study; female; gene mutation; human; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; male; observational study; oncological parameters; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; retrospective study; Taiwan; Tumor Proportion Score; cancer staging; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; metabolism; mutation; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; ErbB Receptors; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mutation; Neoplasm Staging; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Retrospective Studies"
"Bilateral vocal fold immobility in a single tertiary hospital in northern Taiwan: A 23-year retrospective review","2019","To determine the natural history of patient with bilateral vocal fold immobility (BVFI), and to identify the factors or predictors associated with the tracheostomy and duration of cannulation for those who require tracheostomy.A retrospective review was carried out at a single tertiary referral center over a 23-year period of infants less than 1 year old who presented with BVFI. All information related to sex, etiology, gestational age at birth, vocal fold (VF) position at diagnosis, presence of concomitant airway disease, age at attainment of VF movement, age at decannulation, and current tracheostomy status were recorded to perform descriptive and comparative analyses.Forty-one patients were enrolled, and the tracheostomy rate was 80.5% (33/41). Those with a median VF position had a higher rate of tracheostomy in comparison with those with a paramedian VF position (P?=?.003). Among patients who underwent tracheostomy, 77.4% (24/31) were eventually decannulated. The median duration of cannulation was 4.4 years (range: 0.8?-?10.7 years). Those who were found to have attainment of VF movement at less than 1-year-old had a shorter duration of cannulation than others (mean: 1.9 years vs 5.2 years, P?<?.001). The mortality rate of those patients who received tracheostomy was 9.7% (3/31).Although a high tracheostomy rate was found in BVFI patients, most of them underwent decannulation. The earlier attainment of VF movement is achieved, the shorter duration of cannulation is required. This information is important for physicians while following up BVFI patients who have undergone tracheostomy.","female; gestational age; human; infant; male; newborn; procedures; retrospective study; Taiwan; tertiary care center; time factor; tracheostomy; vocal cord paralysis; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Tertiary Care Centers; Time Factors; Tracheostomy; Vocal Cord Paralysis"
"Mosaic paternal haploidy in a patient with pancreatoblastoma and Beckwith–Wiedemann spectrum","2019","Pancreatoblastoma is a rare type of pancreatic cancer in children. Here, we describe a case in which Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) was first suspected because of placental mesenchymal dysplasia. Although the baby did not show the stigmata characteristic of BWS or abnormal peripheral blood methylation, she developed a massive pancreatoblastoma 2 months later. She survived after partial excision of the tumor and chemotherapy. The methylation pattern of the pancreatoblastoma tissue was typical of BWS. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analyzes revealed that the pancreatoblastoma tissue had genome-wide loss of maternal alleles. Peripheral blood and nontumor pancreatic tissue showed normal biparental genomic contribution. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with centromeric probes for chromosomes 2 and 11 revealed haploid pancreatoblastoma cells, whereas the placental mesenchymal dysplasia tissue and nontumor pancreas tissue showed diploidy. SNP genotype analysis suggested the presence of mosaicism with the pancreatoblastoma tissue having a different paternal haplotype than that of the peripheral blood and nontumor pancreatic tissue. We report for the first time mosaic paternal haploidy associated with pancreatoblastoma. Babies with placental mesenchymal dysplasia, even those without a definitive diagnosis of BWS, need to be closely followed for the occurrence of embryonic tumors. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","alpha fetoprotein; antineoplastic agent; abdominal distension; alpha fetoprotein blood level; Article; Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome; cancer chemotherapy; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; dysplasia; dyspnea; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; follow up; haploidy; hepatoblastoma; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; hyperbilirubinemia; hyperinsulinemia; hypoglycemia; infant; laparotomy; liver cyst; mosaicism; multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pancreas cancer; pancreatoblastoma; placental mesenchymal dysplasia; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; vomiting"
"Sleep apnea may be associated with suicidal ideation in adolescents","2019","Suicide is a major threat to adolescent health. Sleep problems increase the risk of adolescent suicidal behavior, but the role of sleep-disordered breathing (e.g., sleep apnea) is unclear. We investigated whether sleep apnea had an effect on suicidal ideation that was independent of depression and perceived stress. We examined a series of sleep variables with suicidal ideation in 746 fifth and seventh graders using self-reported questionnaires to assess time in bed, sleep quality, insomnia, and sleep apnea while controlling depression and perceived stress. Overall, 8.8% of students aged 10–14?years reported having recent suicidal ideation, and 33% or 3.8%, depending on the screening criteria, reported having suspected sleep apnea. The sleep variables were all associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation, but the magnitude of effects was largely attenuated when depression and perceived stress were included in the models. Suspected sleep apnea using daytime sleepiness as a screening criterion was independently associated with suicidal ideation (odds ratio = 2.25, p < 0.05). Suspected sleep apnea was associated with suicidal ideation that was partly independent of depression and stress, which reveals the pertinence of screening for sleep apnea among school students and designing proper prevention strategies for reducing youth suicidal behavior. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adolescence; adolescent; apnea hypopnea index; Article; assessment of humans; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; child; child health; Chinese; chinese version of the pittsburg sleep quality index; cognitive behavioral therapy; cross-sectional study; daytime somnolence; depression; disease association; elementary student; Epworth sleepiness scale; female; human; insomnia; major clinical study; male; medical examination; mental health; Perceived Stress Scale; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; positive end expiratory pressure; risk factor; self report; sleep; sleep disordered breathing; sleep quality; stress; suicidal ideation; Taiwanese; adolescent behavior; complication; psychology; school; sleep disordered breathing; suicide; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Schools; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide"

"Nifedipine modulates renal lipogenesis via the ampk-srebp transcriptional pathway","2019","Lipid accumulation in renal cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related kidney disease, and lipotoxicity in the kidney can be a surrogate marker for renal failure or renal fibrosis. Fatty acid oxidation provides energy to renal tubular cells. Ca2+ is required for mitochondrial ATP production and to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, how nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) affects lipogenesis is unknown. We utilized rat NRK52E cells pre-treated with varying concentrations of nifedipine to examine the activity of lipogenesis enzymes and lipotoxicity. A positive control exposed to oleic acid was used for comparison. Nifedipine was found to activate acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, long chain fatty acyl CoA elongase, ATP-citrate lyase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, suggesting elevated production of cholesterol and phospholipids. Nifedipine exposure induced a vast accumulation of cytosolic free fatty acids (FFA) and stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species, upregulated CD36 and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) expression, inhibited p-AMPK activity, and triggered the expression of SREBP-1/2 and lipin-1, underscoring the potential of nifedipine to induce lipotoxicity with renal damage. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating nifedipine-induced lipid accumulation in the kidney. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Glutamine administration promotes hepatic glucose homeostasis through regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice with limb ischemia","2019","High-fat diet-induced obesity can lead to hepatic insulin resistance (IR) and alter glucose metabolism. The decreased protein expression involved in the PI3K-Akt pathway may enhance hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Obesity-associated glucose dysregulation and IR are risk factors for the development of peripheral arterial disease. Glutamine (Gln) has immunomodulatory properties and was found to attenuate IR and hyperglycemia in diabetic condition. Thus, in this study we hypothesized that Gln administration modulates hepatic glucose metabolism and improve IR via PI3K-Akt pathway in obese mice with limb ischemia. Mice were divided into a high-fat group (HC), and a high-fat Gln group (HG). Mice in the HC group were fed the high-fat diet for 8 weeks, while the HG group was initially fed the high-fat diet for 4 weeks followed by a high-fat diet with Gln for an additional 4 weeks. Part of the mice in the HC and HG groups were subjected to a limb ischemic operation and were euthanized after the operation. Liver tissues and blood samples were collected for analysis. The results showed that high-fat diet-induced obesity resulted in increased plasma glucose and insulin levels. Also, impairment of hepatic insulin signaling by downregulating PI3K-Akt pathway-associated protein expression was observed. Administration of Gln increased protein expression associated with PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, while reducing G6PC and FOXO1 expression in the hepatocytes that may promote glycogen synthesis and inhibit gluconeogenesis.

The clinical reasoning behind the misuse is poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate current clinical practices and develop recommendations that guide clinicians in prescribing antibiotic treatment in acute pancreatitis. Methods: Four methods were used. 1) Systematic data collection was performed to summarize current evidence; 2) a retrospective questionnaire was developed to understand the current global clinical practice; 3) five years of prospectively collected data were analysed to identify the clinical parameters used by medical teams in the decision making process, and finally; 4) the UpToDate Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was applied to provide evidence based recommendations for healthcare professionals. Results: The systematic literature search revealed no consensus on the start of AB therapy in patients with no bacterial culture test. Retrospective data collection on 9728 patients from 22 countries indicated a wide range (31–82%) of antibiotic use frequency in AP. Analysis of 56 variables from 962 patients showed that clinicians initiate antibiotic therapy based on increased WBC and/or elevated CRP, lipase and amylase levels. The above mentioned four laboratory parameters showed no association with infection in the early phase of acute pancreatitis. Instead, procalcitonin levels proved to be a better biomarker of early infection. Patients with suspected infection because of fever had no benefit from antibiotic therapy. Conclusions: The authors formulated four consensus statements to urge reduction of unjustified antibiotic treatment in acute pancreatitis and to use procalcitonin rather than WBC or CRP as biomarkers to guide decision-making. ? 2019 IAP and EPC","amylase; antibiotic agent; C reactive protein; procalcitonin; triacylglycerol lipase; antiinfective agent; biological marker; acute pancreatitis; amylase blood level; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacterium culture; clinical decision making; clinical practice; cohort analysis; consensus development; evidence based practice; fever; human; infection; leukocyte count; major clinical study; medication overuse; prescription; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; systematic review; triacylglycerol lipase blood level; acute disease; antimicrobial stewardship; bacterial infection; clinical practice; complication; consensus; evidence based medicine; microbiology; pancreatitis; protocol compliance; questionnaire; Acute Disease; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimicrobial Stewardship; Bacterial Infections; Biomarkers; Clinical Decision-Making; Consensus; Evidence-Based Medicine; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Pancreatitis; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Descriptive study of snakebite patients in Northern Taiwan: 2009 to 2016","2019","Taiwan is located in a subtropical area where there are approximately 50 kinds of land snakes and six principal kinds of venous snakes. Snakebite envenomation is not an uncommon issue in Taiwan. We design a study to obtain an understanding of the characteristics of snakebites and snakebite patients in a medical center in northern Taiwan. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective medical records study of an 8-year period. We used the key word 'snake' to search the emergency department (ED) diagnosis of all patients and then used antivenom management codes to select patients for inclusion. The species of snake involved, time and site of the bite, geographic data of the patients and patient outcomes were recorded. Results: In total, there were 125 snakebite patients (male 70%, female 30%). The snakes involved were Protobothrops mucrosquamatus (50%), followed by Trimeresurus stejnegeri (7%). The feet and ankles were the most frequently bitten areas (42.4%). The peak months were July and October. The average ED stasis time was 2 hours and 45 minutes, and 65.6% of snakebite patients received antivenom. In patients bitten by P. mucrosquamatus, there was a high surgical rate, 23.8% higher than those reported in other studies. No mortalities or side effects of antivenom were reported in these patients. Conclusion: We propose a clinical flow chart for physicians who are treating patients bitten by P. mucrosquamatus. Snakebites, especially those inflicted by P. mucrosquamatus, induce severe soft tissue swelling, which can mimic compartment syndrome. Antivenom for P. mucrosquamatus is the first and only choice of treatment. The amount of antivenom needs to match the clinical symptoms. Patients bitten by P. mucrosquamatus may need longer observation times than patients bitten by other species of snakes, in addition to toxicologist consultations, sonographic examinations, and measurement of the objective compartment pressure before surgery. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Sciences | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","antibiotic agent; cephalosporin; clindamycin; penicillin derivative; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; snake venom antiserum; Article; chronic pain; compartment syndrome; decision making; echography; edema; envenomation; fasciotomy; female; hospital admission; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; respiratory failure; retrospective study; snakebite; Taiwan; treatment outcome"
"The epidemiology of non-Candida yeast isolated from blood: The Asia Surveillance Study","2019","Background: Current guidelines recommend echinocandins as first-line therapy for candidemia. However, several non-Candida yeast are non-susceptible to echinocandins (echinocandin non-susceptible yeast, ENSY), including Cryptococcus, Geotrichum, Malassezia, Pseudozyma, Rhodotorula, Saprochaete, Sporobolomyces and Trichosporon. In laboratories that are not equipped with rapid diagnostic tools, it often takes several days to identify yeast, and this may lead to inappropriate presumptive use of echinocandins in patients with ENSY fungemia. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of ENSY species during a 1-year, laboratory surveillance programme in Asia. Methods: Non-duplicate yeast isolated from blood or bone marrow cultures at 25 hospitals in China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand were analysed. Isolates were considered to be duplicative if they were obtained within 7?days from the same patient. Results: Of 2155 yeast isolates evaluated, 175 (8.1%) were non-Candida yeast. The majority of non-Candida yeast were ENSY (146/175, 83.4%). These included Cryptococcus (109 isolates), Trichosporon (23), Rhodotorula (10) and Malassezia (4). The proportion of ENSY isolates (146/2155, 6.7%) differed between tropical (India, Thailand and Singapore; 51/593, 8.6%) and non-tropical countries/regions (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan; 95/1562, 6.1%, P?=?0.038). ENSY was common in outpatient clinics (25.0%) and emergency departments (17.8%) but rare in intensive care units (4.7%) and in haematology-oncology units (2.9%). Cryptococcus accounted for the majority of the non-Candida species in emergency departments (21/24, 87.5%) and outpatient clinics (4/5, 80.0%). Conclusions: Isolation of non-Candida yeast from blood cultures was not rare, and the frequency varied among medical units and countries. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Low-dose nab-paclitaxel-based combination chemotherapy in heavily pretreated pancreatic cancer patients","2020","Background: Heavily pretreated pancreatic cancer patients have a grave prognosis. In this case series study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel-based chemotherapy for such patients. Methods: The data of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients (n = 40) treated with nab-paclitaxel after the failure of gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidines at our institution in 2013–2015 were reviewed. Results: The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was two (range, 1–6). Eighteen patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ?2. The regimens comprised nab-paclitaxel combined with the following drugs: gemcitabine (n = 28), gemcitabine and fluoropyrimidine (n = 3), platinum and fluoropyrimidine (n = 4), fluoropyrimidine (n = 4), and irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine (n = 1). The median dose of nab-paclitaxel was 63 (range, 51–72) mg/m2/dose, with the schedule of D1/15, D1/8, and D1/8/15 followed in 23, 14, and 3 patients, respectively. The median overall survival was 5.1 (95% CI, 4.6–5.7) months. Among 32 evaluable patients, two partial responses and six stable diseases were observed. The median progression-free survival was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.9–3.2) months. Grade 3/4 leucopenia or neutropenia was observed in three and two patients, respectively. Grade 3/4 anemia was observed in four patients. Other significant (grade 3 or more) nonhematological toxicities were not frequent, except for sepsis/infection (n = 7). However, more severe anemia or sepsis/infection was significantly associated with disease control. Conclusion: In heavily pretreated pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients, low-dose nab-paclitaxel-based chemotherapy was fairly tolerable with modest efficacy. ? 2019","antineoplastic metal complex; CA 19-9 antigen; carcinoembryonic antigen; fluoropyrimidine; gemcitabine; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; irinotecan; paclitaxel; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; anemia; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer survival; clinical article; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; human; infection; leukopenia; low drug dose; lymph node metastasis; male; neutropenia; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; patient history of chemotherapy; peritoneum metastasis; progression free survival; recurrence free survival; sepsis"

"Targeted treatment of primary aldosteronism – The consensus of Taiwan Society of Aldosteronism","2019","Background/Purpose: Even with the increasing recognition of primary aldosteronism (PA) as a cause of refractory hypertension and an issue of public health, the consensus of its optimal surgical or medical treatment in Taiwan has not been reached. Our objective was to develop a clinical practice guideline that is feasible for real-world management of PA patients in Taiwan. Methods: The Taiwan Society of Aldosteronism (TSA) Task Force recognized the above-mentioned issues and reached this Taiwan PA consensus at its inaugural meeting, in order to provide updated information of internationally acceptable standards, and also to incorporate our local disease characteristics and constraints into PA management. Results: In patients with lateralized PA, including aldosterone producing adenoma (APA), laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the ‘gold standard’ of treatment. Mini-laparoscopic and laparoendoscopic single-site approaches are feasible only in highly experienced surgeons. Patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or those not suitable for surgery should be treated by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The outcome data of PA patient management from the literature, especially from PA patients in Taiwan, are reviewed. Mental health screening is helpful in early detection and management of psychopathology among PA patients. Conclusion: We hope this consensus will provide a guideline to help medical professionals to manage PA patients in Taiwan to achieve a better quality of care. ? 2018","alcohol; epithelial sodium channel blocking agent; eplerenone; finerenone; glucocorticoid; mineralocorticoid antagonist; spironolactone; mineralocorticoid antagonist; adrenal hyperplasia; adrenalectomy; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular mortality; clinical practice; familial hyperaldosteronism; human; hyperaldosteronism; laparoendoscopic single site surgery; laparoscopic adrenalectomy; laparoscopic surgery; long term survival; outcome assessment; patient care; pharmacological parameters; postoperative period; practice guideline; pregnancy; primary hyperaldosteronism; psychosomatics; radiofrequency ablation; robot assisted endoscopic adrenalectomy; robot assisted surgery; screening; surgical technique; Taiwan; consensus; hyperaldosteronism; laparoscopy; medical society; mental health; meta analysis (topic); procedures; Adrenalectomy; Consensus; Humans; Hyperaldosteronism; Laparoscopy; Mental Health; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists; Societies, Medical; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Taiwan"

"A useful design utilizing the information fraction in a group sequential clinical trial with censored survival data","2019","Lan and DeMets (1983) proposed the alpha spending function for group sequential trials to permit the use of unspecified frequencies and timings of interim analyses in the trial design. Regarding a trial with censored time to endpoint, Lan and DeMets (1989) later defined information time at an interim analysis in a maximum duration trial. To compare two survival curves utilizing such a design, information times for group sequential logrank and Wilcoxon-type statistics have been developed by assuming that the survival time follows an exponential distribution or a Weibull distribution without considering the censoring distribution. To better address the practical concerns inherent in clinical trials with survival endpoints, we present a new approach to adequately design a group sequential trial using the Harrington–Fleming (1982) test based on our proposed information fractions by assuming the censoring distribution depends on the patient's accrual time according to various entry distributions and by extending the underlying survival distribution to the generalized gamma distribution. We also determine associated sample sizes, expected number of events and expected stopping time. Two phase III trials of non-small-cell lung cancer originally designed using fixed-sample tests are utilized to illustrate the potential advantages of using a group sequential design with the proposed approach. This enhanced method facilitates the design and analysis of group sequential clinical trials studying survival endpoints by increasing implemental flexibility. ? 2018, The International Biometric Society","cancer; data set; design method; methodology; testing method; biometry; clinical trial (topic); genetics; human; lung tumor; methodology; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; sample size; statistical distribution; survival analysis; time factor; Biometry; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Research Design; Sample Size; Statistical Distributions; Survival Analysis; Time Factors"
"Treatment outcomes and predicting factors for diabetic macular edema treated with ranibizumab – One-year real-life results in Taiwan","2019","Purpose: To report the one-year outcomes of diabetic macular edema (DME) treated with ranibizumab under a real-life setting in Taiwan, and to identify the prognostic factors. Methods: Between July 2013 and January 2015, 119 eyes receiving intravitreal ranibizumab for DME were retrospectively recruited. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central foveal thickness (CFT) measured with optical coherence tomography were collected at baseline and at Month 3, 6, and 12. Linear regression was used to identify the predicting factors for changes in BCVA and CFT at Month 12. Results: The average number of ranibizumab given within one year was 4.36 ± 1.87. The BCVA (logMAR) improved from 0.74 ± 0.30 at baseline to 0.64 ± 0.37 at Month 12 (p = 0.002). A better improvement in BCVA at Month 3 was significantly correlated with a better visual improvement at Month 12 (p < 0.001). The existence of subretinal fluid at baseline (p = 0.02) and a greater reduction in CFT at Month 3 (p < 0.001) were both correlated with a greater reduction in CFT at Month 12. Previous subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide was associated with fewer additional IVR after Month 3 (odds ratio = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14–0.89). Conclusion: Compared with existing prospective studies, the one-year real-life data in Taiwan showed fewer ranibizumab injections for DME and a less prominent yet still significant visual improvement. Both visual and anatomical improvements at Month 3 were correlated with the level of improvements at Month 12. Previous subtenon steroid injection might reduce the need of additional ranibizumab injections. ? 2018","ranibizumab; triamcinolone acetonide; angiogenesis inhibitor; ranibizumab; adult; Article; best corrected visual acuity; central foveal thickness; cohort analysis; comparative study; correlation coefficient; diabetic macular edema; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; prognosis; retrospective study; subretinal fluid; subtenon drug administration; Taiwan; treatment outcome; treatment response; vision; visual system parameters; aged; complication; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic imaging; macular edema; regression analysis; treatment outcome; visual acuity; Aged; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Humans; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Ranibizumab; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Treatment Outcome; Visual Acuity"
"Prevalence of and risk factor for community-onset third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli bacteremia at a medical center in Taiwan","2019","Background: Increased resistance to third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) is a serious concern for community-onset Escherichia coli infection because this resistance easily delays effective treatment. This study surveyed the current antimicrobial resistance pattern among E. coli isolates that cause community-onset bacteremia, with a special focus on the prevalence of and the risk factors for 3GC resistance, and determined factors for poor outcomes among patients with community-onset E. coli bacteremia. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Taiwan. All adult patients with community-onset E. coli bacteremia between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015 were enrolled and were divided into two groups depending on whether the E. coli isolate was susceptible to 3GCs. Risk factors for 3GC resistance, 14-day all-cause mortality, and length of hospital stay were analyzed. Results: The overall rate of 3GC resistance among E. coli isolates causing community-onset bacteremia was 19.7%, whereas it was 9.6% if only isolates causing community-acquired bacteremia were considered. Independent risk factors for 3GC-resistant community-onset E. coli bacteremia were hospitalization within the past 1 year (odds ratio: 2.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.6-3.7, P < 0.001), exposure to antibiotics within the past 15 days (2.6, 1.4-4.9, P = 0.002), residence in nursing home or long-term care facility (3.6, 1.0-12.3, P = 0.044), presence of underlying genitourinary disease (1.9, 1.2-2.9, P = 0.005), and presence of indwelling implantable intravenous port (2.2, 1.1-4.1, P = 0.021). 3GC resistance was independently associated with increased length of hospital stays (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In this study, the prevalence of 3GC resistance was high among both patients with community-onset and those with community-acquired E. coli bacteremia. 3GC resistance is a strong independent risk factor for length of hospital stay. The effectiveness of empirical antibiotic treatment would partially explain the impact of 3GC resistance, but more evidence is needed. The choice of appropriate empirical antibiotics for community-onset E. coli bacteremia might impact outcomes in terms of the length of hospital stay and need to be individualized according to the patient-specific risk for acquiring drug-resistant pathogens. ? 2019 The Author(s).","amikacin; antibiotic agent; cefazolin; cefepime; cefmetazole; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; cephalosporin derivative; ciprofloxacin; cotrimoxazole; ertapenem; gentamicin; imipenem; levofloxacin; meropenem; piperacillin plus tazobactam; sultamicillin; tigecycline; antiinfective agent; cephalosporin derivative; aged; all cause mortality; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterium isolate; community acquired infection; controlled study; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli bacteremia; female; Gram negative sepsis; hospitalization; human; infection risk; length of stay; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; nursing home; observational study; prevalence; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; tertiary care center; urogenital tract disease; urosepsis; bacteremia; community acquired infection; drug effect; Escherichia coli infection; hospital; microbiology; pathogenicity; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Cephalosporins; Community-Acquired Infections; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Hospitals; Humans; Prevalence; Risk Factors"
"The eradication of Helicobacter pylori to prevent gastric cancer: a critical appraisal","2019","Introduction: Gastric cancer is one of the top causes of cancer-related death worldwide. How to eliminate gastric cancer is an urgent public-health issue. Areas covered: In this review, we present up-to-date results of studies on gastric cancer prevention through the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and discuss strategies and obstacles for the implementation of population-wide screening and treatment of this pathogen to prevent gastric cancer. Expert commentary: Gastric cancer is an inflammation-associated cancer with multistep carcinogenesis. The process consists of H. pylori infection, ongoing inflammation, development of metaplastic epithelia and genetic instability eventuating in gastric cancer. H. pylori infection is critical for development of the disease and studies have consistently shown that H. pylori eradication results in a reduction in (a) gastric mucosal inflammation, (b) progression of histologic damage, (c) risk of peptic ulcers and ulcer recurrence, and (d) risk of gastric cancer. Compared with a large number of clinical trials evaluating chemopreventive approaches, studies of population-wide screening, and eradication of H. pylori have only recently begun and only in high-risk populations. To eliminate gastric cancer requires information on how to implement an effective program for screening and treatment of H. pylori taking into consideration the other health priorities in any specific population. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bacterial clearance; cancer prevention; cancer risk; cancer screening; cancer therapy; chemoprophylaxis; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; digestive system inflammation; genomic instability; health care planning; health program; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; high risk population; histopathology; human; metaplasia; nonhuman; peptic ulcer; personalized medicine; recurrent peptic ulcer; Review; stomach cancer; stomach carcinogenesis; animal; drug effect; early cancer diagnosis; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; microbiology; pathogenicity; primary prevention; procedures; protection; risk factor; stomach tumor; treatment outcome; antiinfective agent; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Early Detection of Cancer; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Primary Prevention; Protective Factors; Risk Factors; Stomach Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome"
"The changes of quality of life and their correlations with psychosocial factors following surgery among women with breast cancer from the post-surgery to post-treatment survivorship","2019","Objectives: This 14-month study aimed to examine the changes of quality of life following breast cancer surgery and associations of such changes with depression and anxiety levels, and protective factors (attachment styles in close relationship, and meaning in life) based on positive psychology theory. Materials and methods: Women with breast cancer were recruited within one week of completion of breast cancer surgery. They were asked to complete several questionnaires to measure the generic and breast cancer specific quality of life, depression and anxiety levels, attachment styles in close relationship, and meaning in life. Assessments were performed at baseline (T0), T1 (the 2nd month), T2 (the 5th month), T3 (the 8th month), and T4 (the 14th month). Results: While the generic functions of quality of life improve after surgery, no significant changes of the breast-specific functions were found during the 14-month follow up period. While physical, role, and social functions improved immediately after surgery, the improvements of emotional and cognitive functions began to occur at the 5th and the 8th months after surgery. Depressive symptoms predicted almost all general and breast-specific QOL functions and symptoms. Avoidant and anxious attachment styles were associated with the negative scores for breast-specific functions and symptoms. Conclusion: Breast-specific functions, in particular body image and sexual function, remain unchanged with the passage of time following surgery. A psychological rehabilitation program aiming to reduce depressive symptoms and enhance secure attachment styles in close relationships needs to be established immediately following surgery and continue through the post-treatment survivorship stages. ? 2018","adult; anxiety; Article; attitude to life; breast cancer; cancer surgery; cancer survivor; cognition; correlational study; depression; emotionality; female; human; major clinical study; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; social psychology; survivorship; symptom; aged; body image; breast tumor; coping behavior; longitudinal study; middle aged; psychology; quality of life; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Body Image; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Survivorship"
"Metformin and the risk of dementia in type 2 diabetes patients","2019","This retrospective cohort study investigated dementia risk associated with metformin use in type 2 diabetes patients by using the reimbursement database of the Taiwan’s National Health Insurance. The patients had new-onset diabetes during 1999-2005 and were followed up until December 31, 2011. An unmatched cohort of 147,729 ever users and 15,676 never users of metformin were identified, and a matched-pair cohort of 15,676 ever users and 15,676 never users was created by propensity score (PS). Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using PS. Results showed that in the unmatched cohort, 713 never users and 3943 ever users developed dementia with respective incidence of 1029.20 and 570.03 per 100,000 person-years. The overall hazard ratio was 0.550 (95% confidence interval: 0.508-0.596). The hazard ratio for the first (<27.0 months), second (27.0-58.1 months) and third (>58.1 months) tertile of cumulative duration of metformin therapy was 0.975 (0.893-1.066), 0.554 (0.506-0.607) and 0.286 (0.259-0.315), respectively. Analyses in the matched cohort showed an overall hazard ratio of 0.707 (0.632-0.791) and the hazard ratio for the respective tertile was 1.279 (1.100-1.488), 0.704 (0.598-0.829) and 0.387 (0.320-0.468).

"The antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects of icariin on the kidney in a unilateral ureteral obstruction mouse model","2019","Background: The pathology change of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a critical feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD), regardless of the primary insults. The infiltration of inflammatory cells and the consecutive secretion of profibrotic factors are frequently and conspicuously observed during the development of renal fibrosis. Icariin, an active polyphenol of the Epimedium genus, has been found to alleviate the symptoms of chronic diseases like diabetes, neurodegeneration, and heart and renal diseases. The effect and mechanism of icariin on the prevention of CKD-associated renal fibrosis still needed clarification. Purpose: The aims of this study were to investigate whether icariin treatment improves the development of CKD-associated renal fibrosis and its possible mechanism. Methods: An experimental unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced chronic renal fibrosis mouse model was used. Mice were orally administered with icariin (20 mg/kg/day) for 3 consecutive days before and 14 consecutive days after UUO surgery. Results: The pathological changes, collagen deposition, and protein expressions of profibrotic factors (transforming growth factor-β and connective tissue growth factor) and fibrotic markers (α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin), which were significantly elevated in the kidneys of UUO mice, could be significantly reversed by icariin treatment. Icariin treatment also significantly inhibited the increased Smad2/3 and decreased E-cadherin protein expressions in the kidneys of UUO mice. Icariin treatment prominently mitigated the protein expression of proinflammatory factors like nuclear factor-κB, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin 1-β and prooxidative enzyme (NADPH oxidase-4), and it increased the protein expression of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase). Conclusion: Icariin treatment protects against CKD-associated renal fibrosis via its antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties. Icariin may serve as a therapeutic agent in the prevention of CKD-associated renal fibrosis. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH","alpha smooth muscle actin; candesartan; catalase; collagen; connective tissue growth factor; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; cyclooxygenase 2; fibronectin; icariin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4; transforming growth factor beta; uvomorulin; antiinflammatory agent; collagen; fibronectin; flavonoid; icariin; transforming growth factor beta; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antifibrotic activity; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell infiltration; controlled study; granulocyte; immunohistochemistry; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; obstruction-induced renal fibrosis; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; animal; complication; disease model; drug effect; fibrosis; kidney; kidney disease; male; metabolism; ureter obstruction; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Collagen; Disease Models, Animal; Fibronectins; Fibrosis; Flavonoids; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Male; Mice; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Ureteral Obstruction"
"New Drugs for Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Organisms: Time for Stewardship","2019","A gradual rise in drug-resistant trends among Gram-negative organisms, especially carbapenem-resistant (CR) Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), CR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and extensively-drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii, poses an enormous threat to healthcare systems worldwide. In the last decade, many pharmaceutical companies have devoted enormous resources to the development of new potent antibiotics against XDR Gram-negative pathogens, particularly CRE. Some of these novel antibiotics against CRE strains are β-lactam/β-lactamase-inhibitor combination agents, while others belong to the non-β-lactam class. Most of these antibiotics display good in vitro activity against the producers of Ambler class A, C, and D β-lactamase, although avibactam and vaborbactam are not active in vitro against metallo-β-lactamase (MβL) enzymes. Nevertheless, in vitro efficacy against the producers of some or all class B enzymes (New Delhi MβL, Verona integron-encoded MβL, etc) has been shown with cefepime-zidebactam, aztreonam-avibactam, VNRX-5133, cefiderocol, plazomicin, and eravacycline. As of Feburary 2019, drugs approved for treatment of some CRE-related infections by the US Food and Drug Administration included ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, plazomicin, and eravacycline. Although active against extended-spectrum and AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, delafloxacin does not show in vitro activity against CRE. Murepavadin is shown to be specifically active against CR- and colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. Despite successful development of novel antibiotics, strict implementation of an antibiotic stewardship policy in combination with the?use of well-established phenotypic tests and novel multiplex PCR methods for detection of the most commonly encountered β-lactamases/carbapenemases in hospitals is important for prescribing effective antibiotics against CRE and decreasing the resistance burden due to CRE. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","antibiotic agent; avibactam; aztreonam; beta lactam antibiotic; beta lactamase inhibitor; cefepime; cefiderocol; ceftazidime; eravacycline; meropenem; murepavadin; new drug; plazomicin; unclassified drug; vaborbactam; vnrx 5133; zidebactam; antiinfective agent; azabicyclo derivative; bacterial protein; beta lactam; beta lactamase; beta lactamase inhibitor; carbapenemase; cephalosporin derivative; cyclooctane derivative; WCK 5222; antimicrobial stewardship; Article; carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae; Gram negative bacterium; human; molecular diagnosis; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; phenotype; drug combination; drug effect; Gram negative bacterium; metabolism; multidrug resistance; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Azabicyclo Compounds; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactamase Inhibitors; beta-Lactamases; beta-Lactams; Cephalosporins; Cyclooctanes; Drug Combinations; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Humans"
"Pre-treatment quality of life as a predictor of distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival in patients with head and neck cancer who underwent free flap reconstruction","2019","Purpose: This study examined the prognostic associations of pre-treatment quality of life (QoL) with overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DFMS) among patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) who underwent free flap reconstruction. Methods: A cohort of 127 HNC patients who received free flap reconstruction between November 2010 and June 2014 at a hospital were recruited. Pre-treatment QoL was measured by the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire, which contains six physical domains, including speech, swallowing, appearance, saliva, taste and chewing, as well as the six social-emotional domains of pain, activity, recreation, shoulder, mood, and anxiety. Cox regression analyses were performed. Results: Results showed that pre-treatment QoL was predictive of OS and DMFS. Of the domains, swallowing, chewing, speech, taste, saliva, pain and shoulder were demonstrated to be significant predictors of OS. Additionally, swallowing, chewing, speech, pain and activity were demonstrated making significant contributions to DMFS. Conclusion: Our data supported that physical domains of pre-treatment QoL were predictors for OS and DFMS in HNC patients with free-flap reconstruction. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the prognostic abilities of social-emotional domains. Information on pre-treatment QoL should be taken into account to individualize care plan for these patients, and hence prolong their survival. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; aged; cohort analysis; female; free tissue graft; head and neck tumor; human; male; metastasis; middle aged; preoperative care; prognosis; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; reconstructive surgery; survival; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Free Tissue Flaps; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Preoperative Care; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survival"
"Ophthalmologic manifestations in Taiwanese patients with mucopolysaccharidoses","2019","Background: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of rare lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in various tissues and organs. Ocular problems that affect the cornea, trabecular meshwork, sclera, retina, and optic nerve are very common in these patients. However, there was limited literature focusing on comprehensive ocular findings in different types of MPS. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical ophthalmologic features and electrodiagnostic results of 50 Taiwanese patients with a diagnosis of MPS (34 males and 16 females; age range, 1.1–34.9?years; nine with MPS I, 17 with MPS II, 17 with MPS IV, and seven with MPS VI). Results: Among 44 patients with available data for visual acuity, 15 patients (34%) had a visual acuity of less than 0.5 (6/12) equivalent in their better eye, including 71% of those with MPS VI, 38% with MPS IV, 29% with MPS I, and 14% with MPS II. Severe corneal opacities existed in 57% of MPS VI patients and 11% of MPS I patients, compared with none for MPS II and MPS IV patients. Among 80 eyes with available data of refraction, 11 eyes (14%) had myopia (≦?0.50?D), 55 eyes (69%) had hyperopia (≧0.50?D), and 55 eyes (69%) had high astigmatism (≧1.50?D). Ocular hypertension was found in 45% (28/62) of eyes. There were 16% (14/90), 11% (10/90), 13% (12/90), 31% (27/86), and 79% (30/38) of MPS eyes with lens opacities, optic disc swelling, optic disc cupped, retinopathy, and visual pathway dysfunction, respectively. Intraocular pressure was positively correlated with the severity of corneal opacity (p?<?0.01). Conclusions: Ocular complications with significant reduction in visual acuity are common in MPS patients. Diagnostic problems may arise in these patients with severe corneal opacification, especially for those with MPS VI and MPS I. ? 2019 The Authors.

"SFRPs Are Biphasic Modulators of Wnt-Signaling-Elicited Cancer Stem Cell Properties beyond Extracellular Control","2019","Secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) are mainly known for their role as extracellular modulators and tumor suppressors that downregulate Wnt signaling. Using the established (CRISPR/Cas9 targeting promoters of SFRPs and targeting SFRPs transcript) system, we find that nuclear SFRPs interact with β-catenin and either promote or suppress TCF4 recruitment. SFRPs bind with β-catenin on both their N and C termini, which the repressive effects caused by SFRP-β-catenin-N-terminus binding overpower the promoting effects of their binding at the C terminus. By high Wnt activity, β-catenin and SFRPs only bind with their C termini, which results in the upregulation of β-catenin transcriptional activity and cancer stem cell (CSC)-related genes. Furthermore, we identify disulfide bonds of the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and two threonine phosphorylation events of the netrin-related motif (NTR) domain of SFRPs that are essential for their role as biphasic modulators, suggesting that SFRPs are biphasic modulators of Wnt signaling-elicited CSC properties beyond extracellular control. Liang et al. find that CRD and NTR domains of nuclear SFRPs induce opposite effects on Wnt signaling by interacting with distinct β-catenin regions to modulate TCF4 recruitment. Disulfide bonds of CRD domain and two threonine phosphorylation events of NTR domain in SFRPs are required to generate Wnt/β-catenin-elicited CSC properties. ? 2019 The Author(s)","beta catenin; cysteine; netrin; nuclear protein; regulator protein; secreted frizzled related protein; secreted frizzled related protein 1; secreted frizzled related protein 2; secreted frizzled related protein 3; secreted frizzled related protein 4; secreted frizzled related protein 5; threonine; transcription factor 4; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; amino terminal sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer stem cell; carboxy terminal sequence; cellular parameters; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; extracellular matrix; female; human; human cell; human tissue; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; protein binding; protein domain; protein function; protein motif; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein transport; regulatory mechanism; transcription regulation; upregulation; Wnt signaling"
"Promoting dentinogenesis of DPSCs through inhibiting microRNA-218 by using magnetic nanocarrier delivery","2019","Purpose: The purposes of this study are to explore the roles of microRNA-218 (miR-218) delivered by a newly designed magnetic nanocarrier: GCC-Fe3O4 (GCC-Fe) in dentinogenesis potentials of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Methods: Human DPSCs were obtained from impacted wisdom teeth of healthy donors under the permission of National Taiwan University Hospital institutional review board (NTUH IRB). Meanwhile, the transfection efficiency of GCC-Fe was evaluated. After transfecting miR-218 (GFm) and miR-218 inhibitor (GFmi) into DPSCs for 24 h, the dentinogenesis potentials of DPSCs were then evaluated with Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining with or without induction for 1, 4, and 9 days. Possible signaling pathway was further investigated by Western Blotting. Results: We found that the magnetic GCC-Fe3O4 nanocarrier was serum endurable with about 90% transfection efficiency in DPSCs under normal culture condition. Results of ARS staining indicated that miR-218 was negatively regulating dentinogenesis potentials of DPSCs after induction. When the miR-218 inhibitor was delivered, calcium deposits in DPSCs were increased significantly. We also discovered that the effects of miR-218 were further regulated through the MAPK/ERK pathway. Conclusion: We identified that miR-218 had a negative regulation role in the dentinogenesis of DPSCs. By inhibiting miR-218, the mineralization potentials of DPSCs were promoted after induction. In addition, we also confirmed that the highly efficient magnetic GCC-Fe3O4 nanocarrier not only was suitable for gene manipulation in biomedical studies, but also ideal for future clinical applications due to its serum endurable property. ? 2018","alizarin red s; magnetic nanoparticle; microRNA; microRNA 218; mitogen activated protein kinase; nanocarrier; unclassified drug; microRNA; MIRN218 microRNA, human; adult; Article; controlled study; dental pulp stem cell; dentinogenesis; human; human cell; institutional review; MAPK signaling; staining; Taiwan; third molar; tooth development; tooth disease; university hospital; Western blotting; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cytology; magnetic field; normal human; signal transduction; stem cell; tooth pulp; Adult; Blotting, Western; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Dental Pulp; Dentinogenesis; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Magnetic Fields; MicroRNAs; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells"
"Soil and maize contamination by trace elements and associated health risk assessment in the industrial area of Volos, Greece","2019","Agricultural lands adjacent to industrial activities are vulnerable due to the risk of trace elements (TEs) being accumulated into crops and subsequently humans. One such case concerns the industrial area of Volos, Greece, a suspected contaminated area which has never been studied. We measured Ag, Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Tl, V, and Zn in soil and maize (leaves and grains) and assessed health risk of human exposure via soil ingestion and grain consumption. We found that the most highly enriched elements in soils were Tl (enrichment factor = 19), Se (17.68), Sb (14.81), As (7.89), Ni (6.91), Mo (5.22) and Cr (4.33); they all likely derived from anthropogenic activities and in particular from a nearby major steel factory, except for Ni which is known to be lithogenically elevated in that area. Synchrotron XANES spectra analysis revealed that As species were associated with ferrihydrite, and predominant species were As(V) (at ca. 85%) and As(III) (at ca. 15%). Although the total content of the studied elements was high, the ammonium bicarbonate-DTPA extractions recovered very low element concentrations, probably due to the fact that soil conditions decelerated solubility (i.e., soils were alkaline, clayey, and with high Fe oxides content). This was confirmed by the soil-to-grain transfer index, which was particularly low for all studied elements. In 5% of sampled grains concerning Cd, and in 40% concerning Pb, the European food-related regulation limits were surpassed. Health risk assessment showed a dramatically elevated risk for Tl via soil ingestion (hazard quotient, HQ = 2.399), a value that contributed 74% of the total risk. Similarly, concerning the grain consumption-related health risk, Tl was the predominant contributor (HQ = 0.128, contributing 40% of the total risk). Such elevated Tl risk which has rarely been reported previously, led to a considerably high hazard index (HI) well above the threshold of HI = 1. Cancer risk was below the 1 × 10?4 risk threshold for As and Pb. Our findings indicate that this study should be pivotal concerning similar industrially-affected agricultural soils of suspected contamination, since less-expected toxic elements such as Tl here may be primary contributors to health risk. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonium bicarbonate; Grain (agricultural product); Hazards; Health; Health risks; Heavy metals; Iron oxides; Nickel; Risk assessment; Soils; Trace elements; Anthropogenic activity; Contaminated areas; Corn; Element concentrations; Enrichment factors; Industrial activities; Pollution index; Steel factories; Soil pollution; aluminum; ammonia; antimony; aspartic acid; bicarbonate; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; diazepam; ferric hydroxide; iron; iron oxide; lead; manganese; molybdenum; nickel; selenium; silver; thallium; tin; trace element; zinc; heavy metal; trace element; health risk; heavy metal; maize; pollution exposure; risk assessment; soil pollution; trace element; agricultural land; Article; cancer risk; controlled study; crop; grain; Greece; health hazard; industrial area; maize; nonhuman; plant leaf; priority journal; risk assessment; soil pollution; solubility; spectroscopy; chemistry; environmental monitoring; food contamination; human; industry; maize; risk assessment; soil; soil pollutant; Greece; Magnesia; Thessaly; Volos; Zea mays; Environmental Monitoring; Food Contamination; Greece; Humans; Industry; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trace Elements; Zea mays"
"Phase II study of metabolic response to one-cycle chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma","2019","Background: In the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the optimal use of 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) in measuring metabolic tumor response is undetermined. We launched a phase II trial to evaluate early metabolic response to one-cycle induction chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced ESCC. Methods: ESCC patients in stage classification T3N0, N1M0, or M1a (American Joint Committee on Cancer, 6th edition) received one-cycle chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel, cisplatin, and 24-h infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin on days 1 and 8, followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 40 Gy, with paclitaxel/cisplatin and then esophagectomy. PET was performed at baseline and day 14 of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR). We hypothesized early metabolic responders with &gt;35% reduction in maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), would have better pCR Results. Results: Sixty-six patients were enrolled. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 16 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9–27) and 22 months (16–40), respectively. The early metabolic response rate was 55%; and the pCR rate was 34% in the esophagectomy population. The early metabolic response was not associated with pCR or survival. In an exploratory analysis, the postchemotherapy SUVmax was an independent prognostic factor for pCR, PFS, and OS. Conclusion: Our study failed to validate the predefined early metabolic response for pCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced ESCC patients. However, postchemotherapy SUVmax may be prognostic and predictive, and warrants further study. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","cisplatin; fluorouracil; folinic acid; paclitaxel; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; fluorouracil; paclitaxel; adult; advanced cancer; Article; cancer staging; cancer survival; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus resection; female; follow up; human; induction chemotherapy; major clinical study; male; maximum standardized uptake value; overall survival; phase 2 clinical trial; progression free survival; Taiwan; treatment response; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; middle aged; positron emission tomography; retrospective study; survival analysis; treatment outcome; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Cisplatin; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Esophagectomy; Female; Fluorouracil; Humans; Induction Chemotherapy; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Paclitaxel; Positron-Emission Tomography; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"Genetic variants in the circadian rhythm pathway as indicators of prostate cancer progression","2019","Background: To determine the association between circadian pathway genetic variants and the risk of prostate cancer progression. Methods: We systematically evaluated 79 germline variants in nine circadian pathway genes in a cohort of 458 patients with localized prostate cancer as the discovery phase. We then replicated the significant findings in another cohort of 324 men with more advanced disease. The association of each variant with prostate cancer progression was evaluated by a log-rank test and Cox regression. Results: A single nucleotide polymorphism of the neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) gene (rs6542993 A>T) was found to be associated with a significantly higher risk of disease progression in both localized (P = 0.001) and advanced (P = 0.039) prostate cancer cases. In silico analysis revealed decreased expression levels of NPAS2 in carriers of the T allele of rs6542993 compared with those carrying the A allele. Consistently, downregulation of NPAS2 expression was associated with more aggressive prostate cancer and poor progression-free survival (log-rank P = 0.002). Conclusions: The NPAS2 rs6542993 polymorphism may be a promising biomarker, and may shed light on the pathways that govern prostate cancer progression. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; advanced cancer; aged; allele; Article; cancer growth; cancer risk; circadian rhythm; cohort analysis; gene; gene expression regulation; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; human; major clinical study; male; NPAS2 gene; progression free survival; prostate cancer; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; survival rate"
"Carbon-doped TiO2 activated by X-ray irradiation for the generation of reactive oxygen species to enhance photodynamic therapy in tumor treatment","2019","Traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by the penetration depth of visible light. Although the light source has been changed to near infrared, infrared light is unable to overcome the penetration barrier and it is only effective at the surface of the tumors. In this study, we used X-ray as a light source for deep-seated tumor treatment. A particle with a narrow band gap when exposed to soft X-rays would produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill tumor cell, with less damage to the normal tissues. Anatase TiO2 has been studied as a photosensitizer in PDT. In the experiment, C was doped into the anatase lattice at an optimum atomic ratio to make the band gap narrower, which would be activated by X-ray to produce more ROS and kill tumor cells under stress. The results showed that the synthesized TiO2:C particles were identified as crystal structures of anatase. The synthesized particles could be activated effectively by soft X-rays to produce ROS, to degrade methylene blue by up to 30.4%. Once TiO2:C was activated by X-ray irradiation, the death rate of A549 cells in in vitro testing was as high as 16.57%, on day 2. In the animal study, the tumor size gradually decreased after treatment with TiO2:C and exposure to X-rays on day 0 and day 8. On day 14, the tumor declined to nearly half of its initial volume, while the tumor in the control group was twice its initial volume. After the animal was sacrificed, blood, and major organs were harvested for further analysis and examination, with data fully supporting the safety of the treatment. Based on the results of the study, we believe that TiO2:C when exposed to X-rays could overcome the limitation of penetration depth and could improve PDT effects by inhibiting tumor growth effectively and safely, in vivo. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Factors increasing the detection rate of intrauterine lesions on hysteroscopy in infertile women with sonographically normal uterine cavities","2019","Background: Detection of intrauterine lesions is important for infertile women, as the uterine cavity is the site for embryo growth. This study aims to investigate factors that increase the detection rate of intrauterine lesions on office hysteroscopy in infertile women with sonographically normal uterine cavities. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 1726 infertile women who had normal uterine cavities on two-dimensional transvaginal sonography. Office hysteroscopy was performed in the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. Results: Intrauterine lesions were detected in 260 (15.1%) of the 1726 women. In women who suffered from abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), hypomenorrhea or had a history of dilation and curettage (D&C), the detection rates of intrauterine lesions on office hysteroscopy were 41.4%, 22.2% and 19.4%, respectively. The predictive rate of abnormal hysteroscopic finding was 22.4% in women with at least one of these three clinical features, while it was 9.6% in those without. Conclusion: AUB, hypomenorrhea, and previous D&C are the three factors that increase the detection rate of intrauterine lesions on office hysteroscopy in infertile women with sonographically normal uterine cavities. ? 2018","adult; Article; cesarean scar defect; clinical feature; echography; embryo growth; endometritis; endometrium polyp; female; female infertility; human; hysteroscopy; intrauterine adhesion; major clinical study; menstrual cycle; myoma; oligomenorrhea; prenatal disorder; retrospective study; scar; tortuous cervical canal; transvaginal echography; two-dimensional imaging; unicornuate uterus; uterine cervix disease; uterine septum; uterus bleeding; uterus cavity; uterus disease; diagnostic imaging; echography; hysteroscopy; multivariate analysis; pathology; regression analysis; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; uterus; uterus disease; Adult; Female; Humans; Hysteroscopy; Infertility, Female; Multivariate Analysis; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Ultrasonography; Uterine Diseases; Uterus"
"Women with diffuse large B cell lymphoma benefit more from rituximab-containing chemotherapy","2019","Background: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment response and overall survival (OS) improved after incorporating rituximab with chemotherapies. Yet, available evidence as to whether women and men may benefit similarly from rituximab have not been adequately addressed, particularly in the real-world setting. The objective of this study was to examine sex differences in the clinical outcomes of rituximab in DLBCL patients using the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database and National Health Insurance Research Database. Materials and Methods: All DLBCL patients aged 20 years and older during 2009-2013 were identified (n = 4490; women = 2048). Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the results. Results: The baseline characteristics were similar between women and men with DLBCL, except that women had lower Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and that fewer women underwent R-CHOP. In the survival analysis, women had better OS and longer time to treatment failure. The multivariate analysis of OS showed that the female sex remained to be an independent favorable prognostic factor regardless of Ann Arbor stages, age, treatments, CCI, and practice settings. In the subgroup analysis, the female advantage was only significant in the patients receiving rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy instead of in those receiving other rituximab-containing or non-rituximab therapies. This advantage diminished when rituximab dose was higher. Conclusion: From our population-based study, women demonstrated more survival benefits from the use of rituximab-containing induction chemotherapies for DLBCL. ? 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin plus prednisolone plus rituximab plus vincristine; rituximab; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer registry; cancer survival; cardiovascular disease; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical outcome; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; female; groups by age; human; induction chemotherapy; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiple cycle treatment; overall survival; priority journal; rheumatic disease; sex difference; splenectomy; time to treatment; treatment failure; very elderly"

"Statin adherence and persistence on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Taiwan","2019","Background Evidence and treatment guidelines support the use of statins in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) for secondary prevention of subsequent cardiovascular (CV) event. However, treatment adherence and persistence are still a concern. Methods We constructed a retrospective population-based cohort of patients, who initiated statin treatment within 90 days after discharge from hospital for ASCVD using the claims database of Taiwan National Health Insurance. Proportion of days covered (PDC) was used to measure statin adherence, and PDC ?80% was defined as good adherence. The study outcomes were subsequent rehospitalisation or in-hospital death due to composite ASCVD, myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke. Their associations with statin prescription adherence or persistence were analysed using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model. Results The study cohort included 185 252 postdischarge statin initiators. There were 50 015 subsequent ASCVD rehospitalisations including 2858 in-hospital death during 7 years of study period. Good adherence was significantly associated with lower risk of ASCVD rehospitalisation (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.90; 95% CI 0.87 to 0.92) and significantly lower risk of in-hospital death (aHR 0.59; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.65). Compared with constant use of statin, patients in the three less persistent states (recent stop, non-persistence and intermittent use) were associated with higher risk of subsequent ASCVD rehospitalisation, aHRs were 1.16, 1.13 and 1.26, respectively (all p<0.05). The increased risks were consistent with specific outcome of acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. Also, patients in the recent stop period had significantly higher risk for fatal CV event. Conclusions Good adherence and persistence to statin therapy are significantly associated with lower risk of secondary ASCVD rehospitalisation and in-hospital death. ?

"Identification of factors associated with first-cycle drug approval rates and regulatory outcomes for new drug applications","2019","The aims of this study were to identify types of deficiencies resulting in delay of approvals for drugs eventually approved by the US FDA and to search for factors associated with higher first-cycle approval rates. Review documents of New Drug Applications approved between 2008 and 2017 were retrieved from the Drugs@FDA database. Basic characteristics of the applications, regulatory actions, and reasons for non-approvals and/or major amendments after first review cycle were investigated. Of 825 applications studied, 446 (54.1%) applications received first-cycle approvals without a review extension resulting from a major amendment. Non-approvals (240, 29.1%) were based primarily on chemistry/manufacturing/controls and safety reasons. A higher first-cycle approval rate was associated with factors related to unmet medical needs or innovative development. The association between higher first-cycle approval rates and innovative drugs or those addressing unmet needs reveals the FDA's commitment in advancing innovation and protecting public health. ? 2018","anticonvulsive agent; antineoplastic agent; antiparkinson agent; antivirus agent; digestive tract agent; vitamin; Article; chemistry; controlled study; correlational study; drug approval; drug control; drug formulary; drug manufacture; drug safety; food and drug administration; priority journal; United States; drug approval; Food and Drug Administration; statistics and numerical data; Drug Approval; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration"

"Long-term effects of psychological symptoms after occupational injury on return to work: A 6-year follow-up","2019","Psychological factors may compromise return to work among workers with occupational injuries, and little is known about the long-term consequences of psychological symptoms relating to return to work. The study examined the impact of psychological symptoms on return to work as well as exploring factors associated with return to work among injured workers. A total of 572 workers who experienced occupational injuries were recruited in this prospective cohort study. Surveys of the psychological symptoms using the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) were conducted at 3 and 12 months after the injury. All of the workers were invited to join the study at year 6 after the injury. Sociodemographic factors, psychological symptoms, injury severity, and return-to-work status were collected. Approximately 10% of injured workers could not return to work even 6 years after the injury. Severe psychological symptoms within 1 year after the injury presented a significant risk factor for not returning to work 6 years after the injury (adjusted OR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5–0.8). Furthermore, age, education level, length of hospitalization, and injury-induced changes in appearance had significant independent influence on return to work as well. These findings highlight the importance of the effects of mental health within 1 year post injury on return to work, and support the concept of early screening, detection, and intervention in at-risk occupational injured workers with severe psychological symptoms. ? 2019 by the authors.

Methods: From 2009 to 2018, patients with real-time PCR-confirmed parvovirus B19 infection were collected. Comparisons were done between previously healthy patients and patients with preexisting diseases, as well as patients with high (&gt;5.5 × 105 copies/mL sera) and low viral loads. Results: Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected in 31 patients. Fourteen (45%) patients had underlying diseases, including six (19%) with immunologic diseases, five (16%) with hematologic diseases, and three (10%) with cardiopulmonary diseases. Only seven (23%) patients received an initial impression of erythema infectiosum prior to positive PCR. A higher proportion of patients with underlying diseases presented with fatigue and pallor, and suffered from tachycardia and hepatosplenomegaly compared to previously healthy patients. Among patients with a high viral load, a substantial proportion were of older age, suffered fatigue, and anemia. There was a trend of patients with immunologic comorbidity having a higher viral load. Conclusion: The classical parvovirus B19 manifestations were less frequently observed in patients with a preexisting disease compared with previously healthy patients. Depending on host factors, the symptoms of parvovirus B19 infection can be multifaceted. ? 2019","virus DNA; virus DNA; adolescent; adult; aged; anemia; Article; blood cell count; child; clinical article; clinical feature; comorbidity; comparative study; DNA extraction; erythema infectiosum; female; hepatosplenomegaly; hospitalization; human; Human parvovirus B19; immunosuppressive treatment; male; nonhuman; pallor; polymerase chain reaction; population; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; tachycardia; virus load; blood; complication; erythema infectiosum; fatigue; genetics; Human parvovirus B19; infant; isolation and purification; middle aged; preschool child; season; serology; serum; Taiwan; virology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anemia; Child; Child, Preschool; DNA, Viral; Erythema Infectiosum; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Parvovirus B19, Human; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retrospective Studies; Seasons; Serologic Tests; Serum; Tachycardia; Taiwan; Viral Load; Young Adult"
"Risk of dementia among individuals with psoriasis: A nationwide population-based cohort study in Taiwan","2019","Objective: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease putatively associated with dementia. However, the epidemiologic evidence of the relationship between psoriasis and dementia has been limited. We used a large national sample to investigate this relationship as well as the association between systemic therapy for psoriasis and incident dementia. Methods: The cases were identified as a first recorded diagnosis of psoriasis (ICD-9-CM codes: 696.0, 696.1, or 696.8) between 1996 and 2013 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Each selected case of psoriasis was compared with 4 sex-, age-, and urbanization-matched comparison subjects. The first diagnosis of dementia (ICD-9-CM codes: 290.0-290.4, 294.1-294.2, 331.0-331.2, or 331.82) that covered vascular and nonvascular subtypes until the end of 2013 was tracked in both groups. Cox regression analyses and a competing risk model were applied to evaluate the risk, adjusting for sex, urbanization, age, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, stroke, and depression. The association between systemic therapy and incidence of dementia in the psoriasis group was examined in further stratified analyses. Results: Overall, 3,820 patients with psoriasis and 15,280 comparisons were identified. After adjustment, a significantly higher risk of dementia was identified in the psoriasis group than in the comparison group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06-1.42). A significant association between psoriasis and dementia was identified for nonvascular dementia (aHR = 1.25, 95% CI, 1.07-1.45) but not for vascular dementia (aHR = 1.27, 95% CI, 0.83-1.93). Receiving systemic therapy for psoriasis for more than 90 days significantly reduced the risk of developing dementia compared with no systemic therapy (aHR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97). Compared with those who received no systemic therapy, the patients who received disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and/or biologics had a significantly lower risk of dementia incidence (aHR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50-0.97), which was not the case in patients who received only phototherapy. Conclusions: Individuals with psoriasis have a significantly higher incidence of dementia, particularly the nonvascular type. Systemic therapy might be protective in preventing dementia in patients with psoriasis. ?

"Bilateral asymmetry in kinematic strategies for obstacle-crossing in adolescents with severe idiopathic thoracic scoliosis","2019","Introduction: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS)is the most common three-dimensional spinal deformity pathology during adolescence, often accompanied with sensory integration and proprioception problems, which may lead to abnormal postural control and altered end-point control during functional activities. This paper identifies the effects of AIS on the end-point control and on angular kinematics of the trunk and pelvis-leg apparatus during obstacle-crossing for both the concave- and convex-side limb leading. Materials and Methods: Sixteen adolescents with severe Lenke 1 AIS (age: 14.9 ± 1.7 years, height: 154.7 ± 5.0 cm)and sixteen healthy controls (age: 14.8 ± 2.7 years, height: 154.9 ± 5.6 cm)each walked and crossed obstacles of 3 heights with either the concave- (AIS-A)or convex-side (AIS-V)limb leading. Angular motions of the trunk, pelvis and lower limbs, and toe-obstacle clearances were measured. Two-way analyses of variance were used to study between-subject (group)and within-subject (limb and height)effects on the variables. Whenever a height effect was found, a polynomial test was used to determine the linear trend. α = 0.05 was set for all tests. Results: Patients with AIS significantly reduced pelvic downward list but increased dorsiflexion in both stance and swing ankles at leading limb crossing when compared to controls (p < 0.05). During AIS-A, additional kinematic modifications were observed, i.e., increased stance hip adduction (4.2 ± 0.8°, p = 0.005)and increased swing knee flexion (12.6 ± 1.4°, p = 0.106), with significantly decreased leading toe-clearance (AIS-A: 121.4 ± 6.7 mm, controls: 140.1 ± 5.6 mm, p = 0.031). Conclusions: Patients with AIS adopted an altered kinematic strategy for successful obstacle-crossing. With the concave-side limb leading, more joint kinematic modifications with reduced toe-clearance were found when compared to those during the convex-side limb leading, suggesting an increased risk of tripping. Further studies on the kinematic strategies adopted by different types of AIS will be needed for a more complete picture of the functional adaptations in such patient group. ? 2019","adduction; adolescent; adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; ankle; Article; clinical article; controlled study; gait; human; joint mobility; kinematics; knee function; limb movement; pelvis; priority journal; standing; thoracic spine; trunk; adaptation; biomechanics; case control study; female; male; pathophysiology; scoliosis; severity of illness index; walking; Adaptation, Physiological; Adolescent; Biomechanical Phenomena; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Scoliosis; Severity of Illness Index; Walking"
"Prenatal perfluorooctanoic acid exposure is associated with early onset atopic dermatitis in 5-year-old children","2019","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common childhood skin disease and the first step of atopic march. Perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure is associated with atopic diseases, including AD. However, whether PFAS exposure is related to earlier AD onset remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between prenatal PFAS exposure and earlier onset of AD in children in a 5-year follow-up study. From 2001 to 2005, 1264 mother-infant pairs were recruited from eight Taiwanese maternity hospitals. PFAS levels were analyzed from cord blood. Information on children's health status, including AD occurrence, was obtained via phone interviews at multiple time points. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) concentrations were measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Cox proportional hazards models assessed associations between prenatal PFAS exposure and early onset AD. Overall, 863 mother–infant pairs with complete measurements were recruited. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed AD before 5 years of age was 7.1%. PFOA and PFOS concentrations were grouped based on whether they were above the 75th percentile. PFOA exposure was positively associated with earlier onset of AD (Kaplan-Meier estimate, p = 0.014). In the Cox model, after adjusting for sex, family income, parental atopy, breast feeding, and maternal age at childbirth, significance was observed in children above the upper quartile (?75th) of the PFOA group (hazard ratio: 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–3.16). Our findings suggested that children with higher prenatal PFOA exposure have a higher risk of earlier AD development. Minimizing early life PFAS exposure may help inhibit AD development. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","High performance liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Atopic dermatitis; Birth cohort; Cox proportional hazards models; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Survival curves; Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometries; Hazards; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; age structure; blood; chemical compound; child health; cohort analysis; detection method; maternal health; pollution exposure; skin; skin disorder; sulfonate; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; breast feeding; child; childbirth; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug blood level; family income; female; follow up; high risk patient; human; infant; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; male; maternal age; mother child relation; multicenter study; onset age; prenatal exposure; prospective study; reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography; sex; structured questionnaire; Taiwanese; umbilical cord blood; atopic dermatitis; chemically induced; chemistry; child health; eczema; fetus blood; high performance liquid chromatography; mother; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; Taiwan; Taiwan; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Breast Feeding; Caprylates; Child; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Dermatitis, Atopic; Eczema; Female; Fetal Blood; Fluorocarbons; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Male; Maternal Age; Mothers; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Taiwan"
"Understanding the participation in home, school, and community activities reported by children with disabilities and their parents: A pilot study","2019","Participation has significant impact on children’s health and well-being. Knowledge is limited on how children with disabilities perceive their participation and whether their perceptions differ from their parents. This pilot study aimed to explore whether self-reported frequency of participation and prioritized activities differ between children with disabilities and their parents. Thirty children with disabilities eligible for special education in elementary school and their parents were included. Each of them were interviewed with the Chinese version of Picture My Participation (PMP), separately, to identify the child’s participation frequency in 21 activities at home, school, and community, desire-to-change activities, and the level of involvement in these activities. The results indicated that children’s ratings of participation frequency were significantly lower than parents’ ratings in home activities but not in school and community activities, as analyzed by the Wilcoxon Signed Ranked test. Nineteen (63%) child–parent pairs had selected entirely different items as their desire-to-change activities. Children selected the activities that they were somewhat to very involved in; while parents selected the activities they thought their children were less involved in. Our findings suggest that children with disabilities had unique views on life and this should be supported in their health care and individualized education plans. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Successful treatment of vertical root fracture through intentional replantation and root fragment bonding with 4-META/MMA-TBB resin","2019","Background/Purpose: Vertical root fracture (VRF) is a complication in endodontically treated teeth. This study aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of treatment of 6 VRF teeth with intentional replantation and root fragment bonding with 4-methacryloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride/methyl methacrylate-tri-n-butyl borane (4-META/MMA-TBB) resin. Methods: A series of 6 complete VRF teeth (one incisor, one canine, one premolar, and 3 M) were treated through intentional replantation and root fragment bonding with 4-META/MMA-TBB resin. Results: This study included 6 VRF teeth in 6 patients (one man and 5 women; mean age, 44 ± 8 years). All 6 teeth had VRF in the bucco-lingual direction and one tooth had concomitant VRF in the mesio-distal direction. The root thickness was classified as thick in all 6 teeth. Of the 6 VRF teeth, 4 had biting, percussion, or palpation pain, 4 had gingival swelling, 3 had sinus tracts, 3 had discomfort, and one had tooth mobility. Radiographically, 5 of the 6 teeth had periradicular radiolucent lesions, 4 of which exhibited complete regression and one of which exhibited nearly complete regression after root fragment bonding therapy. Because all 6 treated teeth exhibited sound function in the oral cavity after a follow-up period ranging from 33 to 74 (mean, 50 ± 15) months, the clinical outcomes were all considered to be successful. Conclusion: For a VRF tooth, in addition to tooth extraction, intentional replantation combined with root fragment bonding with 4-META/MMA-TBB resin is a successful treatment modality that can be used to preserve a complete VRF tooth. ? 2018","4 methacryloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride; methylmethacrylate tri n butyl borane; resin; unclassified drug; 4-methacryloxyethyltrimellitic acid anhydride; boron derivative; methacrylic acid; methacrylic acid methyl ester; methylmethacrylate-tributylborane resin; resin cement; adult; Article; bite; buccolingual direction; canine tooth; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; cone beam computed tomography; female; follow up; gingivitis; human; incisor; male; mandibular first molar; mesiodistal direction; middle aged; pain; palpation; percussion; periodontal disease; premolar tooth; radiography; root fragment bonding; surgical technique; thickness; tooth disease; tooth extraction; tooth fracture; tooth replantation; treatment outcome; vertical root fracture; diagnostic imaging; endodontic procedure; injuries; procedures; surgery; tooth extraction; tooth fracture; tooth replantation; tooth root; Adult; Boron Compounds; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Female; Humans; Male; Methacrylates; Methylmethacrylates; Middle Aged; Resin Cements; Root Canal Therapy; Tooth Extraction; Tooth Fractures; Tooth Replantation; Tooth Root; Treatment Outcome"
"Occult hepatitis B virus and surface antigen mutant infection in healthy vaccinated cohorts and children with various forms of hepatitis and multiple transfusions","2019","Background and Aims: Despite the success of universal infant immunization initiated in Taiwan in 1984, occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) and circulating surface antigen mutants remain potential obstacles for eventual eradication of HBV infection. Methods: From 3299 apparently healthy, neonatally–vaccinated subjects (<30 years of age) enrolled during 2014 serosurvey, we recruited all HBsAg–positive (n?=?17), all HBsAg–negative but anti-HBc–positive (n?=?132) and randomly selected HBsAg–negative and anti-HBc–negative subjects (n?=?411). These recruited subjects and 81 HBsAg–negative children with various forms of hepatitis and multiple transfusions were analysed for serum HBV DNA. Results: In healthy, HBsAg–negative subjects, OBI frequency was higher in anti-HBc–positive than anti-HBc-negative individuals (8/90[8.9%] vs 8/301[2.7%], P?=?0.0192) aged <18-years, but was not different between anti-HBc–positive and anti-HBc–negative individuals (0/11[0%] vs 3/110[2.7%], P?>?0.05) aged 18 to 30 years. OBI occurred more frequently in children of HBsAg–positive mothers than in children of HBsAg–negative mothers (10/101 [9.9%] vs 1/75 [1.3%], P?=?0.025). The prevalence of surface ‘a’ determinant (aa110-160) mutants was 13.3% (2/15) in OBI subjects compared to 36.4% (4/11) in HBsAg–positive subjects (P?>?0.05). OBI was found in 30% (3/10) of serologic ‘non-A to E’ viral hepatitis, 14.3% (3/21) of chronic hepatitis C and 2.0% (1/50) of multitransfused, thalassemic children. Conclusions: In this highly immunized population, surface antigen mutant infection is uncommon and has low contribution to OBI development. HBsAg screening plus highly sensitive HBV DNA assays are needed for assurance of blood supply safety. Multiple transfusions from HBsAg–negative blood donors rarely result in persistent HBV infection. HBV might be related to some of serologic ‘non-A to E’ viral hepatitis. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Association between urine lead levels and cardiovascular disease risk factors, carotid intima-media thickness and metabolic syndrome in adolescents and young adults","2020","Background: Environmental lead exposure is a known risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in animal and human epidemiological studies of adults, but limited research has been conducted in young populations. Moreover, the association between lead level and common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) has never been documented. Design: and Participants: In this study, 738 subjects were recruited from a cohort of Taiwanese adolescents and young adults to study the relationship between lead levels in urine and CVD risk factors, metabolic syndrome (MS) and CIMT. Results: The geometric mean of the urine lead level was 1.50 μg/g creatinine. We found a significant positive association between urine lead levels and CVD risk factors, including diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), as well as markers of glucose homeostasis, such as serum glucose, serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β), body mass index (BMI) z score, and CIMT. Overall, increased urine lead concentrations were positively correlated with the prevalence of MS, specifically the criteria of waist/BMI and serum HDL-C. The relationship between urine lead levels and CIMT remained unchanged in all subgroups. Conclusion: In this study, we found that increased urinary levels of lead were positively associated with CVD risk factors, CIMT, and MS in this cohort. Future research to explore the pathogenic basis of exposure to lead and risk of CVDs and their risk factors are warranted. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH",""
"Impact of universal drug susceptibility testing and effective management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Taiwan","2019","Background The treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients in the 1990s in Taiwan was not satisfactory. To strengthen programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (PMDT), Taiwan MDR-TB Consortium (TMTC) was established in 2007. We assess the performance and epidemiologic impact of TMTC. Methodology/Principle findings We analyzed the trends of proportion of TB cases with drug susceptibility testing, enrollment of MDR-TB patients into TMTC and outcomes of treatment of all MDR-TB patients in Taiwan from 2007–2016. We computed the trends of both incidence and prevalence of MDR-TB from 2007–2016. We assessed the trends of MDR-TB among both new and recurrent TB cases. The proportion of TB cases with drug susceptibility testing results increased from 24.2% in 2007 to 97.9% in 2016. Of the 1,452 MDR-TB patients who were eligible for TMTC care, 1,197 (82.4%) were enrolled in TMTC, in whom 82.9% had treatment success. MDRTB incidence was 9.0 cases per million in 2007, which declined to 4.6 cases per million in 2016 (p<0.0001). MDR-TB prevalence decreased from 19.4 cases per million in 2007 to 8.4 cases per million in 2016 (p<0.0001). The proportion of MDR-TB among new TB cases decreased from 1.4% in 2010 to 1.0% in 2016 (p = 0.039); and that among recurrent TB cases from 9.0% in 2010 to 1.8% in 2016 (p<0.0001). Conclusions We concluded that effective PMDT have had a significant impact on the epidemic of drug-resistant TB in Taiwan. ? 2019 Lee et al.

"Complication rates after chorionic villus sampling and midtrimester amniocentesis: A 7-year national registry study","2019","Purpose: To assess the complication rates following chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and midtrimester amniocentesis in Taiwan. Methods: This is a national registry-based cohort study from Taiwan. We included all women with singleton pregnancies who received either CVS (n = 1409) or midtrimester amniocentesis (n = 250,566) during 2006–2012. We assessed preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), infection and spontaneous abortion (SA) that occurred within fourteen days after the procedures. We also assessed the risks of preterm delivery and miscarriage before 24 gestational weeks after amniocentesis. These complications were collected from the Genetic Disease Database of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan National Birth Certificate Registry, and the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. Pearson χ2 tests were used to compare the distributions between groups. Results: For patients who underwent midtrimester amniocentesis, the rates of PPROM, IUFD, infection and SA within fourteen days were 0.24%, 0.11%, 0.05%, and 0.05%, respectively. Women with a normal fetal karyotype had a preterm birth rate (&lt;37 gestational weeks) of 9.38%. The miscarriage rate (&lt;24 gestational weeks) was 0.68%, which was 0.22% higher than those who did not receive the invasive procedures (p &lt; 0.0001). After CVS, the IUFD rate was 1.68%, and the SA rate within fourteen days was 0.77%. Conclusion: The use of our large cohort demonstrated that the procedure-related complication rates were comparable to recent review or meta-analysis. This dataset might facilitate counselling in women who consider invasive genetic diagnostic procedures. ? 2019","adult; amniocentesis; Article; chorion villus sampling; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; fetus death; gestational age; hemophilia; human; iatrogenic disease; infection; invasive procedure; karyotype; low birth weight; major clinical study; maternal age; population research; pregnant woman; premature fetus membrane rupture; premature labor; prenatal diagnosis; second trimester pregnancy; spinal muscular atrophy; spontaneous abortion; Taiwan; thalassemia; treatment indication; adverse event; amniocentesis; chorion villus sampling; labor complication; pregnancy; premature fetus membrane rupture; prematurity; register; risk factor; second trimester pregnancy; spontaneous abortion; Abortion, Spontaneous; Adult; Amniocentesis; Chorionic Villi Sampling; Female; Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture; Gestational Age; Humans; Obstetric Labor Complications; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Premature Birth; Registries; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Who Gets Protection? A National Study of Multiple Victimization and Child Protection Among Taiwanese Children","2019","This study aims to examine the prevalence of multiple types of child victimization and the effects of multiple types of victimization on children’s mental health and behavior in Taiwan. The study also examines the child-protection rate and its correlates among children experiencing various types of victimization. This study collected data with a self-report questionnaire from a national proportionately stratified sample of 6,233 fourth-grade students covering every city and county in Taiwan in 2014. After calculating the 1-year prevalence of child victimization, the study found that bullying was the most prevalent (71%), followed by physical neglect (66%), psychological violence (43%), inter-parental violence (28%), community violence (22%), physical abuse (21%), and sexual violence (9%). As the number of victimization types increased, children were more likely to report greater posttraumatic symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, suicide ideation, self-harm thoughts, and violent behaviors. Gender, neonatal status, parental marital status, and other family risks were significantly associated with elevated incidences of the victimization types. Only 20.6% of the children who had experienced all seven types of victimization had received child protective services. A child was more likely to receive child protective services if he or she had experienced sexual violence, community violence, inter-parental violence exposure, higher family risks, higher suicidal ideation, or living in a single-parent or separated family. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the cumulative effects and the harmful effects that children’s experience of multiple types of victimization can have on the children’s mental health and behavior. The present findings also raise alarms regarding the severity of under-serving in child-victimization cases. These results underscore the importance of assessing, identifying, and helping children with multiple victimization experiences. ? The Author(s) 2016.",""
"AnamiR: Integrated analysis of MicroRNA and gene expression profiling","2019","Background: With advancements in high-throughput technologies, the cost of obtaining expression profiles of both mRNA and microRNA in the same individual has substantially decreased. Integrated analysis of these profiles can help to elucidate the functional effects of RNA expression in complex diseases, such as cancer. However, fundamental discrepancies are observed in the results from microRNA-mRNA target gene prediction algorithms, and few packages can be used to analyze microRNA and mRNA expression levels simultaneously. Results: To address these issues, an R package, anamiR, was developed. A total of 10 experimental/prediction databases were integrated. Two analytical functions are provided in anamiR, including the single marker test and functional gene set enrichment analysis, and several parameters can be changed by users. Here we demonstrate the potential application of the anamiR package to 2 publicly available microarray datasets. Conclusion: The anamiR package is effective for an integrated analysis of both RNA and microRNA profiles. By characterizing biological functions and signaling pathways, this package helps identify dysregulated genes/miRNAs from biological and medical experiments.

"ROS- and HIF1α-dependent IGFBP3 upregulation blocks IGF1 survival signaling and thereby mediates high-glucose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis","2019","The prevalence of chronic hyperglycemia and its complications, imposing a critical burden on the worldwide economy and the global healthcare system, is a pressing issue. Mounting evidence indicates that oxidative stress and hypoxia, two noticeable features of hyperglycemia, play a joint crucial role in mediating cellular apoptosis. However, the underlying detailed molecular mechanism remains elusive. Triggered by the observation that insulin-like growth factor (IGF1)-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) can mediate, in renal cells, high-glucose-induced apoptosis by elevating oxidative stress, we wish to, in this study, know whether or not the similar scenario holds in cardiac cells and, if so, to find its relevant molecular key players, thereby dissecting the underlying molecular pathway. Specifically, we used a combination of three different cellular sources (H9c2 cells, diabetic rats, and neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes) as our model systems of study. We made use of Co-IP assay and western blot analysis in conjunction with loss-of-function reasoning, gain-of-function logic, and inhibitor treatment as our main analytical tools. As a result, briefly, our main findings are that hyperglycemia can induce cardiac IGFBP3 overexpression and secretion, that high levels of IGFBP3 can sequester IGF1 from IGF1 survival pathway, leading to apoptosis, and that IGFBP3 gene upregulation is hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1α-dependent and reactive oxygen species dependent. Piecing these findings together allows us to propose the improved molecular regulatory mechanism. In conclusion, we have established the molecular roles of IGFBP3, HIF1, and prolyl hydroxylase domain in connecting oxidative stress with hypoxia and in cellular apoptosis under hyperglycemia. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","glucose; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; reactive oxygen metabolite; somatomedin binding protein 3; somatomedin C; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; cancer survival; cardiac muscle cell; controlled study; gain of function mutation; gene overexpression; H9c2(2-1) cell line; hyperglycemia; loss of function mutation; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; protein secretion; rat; signal transduction; upregulation; Western blotting"
"Synergic effect between high temperature and air pollution on mortality in Northeast Asia","2019","High temperature and air pollutants have been reported as potential risk factors of mortality. Previous studies investigated interaction between the two variables; however, the excess death risk due to the synergic effect (i.e. interaction on the additive scale) between the two variables has not been investigated adequately on a multi-country scale. This study aimed to assess the excess death risk due to the synergism between high temperature and air pollution on mortality using a multicity time-series analysis. We collected time-series data on mortality, weather variables, and four air pollutants (PM10, O3, NO2, and CO) for 16 metropolitan cities of three countries (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) in Northeast Asia (1979–2015). Quasi-Poisson time-series regression and meta-analysis were used to estimate the additive interaction between high temperature and air pollution. The additive interaction was measured by relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) index. We calculated RERI with relative risks (RR) of the 99th/10th, 90th/90th, and 99th/90th percentiles of temperature/air pollution metrics, where risk at the 90th/10th percentiles of temperature/air pollution metrics was the reference category. This study showed that there may exist positive and significant excess death risks due to the synergism between high temperature and air pollution in the total population for all pollutants (95% lower confidence intervals of all RERIs&gt;0 or near 0). In final, we measured quantitatively the excess death risks due to synergic effect between high temperature and air pollution, and the synergism should be considered in public health interventions and a composite warning system. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","carbon dioxide; nitric oxide; additive; atmospheric pollution; climate effect; composite; health risk; high temperature; meta-analysis; metropolitan area; mortality; public health; synergism; time series analysis; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; concentration (parameter); high temperature; human; Japan; Korea; major clinical study; mortality; mortality risk; particulate matter; priority journal; Taiwan; time series analysis; Japan; Korea; Northeast Asia; Taiwan"
"Identification of TMAO-producer phenotype and host-diet-gut dysbiosis by carnitine challenge test in human and germ-free mice","2019","Objective The gut microbiota-derived metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) plays an important role in cardiovascular disease (CVD). The fasting plasma TMAO was shown as a prognostic indicator of CVD incident in patients and raised the interest of intervention targeting gut microbiota. Here we develop a clinically applicable method called oral carnitine challenge test (OCCT) for TMAO-related therapeutic drug efforts assessment and personalising dietary guidance. Design A pharmacokinetic study was performed to verify the design of OCCT protocol. The OCCT was conducted in 23 vegetarians and 34 omnivores to validate gut microbiota TMAO production capacity. The OCCT survey was integrated with gut microbiome, host genotypes, dietary records and serum biochemistry. A humanised gnotobiotic mice study was performed for translational validation. Results The OCCT showed better efficacy than fasting plasma TMAO to identify TMAO producer phenotype. The omnivores exhibited a 10-fold higher OR to be high TMAO producer than vegetarians. The TMAO-associated taxa found by OCCT in this study were consistent with previous animal studies. The TMAO producer phenotypes were also reproduced in humanised gnotobiotic mice model. Besides, we found the faecal CntA gene was not associated with TMAO production; therefore, other key relevant microbial genes might be involved. Finally, we demonstrated the urine TMAO exhibited a strong positive correlation with plasma TMAO (r=0.92, p<0.0001) and improved the feasibility of OCCT. Conclusion The OCCT can be used to identify TMAO-producer phenotype of gut microbiota and may serve as a personal guidance in CVD prevention and treatment.

"Afatinib is effective in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma with uncommon EGFR p.L747P and p.L747S mutations","2019","Objectives: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)are used as first-line standard treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma with mutant EGFR. Nevertheless, few studies have demonstrated the efficacy of first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs in patients harboring the uncommon p.L747P and p.L747S mutations in exon 19 of EGFR. Materials and methods: From 2005–2018, we identified patients with lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR p.L747P or p.L747S mutations using DNA and cDNA sequencing or commercial kits and recorded their clinical data. Published data pertaining to these mutations were also reviewed. Results: Twelve eligible patients were enrolled at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), and ten additional patients were identified in published literature. In NTUH cohort, the direct DNA sequencing had a 60.0% (3 of 5 patients)false-negative rate, and use of commercial kits all caused misidentification of EGFR p.L747P or p.L747S. Of the 7 patients receiving EGFR TKI treatment, five stage-IV lung adenocarcinoma patients that received afatinib had a 80.0% objective response rate (ORR), while two patients administered gefitinib or erlotinib showed a 0% ORR. The median progression-free survival (PFS)rates were 11.97 and 0.92 months (P = 0.012)for afatinib and gefitinib/erlotinib, respectively. No patients (0%)acquired p.T790 M resistance after failure of afatinib (n = 3). Of 10 patients harboring EGFR p.L747P from published literature, six patients used first-generation EGFR TKIs as treatment also showed 0% ORR and 1.00 month median PFS. Conclusions: Patients with the uncommon EGFR mutations p.L747P and p.L747S could be incorrectly classified as having wild-type EGFR or a 19DEL when using direct DNA sequencing or commercial kits. Moreover, use of afatinib may provide significantly improved PFS in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with one of these two EGFR mutations. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","afatinib; complementary DNA; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; gefitinib; leucine; proline; serine; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer resistance; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical article; cohort analysis; DNA sequence; drug efficacy; drug response; EGFR gene; female; gene mutation; human; human tissue; lack of drug effect; lung adenocarcinoma; male; middle aged; priority journal; progression free survival; treatment planning; trend study; very elderly"

"Immunogenicity, safety, cross-reaction, and immune persistence of an inactivated enterovirus A71 vaccine in children aged from two months to 11 years in Taiwan","2019","Background: To fight against enterovirus A71 (EV-A71)-associated diseases, vaccine development was initiated in Taiwan focusing on two-month-old infants. Methods: We conducted a phase II, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study on infants and children aged two months to 11 years. This study was conducted in 4 parts (2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d) with age de-escalation sequentially. Two doses were administered with a 28-day or 56-day interval. Participants aged two months to <two years received a booster dose at one year after the first dose. During the surveillance period, solicited adverse events (AEs) and unsolicited AEs were recorded for safety evaluation. Blood samples were collected for neutralising antibody assay at various times. Immune persistence and booster effects were also assessed. Results: A total of 363 children completed the study. Most AEs were mild and unrelated to treatment. No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) of serum neutralising antibody titres increased profoundly. Most participants in the vaccine groups achieved defined seroprotection (neutralization titre ? 1:32) after the second vaccination and persisted for two years. Furthermore, the EV-A71 vaccine could provide a cross-reaction against other EV-A71 strain genotypes: B5, C4a, C4b, and C5. Conclusions: The mid dose of the EV-A71 vaccine elicited high immune response and were tolerable in participants aged between two months and 11 years in all dosing groups. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","enterovirus A71 vaccine; neutralizing antibody; placebo; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; antibody titer; arthralgia; Article; child; controlled study; cross reaction; diarrhea; double blind procedure; drug dose escalation; drug megadose; drug safety; drug tolerability; ecchymosis; Enterovirus A71; fatigue; fever; headache; human; immunogenicity; infant; loss of appetite; low drug dose; myalgia; nausea and vomiting; pain; phase 2 clinical trial; preschool child; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; seroconversion; shivering; side effect; single drug dose; swelling; Taiwan"
"Metformin was associated with lower all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes with acute coronary syndrome: A Nationwide registry with propensity score-matched analysis","2019","Background: No randomized controlled trials evaluating metformin therapy efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have been reported. We aimed to examine the mortality benefit of metformin therapy in patients with type 2 DM and ACS, compared with non-metformin anti-diabetes agents users. Methods: Data were extracted from the prospective nationwide ACS-DM Taiwan Society of Cardiology registry. Propensity score (PS) matching on baseline characteristics and treatment measures was performed for metformin versus non-metformin users. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare mortality outcomes among the PS-matched cohort as the primary analysis. The Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for all pre-determined covariates and quintiles of the PS among the overall population were performed as the secondary analyses. Results: Of 1157 patients with type 2 DM and ACS receiving anti-diabetes agents, 78 patients (6.7%) died over the 2-year follow-up period. After PS matching, 318 metformin users were matched with 318 non-metformin users. Metformin users had a lower all-cause mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26–0.95) in the primary analysis. The survival benefit of metformin therapy was consistent in the secondary analyses (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17–0.54 while adjusting for all pre-determined covariates, and aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19–0.59 while adjusting for quintiles of the PS). Conclusions: Among patients with type 2 DM and ACS, metformin was associated with lower all-cause mortality. However, a detrimental effect of any of the comparators could not be excluded. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","angiotensin receptor antagonist; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; inotropic agent; insulin; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; acute coronary syndrome; adult; all cause mortality; Article; cardiology; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease registry; drug efficacy; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; medical society; monotherapy; mortality; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; priority journal; propensity score; Taiwan; treatment response"
"Physician workload associated with do-not-resuscitate decision-making in intensive care units: An observational study using Cox proportional hazards analysis","2019","Background: Physicians play a substantial role in facilitating communication regarding life-supporting treatment decision-making including do-not-resuscitate (DNR) in the intensive care units (ICU). Physician-related factors including gender, personal preferences to life-supporting treatment, and specialty have been found to affect the timing and selection of life-supporting treatment decision-making. This study aimed to examine the influence of physician workload on signing a DNR order in the ICUs. Methods: This is retrospective observational study. The medical records of patients, admitted to the surgical ICUs for the first time between June 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013, were reviewed. We used a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to examine the influence of the physician's workload on his/her writing a DNR order by adjusting for multiple factors. We then used Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank test to compare the time from ICU admission to DNR orders written for patients for two groups of physicians based on the average number of patients each physician cared for per day during data collection period. Results: The hazard of writing a DNR order by the attending physicians who cared for more than one patient per day significantly decreased by 41% as compared to the hazard of writing a DNR order by those caring for fewer than one patient (hazard ratio = 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 - 0.89, P =.01). In addition, the factors associated with writing a DNR order as determined by the Cox model were non-operative, cardiac failure/insufficiency diagnosis (hazard ratio = 1.71, 95% CI 1.00 - 2.91, P =.05) and the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System score (hazard ratio = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.03, P =.03). Physicians who cared for more than one patient per day were less likely to write a DNR order for their patients than those who cared for in average fewer than one patient per day (log-rank chi-square = 5.72, P =.02). Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need to take multidisciplinary actions for physicians with heavy workloads. Changes in the work environmental factors along with stress management programs to improve physicians' psychological well-being as well as the quality. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aged; clinical decision making; female; health personnel attitude; human; intensive care unit; male; middle aged; physician; physician attitude; proportional hazards model; psychology; resuscitation; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; workload; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Decision-Making; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Physician's Role; Physicians; Proportional Hazards Models; Resuscitation Orders; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Workload"
"Enterovirus A71 neurologic complications and long-term sequelae","2019","During recent 20 years, enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) has emerged as a major concern among pediatric infectious diseases, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The clinical manifestations of EV-A71 include uncomplicated hand, foot, and mouth disease, herpanina or febrile illness and central nervous system (CNS) involvement such as aseptic meningitis, myoclonic jerk, polio-like syndrome, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis and cardiopulmonary failure due to severe rhombencephalitis. In follow-up studies of patients with EV-A 71 CNS infection, some still have hypoventilation and need tracheostomy with ventilator support, some have dysphagia and need nasogastric tube or gastrostomy feeding, some have limb weakness/astrophy, cerebellar dysfunction, neurodevelopmental delay, lower cognition, or attention deficiency hyperactivity disorder. Long term sequelae may be related to greater severity of CNS involvement or neuron damage, hypoxia and younger age of onset. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; aseptic meningitis; attention deficit disorder; autonomic neuropathy; central nervous system disease; disease severity; dysphagia; encephalitis; encephalomyelitis; Enterovirus A71; Enterovirus infection; fever; gastrostomy; hand foot and mouth disease; heart failure; herpangina; human; hypoventilation; hypoxia; limb weakness; mental disease; myoclonus; neurological complication; onset age; pleocytosis; poliomyelitis; priority journal; respiratory failure; tendon reflex; tracheostomy; complication; Enterovirus A; neurologic disease; physiology; virology; Enterovirus A, Human; Enterovirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases"
"Recombinant aflatoxin-degrading f420h2-dependent reductase from mycobacterium smegmatis protects mammalian cells from aflatoxin toxicity","2019","Aflatoxins are carcinogenic secondary metabolites of fungi that contaminate many staple crops and foods. Aflatoxin contamination is a worldwide problem, especially in developing countries, posing health hazards, e.g., causing aflatoxicosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and even death. Biological solutions for aflatoxin detoxification are environmentally friendly and a cheaper alternative than chemical methods. The aims of the current study were to investigate: (1) the ability of MSMEG_5998, an aflatoxin-degrading F420H2-dependent reductase from Mycobacterium smegmatis, to degrade aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and reduce AFB1-caused damage in HepG2 cell culture model; and (2) whether a thioredoxin (Trx) linkage of MSMEG_5998 enhanced the enzyme activity. We show that Trx-linked MSMEG_5998 degraded 63% AFB1 and native MSMEG_5998 degraded 31% after 4 h at 22 °C, indicating that the Trx-linked enzyme had a better AFB1-degrading ability. In a HepG2 cell culture model, Trx-linked MSMEG_5998 reduced DNA damage and p53-mediated apoptosis caused by AFB1 to a greater extent than the native enzyme. These findings suggest that Trx-linked MSMEG_5998 could potentially be developed to protect the liver from AFB1 damage, or as a candidate protein to reduce AFB1-related toxicity in animals. ? 2019 by the authors.","4',6 diamidino 2 phenylindole; aflatoxin; aflatoxin B1; beta actin; biological marker; checkpoint kinase 2; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; histone H2AX; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; polyclonal antibody; progesterone receptor; protective agent; protein; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; protein p53; recombinant aflatoxin; thioredoxin; unclassified drug; aflatoxicosis; apoptosis; Article; carcinogenic activity; cell viability assay; chromatography; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA damage; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Escherichia coli; Hep-G2 cell line; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; immunocytochemistry; immunoprecipitation; liver cell carcinoma; mammal cell; molecular weight; MTT assay; Mycobacterium smegmatis; plasmid; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein expression; protein purification; toxicity; Western blotting"
"Reduction of lipid contamination in MR spectroscopy imaging using signal space projection","2019","Purpose: Lipid contamination can complicate the metabolite quantification in MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). In addition to various experimental methods demonstrated to be feasible for lipid suppression, the postprocessing method is beneficial in the flexibility of applications. In this study, the signal space projection (SSP) algorithm is proposed to suppress the lipid signal in the MRSI. Methods: The performance of lipid suppression using SSP and SSP combined with the Papoulis-Gerchberg (PG) algorithm (PG+SSP) is examined in 2D MRSI data and the results were compared with outer volume saturation (OVS) methods. Up to 10 lipid spatial components were extracted by SSP from lipid signals in the range of 0.8~1.5 ppm. Results: Our results show that most lipid signals were found in the first 4 to 5 components and that lipid signals on the spectra can be suppressed using 4 to 5 components. Metabolites concentrations were quantified using LCModel. Two regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected on the peripheral and inner brain regions. The quantification of metabolites in terms of fitting reliability (CRLB) and spatial variations within ROIs (SpaVar) is improved using SSP. When 5 to 6 components were used in SSP and PG+SSP, the metabolite concentrations and the associated SpaVar and CRLB are at the same level as those from the OVS. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the SSP method can be used to suppress the lipid signals of MRSI and SSP with 5 to 6 components is suggested to have a similar suppression performance as the OVS method. ? 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","lipid; algorithm; Article; comparative study; contamination; controlled study; human; image analysis; image processing; mathematical computing; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Papoulis Gerchberg algorithm; performance; radiological parameters; signal noise ratio; signal space projection algorithm; voxel based morphometry"
"Significant effects of exposure to relatively low level ozone on daily mortality in 17 cities from three Eastern Asian Countries","2019","Background: Studies have examined the variation in mortality risk associated with ambient ozone. We conducted an international cooperation study for investigating the non-linear ozone–mortality association accounting for lag effect and for examining the ozone level with significant health effect. Methods: Daily counts of total non-accidental death and ambient air pollutant concentration were obtained in 17 cities from 3 Eastern Asian countries or regions (Taiwan, Korea, and Japan). The total study period was from 1979 to 2010 and differed by city based on data availability. The ozone–mortality association in each city was estimated by running a time-series quasi-Poisson regression model, allowing for overdispersion. The city-specific estimates were then pooled by country by using multivariate random effects meta-analysis. Results: The non-linear ozone exposure–mortality response curves were generated in 17 cities from Taiwan, Korea, and Japan. The association curves in the three countries all showed increased mortality with elevated ozone, and the significant mortality effects of ozone exposure were observed at level higher than 40, 50, and 40 ppb for Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, respectively. These associations are unaffected by co-pollutant of particulate matter in Taiwan and Japan. But the potential confounding effect of co-pollutant could not be ignorable in Korea. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that exposure to a relative low level of ambient ozone is associated with an increased risk of mortality. Our results emphasize the continual need to examine the existing standard by documenting potential human adverse effects. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","ozone; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; international cooperation; meta-analysis; mortality risk; multivariate analysis; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant; pollution exposure; public health; regression analysis; urban area; air pollutant; Article; atmospheric dispersion; city; environmental exposure; human; Japan; meteorological phenomena; mortality; mortality risk; particle size; particulate matter; risk assessment; South Korea; suspended particulate matter; Taiwan; time series analysis; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; Asia; city; environmental exposure; meta analysis; toxicity; Japan; Korea; Taiwan; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Japan; Mortality; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Republic of Korea; Taiwan"
"Analytical methods for cholesterol quantification","2019","Cholesterol is an important lipid molecule in cell membranes and lipoproteins. Cholesterol is also a precursors of steroid hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D. Abnormal levels of cholesterol or its precursors have been observed in various human diseases, such as heart diseases, stroke, type II diabetes, brain diseases and many others. Therefore, accurate quantification of cholesterol is important for individuals who are at increased risk for these diseases. Multiple analytical methods have been developed for analysis of cholesterol, including classical chemical methods, enzymatic assays, gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), and mass spectrometry (MS). Strategy known as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), operating at atmospheric pressure, with only minimal sample pretreatments for real time, in situ, and rapid interrogation of the sample has also been employed for quantification of cholesterol. In this review, we summarize the most prevalent methods for cholesterol quantification in biological samples and foods. Nevertheless, we highlight several new technologies, such as AIMS, used as alternative methods to measure cholesterol that are potentially next-generation platforms. Representative examples of molecular imaging of cholesterol in tissue sections are also included in this review article. ? 2018","cholesterol; ambient ionization mass spectrometry; analytic method; cholesterol blood level; desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; electrospray mass spectrometry; enzymatic assay; gas liquid chromatography; human; lipid analysis; mass spectrometry; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; nonhuman; nutritional science; quantitative analysis; real time mass spectrometry; Review; tandem mass spectrometry; tissue section"
"Prediction of annual dengue incidence by hydro-climatic extremes for southern Taiwan","2019","Dengue is one of the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world. An increase in the incidence of dengue is commonly thought to be a consequence of variability of weather conditions. Taiwan, which straddles the Tropic of Cancer, is an excellent place to study the relationship between weather conditions and dengue fever cases since the island forms an isolated geographic environment. Therefore, clarifying the association between extreme weather conditions and annual dengue incidence is one of important issues for epidemic early warning. In this paper, we develop a Poisson regression model with extreme weather parameters for prediction of annual dengue incidence. A leave-one-out method is used to evaluate the performance of predicting dengue incidence. Our results indicate that dengue transmission has a positive relationship with the minimum temperature predictors during the early summer while a negative relationship with all the maximum 24-h rainfall predictors during the early epidemic phase of dengue outbreaks. Our findings provide a better understanding of the relationships between extreme weather and annual trends in dengue cases in Taiwan and it could have important implications for dengue forecasts in surrounding areas with similar meteorological conditions. ? 2019, ISB.","climate; dengue; forecasting; human; incidence; Poisson distribution; regression analysis; statistical model; Taiwan; weather; Climate; Dengue; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Models, Statistical; Poisson Distribution; Regression Analysis; Taiwan; Weather"
"TARBP2-enhanced resistance during tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer","2019","Tamoxifen is the most widely used hormone therapy in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 70% of all breast cancers. Although patients who receive tamoxifen therapy benefit with respect to an improved overall prognosis, resistance and cancer recurrence still occur and remain important clinical challenges. A recent study identified TAR (HIV-1) RNA binding protein 2 (TARBP2) as an oncogene that promotes breast cancer metastasis. In this study, we showed that TARBP2 is overexpressed in hormone therapy-resistant cells and breast cancer tissues, where it enhances tamoxifen resistance. Tamoxifen-induced TARBP2 expression results in the desensitization of ER+ breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, tamoxifen post-transcriptionally stabilizes TARBP2 protein through the downregulation of Merlin, a TARBP2-interacting protein known to enhance its proteasomal degradation. Tamoxifen-induced TARBP2 further stabilizes SOX2 protein to enhance desensitization of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen, while similar to TARBP2, its induction in cancer cells was also observed in metastatic tumor cells. Our results indicate that the TARBP2-SOX2 pathway is upregulated by tamoxifen-mediated Merlin downregulation, which subsequently induces tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The application of p2PSA% and prostate health index in prostate cancer detection: A prospective cohort in a Tertiary Medical Center","2019","Background/Purpose: Prostate specific antigen (PSA) with low specificity that causes unnecessary prostate biopsies increases clinical morbidities, psychological stress, and medical expenses. We aimed to test the accuracy and cutoff value of Prostate Health Index (PHI) in men for prostate cancer detection. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 213 men who underwent prostate biopsy with PSA≦10 ng/ml or abnormal findings on digital rectal examination. Total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA) and p2PSA levels were measured by serum samples before prostate biopsy. PHI was calculated as (p2PSA/fPSA) × √tPSA. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to predict the risk of cancer and detect clinically significant prostate cancer. Results: 33 (27.0%) patients were confirmed with the diagnoses of prostate cancer by prostate biopsy. The levels of p2PSA, %p2PSA, and PHI showed statistically significant differences between prostate cancer patients and non-cancer patients. %p2PSA and PHI had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.723 and 0.772 (both p < 0.001), respectively, predicting cancer detection at biopsy than other predictors (tPSA, fPSA, %fPSA, and PSA density (AUC: 0.544, 0.538, 0.593, and 0.664, respectively). In multivariable logistic regression, %p2PSA had a statistical significant odds ratio 8.51 (p = 0.003) and PHI had an odds ratio with marginal significance 4.18 (p = 0.06). Conclusion: %p2PSA and PHI increased the diagnostic accuracy with significantly greater sensitivity and specificity than tPSA. We determined an optimal cut-off value of PHI among Taiwanese population. These findings support the usefulness in the decisional process of prostate biopsy. ? 2018","prostate specific antigen; prostate specific antigen; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; digital rectal examination; Gleason score; human; human tissue; image guided biopsy; major clinical study; male; oncological parameters; predictive value; prospective study; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; Prostate Health Index; prostate volume; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; tertiary health care; transrectal ultrasonography; biopsy; blood; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathology; prostate; prostate tumor; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Biopsy; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Prostate; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; ROC Curve; Taiwan"
"The effects of lighting problems on eye symptoms among cleanroom microscope workers","2019","The visual health of microscope workers is an important occupational health concern, and a previous study suggested an association between lighting problems (e.g., flashing light, insufficient lighting) and eye symptoms among cleanroom workers in the electronics industry. This study aimed to explore the association between eye symptoms and lighting problems, as well as light-related counteracting behaviors among microscope workers in the cleanroom environment. Ninety-one cleanroom workers aged 20 years or older were recruited from an electronics factory. The socio-demographic factors, work-related factors, eye symptoms, and lighting problems were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. There were 92.3% female participants in this study. Among all participants, 41.8% and 63.7% had symptoms of dry eye and eye fatigue, respectively. The counteracting behaviors of needing to move closer (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.47, 95% CI = 1.11 to 10.88) was significantly associated with dry eye symptoms. Workers who were more experienced at the job (aOR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.06) and had shorter break times (aOR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91 to 0.98) were more likely to have eye fatigue. As a result of these findings, this study suggests that good lighting and adequate break times are crucial to improve the visual health of cleanroom microscope workers. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The Differences in Clinicopathologic and Prognostic Characteristics Between Surgically Resected Peripheral and Central Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma","2019","Background: Pulmonary peripheral-type squamous cell carcinoma (p-SqCC) has been increasing in incidence. However, little is known about the clinicopathologic features of p-SqCC. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics and clinical outcomes of p-SqCC compared with central-type SqCC (c-SqCC) in a large cohort of surgically resected lung SqCC patients with long-term follow-up results. Methods: The study included 268 patients with SqCC who underwent surgical resection at the authors’ institute from January 1990 to September 2013. The mean follow-up period was 67.1?months. The clinicopathologic and genetic characteristics were investigated in relation to their association with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) based on tumor location. Results: The study cohort included 120 patients with p-SqCC and 148 patients with c-SqCC. Compared with c-SqCC, p-SqCC was correlated with older age (p = 0.002), female sex (p = 0.033), better performance status (p < 0.001), smaller tumor (p = 0.004), less lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), and an earlier pathologic stage (p < 0.001). Despite the clinicopathologic differences, tumor location was not significantly correlated with clinical outcomes. For the p-SqCC patients, the multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation of lymphovascular invasion (PFS, p < 0.001; OS, p < 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.007; OS, p = 0.022) with poor PFS and OS, but a significant correlation of incomplete tumor resection (PFS, p = 0.009) only with poor PFS. Conclusions: The clinicopathologic features differed between the p-SqCC and c-SqCC patients. Lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors of p-SqCC. These prognostic factors may be potentially used as indicators for adjuvant therapies to be used with patients who have p-SqCC. ? 2018, Society of Surgical Oncology.","adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; central-type squamous cell carcinoma; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; disease association; female; follow up; human; long term care; lung lobectomy; lung resection; lymph node dissection; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overall survival; physical examination; positron emission tomography; progression free survival; pulmonary peripheral type squamous carcinoma; squamous cell lung carcinoma; surgical margin; surgical oncology; surgical risk; thorax radiography; tumor recurrence; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; cohort analysis; lung surgery; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; prognosis; squamous cell carcinoma; survival rate; tumor invasion; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Prognosis; Pulmonary Surgical Procedures; Survival Rate"
"Uncertainty analysis of remediation cost and damaged land value for brownfield investment","2019","Flexible land management that allows risk-based remediation approaches can increase local financial assistance in brownfield development investments. The evaluation of brownfields investment has always been mired in uncertainty because of the complexity of contamination and land policy. To clarify the uncertainty in investment costs resulting from a flexible risk-based land management, this research analyzes the uncertainty of remediation costs (Ir) and damaged land value (Ip). Sizable statistical data for 30,000 abandoned factories in Taiwan are used to derive the uncertainty of investment cost. The results show that the range and value of the uncertainty of Ip is more than Ir because the present land value and the change in flexible land management are the main sensitivity factors. The saved investment costs at the 90% confidence interval ranges five orders of magnitude. Moreover, investors could have saved approximately 5.74E+13 USD resulting from Ip and Ir. The study's two major findings with regard to investment risk in brownfield redevelopment are: (1) an explanation of the extent to which investment costs are to be reduced for investors by adjusting remediation goals depending on different land types; (2) characterization of the uncertainty of brownfields in the real investment market for brownfield redevelopment. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Land use; Remediation; Risk assessment; Risk management; Uncertainty analysis; Brownfield development; Brownfield redevelopment; Financial assistance; Land managements; Real investments; Risk-based land managements; Risk-based remediation; Uncertainty; Investments; abandoned land; brownfield site; capital flow; cost analysis; investment incentive; land management; redevelopment; risk assessment; soil remediation; uncertainty analysis; agricultural land; Article; contamination; cost; environmental policy; evaluation study; health hazard; investment; land use; manufacturing industry; Monte Carlo method; motivation; real estate; remediation cost; risk; skin absorption; cost benefit analysis; economics; ecosystem restoration; environmental protection; human; risk assessment; risk management; Taiwan; uncertainty; Taiwan; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Humans; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Taiwan; Uncertainty"
"Exploring the requirements of home medical carers and carees for a technological information platform","2019","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore the requirements of home medical carers and carees for a technological information platform. Methods: This was a qualitative study. The research participants, recruited through purposive sampling, were individuals with experience of home medical services, including doctors, nurses, and users and potential users of long-term care services. Content analysis was used to analyze the text. Results: Four themes emerged regarding the requirements that a technological information platform should meet: (1) high administration efficiency; (2) promotion of continuity of care; (3) integration of long-term care services and service consultation; and (4) promotion of quality of care. The doctors and nurses who administered home medical care stated that the platform should promote continuity and quality of care by improving work efficiency and simplifying communication between health care professionals and caregivers (or care recipients). The users and potential users of home care services hoped that they could obtain information about their service status and communicate with health care professionals. In addition, the users and potential users expected that the platform could integrate long-term care services and provide related health and welfare information; moreover, they wished to have access to high quality services through one single platform. Based on our review, the current information technology system of home medical care in Taiwan faces the following four challenges in meeting users' needs: (1) care information is held in various information systems; (2) the administrative support functions are not sufficiently comprehensive; (3) information on care resources is not provided in a timely manner; and (4) communication is monodirectional, from carers to carees. Conclusions: Although the Taiwanese government has developed several platforms to facilitate the development of home medical care services, these platforms do not meet users' needs. In an integrated information platform, the following functions must be prioritized: (1) high administrative efficiency; (2) promotion of continuity of care; (3) integration of long-term care services with service consultations; and (4) promotion of quality of care. ? 2019 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

"Childhood poly-victimization and children's health: A nationally representative study","2019","Background: Although research on the negative effects of childhood poly-victimization is substantial, few studies have examined the relationship between poly-victimization and younger children's physical health and diseases. Objective: This study examines the associations between poly-victimization and children's health problems requiring medical attention. Methods: A national stratified cluster random sampling was used to select and approach 25% of the total primary schools in Taiwan, and 49% of the approached schools agreed to participate in this study. We collected data with a self-report questionnaire from 6233 (4th-grade) students aged 10–11, covering every city and county in Taiwan. Results: Logistic regression analyses demonstrate a significant dose-response relationship between children's poly-victimization exposure and their health problems including hospitalization, serious injury, surgery, daily-medication requirements, heart murmurs, asthma, dizziness or fainting, allergies, kidney disease, therapies for special needs, smoking, and alcohol use. The results indicate that children's risk of having a health problem grew significantly with each increase in the number of victimization types that children experienced. Conclusions: These research findings underscore the effect of poly-victimization on children's health problems requiring medical attention, and stress the need for both proper screening methods for children's exposure to poly-victimization and stronger awareness of poly-victimization's effects on health conditions in healthcare clinics. ? 2019","alcohol; alcohol consumption; allergy; Article; asthma; child; child health; child hospitalization; childhood adversity; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dizziness; faintness; female; heart murmur; human; injury; kidney disease; male; pilot study; poly victimization; retrospective study; self report; smoking; Taiwan; victim"
"Preliminary study of hospital systems for malpractice dispute management based on physicians' experiences","2019","Objectives: This study explored the characteristics of hospitals' systems for malpractice dispute management. Suggestions are proposed for improving hospitals' policies in this field. Methods: Eighteen physicians who had experienced malpractice disputes in the past 10 years were interviewed. Results: Most physicians received legal and financial support from hospital systems for malpractice disputes, but emotional support from colleagues and supervisors was inadequate due to a prevalent culture of shame and liability in malpractice dispute contexts. Hospital systems were reported to examine dispute events to assure monetary compensation but not to discover root causes of events or to devise preventive strategies. Most hospitals were determined to be reactive, with few implementing policies to proactively prevent malpractice disputes. Conclusions: Government authorities handling health affairs should request that hospitals organize educational activities regularly to improve medical staff members' knowledge and attitudes regarding malpractice disputes. Each malpractice dispute requires root cause analysis and recording of results to guide future policies. For resolution of potential malpractice disputes, hospitals should implement preventive policies to enable early assistance when adverse outcomes or patient complaints occur. ? 2019 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

"Applying Deep Learning for Surrogate Construction of Simulation Systems","2019","The deep learning approach has been successfully applied to various disciplines. When using optimization algorithms, there is a need to evaluate the performance of solutions found so far. The simulation system usually serve as the evaluator. However, to speedup the process, an approximation function, called surrogate, can replace the time consuming simulator. We propose to use deep learning to construct the surrogate function in epidemiology. The simulator is an agent-based stochastic model for influenza and the optimization problem is to find vaccination strategy to minimize the number of infected cases or economical impact. The optimizer is a genetic algorithm and the fitness function is the simulation program. An attempt to use the surrogate function with table lookup and interpolation was reported before. The results show that the surrogate constructed by deep learning approach outperforms the interpolation based one for both total case and economical impact. The average of the absolute value of relative error is less than 0.27%, which is quite close to the intrinsic limitation of the stochastic variation of the simulation software 0.2%, and the rank coefficients are all above 0.999. The vaccination strategy recommended is still to vaccine the school age children first which is consistent with the previous studies for minimizing total infected cases. As to minimize economical impact, the priority goes to the middle schoolers then to young working adults The results are encouraging and it should be a worthy effort to use machine learning approach to explore the vast parameter space of simulation models in epidemiology. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Computer software; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Interpolation; Simulators; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Table lookup; Vaccines; Agent-based stochastic model; Approximation function; Machine learning approaches; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Stochastic variation; Surrogate; Vaccination strategy; Deep learning"
"BIM-based AR maintenance system (BARMS) as an intelligent instruction platform for complex plumbing facilities","2019","The traditional architectural design of facilities requires that maintenance workers refer between plumbing layout drawings and the actual facilities in complex, hidden, sealed in-wall, or low illumination environments. The purpose of a Building information modeling-based Augmented Reality Maintenance System (BARMS) in this study was to provide a smartphone-based platform and a new application scenario for cooling tower and pipe shutdown protocol in a real-world old campus building. An intelligent instruction framework was built considering subject, path, and actions. Challenges and solutions were created to monitor the subject and maintenance protocol while moving from inside to outside, between bright and dark environments, and when crossing building enclosures at roof level. Animated instruction using AR was interactive and followed the knowledge and management protocols of associated instruction aids. The results demonstrated a straightforward mapping of in-wall pipes and their connected valves, with practical auxiliary components of walking direction and path guidance. The suggested maintenance routes also ensured a worker's safety. Statistical analysis showed a positive user response. ? 2019 by the authors.",""
"CHI3L1 results in poor outcome of ovarian cancer by promoting properties of stem-like cells","2019","The role of chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) in ovarian cancer and the possible mechanisms were elucidated. CHI3L1 is a secreted glycoprotein and associated with inflammation, fibrosis, asthma, extracellular tissue remodeling and solid tumors. Our previous study showed CHI3L1 could be a potential prognostic biomarker for epithelial ovarian cancer and could protect cancer cells from apoptosis. Therefore, clinical data and quantitation of CHI3L1 of ovarian cancer patients, tumor spheroid formation, side-population assays, Aldefluor and apoptotic assays, ELISA, RT-PCR, immunoblotting and animal experiments were performed in two ovarian cancer cells lines, OVCAR3 and CA5171, and their CHI3L1-overexpressing and -knockdown transfectants. High expression of CHI3L1 was associated with poor outcome and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer patients. The mRNA expression of CHI3L1 in CA5171 ovarian cancer stem-like cells was 3-fold higher than in CA5171 parental cells. CHI3L1 promoted the properties of ovarian cancer stem-like cells including generating more and larger tumor spheroids and a higher percentage of ALDH+ in tumor cells and promoting resistance to cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis. CHI3L1 could induce both the Akt (essential) and Erk signaling pathways, and then enhance expression of β-catenin followed by SOX2, and finally promote tumor spheroid formation and other properties of ovarian cancer stem-like cells. OVCAR3 CHI3L1-overexpressing transfectants were more tumorigenic in vivo, whereas CA5171 CHI3L1-knockdown transfectants were not tumorigenic in vivo. CHI3L1 critically enhances the properties of ovarian cancer stem-like cells. CHI3L1 or CHI3L1-regulated signaling pathways and molecules could be potential therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer. ? 2019 Society for Endocrinology Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.","2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone; 2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; aldehyde dehydrogenase; beta catenin; chitinase 3 like protein 1; cisplatin; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; octamer transcription factor 4; paclitaxel; protein kinase B; small interfering RNA; transcription factor NANOG; transcription factor Sox2; verapamil; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; carcinogenesis; comparative study; controlled study; disease free survival; down regulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; human; human tissue; immunoblotting; in vivo study; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; outcome assessment; ovary cancer; OVCAR-3 cell line; overall survival; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; spheroid cell; tumor spheroid"
"Relationships between parent-reported parenting, child-perceived parenting, and children’s mental health in Taiwanese children","2019","The current study examines the relationship between parents’ and children’s reports of parenting and their effects on children’s mental health symptoms. Six hundred and sixty-six parent-child dyads in Taiwan participated in this study. The parents and the children filled out the parenting questionnaires, and the children also reported their general mental health. The results demonstrated that parental-reported and child-perceived parenting were positively correlated, but parents tended to report lower scores on authoritarian parenting and higher scores on Chinese parenting than did their children. There were also significant gender differences: The mothers reported higher authoritative parenting than did the fathers; and the boys perceived higher authoritarian and Chinese-culture specific parenting than did the girls. Moreover, the Chinese parenting had a negative effect on children’s mental health outcomes. Finally, our results showed that children’s perception of parenting had a stronger effect on children’s mental health symptoms than did parental reports on parenting, urging future research to include the children’s report when investigating the effects of parenting on children’s mental health outcomes. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Risk of First Hospitalization for Heart Failure in Patients with No History of Heart Failure: A Population-Based Case-Crossover Study","2019","Introduction: Traditional nonselective, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to cause salt and fluid retention and should thus be used cautiously in patients with documented heart failure. Recent studies have found that some NSAIDs, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, are associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure regardless of the related medical history of the patient. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the potential link between NSAIDs (both COX-2 inhibitors and traditional nonselective NSAIDs) and heart failure in patients without a history of heart failure. Methods: We conducted a case-crossover study using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. A total of 5615 subjects with a first hospitalization for heart failure between 2005 and 2013 were identified from the NHIRD. Exposure to individual NSAIDs between the case period (1–30?days before the index date) and control period (121–150?days before the index date) were retrieved. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of the incident heart failure associated with NSAID use after adjustments for potential confounders. Multiple sensitivity analyses, including the case-time-control analysis, were performed to test the robustness of the study results. Results: Overall, NSAID use was associated with a 1.58-fold risk [aOR 1.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40–1.79] of heart failure leading to hospitalization in the main analysis, and similar results were obtained in the case-time-control analysis [aOR 1.40 (95% CI 1.18–1.67)]. The increased risks of heart failure were comparable between traditional NSAIDs [aOR 1.53 (95% CI 1.35–1.74)] and COX-2 inhibitors [aOR 1.74 (95% CI 1.25–2.44)]. Among all NSAIDs, ketorolac was associated with the highest risk of heart failure [aOR 1.98 (95% CI 1.37–2.86)]. Conclusion: Both traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors were associated with an increased risk of heart failure leading to hospitalization in patients without a related history of heart failure. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","acemetacin; alclofenac; celecoxib; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor; diclofenac; etoricoxib; fenoprofen; ibuprofen; ketoprofen; ketorolac; mefenamic acid; meloxicam; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; piroxicam; sulindac; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular risk; comorbidity; controlled study; crossover procedure; dose response; female; heart failure; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; Taiwan; case control study; chemically induced; health survey; heart failure; longitudinal study; middle aged; procedures; risk factor; trends; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Heart Failure; Hospitalization; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Risk Factors; Young Adult"
"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and suicidality: The mediating effects of psychiatric comorbidities and family function","2019","Objective: To explore the association between Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) and suicidality in children. Mediating effects of family function and psychiatric co-morbidities were also explored. Methods: This is a national representative cross-sectional survey of school-based sample of 4739 children aged 7–15. Logistic regression was used to assess the excess risks of suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempts) in 412 children with ADHD. Serial multiple mediator models were conducted to assess the mediating effects of family function and psychiatric comorbidities. Results: The prevalence of suicidality in children with ADHD was approximately 20% in Taiwan. After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of suicidality among children with ADHD was approximately four times higher than among non-ADHD children [(adjusted Odds Ratio [“OR”] = 3.82, 95% Confidence Interval (“CI”) (2.73, 5.34)] for suicidal ideation, adjusted OR = 4.18, 95% CI (2.57, 6.80) for suicide plan and adjusted OR = 4.45, 95% CI (1.99, 9.93) for suicide attempts. The mediating effects of anxiety/depression and conduct problems were about 20% and 8%, respectively, across all suicide outcomes. The mediating effects of family function were around 6–7% for suicidal ideation and 16–18% for suicide plan and suicide attempts. The effects of ADHD on suicidality, in general, remained after considering the mediating roles of family function and psychiatric comorbid conditions. Conclusions: Children with ADHD are at a high risk of suicide. Although the family function and psychiatric co-morbidities partially mediate this association, ADHD in itself is a potent suicide risk factor and should be an important target for suicide prevention. ? 2018","adolescent; anxiety; Article; attention deficit disorder; child; comorbidity; depression; family functioning; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; prevalence; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; Taiwan; attention deficit disorder; automutilation; cross-sectional study; depression; odds ratio; psychology; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; suicidal ideation; suicide; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Self-Injurious Behavior; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted; Taiwan"
"Intravenous Thrombolysis in Acute Ischemic Stroke After Idarucizumab Reversal of Dabigatran Effect: Analysis of the Cases From Taiwan","2019","Background: Asians with atrial fibrillation carry a higher risk of ischemic stroke than non-Asians even under treatment of nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. The purpose of the study was to observe the feasibility of intravenous thrombolytic therapy after administering a reversal agent, idarucizumab, in dabigatran-treated patients with acute ischemic stroke in Taiwan. Methods: Dabigatran-treated patients with acute ischemic stroke who received intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) after idarucizumab reversal were enrolled in the retrospective nationwide study. The clinical data, treatment course, and outcomes were recorded. Stroke severity was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Any intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after rt-PA was detected by neuroimaging studies. Results: Ten dabigatran-treated patients (6 men, mean age 71.10 ± 7.96 years) with acute ischemic stroke were included. Before stroke, the mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 4.50 ± 1.57 and 8 patients (80%) received dabigatran 110 mg twice daily. All patients were treated with 5 g idarucizumab, following which the activated partial thromboplastin time normalized. Intravenous rt-PA (mean dose.78 mg/kg) was initiated a mean time of 11.11 minutes after idarucizumab infusion. The NIHSS score improved significantly after thrombolysis (16.0 ± 6.67 at admission to 9.38 ± 4.75 at discharge, P =.016). ICH developed in 3 patients (30%). Two of them were asymptomatic and 1 patient suffered from symptomatic ICH leading to mortality.

"Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy-induced hypophysitis ? a case series of Taiwanese patients","2019","Immune checkpoint blockade-based immunotherapy is a new modality of cancer treatment with a unique mechanism that has gained increased numbers of indication and is now used in several cancer types. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) emerge as a new entity of diseases involving one or multiple organ systems. irAEs could result in interruption of immunotherapy, morbidities or even death. Among various manifestations of irAEs, immune-mediated hypophysitis is rare but important, requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid life-threatening conditions. We report seven cases of immune-mediated hypophysitis in Taiwan. They suffered from various types of advanced cancer and received different regimens of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The time of onset after initiation of immunotherapy ranged from 5 to 36 weeks. All seven subjects were diagnosed of central adrenal insufficiency, while four of them had primary hypothyroidism. There was no typical finding of infiltrative hypophysitis on the pituitary MRI. There was no documented hormone recovery after diagnosis of hypophysitis, and the tumor responses to immunotherapy were variable in these seven patients. In conclusion, immune-mediated hypophysitis is often irreversible. Fortunately, it can be managed adequately with hormone replacements. Further investigations are warranted to unveil underlying mechanisms and ethnic differences to guide the solutions. ? 2018","antineoplastic agent; corticotropin; cortisone; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody; gonadotropin; hydrocortisone; levothyroxine; megestrol acetate; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; prednisolone; programmed death 1 receptor antibody; testosterone; thyrotropin; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; monoclonal antibody; adrenal insufficiency; adult; advanced cancer; appetite disorder; Article; body weight loss; cancer immunotherapy; case study; clinical article; clinical outcome; disease severity; fatigue; female; follow up; Graves disease; headache; hormone substitution; human; hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; hypophysitis; hypopituitarism; hypothyroidism; immunopathology; lung adenocarcinoma; male; melanoma; middle aged; monotherapy; morbidity; multiple cycle treatment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; rare disease; sarcomatoid carcinoma; subclinical hypothyroidism; Taiwanese; tertiary care center; transitional cell carcinoma; treatment response; uterine cervix carcinoma; Vater papilla carcinoma; aged; case report; cell cycle checkpoint; chemically induced; drug effect; endocrine disease; hypophysitis; immunotherapy; neoplasm; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Endocrine System Diseases; Female; Humans; Hypophysitis; Immunotherapy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Taiwan"
"Nivolumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: Sorafenib-experienced Asian cohort analysis","2019","Background & Aims: Nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, is approved in several countries to treat sorafenib-experienced patients with HCC, based on results from the CheckMate 040 study (NCT01658878). Marked differences exist in HCC clinical presentation, aetiology, treatment patterns and outcomes across regions. This analysis assessed the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in the Asian cohort of CheckMate 040. Methods: CheckMate 040 is an international, multicentre, open-label, phase I/II study of nivolumab in adults with advanced HCC, regardless of aetiology, not amenable to curative resection or local treatment and with/without previous sorafenib treatment. This analysis included all sorafenib-experienced patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) overall population and Asian cohort. The analysis cut-off date was March 2018. Results: There were 182 and 85 patients in the ITT population and Asian cohort, respectively. In both populations, most patients were older than 60 years, had BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) Stage C disease, and had received previous systemic therapy. A higher percentage of Asian patients had HBV infections, extrahepatic metastases and prior therapies. Median follow-up was 31.6 and 31.3 months for the ITT and Asian patients, respectively. Objective response rates were 14% and 15% in the ITT population and Asian cohort, respectively. In the Asian cohort, patients with HBV, HCV or those who were uninfected had objective response rates of 13%, 14% and 21%, respectively. The median duration of response was longer in the ITT (19.4 months) vs. Asian patients (9.7 months). Median overall survival was similar between the ITT (15.1 months) and Asian patients (14.9 months), and unaffected by aetiology in Asian patients. The nivolumab safety profile was similar and manageable across both populations. Conclusion: Nivolumab safety and efficacy are comparable between sorafenib-experienced ITT and Asian patients. Lay summary: The CheckMate 040 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were refractory to previous sorafenib treatment or chemotherapy. This subanalysis of the data showed that treatment responses and safety in patients in Asia were similar to those of the overall treatment population, providing support for nivolumab as a treatment option for these patients.

"Seroepidemiological and molecular investigation of spotted fever group rickettsiae and Coxiella burnetii in Sao Tome Island: A One Health approach","2019","Spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) and Coxiella burnetii are intracellular bacteria that cause potentially life-threatening tick-borne rickettsioses and Q fever respectively. Sao Tome and Principe (STP), small islands located in the Gulf of Guinea, recently experienced a dramatic reduction in the incidence of malaria owing to international collaborative efforts. However, unexplained febrile illnesses persist. A One Health approach was adopted to investigate exposure to SFGR and C. burnetii in humans and examine the diversity of these bacteria in ticks parasitizing domestic ruminants. A cross-sectional human serological study was conducted in Agua Grande district in Sao Tome Island from January to March 2016, and ticks were collected from farmed domestic ruminants in 2012 and 2016. In total, 240 individuals varying in age were randomly screened for exposure to SFGR and C. burnetii by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Twenty of 240 individuals (8.3%) were seropositive for SFGR (4 for Rickettsia africae and 16 for R. conorii) and 16 (6.7%) were seropositive for C. burnetii. Amblyomma astrion were collected exclusively in 2012, as were A. variegatum in 2016 and Rickettsia spp. were detected in 22/42 (52.4%) and 49/60 (81.7%) respectively. Sequence analysis of multiple gene targets from Rickettsia spp. detected in ticks suggests the presence of a single divergent R. africae strain (Sao Tome). While no ticks were found positive for C. burnetii, Coxiella-like endosymbionts were detected in nearly all ticks. This is the first study in STP to provide serological evidence in humans of SFGR and C. burnetii and additional molecular evidence in ticks for SFGR, which may be responsible for some of the unexplained febrile illnesses that persist despite the control of malaria. Future epidemiological studies are needed to confirm the occurrence and risk factors associated with SFG rickettsioses and Q fever in both humans and animals. ? 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",""
"Psychosociobehavioral characteristics associated with high condomless anal intercourse intention: a comparison of receptive, versatile, and insertive MSM in Taiwan","2019","In Taiwan, men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV, and the main route of HIV transmission is condomless anal intercourse (CAI).

For all MSM, those that were in a relationship (AOR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.61–4.03), had three or more steady partners (AOR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.19–5.58), did not use a condom during last anal intercourse (AOR = 6.81; 95% CI: 4.36–10.63), perceived high HIV risk (AOR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.26–3.60), and had high sexual sensation seeking (AOR = 2.80; 95% CI: 1.82–4.30) were more likely to have high CAI intention. After stratification, the significant characteristics differed depending on sexual role, except for no condom use during last anal intercourse remaining significant in all models (AOR = 5.09–20.30; 95% CI: 2.49–66.69, depending on sexual role). Tailoring the programs for MSM of different sexual roles may improve the effectiveness of future prevention efforts. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; anal intercourse; article; condom use; human; human experiment; Human immunodeficiency virus; major clinical study; male; men who have sex with men; nonhuman; sensation seeking; stratification; Taiwan"
"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and sarcopenia in a Western population (NHANES III): The importance of sarcopenia definition","2019","Background: Recent epidemiological studies have shown that sarcopenia is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and advanced fibrosis in an Asian population. We investigated whether NAFLD is associated with a higher risk of sarcopenia using a different definition in elderly patients. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional survey of US patients was conducted, involving 2551 participants aged 60–75 years. NAFLD was measured by ultrasound. Sarcopenia was defined by both a low muscle mass and poor muscle function. In addition, the skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as the absolute muscle mass (kilograms) divided by height 2 (meters) or total body mass (kilograms). A multivariable logistic regression was conducted to estimate the relationship between sarcopenia and NAFLD in the elderly. Results: After adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, severe hepatic steatosis was associated with a decreased risk of sarcopenia as defined by the height-adjusted SMI (odds ratio (OR) 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46–0.87). In contrast, severe hepatic steatosis was associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia as defined by the weight-adjusted SMI (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.31–2.28). These significant associations remained after further adjustments for other potential confounding variables. Conclusions: NAFLD is associated with a lower risk of sarcopenia when using the height-adjusted SMI. In contrast, it showed the opposite result when using the weight-adjusted SMI. The definition of sarcopenia may be an important factor when examining its relationship with NAFLD. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","adult; aged; Article; body height; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease severity; echography; female; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; muscle function; muscle mass; musculoskeletal system parameters; nonalcoholic fatty liver; risk assessment; sarcopenia; skeletal muscle index"
"A Chatbot-supported Smart Wireless Interactive Healthcare System for Weight Control and Health Promotion","2019","People who are overweight and obese have a greater risk of developing serious diseases and health conditions. A steadily increasing trend of obesity is not only limited to developed countries, but to developing nations as well. As smartphones have rapidly gained mainstream popularity, mobile applications (apps) are used in public health as intervention to keep track of diets, activity as well as weight, which is deemed more accurate than relying on user's self-report measure, for the sake of weight management. A solution called 'Smart Wireless Interactive Healthcare System' (SWITCHes) is developed to facilitate objective data reception and transmission in a real-time manner. Based on the user data acquired from SWITCHes app and the auxiliary data from medical instruments, not only SWITCHes app can engage user with tailored feedback in an interactive way, in terms of artificial intelligence-powered health chatbot, but the healthcare professional can provide the more accurate medical advice to user also. This paper presents an overview of development and implementation of SWITCHes. ? 2018 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Health risks; Public health; Smartphones; Time switches; Weight control; Chatbot; Developed countries; Health care professionals; Medical instruments; Mobile app; Mobile applications; obese; overweight; mHealth"
"Non-small cell lung cancer harbouring non-resistant uncommon EGFR mutations: Mutation patterns, effectiveness of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and prognostic factors","2019","Introduction: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutation usually respond to epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), whereas T790M mutation and exon 20 insertion are frequently resistant to EGFR-TKIs. EGFR mutations other than those above are seldom investigated. Methods: In this multicentre, retrospective study, we enrolled NSCLC patients with non-resistant uncommon EGFR mutations, which were defined as mutations other than L858R, exon 19 deletions, exon 20 insertions and T790M. The mutation patterns, clinical data and treatment outcomes were analysed. Patients were classified as gefitinib/erlotinib and afatinib groups according to the EGFR-TKIs received as the first-line therapy. Results: A total of 177 patients were identified (177/1983, 8.9%). Sixty-six patients had more than one EGFR mutation, including those coexisting with exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation. In treatment-na?ve patients with advanced stages (n = 72), the objective response rate was 35.8% for gefitinib/erlotinib group and 60.6% for afatinib group (p = 0.036). In multivariate analysis, no significant differences were found between gefitinib/erlotinib and afatinib groups in median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Brain metastasis at diagnosis was associated with a shorter PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29–4.83) and OS (HR = 3.22, 95% CI = 1.41–7.35). Conclusions: For patients with NSCLC harbouring non-resistant uncommon EGFR mutations, afatinib use as the first-line therapy may provide a better treatment response but no survival benefit, as compared with gefitinib or erlotinib. Brain metastasis at diagnosis is associated with a poor prognosis. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","afatinib; antineoplastic metal complex; circulating tumor DNA; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; gefitinib; pemetrexed; adult; aged; Article; brain metastasis; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; drug efficacy; exon; female; follow up; gene deletion; gene mutation; human; indel mutation; lung carcinogenesis; major clinical study; male; molecular pathology; molecularly targeted therapy; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; retrospective study; short term survival; treatment outcome; treatment response"
"Association of hyperglycemia episodes on long-term mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus with vascular dementia: A population-based cohort study","2019","Aim: This study investigated the effect of severe hyperglycemia episodes on survival and associated factors related to risk of mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with dementia. Methods: We enrolled all type 2 DM patients newly diagnosed as having dementia in Taiwan from 1998 to 2005. These patients were categorized into those who had hyperglycemia episodes and those who did not based on whether or not they had been hospitalized for hyperglycemia after dementia diagnosis. Factors independently associated with mortality were evaluated. Results: Of 5314 patients identified, 303 (5.7%) had at least one hyperglycemia hospitalization. Patients with at least one hyperglycemia hospitalization had a 30% greater risk of mortality than those who had no such admissions (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.09–1.55). Other variables, including age, sex, geographical region, insurance amount, patient with congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, use of anti-hypertensive drugs, use of anti-lipid drugs, and use of insulin were independently associated with risk of mortality. Conclusion: Severe hyperglycemia is common in type 2 DM patients with dementia and it substantially shortens their life. The findings of this study suggest a great need to improve care in DM patients with dementia. ? 2018 The Authors","antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; insulin; aged; Article; cerebrovascular disease; cohort analysis; congestive heart failure; controlled study; drug use; female; health insurance; hospitalization; human; hyperglycemia; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; mortality; mortality risk; multiinfarct dementia; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; priority journal; retrospective study; survival; Taiwan; very elderly"

"Risk of Myocardial Infarction and Ischemic Stroke after Dental Treatments","2019","The association between invasive dental treatments (IDTs) and a short-term risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke (IS) remains controversial. Bacterial dissemination from the oral cavity and systemic inflammation linked to IDT can induce a state of acute vascular dysfunction. The aim of study is to investigate the relation of IDTs to MI and IS by using case-only study designs to analyze data from a large Taiwanese cohort. A nationwide population-based study was undertaken by using the case-crossover and self-controlled case series design to analyze the Taiwanese National Health Care Claim database. Conditional logistic regression model and conditional Poisson regression model were used to estimate the risks of MI/IS. In addition, we used burn patients as negative controls to explore the potential effect of residual confounding. In total, 123,819 MI patients and 327,179 IS patients in the case-crossover design and 117,655 MI patients and 298,757 IS patients were included in the self-controlled case series design. Results from both study designs showed that the risk of MI within the first 24 wk after IDT was not significantly different from or close to unity except for a modest risk during the first week for patients without other comorbidities (odds ratios [95% confidence intervals] of 1.31 [1.08–1.58] and 1.15 [1.01–1.31] for 3 d and 7 d, respectively). We also observed no association between IDTs and IS, or the risk ratio was close to unity. IDTs did not appear to be associated with a transient risk of MI and IS in the Taiwanese population, with consistent findings from both case-only study designs. However, we cannot exclude that dental infections and diseases may yield a long-term risk of MI and IS. ?

"Atrophic glossitis: Etiology, serum autoantibodies, anemia, hematinic deficiencies, hyperhomocysteinemia, and management","2019","Atrophic glossitis (AG)is characterized by the partial or complete absence of filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue. AG may reflect the significant deficiencies of some major nutrients including riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, vitamin B12, folic acid, iron, zinc, and vitamin E. Moreover, protein-calorie malnutrition, candidiasis, Helicobacter pylori colonization, xerostomia, and diabetes mellitus are also the etiologies of AG. Our previous study found the serum gastric parietal cell antibody (GPCA), thyroglobulin antibody (TGA), and thyroid microsomal antibody (TMA)positivities in 26.7%, 28.4%, and 29.8% of 1064 AG patients, respectively. We also found anemia, serum iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid deficiencies, and hyperhomocysteinemia in 19.0%, 16.9%, 5.3%, 2.3%, and 11.9% of 1064 AG patients, respectively. Moreover, GPCA-positive AG patients tended to have relatively higher frequencies of hemoglobin, iron, and vitamin B12 deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia than GPCA-negative AG patients. Supplementations with vitamin BC capsules plus corresponding deficient hematinics for those AG patients with hematinic deficiencies can achieve complete remission of oral symptoms and AG in some AG patients. Therefore, it is very important to examine the complete blood count, serum hematinic, homocysteine, and autoantibody levels in AG patients before we start to offer treatments for AG patients. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",""
"Analysis of heterocyclic amines in meat products by liquid chromatography – Tandem mass spectrometry","2019","Heterocyclic amines (HCAs), a class made up of more than 25 compounds, are unintended hazardous substances that are generated by the heating or processing of proteinaceous foods at high temperatures. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified four such HCAs (IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx, and PhIP) as being probable or possible human carcinogens. In this study, two sample preparation strategies, liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) with solid-phase extraction (SPE) and a rapid, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction (QuEChERS) method, were investigated for the determination of 11 types of HCAs in meat products by LC-MS/MS. The HCAs in the samples were first extracted with acetonitrile by LLE, and followed by SPE. In the case of QuEChERS extraction, acetonitrile is used as the LLME solvent, and PSA, C18EC and MgSO 4 were used as the dSPE sorbent. Both methods showed good performance with respect to precision (RSD &lt; 15.15%), accuracy (79.80–117.64%), recovery (52.39–116.88%), limit of quantitation for a spiked meat extract (0.01–10 ppb) and correlation coefficients (&gt;0.993). The QuEChERS extraction strategy provided a better linear dynamic range and superior sensitivity in comparison with the LLE-SPE approach. HCAs were successfully quantified in real samples using the two proposed approaches by LC-MS/MS. ? 2018","2 amino 6 methyldipyrido[1,2 a:3',2' d]imidazole; 3 amino 1 methyl 5h pyrido[4,3 b]indole; 3 amino 1,4 dimethyl 5h pyrido[4,3 b]indole; acetonitrile; beta carboline; harman; heterocyclic amine; methanol; sorbent; accuracy; Article; chemical composition; high temperature; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liquid liquid extraction; meat; solid phase extraction"
"Blimp-1 contributes to the development and function of regulatory B cells","2019","Regulatory B cells (Bregs) are a B cell subset that plays a suppressive role in immune responses. The CD19+ CD1dhi CD5+ Bregs that can execute regulatory functions via secreting IL-10 are defined as B10 cells. Bregs suppress autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, whereas they exacerbate infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Notably, the molecular mechanisms regulating the development and functions of Bregs are still largely unknown. Furthermore, the biological impact of Bregs in fungal infection has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we compared the gene expression profiles of IL-10-producing and –non-producing mouse splenic B cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or anti-CD40 antibody. Blimp-1, a transcription factor known to be critical for plasma cell differentiation, was found to be enriched in the IL-10-producing B cells. The frequency of Blimp-1+ B10 cells was increased in LPS-treated mice and in isolated B10 cells that were stimulated with LPS. Surprisingly, B cell-specific Blimp-1 knockout (Cko) mice, generated by CD19 promoter driven Cre recombinase-dependent deletion of Prdm1 (gene encoding Blimp-1), showed higher frequencies of B10 cells both in the steady state and following injection with LPS, as compared with control littermates. However, B10 cells lacking Blimp-1 failed to efficiently suppress the proliferation of na?ve CD4+ T cells primed with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. B10 cells can be stimulated for further differentiation into plasmablasts, and a subset of plasmablasts express IL-10. We found that B10 cells from Cko mice failed to generate both IL-10-non-producing and IL-10-producing plasmablasts. Mechanistically, we found that Blimp-1 can directly suppress Il-10, whereas, in the presence of activated STAT3, Blimp-1 works together with activated STAT3 to upregulate Il-10. Moreover, we also found that B10 cells improve the clearance of Candida albicans infection but worsen the infection mortality. Notably, a lack of Blimp-1 in B10 cells did not change these effects of adoptively transferred B10 cells on fungal infections. Together, our data show that Blimp-1 regulates the generation, differentiation, and IL-10 production of Bregs. ? 2019 Wang, Tsai, Ko, Yang, Lin, Hung and Lin.","B lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1; CD19 antigen; CD40 ligand monoclonal antibody; interleukin 10; lipopolysaccharide; STAT3 protein; animal cell; animal experiment; apoptosis; Article; candidiasis; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell culture technique; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell transfer; chromatin immunoprecipitation; coculture; colony forming unit; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flow cytometry; gene; gene amplification; gene deletion; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene knockout; gene ontology; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; luciferase assay; macrophage; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; Prdm1 gene; promoter region; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulatory B lymphocyte; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA isolation; upregulation; Western blotting"
"Identifying features that enhance older adults' acceptance of robots: A mixed methods study","2019","Background: With global aging, robots are considered a promising solution for handling the shortage of aged care and companionships. However, these technologies would serve little purpose if their intended users do not accept them. While the socioemotional selectivity theory predicts that older adults would accept robots that offer emotionally meaningful relationships, selective optimization with compensation model predicts that older adults would accept robots that compensate for their functional losses. Objective: The present study aims to understand older adults' expectations for robots and to compare older adults' acceptance ratings for 2 existing robots: one of them is a more human-like and more service-oriented robot and the other one is a more animal-like and more companion-oriented robot. Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted with 33 healthy, community-dwelling Taiwanese older adults (age range: 59-82 years). Participants first completed a semi-structured interview regarding their ideal robot. After receiving information about the 2 existing robots, they then completed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology questionnaires to report their pre-implementation acceptance of the 2 robots. Results: Interviews were transcribed for conventional content analysis with satisfactory inter-rater reliability. From the interview data, a collection of older adults' ideal robot characteristics emerged with highlights of humanlike qualities. From the questionnaire data, respondents showed a higher level of acceptance toward the more service-oriented robot than the more companion-oriented robot in terms of attitude, perceived adaptiveness, and perceived usefulness. From the mixed methods analyses, the finding that older adults had a higher level of positive attitude towards the more service-oriented robot than the more companion-oriented robot was predicted by higher expectation or preference for robots with more service-related functions. Conclusion: This study identified older adults' preference toward more functional and humanlike robots. Our findings provide practical suggestions for future robot designs that target the older population. ? 2019 S.

"Two transcutaneous stimulation techniques in shoulder pain: Transcutaneous Pulsed Radiofrequency (TPRF) versus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS): A comparative pilot study","2019","Objective. To compare the safety and efficacy of 2 transcutaneous stimulation techniques, transcutaneous pulsed radiofrequency (TPRF) versus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), in chronic shoulder tendonitis. Design. A prospective, randomized, and double-blind clinical trial. Setting. Academic pain service of a city hospital. Subjects. Fifty patients with sonography-confirmed shoulder tendonitis. Methods. Fifty patients were randomly allocated into two groups for electrical stimulation treatment with 3-month follow-ups: Group 1 n=25, TENS and Group 2 n=25, TPRF. Both groups underwent either treatment for 15 minutes every other day, three times total. Our primary goals were to find any treatment comfort level, adverse event, and changes in Constant-Murley shoulder (CMS) scores. The secondary goals were finding the changes in pain, enjoyment of life, and general activity (PEG) scores. Results. For primary goals, no adverse events were noted throughout this study. No differences were found between groups for treatment tolerability (3.20 + 0.87 vs. 2.16 + 0.75). Statistically significant lower PEG scores were noticeable with the TPRF group after the course (12.73 + 5.79 vs. 24.53 + 10.21, p=0.013). Their statistical significance lasted for 3 months although the difference gap diminished after 1 month. CMS scores were significantly higher in the TPRF group (70.84 + 6.74 vs. 59.56 + 9.49, p=0.007) right after treatment course but the significance did not last. Conclusions. In treating chronic shoulder tendinitis using two transcutaneous stimulation techniques, both TPRF and TENS are safe and effective. TPRF is superior to TENS. ? 2019 Mu-Lien Lin et al.","adult; adverse outcome; aged; Article; chronic disease; comparative effectiveness; Constant Murley (score); controlled study; double blind procedure; echography; electrostimulation; female; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; patient comfort; pilot study; prospective study; pulsed radiofrequency treatment; randomized controlled trial; safety procedure; shoulder pain; study design; tendinitis; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; transcutaneous pulsed radiofrequency; treatment duration; analgesia; complication; middle aged; procedures; pulsed radiofrequency treatment; shoulder pain; tendinitis; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; Adult; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Management; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Pulsed Radiofrequency Treatment; Shoulder Pain; Tendinopathy; Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation"
"Cellulose binding domain fusion enhanced soluble expression of fructosyl peptide oxidase and its simultaneous purification and immobilization","2019","Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a hemoglobin molecule in which the N-terminal valine residue of the β subunit has been grafted with the glucose in blood. Its detection has important implications for the diagnosis of diabetes. Enzymatic colorimetric method using fructosyl peptide oxidase (FPO) is simple and rapid for HbA1c detection. A FPO mutant with enhanced activity was constructed and produced by E. coli; however, most of expressed mutant FPO was insoluble. Significantly enhanced expression solubility was achieved when cellulose-binding domain (CBD) from Clostridium thermocellum was fused to the N-terminal of FPO mutant. Via the high affinity interaction between CBD and cellulose, the CBD fusion also facilitated the simultaneous purification and immobilization of FPO directly from E. coli cells lysate using bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibrils as a matrix of very high specific area. A never-dried and water durable nanocellulose film with FPO activity could be easily obtained by collecting the FPO immobilized BC nanofibrils suspension on the surface of a microfiltration membrane. The activity of the ready-use FPO nanocellulose film was stable at least 7 days at room temperature for the detection of HbA1c level of 5.3–11% in blood samples. ? 2019","cellulose derivative; fructosyl peptide oxidase; hemoglobin A1c; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; cellulose; fructosyl-peptide oxidase; fusion protein; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; immobilized enzyme; oxidoreductase; amino terminal sequence; Article; bacterial cell; binding affinity; blood sampling; Clostridium thermocellum; colorimetry; enzyme activity; enzyme binding; enzyme immobilization; enzyme purification; Escherichia coli; microfiltration; nonhuman; protein expression; chemistry; gene expression; genetic procedures; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; mutation; protein domain; Amino Acid Oxidoreductases; Biosensing Techniques; Cellulose; Clostridium thermocellum; Enzymes, Immobilized; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Mutation; Protein Domains; Recombinant Fusion Proteins"
"Hepatitis C virus infection in children and adolescents","2019","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and associated morbidity and mortality worldwide. Short-course, oral, curative, direct-acting antiviral regimens have transformed treatment for HCV infection. Since the 2016 launch of the first global strategy towards elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, the predominant focus of the global response has been on the treatment of adults, who bear the greatest burden of morbidity and mortality of HCV-related chronic liver disease. Compared with adults, there has been little attention paid to addressing the response to HCV in children and adolescents, in part because of the scarcity of data to inform specific paediatric management practices and policy. In this Series paper, we summarise knowledge on the epidemiology, natural history, and treatment of chronic HCV infection in adolescents and children, and we highlight key differences from infection acquired in adulthood. The estimated global prevalence and burden of HCV infection in children aged 1–19 years is 0·15%, corresponding to 3·5 million people (95% CI 3·1–3·9 million). HCV infection is usually asymptomatic during childhood, and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are rare. Sofosbuvir with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir with ribavirin have received regulatory approval and guidelines recommend their use in adolescents aged 12 years and older with HCV infection. In April, 2019, glecaprevir with pibrentasvir also received regulatory approval for adolescents aged 12–17 years. Key actions to address the current policy gaps and achieve treatment scale-up that is comparable to that in adults include: establishment of a campaign on access to testing and treatment that is targeted at children and adolescents; fast-track evaluation of pan-genotypic regimens; and accelerated approval of paediatric formulations. Research gaps that need to be addressed include: age-specific prevalence studies of HCV viraemia in priority countries; further validation of non-invasive tests for staging of liver disease in children; and establishment of paediatric treatment registries and international consortia to promote collaborative research agendas. ? 2019 World Health Organization.

"Use of Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling to Evaluate the Effect of Chronic Kidney Disease on the Disposition of Hepatic CYP2C8 and OATP1B Drug Substrates","2019","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) differentially affects the pharmacokinetics (PK) of nonrenally cleared drugs via certain pathways (e.g., cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6); however, the effect on CYP2C8-mediated clearance is not well understood because of overlapping substrate specificity with hepatic organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs). This study used physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to delineate potential changes in CYP2C8 or OATP1B activity in patients with CKD. Drugs analyzed are predominantly substrates of CYP2C8 (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone), OATP1B (pitavastatin), or both (repaglinide). Following initial model verification, pharmacokinetics (PK) of these drugs were simulated in patients with severe CKD considering changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), plasma protein binding, and activity of either CYP2C8 and/or OATP1B in a stepwise manner. The PBPK analysis suggests that OATP1B activity could be decreased up to 60% in severe CKD, whereas changes to CYP2C8 are negligible. This improved understanding of CKD effect on clearance pathways could be important to inform the optimal use of nonrenally eliminated drugs in patients with CKD. 2018 The Authors.

"Investigating the association between familial hypercholesterolemia and perceived depression","2019","Background and aims: Inherited familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) increases cardiovascular risks, but perceived depression in FH is unknown. This study aims to explore the association between the FH and perceived depression. Methods: This study was a hospital-based design, we started to recruit clinical diagnosis of phenotypic FH since 2014 for the Ten Countries Study in the Asia-Pacific region. We consecutively recruited 302 FH patients and other 414 comparison subjects (214 subjects with hypertriglyceridemia and 200 subjects with normal lipid controls) from the special lipid clinic of National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei. All participants received cardiovascular health examinations and completed a self-reported questionnaire, including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) for assessment of the psychosocial depression. Results: Clinical FH patients had a higher risk of perceived depression, with an odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) of possible depression by 1.50 (1.07–2.11) and probable depression by 1.73 (1.10–2.75) than those of the non-FH groups after adjusted relevant cardiovascular risk factors. FH patients with a family history of coronary heart disease (CHD) had higher domain-specific depression scores than those of controls. In addition, this study found that FH patients with lower educational levels also had a higher risk of depression compared with those in control groups. Conclusions: Patients with clinical phenotype of FH are associated with subjectively perceived depression, particularly among FH patients with a family history of CHD. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; biological marker; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Article; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease association; familial hypercholesterolemia; family history; female; human; hypertension; hypertriglyceridemia; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; medical examination; priority journal; questionnaire; affect; aged; blood; case control study; cross-sectional study; depression; familial hypercholesterolemia; middle aged; preliminary data; prognosis; psychology; risk assessment; risk factor; Taiwan; Adult; Affect; Aged; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Cholesterol, LDL; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Male; Middle Aged; Preliminary Data; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"BIK ubiquitination by the E3 ligase Cul5-ASB11 determines cell fate during cellular stress","2019","The BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein BIK is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, the mechanism of this regulation and its physiological functions remain elusive. Here, we identify Cul5-ASB11 as the E3 ligase targeting BIK for ubiquitination and degradation. ER stress leads to the activation of ASB11 by XBP1s during the adaptive phase of the unfolded protein response, which stimulates BIK ubiquitination, interaction with p97/VCP, and proteolysis. This mechanism of BIK degradation contributes to ER stress adaptation by promoting cell survival. Conversely, genotoxic agents down-regulate this IRE1α-XBP1s-ASB11 axis and stabilize BIK, which contributes in part to the apoptotic response to DNA damage. We show that blockade of this BIK degradation pathway by an IRE1α inhibitor can stabilize a BIK active mutant and increase its anti-tumor activity. Our study reveals that different cellular stresses regulate BIK ubiquitination by ASB11 in opposing directions, which determines whether or not cells survive, and that blocking BIK degradation has the potential to be used as an anti-cancer strategy. ? 2019 Chen et al.",""
"Relationship between fasting plasma glucose and incidence of diabetes in children and adolescents","2019","Aim: To investigate the appropriate fasting plasma glucose threshold by which to define prediabetes in children and adolescents, based on its ability to predict incident paediatric diabetes. Methods: In a nationwide survey of diabetes and renal disease conducted between 1992 and 2000 in all school-aged children in Taiwan, those with abnormal results in repeated urine tests received further physical examination and blood tests. Students who had blood tests for at least two time points were selected for the present study (N = 12 119). The incidence of paediatric diabetes, adjusted hazard ratio and predictive power of fasting plasma glucose were analysed. Results: The incidence of paediatric diabetes increased with increasing fasting plasma glucose levels. Groups with fasting plasma glucose >5.6 mmol/l had a higher adjusted hazard ratio. The adjusted hazard ratio of incident diabetes for participants with higher fasting plasma glucose rose continuously when using a higher threshold for fasting plasma glucose. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for fasting plasma glucose was 0.628 for predicting paediatric diabetes. The association between fasting plasma glucose and incident paediatric diabetes and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were similar in boys and girls and were higher in the age group 12–18 years. According to receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal thresholds, sensitivity and specificity were 4.75 mmol/l, 65% and 51%, respectively, for those aged 6–11 years and 5.19 mmol/l, 60% and 73%, respectively, for those aged 12–18 years. Conclusion: Fasting plasma glucose is associated with the incidence of paediatric diabetes. The results of the present study can be used as reference data to suggest a cut-off value to define paediatric prediabetes. ? 2019 Diabetes UK","glucose; adolescent; adolescent disease; adult; Article; blood examination; blood sampling; child; childhood disease; diabetes mellitus; family history; fasting; follow up; glucose blood level; health survey; human; impaired glucose tolerance; incidence; kidney disease; major clinical study; physical examination; practice guideline; urinalysis; urine sampling"
"Omega-3 fatty acids-enriched fish oil activates AMPK/PGC-1α signaling and prevents obesity-related skeletal muscle wasting","2019","Obesity is known to cause skeletal muscle wasting. This study investigated the effect and the possible mechanism of fish oil on skeletal muscle wasting in an obese rat model. High-fat (HF) diets were applied to induce the defects of lipid metabolism in male Sprague-Dawley rats with or without substitution of omega-3 fatty acids-enriched fish oil (FO, 5%) for eight weeks. Diets supplemented with 5% FO showed a significant decrease in the final body weight compared to HF diet-fed rats. The decreased soleus muscle weights in HF diet-fed rats could be improved by FO substitution. The decreased myosin heavy chain (a muscle thick filament protein) and increased FOXO3A and Atrogin-1 (muscle atrophy-related proteins) protein expressions in soleus muscles of HF diet-fed rats could also be reversed by FO substitution. FO substitution could also significantly activate adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), and PPARγ protein expression and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expression in soleus muscles of HF diet-fed rats. These results suggest that substitution of FO exerts a beneficial improvement in the imbalance of lipid and muscle metabolisms in obesity. AMPK/PGC-1α signaling may play an important role in FO-prevented obesity-induced muscle wasting. ? 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

"Prevalence of overactive bladder in China, Taiwan and South Korea: Results from a cross-sectional, population-based study","2019","Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of overactive bladder (OAB) in individuals aged ?40 years in China, Taiwan, and South Korea. Methods: The present cross-sectional population-representative Internet-based study investigated OAB symptoms in men and women aged ?40 years using the overactive bladder symptom score. Additional instruments included the International Index of Erectile Function (men only) and the Sexual Quality of Life – Female (women only) questionnaires, as well as Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC). Results: In all, 8284 individuals participated in the study. The prevalence of OAB was 20.8% overall (women 22.1%, men 19.5%) and increased significantly with age, from 10.8% in those aged 40–44 years to 27.9% in those aged >60 years (P =.001). The presence of comorbid conditions (e.g. neurological disease, diabetes) was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of OAB. Increasing symptom severity was associated with significantly worsening patient perception of bladder condition responses. Just under half (48%) of those with no OAB had no lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), whereas 88% of those with severe symptoms had all 3 LUTS (International Continence Society definition) symptom categories (voiding, post-micturition, and storage symptoms). Of those without OAB, 10% reported visiting healthcare professionals for urinary symptoms, compared with 64% of those with severe OAB symptoms (P =.001). Increased symptom severity was significantly associated with lower sexual quality of life in both men and women. Conclusions: OAB symptoms were found to affect 1 in 5 individuals aged ?40 years in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, becoming more common with increasing age. The results suggest that many more individuals with OAB could benefit by consulting healthcare professionals. ? 2017 The Authors.

"Children's recall and source monitoring of a repeated event using a timeline as an interview aid","2019","Investigators sometimes use timelines (visual depictions of time) to help children identify temporal information from experienced events or details from a particular instance of a repeated event. However, little is actually known about the efficacy of this visual aid on children's memories. Six- to 9-year-olds participated in four occurrences of a repeated event and were later interviewed with or without the use of a timeline. Children in the timeline condition were less accurate and made more source-monitoring errors than those in the control condition. For items that appeared consistently throughout the events, a suggestibility effect was more evident for older children who used the timeline than those who did not. Overall, there was no clear evidence in support of the visual aid. Despite its popularity, our findings suggest that timelines should be further examined to establish whether, and under what circumstances, they might be used in investigative contexts. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","accuracy; adolescent; analysis of variance; anatomical variation; Article; child; controlled study; drawing; efficacy parameters; female; forensic medicine; geographic mapping; health care quality; human; interview; knowledge; literature; major clinical study; male; memory; monitoring; photography; preschool child; priority journal; reliability; research; school child; social distance; spatiotemporal analysis; suggestion; temporal artery; verbal behavior"
"Internal workplace violence from colleagues is more strongly associated with poor health outcomes in nurses than violence from patients and families [工作?所暴力与?士身体健康??的相?性大于患者和家庭暴力的??]","2019","Aims: To examine the associations between different workplace violence sources and health outcome in nurses. Background: Workplace violence is a major threat to nurses’ physical and mental health. Other workers in the health sector, patients and visitors can cause workplace violence. To effectively prevent workplace violence-related health problems, the differential impact of internal and external violence needs to be explored. Designs: A cross-sectional survey of 1,690 fully employed female nurses. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was used to record the nurses’ experiences of workplace violence, including types (physical, psychological, verbal and sexual) and sources (internal and external) of violence. Data on psychosocial work conditions including work shift, psychological job demands, job control and workplace justice, were also collected. The nurses’ health condition was measured using the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale and Self-Rated Health Scale and multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations between workplace violence and health. The study was carried out in 2015–2016. Results: Sixty percent of the internal workplace violence was psychological and verbal and adverse psychosocial work conditions were associated with workplace violence. After adjustment for demographic characteristics and psychosocial work conditions, internal workplace violence resulted in higher risks of poor self-rated health and mental health than did external workplace violence, particularly in nurses who had experienced psychological and verbal violence. Conclusion: Internal workplace violence in the form of psychological and verbal violence had a stronger effect on nurses’ health than did external workplace violence. Organization-level measures should be implemented to prevent internal violence. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; article; bullying; controlled study; female; human; justice; mental health; nurse; occupational health; prevention; questionnaire; rating scale; workplace violence; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; educational status; exposure to violence; human relation; job stress; multicenter study; nurse patient relationship; nursing staff; psychology; sexual harassment; Taiwan; workplace violence; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Exposure to Violence; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Nurse-Patient Relations; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Occupational Stress; Professional-Family Relations; Sexual Harassment; Taiwan; Workplace Violence"
"Toxicity study of Bidens pilosa in animals","2019","Bidens pilosa (BP)is an edible Asteraceae plant found worldwide that has traditionally been used as food without noticeable side effects. BP has also been used as an herbal medicine to treat over 41 categories of disease in humans and animals. However, to date no long-term toxicity study of BP has been conducted in animals. In this study, 24-week oral toxicity of BP at doses of 0%, 0.5%, 2.5%, 5% and 10% of food was investigated in mice. Mortality, body weight, organ weight, food intake, water consumption, hematology, serum biochemistry, urinalysis, genotoxicity and organ histopathology of animals of both sexes were analyzed. No significant difference in the above parameters was observed between control and BP-fed mice except that body weight and food intake in those fed with 10% BP were significantly less than controls. In addition, similar results were seen in chickens fed with BP for 28 days. Collectively, the data demonstrate that BP has no adverse effects in mice and chickens at dose of 5% or less of food. ? 2019 Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan University",""
"Decompressive Cranioplasty (Osteoplastic Hinged Craniectomy): A Novel Technique for Increased Intracranial Pressure—Initial Experience and Outcome","2019","Background: We redesigned decompressive craniectomy and cranioplasty procedures to decrease the inherent risk of complications. This novel technique, called decompressive cranioplasty, not only may decrease the complication rate but also may improve the cosmetic result, obviate the need for artificial skull implant, and increase the decompressive volume compared with traditional craniectomy. Methods: In decompressive cranioplasty, the Agnes Fast craniotomy was adopted without cutting the temporalis muscle from the underlying bone flap. After opening the dura with or without removal of intracranial hematomas, duraplasty was performed with an intracranial pressure monitor inserted. Four miniplates were bent into a “Z” shape, and the vascularized bone flap was elevated approximately 1.2–1.5 cm above the outer cortex of the skull and fixed with the miniplates. Subsequent cranioplasty was done with a mini-incision on the miniplate sites and reshaping of the miniplate to align the outer cortex of the bone flap. Results: We successfully performed decompressive cranioplasty in 3 emergent cases—2 traumatic subdural hematomas and 1 malignant middle cerebral artery infarction. Postoperative brain computed tomography demonstrated adequate decompression in all cases. Cosmetic outcome was excellent, and there was no temporal hallowing. Mastication function was not affected. At 6-month follow-up, there was no bone flap shrinkage and no hydrocephalus. Conclusions: Decompressive cranioplasty is a safe and effective method in the management of patients with brain edema and intracranial hypertension. It is simple to perform and may reduce the morbidity associated with traditional decompressive craniectomy and subsequent cranioplasty. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","cosmetic; aged; Article; bone graft; brain contusion; brain cortex; brain hematoma; brain hemorrhage; brain infarction; case report; cerebral artery disease; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; conservative treatment; controlled study; cranioplasty; decompressive craniectomy; decompressive cranioplasty; disorientation; dura mater; emergency ward; follow up; Glasgow coma scale; head injury; human; incision; intermethod comparison; intracranial hypertension; intracranial pressure monitoring; male; mastication; medical history; motor performance; muscle strength; neuroimaging; outcome assessment; personal experience; postoperative care; pupil; skull; speech disorder; subdural hematoma; surgical technique; swelling; temporalis muscle; traffic accident; vascularization; very elderly; wound closure"
"Walk score? and its associations with older adults’ health behaviors and outcomes","2019","This study aimed to investigate the associations between Walk Score? and lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes in older Taiwanese adults. A nationwide survey was conducted through telephone-based interviews with older adults (65 years and older) in Taiwan. Data on Walk Score?, lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior, healthy eating behavior, alcohol use, and smoking status), health outcomes (overweight/obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), and personal characteristics were obtained from 1052 respondents. A binary logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders was employed. None of the Walk Score? categories were related to the recommended levels of total physical activity. The categories “very walkable” and “walker’s paradise” were positively related to total sedentary time and TV viewing among older adults. No significant associations were found between Walk Score? and other lifestyle health behaviors or health outcomes. While Walk Score? was not associated with recommended levels of physical activity, it was positively related to prolonged sedentary time in the context of a non-Western country. The different associations between the walk score and health lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes in different contexts should be noted. ? 2019 by the authors.

"HAI-2 as a novel inhibitor of plasmin represses lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis","2019","Background: Dysregulation of pericellular proteolysis usually accounts for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Isolation of a cell-surface protease system for lung cancer metastasis is an important issue for mechanistic studies and therapeutic target identification. Methods: Immunohistochemistry of a tissue array (n = 64) and TCGA database (n = 255) were employed to assess the correlation between serine protease inhibitors (SPIs) and lung adenocarcinoma progression. The role of SPI in cell motility was examined using transwell assays. Pulldown and LC/MS/MS were performed to identify the SPI-modulated novel protease(s). A xenografted mouse model was harnessed to demonstrate the role of the SPI in lung cancer metastasis. Results: Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2 (HAI-2) was identified to be downregulated following lung cancer progression, which was related to poor survival and tumour invasion. We further isolated a serum-derived serine protease, plasmin, to be a novel target of HAI-2. Downregulation of HAI-2 promotes cell surface plasmin activity, EMT, and cell motility. HAI-2 can suppress plasmin-mediated activations of HGF and TGF-β1, EMT and cell invasion. In addition, downregulated HAI-2 increased metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma via upregulating plasmin activity. Conclusion: HAI-2 functions as a novel inhibitor of plasmin to suppress lung cancer cell motility, EMT and metastasis. ? 2019, Cancer Research UK.","antineoplastic agent; hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 2; plasmin inhibitor; scatter factor; serine proteinase; serine proteinase inhibitor; unclassified drug; membrane protein; plasmin; scatter factor; SPINT2 protein, human; transforming growth factor beta1; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cell invasion; cell migration; cell motility; cell surface; CL1-0 cell line; controlled study; correlational study; distant metastasis; down regulation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; human; immunohistochemistry; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lung adenocarcinoma; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; metastasis; middle aged; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; tumor invasion; upregulation; A-549 cell line; animal; cancer transplantation; cell motion; disease exacerbation; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; tumor cell line; A549 Cells; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Disease Progression; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Fibrinolysin; Hepatocyte Growth Factor; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Transplantation; Transforming Growth Factor beta1"
"Early versus late surgical stabilization of severe rib fractures in patients with respiratory failure: A retrospective study","2019","Introduction The timing of surgical stabilization of rib fractures remains controversial. We hypothesized that early surgical stabilization (within 3 days of injury) can improve clinical outcome in patients with severe rib fractures and respiratory failure. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of early surgical stabilization of rib fractures on the perioperative results, clinical outcomes, and medical costs of patients with severe rib fractures and respiratory failure. Methods This was a retrospective comparative study based on a prospectively collected database at a single institute. Patients with severe rib fractures and respiratory failure who underwent surgical stabilization were classified into early (within 3 days of injury) and late (more than 3 days after injury) groups. Outcome measures included operation time, duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, complication rate, mortality rate, and medical cost. Results A total of 33 patients were enrolled (16 and 17 in the early and late groups, respectively). The demographics, trauma mechanism, associated injuries, and severity of trauma were comparable in both groups. The early group had significantly shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (median 36 vs. 90 hours, p = 0.03), intensive care unit stay (median 123 vs. 230 hours, p = 0.004), and hospital stay (median 12 vs. 18 days, p = 0.005); and lower National Health Insurance costs (median 6,617 vs. 10,017 US dollars, p = 0.031). The early group tended to have lower rates of morbidity and mortality, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion Early surgical stabilization of rib fractures in selected patients may significantly shorten their duration of mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit and hospital stays, while incurring less medical costs. ? 2019 Su et al.

"Androgen Receptor Enhances Hepatic Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Gene Transcription After Hepatitis B Virus Integration or Point Mutation in Promoter Region","2019","The gender disparity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is most striking in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cases. The majority of such HCC cases contain integrated HBV, and some hotspot integrations, such as those in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT) promoter, activate gene expression to drive carcinogenesis. As the HBV genome contains both androgen-responsive and estrogen-responsive motifs, we hypothesized that the integrated HBV DNA renders a similar regulation for downstream gene expression and thus contributes to male susceptibility to HCC. To test this hypothesis, the HBV integration sites and the common mutations in the TERT promoter and tumor protein P53 (TP53) coding region were analyzed in 101 HBV-related HCC cases using a capture-next-generation sequencing platform. The results showed that both HBV integration and –124G>A mutation in the TERT promoter region, occurring in a mutually exclusive manner, were more frequent in male than in female patients with HCC (integration: 22/58 male patients with HCC, 6/36 female patients with HCC, P = 0.0285; –124G>A: 17/62 male patients with HCC, 3/39 female patients with HCC, P = 0.0201; in combination, 39/62 male patients with HCC, 9/39 female patients with HCC, P < 0.0001). The effects of sex hormone pathways on the expression of TERT with both genetic changes were investigated using a reporter assay. HBV integration in the TERT promoter rendered the TERT transcription responsive to sex hormones, with enhancement by androgen receptor (AR) but suppression by estrogen receptor, both of which were dependent on hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha. Besides, AR also increased TERT expression by targeting TERT promoter mutations in a GA binding protein transcription factor subunit alpha–dependent manner. Conclusion: TERT elevation by AR through integrated HBV and point mutation at the TERT promoter region was identified as a mechanism for the male dominance of HBV-related HCCs; telomerase and AR thus may be targets for intervention of HCC. ? 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","androgen; androgen receptor; DNA fragment; estrogen; estrogen receptor; GA binding protein; genomic DNA; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha; protein p53; telomerase reverse transcriptase; virus DNA; alpha chain; Article; DNA hybridization; DNA integration; DNA probe; estrogen responsive element; female; gene expression; gene mutation; genetic transcription; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; human tissue; liver cell carcinoma; liver tissue; major clinical study; male; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; point mutation; priority journal; promoter region; RNA extraction; sex difference; somatic mutation; virus DNA cell DNA interaction; whole genome sequencing"
"Activity Recognition System for Dementia in Smart Homes based on Wearable Sensor Data","2019","The highly developed medical technology has increased the average human life span, but also speeds up the process of the world's population aging. In the next few decades, Dementia will affect a considerably increasing number of the elderly. Taking care of the person with dementia is an overwhelming task and can cause physical, emotional and economic pressures to families and caregivers. This works aims to alleviate the caregiver's burden, which can constantly monitor the elderly in smart homes, and in turn, send alert to the caregiver whenever abnormal activities of the elderly occur. This system adopts the unsupervised clustering algorithm, e.g. Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM), to get the potential clusters about the hands movements because the number of clusters is unknown in priori. In order to store spatial information of hands movements within a special activity, N-gram model is used to extract the feature basing on the result of DPMM, and in turn integrate position and hands movement features. The activity recognition (AR) model is used to recognize the living activities with promising performance, in which the precision and recall of this proposed system is up to 96.8% and 96.7%, respectively, even for the similar activities, such as 'eating mear' and 'having medicine ? 2018 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Biomedical engineering; Bluetooth; Clustering algorithms; Intelligent buildings; Neurodegenerative diseases; Pattern recognition; Activity recognition; Dirichlet process mixture model; Indoor positioning; Medical technologies; N-grams; Non-parametric; Person with dementias; Unsupervised clustering algorithm; Wearable sensors"
"Reactivation of PTEN tumor suppressor for cancer treatment through inhibition of a MYC-WWP1 inhibitory pathway","2019","Activation of tumor suppressors for the treatment of human cancer has been a long sought, yet elusive, strategy. PTEN is a critical tumor suppressive phosphatase that is active in its dimer configuration at the plasma membrane. Polyubiquitination by the ubiquitin E3 ligase WWP1 (WW domain–containing ubiquitin E3 ligase 1) suppressed the dimerization, membrane recruitment, and function of PTEN. Either genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of WWP1 triggered PTEN reactivation and unleashed tumor suppressive activity. WWP1 appears to be a direct MYC (MYC proto-oncogene) target gene and was critical for MYC-driven tumorigenesis. We identified indole-3-carbinol, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, as a natural and potent WWP1 inhibitor. Thus, our findings unravel a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer prevention and treatment through PTEN reactivation. ? 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

"Early life exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate causes age-related declines associated with insulin/IGF-1-like signaling pathway and SKN-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans","2019","Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is an ubiquitous and emerging contaminant that is widely present in food, agricultural crop, and the environment, posing a potential risk to human health. This study utilized the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to decipher the toxic effects of early life exposure to DEHP on aging and its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that exposure to DEHP at 0.1 and 1.5 mg/L inhibited locomotive behaviors. In addition, DEHP exposure significantly shortened the mean lifespan of the worms and further adversely affected pharyngeal pumping rate and defecation cycle in aged worms. Moreover, DEHP exposure also further enhanced accumulation of age-related biomarkers including lipofuscin, lipid peroxidation, and intracellular reactive oxygen species in aged worms. In addition, exposure to DEHP significantly suppressed gene expression of hsp-16.1, hsp-16.49, and hsp-70 in aged worms. Further evidences showed that mutation of genes involved in insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) pathway (daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, akt-1, akt-2, and daf-16) restored lipid peroxidation accumulation upon DEHP exposure in aged worms, whereas skn-1 mutation resulted in enhanced lipid peroxidation accumulation. Therefore, IIS and SKN-1 may serve as an important molecular basis for DEHP-induced age-related declines in C. elegans. Since IIS and SKN-1 are highly conserved among species, the age-related declines caused by DEHP exposure may not be exclusive in C. elegans, leading to adverse human health consequences due to widespread and persistent DEHP contamination in the environment. Early life DEHP exposure causes age-related declines, leading to potential adverse human health consequences. ? 2019","Crops; Esters; Gene expression; Health; Health risks; Insulin; Lipids; Oxidation; Oxidative stress; Age-related; Agricultural crops; Caenorhabditis elegans; DEHP; Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate; Emerging contaminant; Reactive oxygen species; SKN-1; Chemical contamination; insulin; lipofuscin; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; reactive oxygen metabolite; somatomedin C; akt-2 protein, C elegans; biological marker; Caenorhabditis elegans protein; DNA binding protein; heat shock protein; hsp-16.1 protein, C elegans; insulin; lipofuscin; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; plasticizer; protein kinase B; reactive oxygen metabolite; skn-1 protein, C elegans; somatomedin C; transcription factor; aging; bioaccumulation; biomarker; gene expression; hormone; mutation; nematode; phthalate; population decline; reactive oxygen species; signaling; toxicity; age 1 gene; aged; aging; akt 1 gene; akt 2 gene; animal experiment; Article; bioaccumulation; Caenorhabditis elegans; controlled study; daf 16 gene; daf 2 gene; defecation; environmental exposure; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; hsp 16.1 gene; hsp 16.49 gene; hsp 70 gene; lifespan; lipid peroxidation; locomotion; nonhuman; pdk 1 gene; signal transduction; skn 1 gene; aging; animal; biosynthesis; drug effect; genetics; longevity; metabolism; pollutant; signal transduction; toxicity; Caenorhabditis elegans; Aging; Animals; Biomarkers; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Diethylhexyl Phthalate; DNA-Binding Proteins; Environmental Pollutants; Heat-Shock Proteins; Insulin; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Lipid Peroxidation; Lipofuscin; Longevity; Plasticizers; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors"
"Revisiting donor risk over two decades of single-center experience: More attention on the impact of overweight","2019","Objective: Morbidity rates after living donor hepatectomy vary greatly among centers. Donor morbidity in a tertiary center over the past two decades was revisited. Methods: Clinical data and grading of complications were reviewed by a nontransplant surgeon based on Clavien 5 tier grading. Risk factors were analyzed. Results: In total, 473 consecutive living liver donors from 1997 to 2016 were included for analysis; 305 were right liver donors and 168 left liver donors, and the corresponding morbidity rates were 27.2% and 9.5%. The majority (81/99, 81.2%) of complications were grade I and II. Donors with morbidity compared with those without were significantly younger, nonoverweight body figure (BMI &lt; 25), more as the right liver donors, and longer length of hospital stay. Right liver donation had significantly higher morbidity rates than did left liver donation in earlier periods (before 2011), but not thereafter. Multivariate modeling revealed that right lobe donation and overweight (BMI ? 25 kg/m 2 ) were significant factors associated with donor morbidity, with adjusted hazard ratios HR (95% confidence interval) of 3.401 (1.909–6.060) and 0.550 (0.304–0.996), respectively. Further, overweight was a paradoxical risk factor in right donor hepatectomy with HR 0.422 (0.209–0.851), but the effect was nonsignificant in left liver donors. Most complications in overweight donors were grade I and not specific to liver surgery. Conclusions: The overall complication rate was 20.9%. Overweight might be protective against morbidity in right hepatectomy and warrants further deliberation. ? 2018","adult; age; female; human; length of stay; liver resection; liver transplantation; living donor; male; obesity; postoperative complication; risk factor; time factor; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Female; Hepatectomy; Humans; Length of Stay; Liver Transplantation; Living Donors; Male; Overweight; Postoperative Complications; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Young Adult"
"Clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with bacteremia caused by Campylobacter species with an emphasis on the subspecies of C. fetus","2019","Objectives: This study was intended to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with bacteremia caused by Campylobacter species. Methods: From April 1998 to May 2014, 56 adults with bacteremia caused by Campylobacter species were evaluated. These Campylobacter species isolates were confirmed to the species level using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (all isolates) and multiplex PCR analysis (for C. fetus only). The performance of identification for Campylobacter species by the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS was evaluated. The genetic relatedness of C. fetus isolates was analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: The leading underlying medical conditions of these patients were malignancy (46.4%), hypertension (35.7%), and liver cirrhosis (23.2%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 5.4%. Using 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, 26 isolates of C. coli, 11 of C. jejuni, and 19 of C. fetus, including 15 C. fetus subsp. fetus and five C. fetus subsp. venerealis, were identified. Among the five C. fetus subsp. venerealis isolates recognized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, only two isolates were C. fetus subsp. venerealis by multiplex PCR method. The Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS failed to correctly identify C. fetus subsp. venerealis isolates. MLST analysis of C. fetus isolates revealed three STs: ST20 (n = 12), ST11 (n = 5), and ST57 (n = 2), which were compatible with three major PFGE clusters. Conclusion: Database expansion of MALDI-TOF MS for the correct identification of C. fetus to subspecies levels is needed. A novel clone of ST57-PFGE Cluster C of C. fetus subsp. venerealis was noted. ? 2017","RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; accuracy; adult; Article; bacteremia; bacterium identification; Campylobacter; Campylobacter fetus; Campylobacter venerealis; female; genotype; human; hypertension; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; malignant neoplasm; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; microbiological examination; middle aged; mortality rate; multilocus sequence typing; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; phenotype; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; retrospective study; RNA sequence; adolescent; aged; bacteremia; Campylobacter; campylobacteriosis; child; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; male; microbiology; mortality; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bacteremia; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Campylobacter; Campylobacter fetus; Campylobacter Infections; Child; DNA, Bacterial; Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Young Adult"
"Effect of novel divergence markings on conflict prevention regarding motorcycle-involved right turn accidents of mixed traffic flow","2019","Introduction: In Taiwan, segregated traffic flow countermeasures have long been in place. Although these facilities have decreased the numbers of motorcycle left-turn collisions, right-angle collisions, and sideswipe collisions, they have also induced serious right-turn accidents. The purpose of this research was to evaluate an intervention intended to decrease conflicts and motorcycle-involved crashes. In this study, the reasons why the motorcycle accident rate is higher at intersections with slow lanes than at those without slow lanes are presented, and the theory of the self-explaining road was applied to create divergence markings for a mixed traffic flow environment. An intervention that guides motorcycles and cars into appropriate locations at intersections was applied to three intersection approaches. Method: The intervention effectiveness was evaluated by comparing the number of accidents at the intersections before and after the implementation of improvement measures. Moreover, video recordings were used to analyze the traffic distributions at the cross-sections of intersections. T-test was adopted to examine whether the traffic flows at the cross-sections of the intersections before and after the intervention were statistically different. In addition, this research applied the post-encroachment time (PET), the time between the first road user leaving the encroachment zone and the second road user arriving in it, to evaluate traffic conflicts. Finally, the PET and severity index between a straight-through motorcycle and a right-turn vehicle were analyzed. Results: PET increased by 3.2%–20.4%, and the rates of right-turn collisions, sideswipe collisions, and rear-end collisions decreased by 64.3%, 77.3%, and 61.5% respectively. Conclusions: Eliminating the slow traffic lane and setting divergence markings may not effectively cause vehicles in different driving directions to drive in the proper locations in the lanes. However, divergence markings both reduce the rate of right-turn collisions and decrease the incidence of sideswipe and rear-end collisions. Practical applications: The proposed design method may be a good design reference for countries having a high motorcycle density. ? 2019","Accidents; Behavioral research; Information dissemination; Motorcycles; Road and street markings; Roads and streets; Video recording; Before and after; Conflict prevention; Improvement measure; Intervention effectiveness; Post-encroachment time; Rear-end collisions; Self-explaining road; Traffic distributions; Street traffic control; article; comparative effectiveness; incidence; theoretical study; traffic accident; videorecording"
"Increasing Trend in Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer in Asia: More Cancers in Men and More Rectal Cancers","2019","BACKGROUND:The incidence of young-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) is reported to be increasing in the Western world. There are no population-based studies assessing the trend across Asia.METHODS:We performed a multinational cohort study involving four Asian countries/regions, namely Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong. The magnitude and direction of trend in the incidence of young-onset CRC (age < 50) were quantified using Joinpoint Regression Program to estimate average annual percentage change (AAPC).RESULTS:In Taiwan (1995-2014), incidence of young-onset CRC significantly increased in both men (colon cancer: 4.9-9.7 per 100,000; rectal cancer: 4.0-8.3 per 100,000) and women (colon cancer: 5.1-9.7 per 100,000; rectal cancer: 3.8-6.4 per 100,000). In Korea (1999-2014), incidence of young-onset CRC significantly increased in both men (colon cancer: 5.0-10.4 per 100,000; rectal cancer: 4.9-14.0 per 100,000) and women (colon cancer: 4.1-9.6 per 100,000; rectal cancer: 4.1-9.1 per 100,000). The most pronounced change was observed with male rectal cancer, increasing by 3.9% per year in Taiwan (AAPC + 3.9, 95% confidence interval + 3.3 to +4.5, P < 0.05) and 6.0% per year in Korea (AAPC +6.0, 95% confidence interval + 4.5 to +7.6, P < 0.05). Only a significant increase in rectal cancer was noted in Japan (male rectal cancer: 7.2-10.1 per 100,000, female rectal cancer 4.7-6.7 per 100,000) and Hong Kong (male rectal cancer: 4.4-7.0 per 100,000).CONCLUSIONS:Increasing trend in young-onset CRC is not limited to the Western world.

"Chidamide-induced ROS accumulation and miR-129-3p-dependent cell cycle arrest in non-small lung cancer cells","2019","Background: Epigenetic therapy is a promising popular treatment modality for various cancers. Histone modification and miRNA should not be underestimated in lung cancer. This study aimed to investigate whether chidamide, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), which inhibits telomerase activity and induces cell cycle arrest, influences ROS and miRNA production in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Methods: H1355 and A549 were treated with chidamide. The analysis of DNA content was measured by FACSCalibur equipped with a 488 nm laser. H1355 cells were transfected with miR-129-3p mimic by Lipofectamine2000. Telomerase activity was performed on the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Detection of thymidylate synthase (TS), p21, p53, pRB, and β-actin, were performed by western blot analysis. Results: Our data showed that expression of TS, p21, and pRB were altered in the presence of chidamide by PCR and western blot. Using BrdU-incorporation analysis, we found that chidamide induced G1 arrest through the regulation of the TS gene by miR-129-3p. Chidamide was shown to suppress telomerase activity in the TRAP assay and reduced the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) by PCR and q-PCR in H1355 and A549 cells. Chidamide increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by flow cytometry. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, attenuated chidamide-induced telomerase activity inhibition. Conclusion: Chidamide repressed telomerase activity through ROS accumulation and cell cycle arrest by miR-129-3p upregulation in both H1355 and A549 cells. This is the first study to demonstrate that chidamide induces miR-129-3p upregulation and ROS accumulation, leading to cell cycle arrest. ? 2018","acetylcysteine; beta actin; cyclin dependent kinase 6; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 129 3p; protein p21; protein p53; reactive oxygen metabolite; retinoblastoma protein; telomerase; telomerase reverse transcriptase; thymidylate synthase; tucidinostat; unclassified drug; aminopyridine derivative; antineoplastic agent; benzamide derivative; histone deacetylase inhibitor; microRNA; Mirn129 microRNA, human; N-(2-amino-5-fluorobenzyl)-4-(N-(pyridine-3-acrylyl)aminomethyl)benzamide; reactive oxygen metabolite; telomerase; TERT protein, human; A-549 cell line; Article; concentration response; controlled study; DNA content; drug cytotoxicity; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme repression; flow cytometry; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; lung non-small cell carcinoma cell line; NCI-H1355 cell line; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; regulatory mechanism; telomeric repeat amplification protocol; upregulation; Western blotting; cell cycle checkpoint; drug effect; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; tumor cell line; A549 Cells; Aminopyridines; Antineoplastic Agents; Benzamides; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Reactive Oxygen Species; Telomerase"
"Risk factors associated with altered circulating microRNA-125B and their influences on uremic vascular calcification among patients with end-stage renal disease","2019","Background MicroRNA?125b (miR?125b) has been shown to regulate vascular calcification (VC), and serum miR?125b levels are a potential biomarker for estimating the risk of uremic VC status. However, it is unknown whether clinical features, including chronic kidney disease–mineral bone disorder molecules, affect serum miR?125b levels. Methods and Results Patients receiving chronic dialysis for ?3 months were recruited from different institutes. Serum mi R?125b and chronic kidney disease–mineral bone disorder effectors, including intact parathyroid hormone, 25?OH?D, fibroblast growth factor?23, osteoprotegerin, and fetuin?A, were quantified. We used multivariate regression analyses to identify factors associated with low serum miR?125b levels and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve curve to derive optimal cutoffs for factors exhibiting close associations. Further regression analyses evaluated the influence of miR?125b on VC risk. Among 223 patients receiving chronic dialysis (mean age, 67.3 years; mean years of dialysis, 5.2), 54 (24.2%) had high serum miR?125b levels. Osteoprotegerin (P=0.013), fibroblast growth factor?23 (P=0.006), and fetuin?A (P=0.036) were linearly associated with serum miR?125b levels. High osteoprotegerin levels independently correlated with high serum miR?125 levels. Adding serum miR?125b levels and serum osteoprotegerin levels (?400 pg/mL) into models estimating the risk of uremic VCincreased the area under receiver operating characteristic curve values (for models without miR?125b/osteoprotegerin, with miR?125b, and both: 0.74, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively). Conclusions Serum osteoprotegerin levels ?400 pg/mL and serum miR?125b levels synergistically increased the accuracy of estimating VC risk among patients receiving chronic dialysis. Taking miR?125b and osteoprotegerin levels into consideration when estimating VC risk may be recommended. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Developing a prognostic gene panel of epithelial ovarian cancer patients by a machine learning model","2019","Epithelial ovarian cancer patients usually relapse after primary management. We utilized the support vector machine algorithm to develop a model for the chemo-response using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and validated the model in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the GSE9891 dataset. Finally, we evaluated the feasibility of the model using ovarian cancer patients from our institute. The 10-gene predictive model demonstrated that the high response group had a longer recurrence-free survival (RFS) (log-rank test, p = 0.015 for TCGA, p = 0.013 for GSE9891 and p = 0.039 for NTUH) and overall survival (OS) (log-rank test, p = 0.002 for TCGA and p = 0.016 for NTUH). In a multivariate Cox hazard regression model, the predictive model (HR: 0.644, 95% CI: 0.436–0.952, p = 0.027) and residual tumor size < 1 cm (HR: 0.312, 95% CI: 0.170–0.573, p < 0.001) were significant factors for recurrence. The predictive model (HR: 0.511, 95% CI: 0.334–0.783, p = 0.002) and residual tumor size < 1 cm (HR: 0.252, 95% CI: 0.128–0.496, p < 0.001) were still significant factors for death. In conclusion, the patients of high response group stratified by the model had good response and favourable prognosis, whereas for the patients of medium to low response groups, introduction of other drugs or clinical trials might be beneficial. ? 2019 by the authors.

"A novel role for the klebsiella pneumoniae sap (sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides) transporter in intestinal cell interactions, innate immune responses, liver abscess, and virulence","2019","Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important human pathogen causing hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections. Systemic K. pneumoniae infections may be preceded by gastrointestinal colonization, but the basis of this bacterium's interaction with the intestinal epithelium remains unclear. Here, we report that the K. pneumoniae Sap (sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides) transporter contributes to bacterial-host cell interactions and in vivo virulence. Gene deletion showed that sapA is required for the adherence of a K. pneumoniae blood isolate to intestinal epithelial, lung epithelial, urinary bladder epithelial, and liver cells. Te flsapA mutant was defcient for translocation across intestinal epithelial monolayers, macrophage interactions, and induction of proinflammatory cytokines. In a mouse gastrointestinal infection model, flsapA yielded signifcantly decreased bacterial loads in liver, spleen and intestine, reduced liver abscess generation, and decreased mortality. Tese fndings offer new insights into the pathogenic interaction of K. pneumoniae with the host gastrointestinal tract to cause systemic infection. ? 2018 The Author(s).","antiinfective agent; virulence factor; animal experiment; animal model; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bacterium adherence; cell interaction; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytokine production; female; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; innate immunity; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae infection; liver abscess; macrophage; mouse; nonhuman; phagocytosis; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; animal; Bagg albino mouse; immunology; innate immunity; intestine; Klebsiella infection; liver abscess; microbiology; pathogenicity; pathology; physiology; Animals; Female; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Intestines; Klebsiella Infections; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Liver Abscess; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Virulence Factors"
"Romantic involvement and adolescents' academic and psychosocial functioning in Chinese societies","2019","This study explores the effects of romantic involvement and dating behaviors on adolescent academic and psychosocial functioning in Chinese societies, where adolescent dating is generally discouraged and believed to generate adverse outcomes. Adolescents (male = 48.6%; MeanAge = 15.20 years) from Taiwan (N = 1081) and mainland China (N = 684) were recruited through stratified sampling to complete self-report surveys on their academic performance, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, relationship status, and gender-role beliefs. Adolescents with current or past dating experiences were also asked about specific dating behaviors, such as the onset of dating, number of relationships, and breakup experiences. Approximately one-third of Chinese adolescents surveyed (34.2%) have past or ongoing dating experience, who showed poorer academic performance compared to never-dated teens. In the full sample, single adolescents with past dating experiences reported greater depressive symptoms than those currently dating or never-dated teens. Boys with past dating experience showed higher self-esteem than their currently dating or never-dated peers, whereas single girls with past dating experience showed lower self-esteem than their currently dating or never-dated counterparts. Among adolescents with dating experience, early dating, over-dating, sexual activities, and breakup experiences can undermine their academic and psychosocial well-being. These findings have significant implications for practice and policy regarding adolescent education and mental health. ? 2018",""
"The evolution of the characteristics of charcoal-burning suicide in Hong Kong, 2002–2013","2019","Background: The use of barbecue charcoal gas for suicide led to more than 50,000 deaths in Asia since the rise of its use from 1998. Little is known whether the profile of charcoal-burning suicides changed over time. Methods: Hong Kong's suicide data (2002–2013) were extracted from the Coroner's files. The detailed characteristics were compared between suicide by charcoal-burning and non-charcoal-burning methods, and between charcoal-burning suicides of different periods (2002–2005 vs 2006–2009 vs 2010–2013). Results: People who died by suicide using charcoal burning (n = 2,188) were more likely to be male, aged 30–49 years, married (2002–2005 only), have debt, or live alone, and were less likely to have past or current psychiatric treatment or medical illness than non-charcoal-burning suicides (n = 9,666) across the three four-year periods. By contrast, compared to charcoal-burning suicides in 2002–2005, those in more recent periods (2006–2009 and 2010–2013) were more likely to be aged 50+, non-married, live alone (2006–2009 only), or have current psychiatric treatment or medical illness, and were less likely to be male (2006–2009 only), unemployed, or have debt. Limitations: There could be under-reporting of certain characteristics for charcoal-burning suicides in the Coroner's files. Conclusion: Charcoal-burning suicides persistently showed a distinguishable profile in Hong Kong, whilst changes in certain characteristics suggested a ‘diffusion’ of the method to some other groups such as older individuals. Responsible media reporting and restricting online information about new suicide methods could be potentially important prevention strategies in the early stage, whilst other strategies are needed when the methods become more commonly used. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; age; Article; charcoal burning suicide; controlled study; female; financial deficit; Hong Kong; human; independent living; major clinical study; male; married person; priority journal; psychiatric treatment; retrospective study; sex difference; suicide; unemployment"
"Intentional endometrial injury increases embryo implantation potentials through enhanced endometrial angiogenesis","2019","Embryo implantation rates have been found to be enhanced by precedent endometrial injuries, but the underlying mechanism is not fully investigated. Endometrial inflammation occurs both at peri-implantation period and after endometrial injury, in which vascular reaction is a distinctive feature of inflammation. In this study, intentional endometrial injury was done with a 0.7-mm-diameter brush inserted into the left uterine horn of female ICR mice, then turned around 720° (group 2), and the right uterine horn served as the controls without endometrial injuries (group 1). Intraperitoneal equine chorionic gonadotropin 2.5 IU was injected, followed by human chorionic gonadotropin 10 IU injection, and the uterus was dissected 5 days later, roughly at the peri-implantation period. The peri-implantation endometrium was obtained, and angiogenesis protein array revealed that matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), and IL-1α were more strongly expressed in injured endometrium (group 2) than in the controls (group 1). Immunohistochemical CD34 staining was more prominently expressed in group 2 uterus, and the treatment with LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, significantly decreased CD34 immunopositive cells. The capabilities of permeability, proliferation, tube formation, and migration of mouse endometrial endothelial cells were significantly enhanced in group 2 than in group 1. Our results demonstrate that enhanced endometrial angiogenesis is a possible mechanism accounting for the increased endometrial receptivity after endometrial injury. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an intranasally administered trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine with adjuvant LTh(αK): A phase I study","2019","Background: A nasal influenza vaccine has been available only in a live attenuated form, which limits the range of recipients to immune-competent individuals. The present study evaluated a newly developed intranasal inactivated influenza vaccine with a novel adjuvant, heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) derived from E. coli (LTh(αK)). Methods: The study was a randomized, double-blind, controlled phase I trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an intranasal vaccine containing the trivalent influenza HA antigen (7.5 ?g each of A/California/7/09 (H1N1)-like virus, A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2) virus, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus) in combination with 4 different doses of adjuvant LTh(αK) (7.5, 15, 30 or 45 μg) and 22.5 μg of influenza HA antigen alone (control vaccine). The vaccine was intranasally administered on Days 0 and 7. A safety evaluation commenced for 180 days, and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers and nasal HA-specific IgA titers on Day 0 and Day 28 were assessed to determine whether an immunogenic response was elicited. Results: From November 2012 to September 2013, a total of 36 subjects were enrolled. Twenty-four subjects received an adjuvanted vaccine, and 12 subjects received a control vaccine. The most common adverse event (AE) was mild nasal discomfort, and systemic AEs were mild fatigue and headache. Only two subjects discontinued the study because of an AE (one had grade 3 fever, and one had nodal arrhythmia). In the group with 45 μg of LTh(αK), the seroprotection rates were 100%, 100% and 80%, and the nasal IgA conversion factors were 7.90, 7.46 and 12.27 for the A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and split B strains, respectively. Adjuvant LTh(αK) vaccine showed a significant enhancement in mucosal immunity in split B -specific IgA. Conclusion: The intranasal inactivated influenza vaccine is generally safe, and the LTh(αK)-adjuvanted vaccine is more immunogenic than non-adjuvanted control vaccine.

"Biodegradable redox-sensitive star polymer nanomicelles for enhancing doxorubicin delivery","2019","A typical amphiphilic star polymer adamantane-[poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)- bis(2-carboxyethyl) sulfide-poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether)] 4 with a specific hydrophilic/redox-sensitive/hydrophobic structure was designed and synthesized through ring opening and esterification reactions. The self-assembled nanomicelles were used as doxorubicin (DOX) delivery vehicles with suitable critical micelle concentrations (5.0 mg/L). After the drug being loaded, drug-loaded micelles showed good drug-loading efficiency (10.39%), encapsulation efficiency (58.1%), and drug release (up to 60%) under simulated biological environment conditions. In addition, the backbone structure of the biodegradable polymer was easily hydrolyzed by the action of biological enzymes. As expected, cell-based studies showed that the designed polymer micelles possessed good biocompatibility (a survival rate of 85% for NH-3T3 cells).

"Factors associated with improvement in symptoms and quality of life for first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer - A multicenter prospective SMILE study","2019","Introduction: Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are a standard first-line treatment for advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. Factors associated with symptoms and quality of life (QOL) improvements have not been investigated. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, prospective study to evaluate improvements in QOL and symptoms in NSCLC patients treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs. QOL was assessed using the instrument of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung questionnaire (FACT-L) and Treatment Outcome Index (TOI). Assessment of symptoms was evaluated using the Lung cancer subscale (LCS). Results: Eligible subjects included 280 patients for endpoint analyses. The mean FACT-L score increased by 4.0 ± 15.56 at Week 2 (p<0.001), 5.1 ± 18.48 at Week 4 (p<0.001), and 4.2 ± 20.27 at Week 12 (p=0.001). Similarly, a 2.3 ± 11.65 (p<0.001), 3.2 ± 13.59 (p<0.001), and 2.4 ± 14.34 (p=0.009) increase in mean TOI score were observed at Weeks 2, 4 and 12, respectively. For LCS, it was slightly increased by 1.7 ± 4.61, 2.0 ± 5.50, and 2.0 ± 5.36 at Weeks 2, 4, and 12 (all p<0.001), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed patients who were ex-smokers or with at least 3 metastatic sites were associated with symptoms improvement. Patients who were ex-smokers, with at least 3 metastatic sites, a PS of 1, or treated with gefitinib were associated with QOL improvement. Conclusions: In EGFR -mutated NSCLC patients who were treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs, these ex-smokers or with 3 or more metastatic sites were associated with improvements in symptoms and QOL. ?

"Balance control, agility, eye-hand coordination, and sport performance of amateur badminton players: A cross-sectional study","2019","In this study, balance performance, agility, eye-hand coordination, and sports performance were compared between amateur badminton players and active controls. Thirty young adult badminton players and 33 active controls participated in the study. Static single-leg standing balance (with eyes closed) was measured using a force platform, and dynamic balance was measured using the Y Balance Test (lower quarter). Agility was measured using a hexagon agility test, and eye-hand coordination was measured using a computerized finger-pointing task. Sports performance was quantified by the number of times a shuttlecock fell in a designated area following a badminton serve. The badminton players had superior accuracy in badminton serving (P<.001) relative to the active controls. However, no significant between-group differences were noted in all other outcome variables (P>.05). Amateur badminton players had more favorable sports performance, but not balance performance, agility, or eye-hand coordination, than controls. ? 2019 the Author(s).","adult; agility; article; athletic performance; badminton; controlled study; cross-sectional study; eye hand coordination; female; finger; fitness; human; leg; male; outcome variable; young adult; athletic performance; body equilibrium; case control study; cross-sectional study; movement (physiology); normal human; physiology; psychomotor performance; racquet sport; Adult; Athletic Performance; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Movement; Postural Balance; Psychomotor Performance; Racquet Sports"

This guideline includes the epidemiology and recommendations of antimicrobial treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia in adults and pediatric pneumonia. ? 2019","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter; adult; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; Burkholderia pseudomallei; carbapenem resistance; child; child hospitalization; Chlamydia pneumoniae; chlamydial pneumonia; community acquired pneumonia; comorbidity; disease severity; drug dose escalation; Enterobacteriaceae; epidemiological data; Haemophilus influenzae; health care associated pneumonia; hemodialysis associated pneumonia; hemodynamic parameters; hospital acquired pneumonia; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; infection risk; intensive care unit; Legionella; Letter; medical history; Moraxella catarrhalis; mortality risk; multidrug resistance; Mycoplasma pneumonia; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; nonhuman; nursing home associated pneumonia; outpatient care; pediatric patient; pneumonia; practice guideline; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas pneumonia; risk factor; staphylococcal pneumonia; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pneumonia; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Taiwan; time out (healthcare); ventilator associated pneumonia; epidemiology; evidence based medicine; intensive care; organization and management; pneumonia; practice guideline; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Child; Critical Care; Evidence-Based Medicine; GRADE Approach; Humans; Pneumonia; Taiwan"
"Detecting tuberculosis clusters in urban neighborhoods, Taipei, Taiwan: Linking geographic and genotyping evidence","2019","Tuberculosis (TB) clusters, defined as two or more active TB cases with epidemiological links and the same genotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, are direct evidence of recent TB transmission. We analyzed TB cases newly diagnosed in 2006–2008, confirmed by the diagnostic laboratory, at a university-affiliated hospital in Taipei metropolitan area where TB is endemic in elderly populations. Numbers of randomly selected non-TB patients (as controls) from each district were proportional to the district population (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.8), which supports that patients who visited the hospital represent a spatially independent sample of total population in this area. We used the nearest neighbor hierarchical (NNH) clustering method and the spatial scan statistics to identify spatial TB clusters among 969 cases within the 10-km buffer, adjusting for the elderly population. One cluster with 10 TB cases from different households in geographic proximity to each other was detected by both NNH clustering and spatial scan statistics. Spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) genotyping showed that four of the six M. tuberculosis strains from this spatial cluster were identical. Three of those four patients were older than 70 years, but none were nursing home residents. The identical genotypes of M. tuberculosis strains in clustered elderly TB patients living in neighborhoods indicate that recent transmission plays a significant role in TB endemicity among elderly populations in Taiwan. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","disease transmission; elderly population; epidemiology; metropolitan area; neighborhood; spatial analysis; tuberculosis; urban society; Taipei; Taiwan; Mycobacterium tuberculosis"
"Tumor detection in automated breast ultrasound using 3-D CNN and prioritized candidate aggregation","2019","Automated whole breast ultrasound (ABUS) has been widely used as a screening modality for examination of breast abnormalities. Reviewing hundreds of slices produced by ABUS, however, is time consuming. Therefore, in this paper, a fast and effective computer-aided detection system based on 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and prioritized candidate aggregation is proposed to accelerate this reviewing. First, an efficient sliding window method is used to extract volumes of interest (VOIs). Then, each VOI is estimated the tumor probability with a 3-D CNN, and VOIs with higher estimated probability are selected as tumor candidates. Since the candidates may overlap each other, a novel scheme is designed to aggregate the overlapped candidates. During the aggregation, candidates are prioritized based on estimated tumor probability to alleviate over-aggregation issue. The relationship between the sizes of VOI and target tumor is optimally exploited to effectively perform each stage of our detection algorithm. On evaluation with a test set of 171 tumors, our method achieved sensitivities of 95% (162/171), 90% (154/171), 85% (145/171), and 80% (137/171) with 14.03, 6.92, 4.91, and 3.62 false positives per patient (with six passes), respectively. In summary, our method is more general and much faster than preliminary works and demonstrates promising results. ? 1982-2012 IEEE.","Automation; Computer networks; Convolution; Diagnosis; Diseases; Edge detection; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Probability; Tumors; Ultrasonic imaging; Breast Cancer; Breast ultrasound; Computer aided detection; Convolutional neural network; Image edge detection; Lesions; Medical imaging; Article; automated whole breast ultrasound; cancer diagnosis; convolutional neural network; echomammography; false positive result; human; major clinical study; nerve cell network; algorithm; breast; breast tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; echomammography; female; procedures; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Neural Networks, Computer; Ultrasonography, Mammary"
"A modest protective association between pet ownership and cardiovascular diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","PURPOSE: Investigate the relationship between pet ownership and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases up to August 2018. Eligible publications examining the association between pet ownership and all-cause and CV mortality (primary outcomes) and risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (secondary outcomes) were included. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the quality of the articles. RESULTS: We included 12 studies, involving 488,986 participants (52.3% female, mean age 56.1 years), in our systematic review. The mean follow-up duration was 8.7 ± 6.3 years. Pet ownership had no association with adjusted all-cause mortality (odds ratio, OR = 1.01, 95% confidence interval, CI [0.94, 1.08], I2 = 76%), adjusted CV mortality (OR = 0.87, 95% CI [0.75, 1.00], I2 = 72%), or risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (OR = 0.87, 95% CI [0.72, 1.05], I2 = 73%), myocardial infarction (MI) (OR = 0.99, 95% CI [0.97, 1.01], I2 = 0%), or stroke (OR = 0.99, 95% CI [0.98, 1.01], I2 = 0%). However, subgroup analysis showed that pet ownership was associated with a lower adjusted CV mortality in the general population (OR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.86, 0.99], I2 = 27%) than in CVD patients. In patients with established CVD, pet ownership was associated with a lower adjusted CVD risk (OR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.60, 0.84], I2 = 0%). CONCLUSION: Pet ownership is not associated with adjusted all-cause or CV mortality, or risk of CVD, MI, or stroke, but it is associated with a lower adjusted CV mortality in the general population and a lower CVD risk in patients with established CVD.",""
"Identifying patient-important outcomes in polycystic kidney disease: An international nominal group technique study","2019","Aim: Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are at increased risk of premature mortality, morbidities and complications, which severely impair quality of life. However, patient-centered outcomes are not consistently reported in trials in ADPKD, which can limit shared decision-making. We aimed to identify outcomes important to patients and caregivers and the reasons for their priorities. Methods: Nominal group technique was adopted involving patients with ADPKD and caregivers who were purposively selected from eight centres across Australia, France and the Republic of Korea. Participants identified, ranked and discussed outcomes for trials in ADPKD. We calculated an importance score (0–1) for each outcome and conducted thematic analyses. Results: Across 17 groups, 154 participants (121 patients, 33 caregivers) aged 19 to 78 (mean 54.5 years) identified 55 outcomes. The 10 highest ranked outcomes were: kidney function (importance score 0.36), end-stage kidney disease (0.32), survival (0.21), cyst size/growth (0.20), cyst pain/bleeding (0.18), blood pressure (0.17), ability to work (0.16), cerebral aneurysm/stroke (0.14), mobility/physical function (0.12), and fatigue (0.12). Three themes were identified: threatening semblance of normality, inability to control and making sense of diverse risks. Conclusion: For patients with ADPKD and their caregivers, kidney function, delayed progression to end-stage kidney disease and survival were the highest priorities, and were focused on achieving normality, and maintaining control over health and lifestyle. Implementing these patient-important outcomes may improve the meaning and relevance of trials to inform clinical care in ADPKD. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology","adult; aged; anxiety; Article; Australia; blood pressure; brain artery aneurysm; caregiver; cerebrovascular accident; end stage renal disease; fatigue; female; France; human; kidney cyst; kidney function; kidney hemorrhage; kidney pain; kidney polycystic disease; major clinical study; male; physical mobility; priority journal; risk assessment; South Korea; stress; survival; treatment outcome; tumor volume; work capacity"
"Association of Constipation with risk of end-stage renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease","2019","Background: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem. Many risk factors were identified and interventions were applied accordingly, but the incidence of end-stage renal disease continued increasing. Some other risk factors may be ignored. Gut microbiota has been recognized as an important endogenous organ. The kidney-gut axis would contribute to gut dysbiosis, which might worsen CKD. Constipation, commonly seen in CKD, was one of the clinical presentation of gut dysbiosis. The clinical impact of constipation to CKD remains unknown. Our study aimed at assessing the risk of ESRD between CKD patients with and without constipation in a nationwide database. Methods: We identified newly diagnosed cases of CKD without constipation history before in 2000-2011 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Subjects who developed constipation later formed constipation group. The others without constipation matched by propensity score formed non-constipation group. The incidence rates and hazards of ESRD in patients with and without constipation by the end of 2013 were compared by using Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable. Results: The incidences of ESRD per 1000 person-years were 22.9 for constipation group and 12.2 for non-constipation group, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.90 (95% CI, 1.60-2.27). Compared to the CKD patients without constipation, adjusted hazard ratio for the CKD patients with laxatives < 33, 33-197 and ? 198 days per year were 0.45 (0.31-0.63), 1.85 (1.47-2.31) and 4.41 (3.61-5.39) respectively. Conclusion: In a population of newly-diagnosed CKD patients, we observed that subjects with de novo constipation, as compared with non-constipation, have increased risk of developing ESRD. More severe constipation would increase the risk further. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aluminum; analgesic agent; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antidiarrheal agent; antihistaminic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium; calcium channel blocking agent; diuretic agent; iron; laxative; narcotic analgesic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; serotonin 3 antagonist; spasmolytic agent; aged; Article; chronic kidney failure; comorbidity; constipation; disease association; disease severity; drug use; end stage renal disease; female; human; ICD-9-CM; incidence; major clinical study; male; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; Taiwan"
"Mother-to-child transmission of HIV: An 11-year experience in a single center and HIV prevention effectiveness in Taiwan","2019","Background: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become an essential global health issue and its elimination is a crucial target. A prenatal “opt-out” HIV screening program was initiated in 2005 in Taiwan. In recent 3 years, approximate screening and MTCT rates were 99% and 2.27% (1/44), respectively. Here, we describe the clinical management of mothers infected with HIV and MTCT rate at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), Taipei, Taiwan, in the years after the program was initiated. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts of pregnant women infected with HIV, who were managed at NTUH between January 2005 and December 2016. HIV infection status of 39 infants born to mothers infected with HIV was available. Results: Between 2005 and December 2016, 50 pregnant women infected with HIV, with 57 parities were managed at NTUH, and 57 live infants were born. We excluded 18 parities because of missing data. Maternal antiviral treatment was administered in 37 of 39 infants. Only one infant tested positive for an HIV antibody test at 18 months, but showed definitive HIV exclusion at 20 months after a series of tests without administration of antiviral treatment. MTCT rate was 0%. Conclusion: Successful implementation of available perinatal HIV intervention dramatically reduced vertical transmission rate of HIV. MTCT rate was 0% in NTUH after the program. However, as NTUH is an HIV referral center, additional efforts are needed to achieve the World Health Organization criteria of lowering the vertical transmission rate of HIV to <2% in Taiwan. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","Human immunodeficiency virus antibody; nevirapine; zidovudine; antiviral therapy; Article; cesarean section; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; female; fetus distress; first trimester pregnancy; global health; hepatitis C; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; injection drug user; mixed infection; mother; neonatal abstinence syndrome; newborn; pregnant woman; premature fetus membrane rupture; premature labor; prematurity; prenatal care; retrospective study; second trimester pregnancy; solutio placentae; Taiwan; third trimester pregnancy; virus load; virus transmission"
"Effect of Adenotonsillectomy on Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea: 6-Month Follow-up Study","2019","Objective: To investigate 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure changes 6 months after surgery among children with obstructive sleep apnea. Study Design: Prospective interventional study. Setting: Tertiary medical hospital. Subjects and Methods: Children aged 4 to 16 years with symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index >1) were recruited. All children underwent adenotonsillectomy and postoperative polysomnography overnight. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured before and 6 months after surgery. Results: The study cohort enrolled 124 children: mean (SD) age, 7.3 (3.1) years; 73% boys. After surgery, the apnea-hypopnea index significantly decreased from 13.3 (18.1) to 3.3 (7.2) events per hour (P <.001). Overall systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different following surgery, while daytime systolic blood pressure was slightly increased (114.3 to 117.3 mm Hg, P <.01) postoperatively. The hypertensive group (n = 43) exhibited significantly decreased levels of overall diastolic, nighttime systolic, and nighttime diastolic blood pressure (P <.05), and 54% of hypertensive children became nonhypertensive after surgery. The nonhypertensive group (n = 81) showed slightly increased levels of nocturnal overall systolic, daytime systolic, and nighttime systolic blood pressure. A generalized linear mixed model revealed that children with hypertension had a greater decrease in systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure during the daytime and nighttime (all P <.05) than those without hypertension. Conclusions: Ambulatory blood pressure changes after adenotonsillectomy among children with obstructive sleep apnea are minimal. The decrease in ambulatory blood pressure after surgery is more prominent for hypertensive children than nonhypertensive children. ?

"Neoadjuvant trastuzumab emtansine and pertuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive breast cancer: Three-year outcomes from the phase III KristinE study","2019","PURPOSE The KRISTINE study compared neoadjuvant trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab (T-DM1+P) with docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab plus P (TCH+P) for the treatment human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive stage II to III breast cancer. T-DM1+P led to a lower pathologic complete response rate (44.4% v 55.7%; P = .016), but fewer grade 3 or greater and serious adverse events (AEs). Here, we present 3-year outcomes from KRISTINE. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant T-DM1+P or TCH+P every 3 weeks for six cycles. Patients who received T-DM1+P continued adjuvant T-DM1+P, and patients who received TCH+P received adjuvant trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. Secondary end points included event-free survival (EFS), overall survival, patient-reported outcomes (measured from random assignment), and invasive disease-free survival (IDFS; measured from surgery). RESULTS Of patients, 444 were randomly assigned (T-DM1+P, n = 223; TCH+P, n = 221). Median follow-up was 37 months. Risk of an EFS event was higher with TDM-1+P (hazard ratio [HR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.36 to 4.98]) with more locoregional progression events before surgery (15 [6.7%] v 0). Risk of an IDFS event after surgery was similar between arms (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.52 to 2.40]). Pathologic complete response was associated with a reduced risk of an IDFS event (HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.60]) regardless of treatment arm. Overall, grade 3 or greater AEs (31.8% v 67.7%) were less common with T-DM1+P. During adjuvant treatment, grade 3 or greater AEs (24.5% v 9.9%) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (18.4% v 3.8%) were more common with T-DM1+P. Patient-reported outcomes favored T-DM1+P during neoadjuvant treatment and were similar to trastuzumab plus pertuzumab during adjuvant treatment. CONCLUSION Compared with TCH+P, T-DM1+P resulted in a higher risk of an EFS event owing to locoregional progression events before surgery, a similar risk of an IDFS event, fewer grade 3 or greater AEs during neoadjuvant treatment, and more AEs leading to treatment discontinuation during adjuvant treatment. ? 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.","carboplatin; docetaxel; pertuzumab; trastuzumab; trastuzumab emtansine; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; anemia; asthenia; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer staging; Conference Paper; controlled study; diarrhea; disease exacerbation; disease free survival; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; event free survival; fatigue; febrile neutropenia; female; follow up; good clinical practice; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; hypertension; hypokalemia; loading drug dose; maintenance drug dose; major clinical study; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; neutropenia; neutrophil count; overall survival; patient-reported outcome; peripheral neuropathy; phase 3 clinical trial; platelet count; priority journal; quality of life; recurrent disease; risk factor; side effect; thrombocytopenia; treatment duration; treatment outcome; vomiting"
"Theranostic Iron@Gold Core–Shell Nanoparticles for Simultaneous Hyperthermia-Chemotherapy upon Photo-Stimulation","2019","The challenges of nanoparticles, such as size-dependent toxicity, nonbiocompatibility, or inability to undergo functionalization for drug conjugation, limit their biomedical application in more than one domain. Oval-shaped iron@gold core–shell (oFe@Au) magnetic nanoparticles are engineered and their applications in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and controlled drug release, are explored via photo stimulation-generated hyperthermia. The oFe@Au nanoparticles have a size of 42.57 ± 5.99 nm and consist of 10.76 and 89.24 atomic % of Fe and Au, respectively. Upon photo-stimulation for 10 and 15 minutes, the levels of cancer cell death induced by methotrexate-conjugated oFe@Au nanoparticles are sixfold and fourfold higher, respectively, than oFe@Au nanoparticles alone. MRI and OCT confirm the application of these nanoparticles as a contrast agent. Finally, results of in vivo experiments reveal that the temperature is elevated by 13.2 °C, when oFe@Au nanoparticles are irradiated with a 167 mW cm?2 808 nm laser, which results in a significant reduction in tumor volume and scab formation after 7 days, followed by complete disappearance after 14 days. The ability of these nanoparticles to generate heat upon photo-stimulation also opens new doors for studying hyperthermia-mediated controlled drug release for cancer therapy. Applications include biomedical engineering, cancer therapy, and theranostics fields. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Amentoflavone induces apoptosis and reduces expression of anti-apoptotic and metastasis-associated proteins in bladder cancer","2019","Background/Aim: Amentoflavone has been shown to be effective against a variety of cancer cells, but its role in bladder cancer remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate whether amentoflavone may induce toxicity effect of bladder cancer. Materials and Methods: Herein, we evaluated amentoflavone effects in a human bladder cancer cell line TSGH8301 in vitro. Results: Amentoflavone caused significant cytotoxicity in TSGH8301 cells at a concentration as low as 200 μM. FAS/FASL-dependent extrinsic apoptosis and mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptosis were observed in amentoflavone-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. Levels of several proapoptotic proteins, such as FAS, FAS-ligand and BAX (B-cell lymphoma 2 associated X) were increased following amentoflavone treatment. Meanwhile, anti-apoptotic MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) and cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (C-FLIP) protein levels were reduced. Additionally, angiogenesis and proliferation-related proteins, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), urokinase-type plasminogen actvator (uPA) and cyclin D1 were diminished by amentoflavone.

"High accuracy differentiating autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by immunoglobulin G glycosylation","2019","Background: Misdiagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) as pancreatic cancer (PDAC) or vice versa can cause dismal patents' outcomes. Changes in IgG glycosylation are associated with cancers and autoimmune diseases. This study investigated the IgG glycosylation profiles as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in PDAC and AIP. Methods: Serum IgG-glycosylation profiles from 86 AIP patients, 115 PDAC patients, and 57 controls were analyzed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was applied to build a decision tree for discriminating PDAC from AIP. The result was validated in an independent cohort. Results: Compared with AIP patients and controls, PDAC patients had significantly higher agalactosylation, lower fucosylation, and sialylation of IgG1, a higher agalactosylation ratio of IgG1 and a higher agalactosylation ratio of IgG2. AIP patients had significantly higher fucosylation of IgG1 and a higher sialylation ratio of IgG subclasses 1, 2 and 4. Using the CART analysis of agalactosylation and sialylation ratios in the IgG to discriminate AIP from PDAC, the diagnostic accuracy of the glycan markers was 93.8% with 94.6% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity. There were no statistically significant difference of IgG-glycosylation profiles between diffuse type and focal type AIP. Conclusions: AIP and PDAC patients have distinct IgG-glycosylation profilings. IgG-glycosylation could different PDAC from AIP with high accuracy. ? 2019 The Author(s).","glycan; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G1; immunoglobulin G2; immunoglobulin G4; area under the curve; Article; autoimmune pancreatitis; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; electrospray mass spectrometry; female; fucosylation; human; hydrophilic interaction chromatography; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; male; pancreas adenocarcinoma; priority journal; prognosis; protein glycosylation; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; sialylation; solid phase extraction"
"The dose-response effects of uric acid on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy in healthy individuals","2019","Background and aim: Hyperuricemia (HUA) is associated with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular risks in various populations. HUA is also able to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in mouse models. However, the dose-response effects of serum uric acid (SUA) on the prevalence of MetS and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are unclear. Methods and results: We retrospectively collected data from 18,932 individuals who underwent an annual health examination between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2016. We excluded those with systemic diseases or missing questionnaires. The primary study endpoints were the prevalence of MetS and LVH, which were defined by the criteria for the Taiwanese population and the “SPRINT” trial. The cohort consisted of 17,913 individuals with a mean age of 31.2 years (SD 7.4) and a mean body mass index of 24.6 kg/m 2 (SD 3.6); 87.1% of the individuals were men. The prevalence rates of HUA, MetS, and LVH were 29.5%, 9.4%, and 0.32%, respectively, in the overall study population. The HUA group was predominantly male and had significantly poorer lifestyle choices and greater laboratory cardiometabolic biomarker values than did the normouricemic group. However, the frequencies of physical activity were comparable between the two groups. After adjusting for confounders, SUA was associated with MetS (OR:1.473, 95% CI:1.408–1.540, P &lt; 0.001) and LVH (OR:1.301, 95% CI:1.064–1.591, P = 0.01). Conclusion: We demonstrated that the dose-response effects of SUA are associated with the prevalence of MetS and electrocardiographic LVH in healthy individuals from Taiwan. Based on this evidence, future studies should investigate urate-lowering therapy and cardiovascular benefits in individuals with HUA (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03473951). ? 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","alanine aminotransferase; biological marker; C reactive protein; cholesterol; creatinine; glucose; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; uric acid; uric acid; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; blood pressure; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; dose response; dyslipidemia; electrocardiography; female; glomerulus filtration rate; gout; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; human; hypertension; hyperuricemia; incidence; kidney function; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; mortality; normal human; physical activity; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; systolic blood pressure; uric acid blood level; waist circumference; blood; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; hyperuricemia; metabolic syndrome X; predictive value; prevalence; risk assessment; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Biomarkers; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Hyperuricemia; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Uric Acid; Young Adult"
"Direct-acting antivirals in East Asian hepatitis C patients: real-world experience from the REAL-C Consortium","2019","Background and aims: One-third of the global hepatitis C virus (HCV) burden is found in Asia. Real-world data from diverse East Asian cohorts remain limited. This study addressed the real-world status of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy among patients from East Asia. Methods: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients from clinical sites in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong were recruited in the REAL-C registry, an observational chart review registry. The primary outcome was sustained virologic response (SVR12, HCV RNA PCR &lt; 25?IU/mL 12?week post-therapy). Results: A total of 6287 CHC patients were enrolled. Compared to other East Asian patients, patients from Japan were older (66.3 vs. 61.5?years, p &lt; 0.0001), had lower body mass indices (22.9?kg/m2 vs. 24.6?kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001), and were more likely to have non-liver malignancy history (12.2% vs. 5.0%, p &lt; 0.001).The overall SVR12 rate was 96.4%, similar to patients both inside and outside Japan (96.6% vs. 96%, p = 0.21). The SVR12 rate ranged from 91.1 to 99.4% except treatment-experienced cirrhotic HCV genotype-1 patients who received daclatasvir/asunaprevir (85.9%) and the treatment-experienced cirrhotic HCV genotype-2 patients treated with sofosbuvir/ribavirin (87%). The overall rate of drug discontinuation was 1.9%, also similar across regions. On multivariate regression analyses, there was no significant association between geographic region and SVR outcomes. Conclusions: In this large multinational CHC cohort from the East Asia, oral DAAs were highly effective and well tolerated across the region. Policies should encourage treatment for all CHC patients with DAAs in Asia with its heavy burden of HCV. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.","asunaprevir; daclatasvir; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; body mass; chronic hepatitis C; controlled study; drug response; East Asian; female; genotype; geographic distribution; Hong Kong; human; Japan; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; medical history; observational study; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; South Korea; sustained virologic response; Taiwan"
"Effects of positive and negative expectations on human pain perception engage separate but interrelated and dependently regulated cerebral mechanisms","2019","Expectations substantially influence pain perception, but the relationship between positive and negative expectations remains unclear. Recent evidence indicates that the integration between pain-related expectations and prediction errors is crucial for pain perception, which suggests that aversive prediction error-associated regions, such as the anterior insular cortex (aIC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), may play a pivotal role in expectation-induced pain modulation and help to delineate the relationship between positive and negative expectations. In a stimulus expectancy paradigm combining fMRI in healthy volunteers of both sexes, we found that, although positive and negative expectations respectively engaged the right aIC and right rACC to modulate pain, their associated activations and pain rating changes were significantly correlated. When positive and negative expectations modulated pain, the right aIC and rACC exhibited opposite coupling with periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the mismatch between actual and expected pain respectively modulated their coupling with PAG and thalamus across individuals. Participants’ certainty about expectations predicted the extent of pain modulation, with positive expectations involving connectivity between aIC and hippocampus, a region regulating anxiety, and negative expectations engaging connectivity between rACC and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a region reflecting outcome value and certainty. Interestingly, the strength of these certainty-related connectivities was also significantly associated between positive and negative expectations. These findings suggest that aversive prediction-error-related regions interact with pain-processing circuits to underlie stimulus expectancy effects on pain, with positive and negative expectations engaging dissociable but interrelated neural responses that are dependently regulated by individual certainty about expectations. ? 2019 the authors.","adult; anterior cingulate; anxiety; article; controlled study; dissociation; expectancy; expectation; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; hippocampus; human; insula; lateral orbitofrontal cortex; male; modulation; nerve potential; nociception; periaqueductal gray matter; prediction; stimulus; thalamus; volunteer; anticipation; association; brain; brain mapping; cingulate gyrus; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; pain measurement; pathophysiology; prefrontal cortex; psychology; young adult; Adult; Anticipation, Psychological; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cues; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Pain; Pain Measurement; Pain Perception; Periaqueductal Gray; Prefrontal Cortex; Thalamus; Young Adult"
"HSP70 is required for the proper assembly of pericentriolar material and function of mitotic centrosomes","2019","Background: At the onset of mitosis, the centrosome expands and matures, acquiring enhanced activities for microtubule nucleation and assembly of a functional bipolar mitotic spindle. However, the mechanisms that regulate centrosome expansion and maturation are largely unknown. Previously, we demonstrated in an immortalized human cell line CGL2 and cancer cell line HeLa that the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) accumulates at the mitotic centrosome and is required for centrosome maturation and bipolar spindle assembly. Results: In this study, we further show that HSP70 accumulated at the spindle pole in a PLK1-dependent manner. HSP70 colocalized with pericentrin (PCNT), CEP215 and γ-tubulin at the spindle pole and was required for the 3D assembly of these three proteins, which supports mitotic centrosome function. Loss of HSP70 disrupted mitotic centrosome structure, reduced pericentriolar material recruitment and induced fragmentation of spindle poles. In addition, HSP70 was necessary for the interaction between PCNT and CEP215 and also facilitated PLK1 accumulation and function at the spindle pole. Furthermore, we found that HSP70 chaperone activity is required for PCNT accumulation at the mitotic centrosome and assembly of mitotic spindles. Conclusion: Our current results demonstrate that HSP70 is required for the accurate assembly of the pericentriolar material and proper functioning of mitotic centrosomes. ? 2019 The Author(s).","chaperone; gamma tubulin; heat shock protein 70; pericentrin; Article; cell maturation; cell viability; centrosome; controlled study; embryo development; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; mitosis spindle; pericentriolar region; protein assembly; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein structure; spindle pole"
"Differences between COPD patients and their families regarding willingness toward life-sustaining treatments","2019","Background/Purpose: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receive more life-sustaining treatments (LSTs) than those with other diseases. The aims of this study were to explore the willingness of COPD patients and their families to consent to LSTs and compare the differences between their levels of willingness. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted, and structured questionnaires were used for data collection. Results: A total of 219 valid samples were collected, including 109 patients and 110 families. Sixty percent of family members indicated that they did not know the intentions of the patient. Families were significantly more willing for patients to receive LSTs than the patients themselves. The level of willingness of patients and families varied according to the situation and LST interventions. When patients were in a vegetative state or medical treatments were futile, the willingness of COPD patients and their families to receive LSTs significantly decreased. Endotracheal intubation and external defibrillation were the least likely to be requested, whereas the willingness to receive medication injections and noninvasive ventilation was greatest. Conclusion: Communication between families and patients on the issue of LST should be facilitated. Adequate information on the patient's condition and possible LSTs should be provided to avoid COPD patients receiving inappropriate LSTs. ? 2018","hypertensive factor; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; cross-sectional study; defibrillation; endotracheal intubation; family attitude; family decision making; female; hemodialysis; home oxygen therapy; human; informed consent; life sustaining treatment; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; noninvasive ventilation; nose feeding; patient attitude; persistent vegetative state; structured questionnaire; tracheostomy; treatment outcome; adult; chronic obstructive lung disease; decision making; family; interpersonal communication; middle aged; patient preference; questionnaire; Taiwan; terminal care; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Communication; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Making; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Preference; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Terminal Care"
"SCID/NOD mice model for 5-FU induced intestinal mucositis: Safety and effects of probiotics as therapy","2019","Background: For chemotherapy patients, intestinal mucositis is a frequent complication. Previously, we evaluated the beneficial effect of oral probiotics in 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) induced mucositis in BALB/c mice. Here, we used SCID/NOD mice instead to simulate the immunodeficiency of chemotherapy patients: first, to evaluate the safety of probiotic supplementation and second, to determine the probiotic effect in response to 5-FU intestinal mucositis. Methods: Thirty-six SCID/NOD mice were injected with saline (three control groups) or 5-FU (three experimental groups) intraperitoneally daily for five days. Mice were given either oral saline daily, probiotic suspension of Lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus (Lcr35, Antibiophilus?, France) or Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum (LaBi, Infloran?, Italy). Blood, liver, spleen, and lymph node tissue samples were evaluated for probiotic translocation via culture and Q-PCR. Weight change, diarrhea score, jejunal villus height (VH) and crypt depth (CD), and serum cytokine levels of TNF-α, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-17 were also assessed. Results: No weight loss was found in the SCID control group. Mean weight loss of 10.63 ± 0.87% was noted by day five in 5-FU group without probiotics but it was only 6.2 ± 0.43% if mice were given Lcr35 (p < 0.01) and 7.1 ± 1.80% (p < 0.01) if they were given LaBi. Diarrhea score of 5-FU group without probiotics was 2.0 ± 0.0 by day five, which dropped to 1.33 ± 0.17 (p < 0.05) and 1.42 ± 0.24 (p < 0.05) with Lcr35 and LaBi, respectively. Average VH significantly decreased and CD significantly increased in SCID mice given 5-FU. With probiotics, average CD improved (p < 0.05) while VH lengthened as well. Besides IL-13, all cytokine levels increased in 5-FU SCID mice. Both Lcr35 and LaBi significantly inhibited serum cytokines (p < 0.05). No probiotic strains were detected in blood cultures of any mice. Conclusion: Using SCID/NOD mice as a novel model for 5-FU induced intestinal mucositis, we find that probiotics Lcr35 and LaBi do not lead to bacteremia, can improve diarrhea and body weight, can restore jejunal crypt depth, and significantly inhibit cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IFNγ, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17. ? 2018","fluorouracil; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; probiotic agent; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; fluorouracil; probiotic agent; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Bifidobacterium bifidum; blood; body weight change; body weight gain; body weight loss; comparative study; controlled study; diarrhea; diet supplementation; drug effect; drug safety; drug tissue level; fluorouracil induced intestinal mucositis; jejunum mucosa; Lactobacillus acidophilus; Lactobacillus casei; liver; lymph node; male; mouse; mouse model; mucosa inflammation; NOD SCID mouse; nonhuman; spleen; animal; disease model; immunology; intestine mucosa; mucosa inflammation; nonobese diabetic mouse; SCID mouse; Animals; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Fluorouracil; Intestinal Mucosa; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Mucositis; Probiotics"
"Developing a decision-aid website for breast cancer surgery: An action research approach","2019","Background: Patients with early-stage breast cancer have numerous options when choosing the type of breast surgery method to be applied. Each of these options lead to a similar long-term survival rate, but result in significant differences in appearance, function, cost, recurrence rate, and various other relevant considerations. However, the time available for detailed communication with each patient is often limited in clinics, which puts these women under great psychological stress and can hinder their surgery-related decision making. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a multipurpose surgery decision-making website providing medical information, psychological support, and decision-related simulation for women during breast cancer surgery-related decision making. Methods: Using the 4 steps of action research, which involve multigroup teamwork via regular team meetings, the following were performed: (1) Planning: searching, analyzing, and evaluating health websites to consensually decide the major infrastructure; (2) Action: work was performed simultaneously in 4 groups, which consisted of medical information collection and editing, patient interviews and data extraction, webpage content design, and programming to create or host the website; (3) Evaluation: the website was tested by clinical experts and focus groups of former breast cancer patients to assess its effectiveness and pinpoint appropriate improvements; and (4) Reflection: constant dialogue was conducted between the various participants at each step, which was used as the foundation and motivation of next plan-action-evaluation-reflection circle. Results: Using the action research approach, we completed the construction of our website, which includes the following: (1) “Woman’s Voice”—an animated comic depicting the story of a female breast cancer patient with interspersed questions for the users that will help them better empathize with the experience; (2) “Cancer Information Treasure House”—providing breast cancer surgery-related information through text, tables, pictures and a presentation video; (3) “Decision-making Simulator”—helping patients think through and check the pros and cons of the different surgical options via visual-based interactions including “Stairs Climbing” and “Fruit of Hope”; and (4) “Recommended Links”—providing reliable websites for further reference. Additionally, we have further improved the website based on the feedback received from postsurgery breast cancer patients and clinicians. We hope to continue improving to better meet both the patients’ and health providers’ needs and become a practical decision-making aid for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Conclusions: We have created the first breast cancer surgery decision-making assistance tool in Taiwan using a “Web-based” and multifunctional website design. This site aims to provide health care knowledge, psychological healing, and emotional support functions, as well as decision-making capability enhancement simulations. We look forward to assisting breast cancer patients in their decision-making process and expect our website to increase patient’s autonomy and improve their communication with clinicians. ?

"Highly Effective Photocontrollable Drug Delivery Systems Based on Ultrasensitive Light-Responsive Self-Assembled Polymeric Micelles: An in Vitro Therapeutic Evaluation","2019","An ultrasensitive light-responsive block copolymer, a combination of a multiarmed poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(caprolactone) polymer as a water-soluble element and maleimide-anthracene linkers as a photosensitive group, was successfully synthesized and rapidly self-assembled to form spherical micellar nanoparticles in aqueous media and phosphate-buffered saline. Their unique characteristics, such as extremely low critical micelle concentration, desirable micellar stability, well-controlled light-responsiveness, tailorable drug-loading content, and ultrasensitive light-induced drug release, make these micelles potential candidates for development of a more effective, safer drug delivery platform for cancer treatment. In vitro studies revealed that the drug-loaded micelles exhibited high structural stability in serum-containing media and very low toxicity toward normal and cancer cells under physiological conditions. Irradiation of cancer cells incubated with the drug-loaded micelles with ultraviolet light at 254 nm for only 10 s triggered rapid and complete release of the drug in the intracellular environment and induced strong antiproliferative/cytotoxic activity. Importantly, real-time cytotoxic assays and fluorescence imaging analysis further demonstrated that the drug-loaded micelles were rapidly taken up into the cytosol or nuclei of the cells, and subsequent ultraviolet exposure induced drug release and apoptotic cell death. Given their simplicity of design, high reliability, and performance, this new light-sensitive micelle may provide a promising route for developing a multifunctional therapeutic nanocarrier system. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Block copolymers; Cell death; Critical micelle concentration; Diseases; Fluorescence imaging; Functional polymers; Light sensitive materials; Micelles; Photosensitivity; Polyethylene glycols; Saline water; Stability; Synthesis (chemical); Targeted drug delivery; Cytotoxicity assays; Functional block copolymers; Micellar nanoparticles; Phosphate-buffered salines; Photo-responsive; Physiological condition; Polymer assemblies; Structural stabilities; Controlled drug delivery"
"Assessment of the relationship between ambient temperature and home blood pressure in patients from a web-based synchronous telehealth care program: Retrospective study","2019","Background: Decreased ambient temperature significantly increases office blood pressure, but few studies have evaluated the effect of ambient temperature on home blood pressure. Objective: We aimed to investigate the relationship between short-term ambient temperature exposure and home blood pressure. Methods: We recruited patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases from a telehealth care program at a university-affiliated hospital. Blood pressure was measured at home by patients or their caregivers. We obtained hourly meteorological data for Taipei (temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) for the same time period from the Central Weather Bureau, Taiwan. Results: From 2009 to 2013, we enrolled a total of 253 patients. Mean patient age was 70.28 (SD 13.79) years, and 66.0% (167/253) of patients were male. We collected a total of 110,715 home blood pressure measurements. Ambient temperature had a negative linear effect on all 3 home blood pressure parameters after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors and antihypertensive agents. A 1°C decrease was associated with a 0.5492-mm Hg increase in mean blood pressure, a 0.6841-mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure, and a 0.2709-mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure. This temperature effect on home blood pressure was less prominent in patients with diabetes or hypertension. Antihypertensive agents modified this negative effect of temperature on home blood pressure to some extent, and angiotensin receptor blockers had the most favorable results. Conclusions: Short-term exposure to low ambient temperature significantly increased home blood pressure in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. Antihypertensive agents may modify this effect. ?Ching-Chang Huang, Ying-Hsien Chen, Chi-Sheng Hung, Jen-Kuang Lee, Tse-Pin Hsu, Hui-Wen Wu, Pao-Yu Chuang, Ming-Fong Chen, Yi-Lwun Ho.",""
"Relationship between body mass index, antidiabetic agents, and midterm mortality in patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome","2019","Background-The aim of this study was to determine the influence of various antidiabetic therapies on the relationship between body mass index and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome. Methods and Results-This was a prospective, observational study comprising 1193 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome. The patients were stratified into 4 body mass index categories, and their mortality rates were compared using time-dependent Cox regression analysis using normal weight (body mass index, 18.5-23.9) as the reference. Subsequently, the influence of antidiabetic therapies on the association between BMI and mortality were analyzed. Seventy-four patients (6.2%) died over 2 years of follow-up. The mortality rate was lowest in the class I obese group (3.35%) and highest in the normal-weight group (9.67%). After adjusting for covariates, class I obesity paradoxically remained significantly protective against mortality compared with normal weight (hazard ratio, 0.141; P=0.049); interaction term analysis showed that insulin therapy influenced this “obesity paradox” (P=0.045). When the patients were stratified by insulin use, the protective effect of obesity disappeared in the insulin-treated patients but persisted in the non-insulin-treated patients. Conclusions-In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome, the relationship between body mass index and mortality rate is U-shaped, with class I obesity representing the nadir and normal weight the peak. The protective effect of obesity disappeared in patients treated with insulin. ? 2019 The Authors.","angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; insulin sensitizing agent; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; sulfonylurea; acute coronary syndrome; adult; adverse outcome; aged; all cause mortality; Article; body mass; body weight; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; drug use; female; follow up; human; insulin treatment; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; treatment response"
"Comparisons of the clinical outcomes between early- and adult-onset bipolar disorders: A prospective cohort analysis","2020","Background: This study aimed to explore the impact of age-at-onset on clinical outcomes in bipolar-spectrum disorders, including the development of alcohol or substance use disorder, suicidality, and psychiatric hospitalization. Methods: This population-based study enrolled newly-diagnosed bipolar-spectrum patients, including 4,367 patients with early-onset bipolar disorder (EOBD), 64,787 patients with adult-onset bipolar disorder (AOBD), and the same number of age-controlled comparison subjects without bipolar disorder, from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Time-dependent covariate Cox regression models were used to estimate the effect of age-at-onset on clinical outcomes with adjustment for pre-existing psychiatric comorbid conditions and pharmacological treatment patterns. Sensitivity analyses using different definitions of study sample and age cutoffs were conducted. Results: The average follow-up duration was 5.7 years. After adjustment with time-dependent covariates and chronological age, there were no significant differences in the risks for developing new-onset alcohol or substance use disorders and psychiatric hospitalization between EOBD and AOBD patients. Although EOBD patients had a higher risk of hospitalization for suicide and self-harm than did AOBD patients in primary analysis, this finding did not replicated in the sensitivity analyses. Limitations: The symptom profile and severity of bipolar disorder was not available in the NHIRD; therefore, surrogate indicators of clinical outcome might not be sensitive enough to detect the subtle differences. Conclusions: EOBD and AOBD patients had similar risks for developing alcohol or substance use disorders. Their risk of psychiatric hospitalization was similar. Whether EOBD patients might have a higher risk of hospitalization for suicide and self-harm warrants further investigations. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","alcohol; antidepressant agent; benzodiazepine; mood stabilizer; neuroleptic agent; adult; age; Article; automutilation; bipolar I disorder; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; female; follow up; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sensitivity analysis; suicidal behavior; suicide"
"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Use and Risk of Arrhythmia: A Nationwide, Population-Based Cohort Study","2019","Purpose: This study compares the risks of arrhythmia among patients with depression receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and those receiving other classes of antidepressants and among patients with depression receiving citalopram-escitalopram and those receiving other SSRIs. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from the 2000–2011 National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Patients with depression who were new antidepressant users were included in the study sample. Propensity score matching was used to balance the covariates between the comparison groups. Crude incidence rates were generated by Poisson regressions, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the rates of arrhythmia among SSRI users and nonusers of SSRI antidepressants as well as between citalopram-escitalopram users and users of other SSRIs. Findings: Neither SSRI (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83–1.08) nor citalopram-escitalopram (HR = 1.20; 95% CI, 0.95–1.51) exposure was associated with a risk of arrhythmia compared with other, newer non-SSRI antidepressants or noncitalopram SSRIs. An increase in mortality was, however, observed among citalopram-escitalopram users (HR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08–1.31). Implications: Citalopram, escitalopram, and other SSRIs were not associated with an elevated risk of arrhythmia compared with each other or with non-SSRI antidepressants. Nevertheless, citalopram and escitalopram were associated with an increase in mortality risk compared with other SSRIs and deserve further investigation. ? 2019","agomelatine; amfebutamone; citalopram; duloxetine; escitalopram; fluoxetine; fluvoxamine; milnacipran; mirtazapine; moclobemide; paroxetine; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; sertraline; trazodone; anxiety disorder; Article; bipolar disorder; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; depression; heart arrest; heart arrhythmia; heart ventricle arrhythmia; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle flutter; human; major clinical study; mortality; paroxysmal tachycardia; propensity score; proportional hazards model; QT prolongation; retrospective study; Taiwan"
"Increased risk for incident thyroid diseases in people with psoriatic disease: A cohort study","2019","Background: The association between psoriasis and thyroid diseases is unclear. Objective: To examine the risk for thyroid diseases among psoriasis patients. Methods: We used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a nationwide cohort study. We examined the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident thyroid diseases in relation to psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Results: We identified 13,266 patients with psoriatic arthritis (psoriatic arthritis group), 149,576 with psoriasis alone (psoriasis group), and 162,842 nonpsoriasis controls. Compared with the nonpsoriasis controls, the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis groups had increased risk for incident hyperthyroidism (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07-1.65 [psoriatic arthritis]; aHR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11-1.33 [psoriasis]) and Graves disease (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.07-1.79 [psoriatic arthritis]; aHR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.41 [psoriasis]).

"Clinicopathologic correlation of ocular surface squamous neoplasia from a university hospital in North Taiwan 1994 to 2014","2019","Background/purpose: To describe the clinical and histologic characteristics of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) and evaluate factors significant in recurrence at a university hospital in North Taiwan. Methods: Patient charts, clinical features, and pathology records were retrospectively reviewed in patients with pathology-proved OSSN from January, 1994 to December, 2014. Clinicopathologic correlation was analyzed. Results: Thirty-six patients were recruited. Mean age was 63.4 ± 13.0 (ranging from 23 to 87) years old. OSSN was predominant in men (21/36). Clinical appearances included papilliform in 17 eyes, gelatinous in 11 eyes, leukoplakic in 3 eyes, and 5 eyes in corneal intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Of 31 conjunctival OSSN, there were 4 in CIN I, 11 in CIN II, 13 in CIN III, and 3 in squamous cell carcinoma. Superior location was associated with higher-grade OSSN. Although statistical analysis was not significant, papilliform and multifocal lesions showed a trend of high-grade OSSN. The stages of tumor were 4, 5, 26, and 1 eye(s) in T1 to T4, respectively. Recurrence of disease occurred in 9 cases (25%) with mean recurrence time of 20.6 (range: 4 to 65) months. Multifocal lesion has a higher tendency for recurrence.

"A silicon-based coral-like nanostructured microfluidics to isolate rare cells in human circulation: Validation by SK-BR-3 cancer cell line and its utility in circulating fetal nucleated red blood cells","2019","Circulating fetal cells (CFCs) in maternal blood are rare but have a strong potential to be the target for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD). ""Cell Reveal TM system"" is a silicon-based microfluidic platform capable to capture rare cell populations in human circulation. The platform is recently optimized to enhance the capture efficiency and system automation. In this study, spiking tests of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells were used for the evaluation of capture efficiency. Then, peripheral bloods from 14 pregnant women whose fetuses have evidenced non-maternal genomic markers (e.g., de novo pathogenic copy number changes) were tested for the capture of circulating fetal nucleated red blood cells (fnRBCs). Captured cells were subjected to fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on chip or recovered by an automated cell picker for molecular genetic analyses. The capture rate for the spiking tests is estimated as 88.1%. For the prenatal study, 2-71 fnRBCs were successfully captured from 2 mL of maternal blood in all pregnant women. The captured fnRBCs were verified to be from fetal origin. Our results demonstrated that the Cell Reveal TM system has a high capture efficiency and can be used for fnRBC capture that is feasible for the genetic diagnosis of fetuses without invasive procedures. ? 2019 by the authors.","Biochips; Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Diagnosis; Diseases; Efficiency; Microfluidics; Nanostructures; Silicon; Breast cancer cells; Capture efficiency; cbNIPD; Fluorescent in situ hybridization; FnRBC; Microfluidic platforms; Nucleated red blood cells; System automa-tion; Blood"
"Specific diacylglycerols generated by hepatic lipogenesis stimulate the oncogenic androgen receptor activity in male hepatocytes","2019","Background: Obesity-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is more prevalent in males than in females, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The influence of hepatic androgen receptor (AR) pathway on the gender difference of HCC has been well documented. Here we investigated the role of hepatic lipogenesis, which is elevated in the livers of obese and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, in stimulating the AR pathway for the male preference of obesity induced HCC. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a fructose-rich high carbohydrate diet (HCD) to induce hepatic lipogenesis. The effect of hepatic lipogenesis on AR was examined by the expression of hydrodynamically injected AR reporter and the endogenous AR target gene; the mechanism was delineated in hepatoma cell lines and validated in male mice. Results: The hepatic lipogenesis induced by a fructose-rich HCD enhanced the transcriptional activity of hepatic AR in male mice, which did not happen when fed a high fat diet. This AR activation was blocked by sh-RNAs or inhibitors targeting key enzymes in lipogenesis, either acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit alpha (ACCα), or fatty acid synthase (FASN), in vivo and in vitro. Further mechanistic study identified that specific unsaturated fatty acid, the oleic acid (C18:1 n-9), incorporated DAGs produced by hepatic lipogenesis are the key molecules to enhance the AR activity, through activation of Akt kinase, and this novel mechanism is targeted by metformin. Conclusions: Our study elucidates a novel mechanism underlying the higher risk of HCC in obese/NAFLD males, through specific DAGs enriched by hepatic lipogenesis to increase the transcriptional activity of hepatic AR, a confirmed risk factor for male HCC. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; androgen receptor; calphostin C; cerulenin; diacylglycerol; fatty acid synthase; leukemia inhibitory factor receptor; metformin; oleic acid; palmitic acid; palmitoleic acid; phosphatidate phosphatase; protein kinase B; protein kinase C epsilon; short hairpin RNA; stearic acid; triacylglycerol; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; female; gene expression; lipid diet; lipid liver level; lipogenesis; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver cell; male; mouse; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; oncogene src; priority journal"
"Post-acute care for frail older adults","2019","As population ages, many older adults suffer acute functional decline that persist after completing treatment course in acute care. They need care from others and are unable to return to their residences after discharge. In the past, this would lead to prolonged stays at hospital and difficult discharges from hospitals that create clinical dilemmas. In 2014, the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) launched the first integrated Post-acute Care (PAC) program for stroke patients. The target population has now expanded to include patients with burn injuries, traumatic nerve injuries, fragility fractures, heart failure, and frailty. Frail older adults often experience acute functional decline during hospitalization. It is crucial to recognize frailty and intervene early. By providing services that facilitate smooth transition between acute care and long-term care systems, the PAC program could not only decrease level of disability and prevent institutionalization, but also reduce re-admission and mortality rate. ? 2019 Society of Internal Medicine of Taiwan.All Rights Reserved.","lead; Article; fragility fracture; frail elderly; frailty; health program; heart failure; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; injury; institutionalization; long term care; mortality rate; nerve injury; stroke patient; subacute care"
"Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors in Child and Adolescent Health, 1990 to 2017: Findings from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2017 Study","2019","Importance: Understanding causes and correlates of health loss among children and adolescents can identify areas of success, stagnation, and emerging threats and thereby facilitate effective improvement strategies. Objective: To estimate mortality and morbidity in children and adolescents from 1990 to 2017 by age and sex in 195 countries and territories. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study examined levels, trends, and spatiotemporal patterns of cause-specific mortality and nonfatal health outcomes using standardized approaches to data processing and statistical analysis. It also describes epidemiologic transitions by evaluating historical associations between disease indicators and the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income, educational attainment, and fertility. Data collected from 1990 to 2017 on children and adolescents from birth through 19 years of age in 195 countries and territories were assessed. Data analysis occurred from January 2018 to August 2018. Exposures: Being under the age of 20 years between 1990 and 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Death and disability. All-cause and cause-specific deaths, disability-adjusted life years, years of life lost, and years of life lived with disability. Results: Child and adolescent deaths decreased 51.7% from 13.77 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 13.60-13.93 million) in 1990 to 6.64 million (95% UI, 6.44-6.87 million) in 2017, but in 2017, aggregate disability increased 4.7% to a total of 145 million (95% UI, 107-190 million) years lived with disability globally. Progress was uneven, and inequity increased, with low-SDI and low-middle-SDI locations experiencing 82.2% (95% UI, 81.6%-82.9%) of deaths, up from 70.9% (95% UI, 70.4%-71.4%) in 1990. The leading disaggregated causes of disability-adjusted life years in 2017 in the low-SDI quintile were neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, and congenital birth defects, whereas neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, headache, dermatitis, and anxiety were highest-ranked in the high-SDI quintile. Conclusions and Relevance: Mortality reductions over this 27-year period mean that children are more likely than ever to reach their 20th birthdays. The concomitant expansion of nonfatal health loss and epidemiological transition in children and adolescents, especially in low-SDI and middle-SDI countries, has the potential to increase already overburdened health systems, will affect the human capital potential of societies, and may influence the trajectory of socioeconomic development. Continued monitoring of child and adolescent health loss is crucial to sustain the progress of the past 27 years. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Perinatal polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzofurans exposure are associated with DNA methylation changes lasting to early adulthood: Findings from Yucheng second generation","2019","Epigenome-wide DNA methylation has not been studied in men perinatally exposed to PCBs and dioxins. Therefore, we examined whether perinatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) induces sustained methylation changes lasting to early adulthood. We used the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to assess DNA methylation in whole blood among Yucheng second generation (people perinatal exposed to high PCBs and PCDFs) compared with referents. Thirty male offspring from the Yucheng cohort were randomly selected and matched with 30 male offspring from the Yucheng’ neighborhood referents with similar backgrounds. Methylation differences between the Yucheng second generation and non-exposed referents were identified using a P value &lt; 1.06 × 10?7. Differential DNA methylation with epigenome-wide statistical significance was observed for 20 CpGs mapped to 11 genes, and 19 CpGs were correlated with gestational levels of PCBs or PCDF toxic equivalency (PCDF-TEQ) with the same direction of effect. Among the 11 genes, AHRR and CYP1A1 are involved in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway known to mediate dioxin toxicity. MYO1G, FRMD4A, ARL4C, OLFM1, and WWC3 were previously reported to be related to carcinogenesis. This is the first study examining genome-wide DNA methylation among people perinatally exposed to high concentrations of PCBs and PCDFs. We observed novel differential methylation of several genes, indicating that modifications of DNA methylation associated with perinatal PCB and PCDF exposure may persist in exposed offspring for more than 20 years. Furthermore, involvement of several carcinogesis-related genes suggested a potential in utero epigenetic mechanisms. ? 2019","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome P450 1A1; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor; ARL4C protein, human; benzofuran derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; biochemical composition; concentration (composition); dioxin; DNA; gene; genetic analysis; genotoxicity; methylation; PCB; PCDD; PCDF; pollution exposure; protein; public health; adolescent; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; female; gene expression; gene mapping; human; major clinical study; male; maternal exposure; maternal serum; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; pyrosequencing; sex difference; signal transduction; adult; DNA methylation; environmental exposure; epidemiology; family size; metabolism; pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; toxicity; China; Shandong; Yucheng; ADP-Ribosylation Factors; Adult; Benzofurans; Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated; DNA Methylation; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Male; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"
"Metformin is associated with a lower risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients with type 2 diabetes","2019","Background: Whether metformin use might affect the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remained to be answered. Methods: A total of 610,089 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients with 2 or more times of prescription of antidiabetic drugs during 1999–2009 were enrolled from Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. They were followed up for NHL incidence until December 31, 2011. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted. Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment-weighting using propensity scores was used to estimate hazard ratios. Results: There were 414,783 metformin initiators and 195,306 non-metformin initiators within the initial 12-month of prescriptions of antidiabetic drugs. After a median follow-up of 5.07 years in metformin initiators and 6.78 years in non-metformin initiators, 1076 and 755 patients were diagnosed of new-onset NHL, respectively. The respective incidence was 47.74 and 57.68 per 100,000 person–years and the hazard ratio for metformin initiators versus non-metformin initiators was 0.849 (95% confidence interval 0.773–0.932) in the intention-to-treat analysis. In the per-protocol analysis, the hazard ratio was 0.706 (95% confidence interval 0.616–0.808). Sensitivity analyses after excluding patients with irregular follow-up, with an extension of minimal observation periods of 24 or 36 months, with incretin-based therapies, or in patients enrolled during 2 different periods (i.e., 1999–2003 and 2004–2009) consistently showed a lower risk among metformin initiators in both the intention-to-treat and the per-protocol analyses. Conclusions: Metformin use is associated with a lower risk of NHL compared with non-metformin antidiabetics. ? 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","acarbose; incretin; insulin; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; rosiglitazone; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea derivative; adult; Article; cancer incidence; female; follow up; human; intention to treat analysis; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhodgkin lymphoma; prescription; propensity score"
"Advanced Paternal Age and Early Onset of Schizophrenia in Sporadic Cases: Not Confounded by Parental Polygenic Risk for Schizophrenia","2019","Background: Whether paternal age effect on schizophrenia is a causation or just an association due to confounding by selection into late parenthood is still debated. We investigated the association between paternal age and early onset of schizophrenia in offspring, controlling for both paternal and maternal predisposition to schizophrenia as empirically estimated using polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Methods: Among 2923 sporadic schizophrenia cases selected from the Schizophrenia Trio Genomic Research in Taiwan project, 1649 had parents’ genotyping data. The relationships of paternal schizophrenia PRS to paternal age at first birth (AFB) and of maternal schizophrenia PRS to maternal AFB were examined. A logistic regression model of patients’ early onset of schizophrenia (?18 years old) on paternal age was conducted. Results: Advanced paternal age over 20 years exhibited a trend of an increasing proportion of early onset of schizophrenia (odds ratio per 10-year increase in paternal age = 1.28, p = .007) after adjusting for maternal age, sex, and age. Older paternal AFB also exhibited an increasing trend of paternal schizophrenia PRS. Additionally, a U-shaped relationship between maternal AFB and maternal schizophrenia PRS was observed. After adjusting for both paternal and maternal schizophrenia PRS, the association of paternal age with patients’ early onset of schizophrenia remained (odds ratio = 1.29, p = .04). Conclusions: The association between paternal age and early onset of schizophrenia was not confounded by parental PRS for schizophrenia, which partially captures parental genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia. Our findings support an independent role of paternal age per se in increased risk of early onset of schizophrenia in offspring. ? 2019 Society of Biological Psychiatry","adult; Article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; disease association; disease predisposition; female; genetic analysis; genetic variability; genotype; human; major clinical study; male; maternal age; onset age; paternal age; polygenic risk score; priority journal; progeny; risk assessment; risk factor; schizophrenia; scoring system; single nucleotide polymorphism"

"Toward understanding the antitumor effects of water-soluble fullerene derivatives on lung cancer cells: apoptosis or autophagy pathways?","2019","Here we report the synthesis and investigation of anticancer effects of a series of water-soluble fullerene derivatives bearing amino acid (F1-F7) and thioacid (F8-F10) residues. Compounds F4 and F10 efficiently inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro while being nontoxic to endothelial cells. It was revealed that the cancer cell death was caused by either autophagy (F4) or apoptosis (F10). Both fullerene derivatives strongly inhibited the tumor growth in the zebrafish xenograft model. In contrast to the vast majority of known cytostatics, fullerene derivatives do not show any significant acute toxicity effects in mice. Importantly, functional groups attached to the carbon cage affect interaction of the compounds with cancer cells, thus enabling realization of two different cell death mechanisms. The obtained results pave a way to the development of a new generation of selective antitumor drugs suppressing efficiently the proliferation of cancer cells while being nontoxic to normal cells. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","adenosine triphosphate; amino acid; antineoplastic agent; carbon; cisplatin; doxorubicin; fullerene derivative; glutathione; propidium iodide; thioacid; A-549 cell line; acute toxicity; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; aqueous solution; Article; autophagy; breathing; cell death; cell proliferation; chemical structure; controlled study; drug synthesis; endothelium cell; gel permeation chromatography; hydrodynamics; in vitro study; LD50; lung cancer; lung cancer cell line; mass spectrometry; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; oxygen consumption; tumor growth; zebra fish"
"First-line afatinib vs gefitinib for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC (LUX-Lung 7): impact of afatinib dose adjustment and analysis of mode of initial progression for patients who continued treatment beyond progression","2019","Purpose: In the randomized phase IIb LUX-Lung 7 trial, afatinib significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and time-to-treatment failure vs gefitinib in patients with treatment-na?ve epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. We report post hoc analyses of tolerability-guided dose adjustment for afatinib and summarize the clinical characteristics of patients who continued afatinib/gefitinib beyond initial radiological progression in LUX-Lung 7. Methods: Patients received afatinib 40?mg/day or gefitinib 250?mg/day until investigator-assessed progression or beyond if beneficial. In case of selected treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), the afatinib dose could be reduced by 10-mg decrements to minimum 20?mg (only dose interruptions were permitted with gefitinib). Results: All randomized patients were treated (afatinib, n = 160; gefitinib, n = 159). Sixty-three patients had afatinib dose reduction (< 40?mg/day; 47 within first 6 months). Dose reduction decreased TRAE incidence/severity (before vs after; all grade/grade 3: 100.0%/63.5% vs 90.5%/23.8%). There was no evidence of significant difference in PFS for patients who received < 40?mg/day vs ? 40?mg/day for the first 6 months [median: 12.8 vs 11.0 months; hazard ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.90–2.00)]. Twenty-four and 26 patients continued afatinib and gefitinib, respectively, beyond progression in target lesions; median time from nadir of target lesion diameters to initial progression was 6.7 months and 5.6 months. Of these patients, ~ 70% had objective response or non-complete response/non-progressive disease in non-target lesions at initial progression.

"Phthalate exposure increases subclinical atherosclerosis in young population","2019","The link between phthalate exposure and the risk of subclinical atherosclerosis in young population remains unclear. This study investigated the association between phthalate exposure and subclinical atherosclerosis, in terms of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), in young population. From a nationwide mass urine screening for renal health, conducted in 1992–2000 among school children 6–18 years of age in Taiwan, we recruited 789 subjects to participate in the cardiovascular health examination in 2006–2008. Among them, 787 received measurements of 7 urinary phthalate metabolites and CIMT. Results showed both mean and maximal values of CIMT at all segments of carotid arteries significantly increased with the urinary mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), ? di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) in a dose-response relationship after adjustment for multiple linear regression models. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher quartiles of urinary concentrations of MEHP, ?DEHP, and MnBP were associated with a higher risk of thicker CIMT. Compared to subjects with the lowest quartile (Q1) of urinary MEHP, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for thicker CIMT among subjects with higher urinary MEHP were 2.13 (1.18–3.84) at Q2, 4.02 (2.26–7.15) at Q3 and 7.39 (4.16–13.12) at the highest Q4.

"Real-world anti-viral treatment decisions among chronic hepatitis C patients in Taiwan: The INITIATE study","2019","Background/Purpose: While direct-acting antiviral regimens have been approved for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients in Taiwan, reimbursement is limited to certain populations. Thus, pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) remains the standard of care for many patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the percentage of CHC patients who were recommended and willing to receive PEG-IFN/RBV, and to identify reasons why patients were not recommended or unwilling to receive treatment. Methods: 822 Taiwanese CHC patients were enrolled from May–August 2016 in this cross-sectional study. PEG-IFN/RBV recommendation and patient willingness to receive treatment were evaluated through surveys. Patient characteristics associated with treatment recommendation and willingness were assessed. Results: 311 (37.8%) patients were recommended PEG-IFN/RBV while 102 (12.4%) were willing to follow treatment recommendation. Rates of recommendation and willingness were lower in treatment-experienced, hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (GT1) and cirrhotic patients, and those treated in Northern Taiwan. Multivariate analyses found factors such as prior treatment experience, GT1, cirrhosis and low hemoglobin levels to be associated with lower recommendation rates while advanced age, GT1 and low baseline viral loads were associated with lower willingness rates. Physicians' top reasons for not recommending PEG-IFN/RBV included the wish to wait for better treatment options (60.3%), prior treatment failure (21.3%) and patients’ advanced age (20.9%). Patients were unwilling to receive treatment mainly due to concerns about side effects (91.4%), the wish to wait for better treatment options (71.3%) and inconvenience (25.4%). Conclusion: A minority of Taiwanese CHC patients were recommended PEG-IFN/RBV, of which few were willing to receive treatment. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","hemoglobin; peginterferon; ribavirin; virus RNA; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; chronic hepatitis C; comorbidity; compensated liver cirrhosis; cross-sectional study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; groups by age; hemoglobin blood level; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; Hepatitis C virus genotype 3; Hepatitis C virus genotype 6; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1a; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1b; human; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; middle aged; multicenter study; nonhuman; observational study; patient-reported outcome; platelet count; prospective study; sex difference; Taiwan; treatment failure; treatment response; virus load; chronic hepatitis C; combination drug therapy; drug effect; genotype; Hepacivirus; multivariate analysis; physiology; statistical model; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Ribavirin; Taiwan; Treatment Failure; Viral Load"
"A quantitative image analysis using MRI for diagnosis of biliary atresia","2019","Purpose: Biliary atresia is a life-threatening disease that needs early diagnosis and management. Recently, MRI images have been used for the diagnosis of biliary atresia with improved accuracy of diagnosis when other imaging modalities such as ultrasonography are equivocal. This study aimed to evaluate the juxta-hilar extrahepatic biliary tree using MRI images to determine a quantitative value for diagnosing biliary atresia. Materials and methods: This retrospective study was approved by the Ethical Committee at Mackey Memorial Hospital (IRB Number: 15MMHIS149e). Between January 2010 and December 2015, twenty-five patients with surgically confirmed biliary atresia were enrolled (age 18–65 days). Another 25 patients with clinically or surgically diagnosed idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (age 6–64 days) and 20 patients with non-hepatobiliary disease (age 6–65 days) were considered control group and normal subjects, respectively. The diameter of the enlarged, T2-hyperintense structure was measured using MRI images by two radiologists both blinded. The cut-off value for a biliary atresia diagnosis was obtained by area under the curve analysis. Results: The diameter of the T2-hyperintense structure at porta hepatis in biliary atresia (4.79 ± 1.14 mm) is larger than in idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (1.72 ± 0.42 mm) or in non-hepatobiliary disease (1.72 ± 0.35 mm) (p < 0.05). The optimum cut-off value for diagnosing biliary atresia was 3.1 mm with 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Conclusion: The value of the enlarged, T2-hyperintense structure measured on MRI images was significantly increased in biliary atresia and may be useful in diagnosing biliary atresia. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Disease control; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Area under the curves; Bile ducts; Biliary atresia; Hepatobiliary disease; Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis; Imaging modality; Quantitative image analysis; Quantitative values; Diagnosis; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bile duct atresia; bilirubin blood level; cholangiography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; echography; female; human; image analysis; intrahepatic bile duct; major clinical study; male; newborn; newborn hepatitis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; radiological parameters; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; abnormalities; bile duct atresia; diagnostic imaging; extrahepatic bile duct; infant; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Bile Ducts, Extrahepatic; Biliary Atresia; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Retrospective Studies; Ultrasonography"
"Novel interleukin-10 gene polymorphism is linked to gestational diabetes in taiwanese population","2019","Objective: The association of interleukin-10 (IL-10) polymorphism with diabetes and its complication was recently established, while there were few researches considering the potential role of IL-10 in gestational diabetes (GDM). This study aimed to investigate the association between IL-10 gene rs1800896 (-1082 A/G), rs1800871 (-819 T/C), rs1800872 (-592 A/C), and rs3021094 (3388 A/C) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and GDM susceptibility. Methods: This study included 72 GDM patients and 100 healthy pregnant women. Direct sequencing of the products from polymerase chain reactions of the extracted genomic DNA from study subjects were conducted for analyzing IL-10 gene polymorphism and further genotype frequencies were compared. Plasma IL-10 concentration was measured by ELISA method. Results: The results revealed no significant difference in-592 A/C,-819 T/C, and-1082 A/G genotypes. Significantly increased prevalence of A allele (P = 0.028, OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.081-2.64) and A/A genotype (P = 0.031, OR = 2.881, 95% CI = 1.145-7.250) at a previously un-characterized rs3021094 SNP were discovered in the GDM group. Increased IL-10 levels and insulin resistance were also related to the genotype of rs3021094. The risk of GDM was increased when IL-10 level was over 6.5 pg/ml. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that A allele and A/A genotype of rs3021094 SNP in IL-10 gene were linked to increased risk for GDM, IL-10 plasma level and insulin resistance, which could be potential targets for early screening and detection of GDM. ? 2019 Kang, Liu, Lee, Li, Yang, Huang, Lin and Jou.","C peptide; cholesterol; genomic DNA; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; insulin; interleukin 10; low density lipoprotein; metformin; triacylglycerol; adult; antidiabetic activity; Article; birth weight; chest circumference; controlled study; DNA extraction; DNA polymorphism; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gene frequency; genetic linkage; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genotype; gestational age; glucose blood level; head circumference; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin resistance; lipid fingerprinting; major clinical study; newborn; oral glucose tolerance test; polymerase chain reaction; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; promoter region; retrospective study; single nucleotide polymorphism; Taiwanese"
"Trends in prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus from 2005 to 2014 in Taiwan","2019","Background/Purpose: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and DM-related complications place a high socioeconomic burden on individuals and society. Updating nationwide information periodically is thus pivotal to preventing DM and improving its management in Taiwan. Methods: We used the National Health Insurance Research Database; disease diagnosis codes were assigned according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification. DM was defined as ?3 outpatient visits or 1 hospitalization within a year. We excluded individuals with gestational DM, those with missing data, and those aged >100 years. Type 1 DM (T1DM) was defined based on information from the catastrophic illness registry. Results: From 2005 to 2014, total population with DM increased by 66% and age-standardized prevalence in patients aged 20–79 years increased by 41%. The DM prevalence was generally higher in men; however, the prevalence was higher in women aged ?65 years. The prevalence of DM was approximately 50% in those aged >80 years. DM incidence increased by 19%; the increase was most obvious in patients aged 20–39 years (p < 0.001). The standardized incidence of T1DM slightly decreased by 11% (p = 0.118) and standardized prevalence of T1DM increased from 0.04% to 0.05%. Number of T1DM accounted for 0.51–0.59% of the entire diabetic population during the observation period. Conclusion: DM prevalence is continually increasing, but the incidence only marginally increased from 2005 to 2014. Moreover, DM is a major problem in elderly people. The higher incidence of DM in men is consistent with the pandemic of overweight and obesity in men in Taiwan. ? 2019","adult; aged; Article; data base; female; hospitalization; human; ICD-9-CM; incidence; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major clinical study; male; national health insurance; prevalence; Taiwan; terminal disease"
"Metformin reduces risk of benign nodular goiter in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus","2019","Background: Whether metformin might affect the risk of benign nodular goite r in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has not been investigated. Methods: Patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus during 1999-2005 were enrolled from Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. Analyses were conducted in a propensity score matched-pairs of 20,048 ever users and 20,048 never users of metformin. The patients were followed until December 31, 2011, for the incidence of benign nodular goiter. Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. Results: Among the never users and ever users of metformin, 392 and 221 cases were diagnosed of benign nodular goiter during follow-up, with incidence of 457.88 and 242.45 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The overall hazard ratio for ever versus never users was 0.527 (95% confidence inte rval: 0.447-0.621). When cumulative duration of metformin therapy was divided into tertiles, the hazard ratios for the first (<25.3 months), second (25.3-57.3 months) and third (>57.3 months) tertiles were 0.815 (0.643-1.034), 0.648 (0.517-0.812) and 0.255 (0.187-0.348), respectively. Sensitivity analyses estimating the overall hazard ratios for p atients enrolled in each specific year from 1999 to 2005 consistently showed a lower risk of benign nodular goiter among users of metformin. Conclusion: Metformin use is associated with a lower risk of benign nodula r goiter in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ? 2019 European Society of Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain.","acarbose; insulin; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; rosiglitazone; sulfonylurea derivative; antidiabetic agent; metformin; aged; Article; benign nodular goiter; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetic patient; female; follow up; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; national health insurance; nodular goiter; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pharmaceutical care; population research; prescription; priority journal; retrospective study; risk reduction; treatment duration; complication; insulin resistance; middle aged; nodular goiter; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physiology; proportional hazards model; risk factor; Taiwan; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Goiter, Nodular; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Diagnosing the RGS11 Lung Cancer Biomarker: The Integration of Competitive Immunoassay and Isothermal Nucleic Acid Exponential Amplification Reaction","2019","Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide, which makes the identification of reliable lung cancer biomarkers a pressing need for early diagnosis and prognosis. RGS11, which is a regulator of G-protein signaling and also a lung cancer biomarker, plays an important role in cancer-related metastasis. However, trace levels of RGS11 (in the range of pg/mL) in serum samples make it difficult to quantify using currently available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and, therefore, this hinders progress in the discovery of new approaches for treating lung cancer. The aim of this study is to develop a rapid, sensitive, and reliable platform for the detection of RGS11 lung cancer biomarker based on a suspension immunoassay coupled with an isothermal exponential amplification strategy. Our study was initiated by the functionalization of magnetic beads with anti-RGS11 antibodies (Ab-MB) by EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-carbodiimide)/NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide) activation. Ab-MB served as a sensing probe for the competitive immunorecognitions between known concentrations of His-tag RGS11 and unknown concentrations of target RGS11 in serum. The reporter anti-His antibodies, which were modified with primers that induced an isothermal exponential amplification reaction, were subsequently introduced to the reaction mixture that resulted in the formation of immunosandwich complexes. The exponentially amplified DNA duplex that was intercalated with SYBR Green was designated as a signal reporter for the assessment of RGS11 in an inversely proportional relationship. The sensing platform was excellent for the determination of RGS11 with an exceptional detection limit of 148 fg/mL and a linear dynamic range of 0.1-10 pg/mL using a minimal sample volume (20 μL) and with a reaction time of 1.5 h. In addition, we challenged the sensing platform with RGS11-spiked samples (in 2× diluted serum), and an acceptable recovery rate (>90%) was observed. Finally, 24 clinical samples acquired from patients with advanced lung cancer (C), inflammation (I), and heart failure (H) were analyzed by this newly developed sensing platform and a commercial ELISA kit for validation. This sensing platform has potential in biomedical applications for clinically diagnosing liquid biopsy samples for patients with lung cancer. Moreover, the universal design of our proposed system is easily adapted to detect any other protein if a His-tag recombinant protein is available. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Antibodies; Biological organs; Biomarkers; Body fluids; Diagnosis; Diseases; Immunology; Isotherms; Medical applications; Nucleic acids; Pathology; Recombinant proteins; Amplification strategy; Biomedical applications; Competitive immunoassay; Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Functionalizations; Linear dynamic ranges; Minimal sample volume; Proportional relationships; Amplification"
"Chronic disseminated candidiasis manifesting as hepatosplenic abscesses among patients with hematological malignancies","2019","Background: The outcomes of deep-seated abscesses attributed to chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC) in patients with hematological malignancies have rarely been reported in recent years. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the data of patients with hematological malignancies who received a diagnosis of CDC at a medical center in Taiwan between 2008 and 2013. Results: Sixty-one patients (32 men and 29 women) were diagnosed with CDC. The median age was 51 years (range: 18-83). The overall incidence of CDC was 1.53 per 100 patient-years in patients with hematological malignancies between 2008 and 2013. The highest incidence of CDC was 4.3 per 100 patient-years for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, followed by 3.6 for acute myeloid leukemia. We detected 3 (4.9%) proven, 13 (21.3%) probable, and 45 (73.8%) possible cases of CDC. A total of 13 patients had positive blood cultures for Candida species: C. tropicalis (8), C. albicans (2), C. glabrata (2), and C. famata (1). The median duration of antifungal treatment was 96 days (range: 7-796 days). Serial imaging studies revealed that the resolution rate of CDC was 30.0% at 3 months and 54.3% at 6 months. Five patients (8.2%) had residual lesions that persisted beyond one year. A multivariate analysis of the 90-day outcome revealed that shock was the only independent prognostic factor of 90-day survival in patients with CDC. Conclusion: The incidence of CDC did not decrease between 2008 and 2013. Patients with acute leukemia had a higher risk of CDC than those with other hematological malignancies. Imaging studies conducted at 6 months after diagnosis revealed that only half of the patients showed complete resolution. CDC requires prolonged treatment, and serial imaging at 6 months interval is suggested. Shock is the only independent prognostic factor of 90-day survival in patients with CDC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","antifungal agent; micafungin; nystatin; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; adolescent; adult; aged; allogeneic stem cell transplantation; Article; Candida albicans; Candida glabrata; Candida tropicalis; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; Debaryomyces hansenii; disease duration; female; fungus culture; hematologic malignancy; human; incidence; infection risk; invasive candidiasis; liver abscess; major clinical study; male; mortality; outcome assessment; prognosis; retrospective study; shock; spleen abscess; survival time; Taiwan; treatment duration; Candida; candidiasis; chronic disease; complication; diagnostic imaging; hematologic disease; liver abscess; microbiology; middle aged; pathogenicity; spleen disease; survival rate; very elderly; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antifungal Agents; Candida; Candidiasis; Chronic Disease; Female; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Liver Abscess; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Splenic Diseases; Survival Rate; Taiwan"
"AKR1C1 controls cisplatin-resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma through cross-talk with the STAT1/3 signaling pathway","2019","Background: Cisplatin is the first-line chemotherapy used against most upper aerodigestive tract carcinomas. In head and neck cancer, sensitivity to cisplatin remains the key issue in treatment response and outcome. Genetic heterogeneity and aberrant gene expression may be the intrinsic factors that cause primary cisplatin-resistance. Methods: Combination of the HNSCC gene expression data and the cisplatin sensitivity results from public database. We found that aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1) may be associated with cisplatin sensitivity in HNSCC treatment of na?ve cells. We examined the AKR1C1 expression and its correlation with cisplatin IC50 and prognosis in patients. The in vitro and in vivo AKR1C1 functions in cisplatin-resistance through overexpression or knockdown assays, respectively. cDNA microarrays were used to identify the upstream regulators that modulate AKR1C1-induced signaling in HNSCC. Finally, we used the cigarette metabolites to promote AKR1C1 expression and ruxolitinib to overcome AKR1C1-induced cisplatin-resistance. Results: AKR1C1 positively correlates to cisplatin-resistance in HNSCC cells. AKR1C1 is a poor prognostic factor for recurrence and death of HNSCC patients. Silencing of AKR1C1 not only reduced in vitro IC50 but also increased in vivo cisplatin responses and vise versa in overexpression cells. Cigarette metabolites also promote AKR1C1 expression. Transcriptome analyses revealed that STAT1 and STAT3 activation enable AKR1C1-induced cisplatin-resistance and can be overcome by ruxolitinib treatment. Conclusions: AKR1C1 is a crucial regulator for cisplatin-resistance in HNSCC and also poor prognostic marker for patients. Targeting the AKR1C1-STAT axis may provide a new therapeutic strategy to treat patients who are refractory to cisplatin treatment. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aldo keto reductase; aldo keto reductase family 1 member C1; cisplatin; complementary DNA; ruxolitinib; STAT1 protein; STAT3 protein; transcriptome; unclassified drug; 3 alpha-beta, 20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 3alpha(or 20beta) hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; antineoplastic agent; autacoid; caspase; cisplatin; protein kinase inhibitor; STAT1 protein; STAT1 protein, human; STAT3 protein; transcriptome; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; DNA microarray; drug sensitivity; gene expression; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; gene regulatory network; gene silencing; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; molecular interaction; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; animal; apoptosis; biological model; cell survival; disease model; drug effect; drug screening; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; mortality; pathology; prognosis; tumor cell line; 20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Caspases; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Cisplatin; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Mice; Models, Biological; Prognosis; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Signal Transduction; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; STAT1 Transcription Factor; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Transcriptome; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Impact of antiretroviral therapy containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate on the survival of patients with HBV and HIV coinfection","2019","Background: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is active against both HBV and HIV. Whether the introduction of TDF-containing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the outcome of HIV/HBV-coinfected patients remains unclear in areas of higher HBV endemicity. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of newly diagnosed antiretroviral-na?ve HIV-infected patients between 2007 and 2015. Four groups of patients were defined, according to the HBV status and availability of TDF for HIV treatment in Taiwan in 2011. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Results: During the 9-year study period, 1,723 HIV-infected patients were included, with a median age of 31?years and baseline CD4 count of 273 cells per μL. The HBV seroprevalence had declined from 18.1% (125/692) in the pre-TDF era to 10.1% (104/1031) in the post-TDF era. The respective mortality rate for HIV/HBV-coinfected and HIV-monoinfected patients in the pre-TDF era was 23.2 (95% CI, 12.5-43.1) and 9.6 (95% CI, 6.1-15.0) deaths per 1000 person-years of follow-up [PYFU], and the respective mortality rate in the post-TDF era was 15.7 (95% CI, 7.0-34.8) and 8.0 (95% CI, 5.5-11.6) deaths per 1000 PYFU. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis among HIV/HBV-coinfected patients compared to HIV-monoinfected patients was 2.79 (95% CI, 1.25-6.22) in pre-TDF era and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.45-2.72) in post-TDF era. Conclusions: In this country of high HBV endemicity, the adverse impact of chronic HBV infection on the survival observed in the pre-TDF era has significantly diminished among HIV/HBV-coinfected patients compared to HIV-monoinfected patients in the era of TDF-containing cART. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Identifying individual risk rare variants using protein structure guided local tests (POINT)","2019","Rare variants are of increasing interest to genetic association studies because of their etiological contributions to human complex diseases. Due to the rarity of the mutant events, rare variants are routinely analyzed on an aggregate level. While aggregation analyses improve the detection of global-level signal, they are not able to pinpoint causal variants within a variant set. To perform inference on a localized level, additional information, e.g., biological annotation, is often needed to boost the information content of a rare variant. Following the observation that important variants are likely to cluster together on functional domains, we propose a protein structure guided local test (POINT) to provide variant-specific association information using structure-guided aggregation of signal. Constructed under a kernel machine framework, POINT performs local association testing by borrowing information from neighboring variants in the 3-dimensional protein space in a data-adaptive fashion. Besides merely providing a list of promising variants, POINT assigns each variant a p-value to permit variant ranking and prioritization. We assess the selection performance of POINT using simulations and illustrate how it can be used to prioritize individual rare variants in PCSK9, ANGPTL4 and CETP in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial data. ? 2019 Marceau West et al.","angiopoietin related protein 4; cholesterol ester transfer protein; proprotein convertase 9; angiopoietin related protein 4; ANGPTL4 protein, human; CETP protein, human; cholesterol ester transfer protein; PCSK9 protein, human; proprotein convertase 9; ANGPTL4 gene; Article; CETP gene; controlled study; genetic database; genetic risk; genetic variability; genotype; information processing; molecular genetics; PCSK9 gene; protein analysis; protein structure guided local test; protein structure, function and variability; simulation; three dimensional imaging; biological model; biology; computer simulation; DNA sequence; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; human; procedures; protein tertiary structure; risk factor; Angiopoietin-like 4 Protein; Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Humans; Models, Genetic; Proprotein Convertase 9; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Risk Factors; Sequence Analysis, DNA"
"HapticSphere: Physical support to enable precision touch interaction in mobile mixed-reality","2019","This work presents HapticSphere, a wearable spherical surface enabled by bridging a finger and the head-mounted display (HMD) with a passive string. Users perceive a physical support on a finger attached to a string, when extending their arm and reaching out to the string's maximum extension. This physical support assists users in precise touch interaction in the context of stationary and walking virtual or mixed-reality experiences. We propose three methods of attachment of the haptic string (directly on the head or on the body), and illustrate a novel single-step calibration algorithm that supports these configurations by estimating a grand haptic sphere, once a head-coordinated touch interaction is established. Two user studies were conducted to validate our approach and to compare the touch performance with physical support in sitting and walking conditions in the context of mobile mixed-reality scenarios. The results show that, in the walking condition, touch interaction with physical support significantly outperformed the visual-only condition. ? 2019 IEEE.","Flow visualization; Helmet mounted displays; Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Visualization; Walking aids; Wearable technology; Centered computing; Human; Tree-maps; Visualization designs; Visualization technique; Mixed reality"
"Regulation of liver receptor homologue-1 by DDB2 E3 ligase activity is critical for hepatic glucose metabolism","2019","Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) plays a critical role in hepatic metabolism and disease. Here we show that LRH-1 protein stability is regulated by the cullin 4 (CUL4) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. We found that DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2) directly interacts with LRH-1 and functions as a substrate recognition component of CUL4-DDB1 to promote LRH-1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, we observed that protein levels of endogenous LRH-1 are increased by insulin without a change in mRNA levels of LRH-1. However, overexpression of DDB2 impaired the insulin-stimulated increase in LRH-1 levels. In addition, DDB2 overexpression decreased LRH-1 transcriptional activation and expression of target genes, such as glucokinase, whereas knockdown of DDB2 increased the expression of glucokinase. Finally, we demonstrated that DDB2 knockdown increases glucose uptake and intracellular levels of glucose-6-phosphate in HepG2 cells. Our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of LRH-1 activity and suggests a role for DDB2 in hepatic glucose metabolism. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of tetracyclic azafluorenone derivatives with topoisomerase I inhibitory properties as potential anticancer agents","2019","Several 9-chloro-11H-indeno[1,2-c]quinolin-11-one derivatives have been designed which is replacing side chains with different groups containing oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms.

"Bilateral Congenital Corneal Opacities as an Early-Onset Ocular Feature of Kabuki Syndrome","2019","PURPOSE: Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by multiple systemic anomalies and unique facial characteristics. Here, we present the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of bilateral congenital corneal opacities as an early-onset ocular manifestation of KS associated with a KMT2D gene mutation. METHODS: The proband is a girl. At birth, bilateral corneal opacities, short fifth fingers, patent ductus arteriosus, absence of the uvula, and an ectopic kidney on the right side were noted. Ophthalmic examinations revealed vascularized, nonhomogeneous opacities in both corneas; to prevent deprivation amblyopia, bilateral corneal transplantations were performed. RESULTS: At 1 year and 10 months of age, she was referred by a general practitioner to our pediatric endocrinologist for failure to thrive. Genetic analysis at that age revealed the presence of a KMT2D gene mutation, and the patient was diagnosed with KS. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical diagnosis of KS is challenging because the most remarkable facial features are not evident until early childhood. In this case, bilateral congenital corneal opacities were identified as an early-onset ocular manifestation of KS. KS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with bilateral congenital corneal opacities.","DNA binding protein; KMT2D protein, human; tumor protein; abnormalities; case report; cornea opacity; face; female; genetics; hematologic disease; human; infant; multiple malformation syndrome; mutation; pathology; vestibular disorder; Abnormalities, Multiple; Corneal Opacity; DNA-Binding Proteins; Face; Female; Hematologic Diseases; Humans; Infant; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Vestibular Diseases"
"A phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial of oral TSR-011 in patients with advanced solid tumours and lymphomas","2019","Background: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements are oncogenic drivers in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TSR-011 is a dual ALK and tropomyosin-related kinase (TRK) inhibitor, active against ALK inhibitor resistant tumours in preclinical studies. Here, we report the safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TSR-011 in patients with relapsed or refractory ALK- and TRK-positive advanced cancers. Methods: In this sequential, open-label, phase 1 trial (NCT02048488), patients received doses of 30 mg, escalated to 480 mg every 24 hours (Q24h), followed by an expansion cohort of patients with ALK-positive cancers. The primary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics. Results: TSR-011 320- and 480-mg Q24h doses exceeded the maximum tolerated dose. At the RP2D of 40 mg every 8 hours (Q8h), the most common grade 3–4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 3.2–6.5% of patients. Of 14 ALK inhibitor-naive patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, 6 experienced partial responses and 8 had stable disease. Conclusions: At the RP2D (40 mg Q8h), TSR-011 demonstrated a favourable safety profile with acceptable QTc changes. Limited clinical activity was observed. Based on the competitive ALK inhibitor landscape and benefit/risk considerations, further TSR-011 development was discontinued.

"EGCG regulation of non-insulin-responsive endosomal compartments in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle","2019","Tea consumption reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but how (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in tea, mediates glucose transporter (GLUT)-containing vesicles in muscle cells is still unknown. This study investigated the hypothesis that EGCG can stimulate glucose transport by regulating endosome-specific signaling control systems, thus enhancing glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells. To understand the relationship between the endosomal system and the EGCG-regulated pathway in skeletal muscle, the insulin-resistance L6 myotubes, induced by palmitate treatment, were treated with vesicle ablation, actin filament disruption and signaling inhibition and results were analyzed. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated human transferrin was localized to endosomes in the cells, followed by incubation with diaminobenzidine/H2O2. The unablated cell-associated glucose uptake was determined using quantitative fluorescence assay. Ablation of endosomal compartments showed that insulin had little effect on the endosomal recycling pathway, and it mainly affected GLUT4 storage vesicles. Conversely, EGCG stimulated endosomal compartments to facilitate glucose transport using a mechanism independent of the actin-based cytoskeletal transit system. Both Akt and atypical protein kinase C, the downstream effectors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), participated in the development of palmitate-induced muscle cells insulin resistance. However, EGCG-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated using a PI3K-independent mechanism that involves silent information regulator 1. Thus, glucose transport is regulated by at least two signal cascades and by two types of vesicles, and EGCG can improve glucose uptake in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle through the non-insulin-responsive endosomal pathway. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",""
"Irradiated ears in nasopharyngeal carcinoma survivors: A review","2019","This article reviews the literature on otological complications in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) survivals after irradiation during the past three decades. Symptoms of the irradiated ears were assessed from the external ear canal, through the middle ear cavity including the Eustachian tube, and to the inner ear compartments. The development of radioimaging diagnostic techniques, the introduction from adjuvant chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and the invention of radiotherapeutic equipment to intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) have increased the survival rate of NPC patients during the past 30 years. The prevalence of cochlear and vestibular deficits has decreased a lot, whereas middle ear complications (i.e., otitis media with effusion and radiation-induced otitis media) do not decline in NPC survivors even in the IMRT era, probably because the medial half of the Eustachian tube receives > 95% of the total dose despite 2DRT or IMRT.

"Influenza B viruses in pigs, Taiwan","2019","Background: Influenza B viruses (IBVs) have never been isolated from natural-infected pigs in clinical cases, although the susceptibility of domestic pigs to experimental IBV infections had been confirmed as well as IBV-specific antibodies were detected from pigs under natural and experimental conditions. Objectives: We aimed to assess and investigate the activities for infection and circulation of IBVs in pigs. Methods: Annual active surveys for influenza have been implemented on swine populations in Taiwan since July 1998. Nasal swabs, trachea, lungs, and blood from pigs were tested using virological and serological assays for influenza. Gene sequences of influenza viral isolates were determined and characterized. Preliminary sero-epidemiological data for influenza virus were investigated. Results: Three strains of IBV were isolated and identified from natural-infected pigs in 2014. Genetic characterization revealed the highest identities (>99%) of molecular sequence with the contemporary IBVs belonged to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 genetic clade of Victoria lineage in the phylogenetic trees for all 8 genes. IBV-specific antibodies were detected in 31 (0.2%; 95%CI: 0.1%-0.2%) of 15?983 swine serum samples from 29 (2.8%; 95%CI: 1.9%-3.9%) of 1039 farm visits under annual active surveys from 2007 through 2017. Seropositive cases have been found sparsely in 1-5 of test prefectures every year except 2015 and 2017 as well as scattered loosely over 26 townships/districts of 11 prefectures in Taiwan cumulatively in 11?years. Conclusions: Influenza B viruse infections from humans to pigs remained sporadic and accidental currently in Taiwan but might have paved potential avenues for newly emerging zoonotic influenza in the future. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Cordyceps cicadae mycelia and its active compound HEA exert beneficial effects on blood glucose in type 2 diabetic db/db mice","2019","BACKGROUND: This is the first study to investigate the therapeutic effects of Cordyceps cicadae (C. cicadae) mycelia and its active compound N6-(2-hydroxyethyl)adenosine (HEA) on blood glucose in genetically diabetic mice. RESULTS: Forty mice, 9 weeks of age, were divided into normal control, diabetic control, and three C. cicadae mycelia treated diabetic groups. After 9 weeks of continuous supplementation, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance index showed significant glucose tolerance with C. cicadae mycelia. Furthermore, the effect of HEA is similar to that of C. cicadae mycelia in an OGTT, suggesting that HEA could be the major factor responsible for the functional properties of C. cicadae mycelia. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, it is suggested that the therapeutic effect of C. cicadae mycelia may be driven by one of its active components, HEA, which could alleviate many diabetes complications in genetically obese mice and may offer promise as a supplement for diabetes management. ? 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. ? 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","insulin; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; Cordyceps; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; human; inbred mouse strain; male; metabolism; mouse; mycelium; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Animals; Blood Glucose; Cordyceps; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Insulin; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred Strains; Mycelium"
"Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in the Real World: A Population-Based Cohort Study","2019","Objective: To determine and compare the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality of febuxostat and allopurinol use. Patients and Methods: We conducted a cohort study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. New users of febuxostat and allopurinol between April 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 were identified, and the two groups were 1:1 matched by propensity score, benzbromarone use history, renal impairment, and time of drug initiation. The risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), venous thromboembolism (VTE), heart failure (HF) hospitalization, atrial fibrillation hospitalization, cardiovascular (CV) death, and all-cause mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. The dose-response relationship between xanthine oxidase inhibitor use and adverse CV outcomes were also determined. Results: A total of 44,111 patients were included for each group, and all baseline covariates were well matched. Febuxostat users were at a significantly higher risk for HF hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.13-1.33), atrial fibrillation hospitalization (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.36), and CV death (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.36) than allopurinol users, whereas no difference was found for the major adverse cardiac events composite endpoint, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. The elevated risk of HF hospitalization was consistent throughout the primary and sensitivity analyses. In addition, febuxostat increased the risk of adverse CV outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: The use of febuxostat, compared with allopurinol, was associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse CV events. Higher febuxostat doses had a greater impact. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms linking febuxostat to adverse CV outcomes. ? 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research","allopurinol; benzbromarone; febuxostat; allopurinol; antigout agent; febuxostat; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; atrial fibrillation; brain ischemia; cardiovascular disease assessment; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug safety; drug withdrawal; female; heart failure; heart infarction; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; medical history; outcome assessment; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; venous thromboembolism; cardiovascular disease; comparative study; factual database; gout; mortality; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; Aged; Allopurinol; Cardiovascular Diseases; Databases, Factual; Febuxostat; Female; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Hirsutanol A attenuates lipopolysaccharide-mediated matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression and cytokines production and improves endotoxemia-induced acute sickness behavior and acute lung injury","2019","Activated human monocytes/macrophages, which increase the levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, are the essential mechanisms for the progression of sepsis. In the present study, we determined the functions and mechanisms of hirsutanolA (HA), which is isolated from the red alga-derived marine fungus Chondrostereum sp. NTOU4196, on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators produced from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated THP-1 cells. Our results showed that HA suppressed LPS-triggered MMP-9-mediated gelatinolysis and expression of protein and mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner without effects on TIMP-1 activity. Also, HA significantly attenuated the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β from LPS-treated THP-1 cells. Moreover, HA significantly inhibited LPS-mediated STAT3 (Tyr705) phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and ERK1/2 activation in THP-1 cells. In an LPS-induced endotoxemia mouse model, studies indicated that HA pretreatment improved endotoxemia-induced acute sickness behavior, including acute motor deficits and anxiety-like behavior. HA also attenuated LPS-induced phospho-STAT3 and pro-MMP-9 activity in the hippocampus. Notably, HA reduced pathologic lung injury features, including interstitial tissue edema, infiltration of inflammatory cells and alveolar collapse. Likewise, HA suppressed the induction of phospho-STAT3 and pro-MMP-9 in lung tissues. In conclusion, our results provide pharmacological evidence that HA could be a useful agent for treating inflammatory diseases, including sepsis. ? 2019 by the authors.","antiinflammatory agent; gelatinase B; hirsutanol A; I kappa B kinase alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; STAT3 protein; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; cytokine; gelatinase B; hirsutanol A; lipopolysaccharide; sesquiterpene; acute lung injury; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; anxiety disorder; Article; attenuation; body weight loss; cell viability; controlled study; cytokine production; drug determination; drug effect; endotoxemia; enzyme activation; gene expression; hippocampus; human; human cell; inflammatory cell; lung edema; lung infiltrate; male; motor dysfunction; mouse; nonhuman; protein degradation; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; THP-1 cell line; acute lung injury; animal; C57BL mouse; complication; drug effect; endotoxemia; illness behavior; lung; metabolism; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Acute Lung Injury; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytokines; Endotoxemia; Humans; Illness Behavior; Lipopolysaccharides; Lung; Male; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Sesquiterpenes; Signal Transduction; THP-1 Cells"

"Bevacizumab dose affects the severity of adverse events in gynecologic malignancies","2019","In this retrospective study, we investigated adverse events and outcomes in patients treated with bevacizumab for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers at a single hospital. We determined the cumulative incidences of various bevacizumab-related adverse events and the correlation between dose and adverse event incidences. We analyzed data from 154 patients that received 251 rounds of bevacizumab as first-line, first salvage, >2 salvage treatments. Adverse events of any grade were observed in 121 (78.6%) patients; at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event occurred in 32 (20.8%) patients. The two most common events were proteinuria (38.3%) and hypertension (33.8%). The first-line treatment group displayed significantly higher frequencies of hypertension (52.7% vs. 18.9% vs. 15.5%, p < 0.001), wound complications (9.1% vs. 0% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.010), arthralgia (29.1% vs. 11.3% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.003), and reduced range of joint motion (14.5% vs. 5.7% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.046), compared to those in the first and >2 lines salvage groups, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis test). The cumulative incidences of all grades and grades 3/4 of hypertension cumulative incidence plateaued at around 30% for all grades and 10% for grades 3 and 4, at bevacizumab doses above 8080 and 3510 mg, respectively. The proteinuria cumulative incidence plateaued at around 35% for all grades and 3% for grades 3 and 4, at bevacizumab doses above 11,190 and 4530 mg, respectively. We concluded that, in this realistic clinical population, different kinds and higher cumulative incidences of adverse events were observed compared to those reported in previous clinical trials. Moreover, bevacizumab doses showed cumulative toxicity and plateau effects on hypertension and proteinuria. Copyright ? 2019 Lee, Hsu, Tai, Chen, Chiang, Chen and Cheng.

"Electropolymerised-hemin-catalysed reduction and analysis of tartrazine and sunset yellow","2019","Colourants are widely added in various foods; nevertheless, recent research has revealed that the azo-colourants in foods pose a potential risk to human health. In the present study, the electropolymerised hemin electrode was demonstrated to efficiently catalyse the reduction of azo-colourants. Taking advantage of the ability of cyclic protoporphyrin to exhibit π?π stacking interactions with azo compounds and the capability of the central ferric ion to electrostatically attract the negatively charged sulfonate group, sulphonated azo compounds were readily adsorbed by hemin molecules, facilitating the redox reaction of azo compounds. In response to 2 μM tartrazine (TT), the hemin-functionalised electrode exhibited a well-defined wave in square wave voltammograms (SWVs), and the wave current was approximately 5-fold greater than the signal yielded with the bare electrode. The parameters of hemin electropolymerisation yielding the maximum sensitivity were investigated, leading to a limit of detection of 360 nM (n = 3). Furthermore, simultaneous analysis of TT and sunset yellow (SY) in a mixture was demonstrated to be feasible, with well-separated (ΔE = 160 mV) voltammetric peaks obtained that corresponded to TT and SY. The electrode was also successfully tested with a drink-mimicking sample, indicating the negligible effects of oxygen and ions on analytical performance. To gain insight into the advanced catalytic property, catalytic kinetics were analysed, which revealed that the number of electrons transferred was 1.63 (for TT) and 1.67 (for SY). The reaction order of TT and SY was 2.7 and 1.8, respectively. The Tafel slope of TT and SY, derived from the polarisation curves, was 172 and 86 mV dec?1, respectively, and an approximately 33% increase in the exchange current was obtained compared with when the unmodified electrode was employed. The catalytic performance supports that electropolymerised hemin is a superior catalyst with promise for practical application in the detection of azo-colourants. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electrodes; Health risks; Redox reactions; Azo-colourants; Catalytic reduction; Hemin; Sunset yellows; Tartrazine; Dyes"
"First-line afatinib for the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer in the ‘real-world’ clinical setting","2019","Afatinib is an ErbB family blocker that is approved for the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pivotal randomized clinical studies demonstrated that afatinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with platinum-based chemotherapy (LUX-Lung 3, LUX-Lung 6), and with gefitinib (LUX-Lung 7), with manageable side effects. However, these results were derived from controlled studies conducted in selected patients and are not necessarily representative of real-world use of afatinib. To gain a broader understanding of the effectiveness and safety of first-line afatinib, we have undertaken a literature review of real-world studies that have assessed its use in a variety of patient populations. We focused on patients with uncommon EGFR mutations, brain metastases, or those of advanced age, as these patients are often excluded from clinical studies but are regularly seen in routine clinical practice. The available real-world studies suggest that afatinib has clinical activity, and is tolerable, in diverse patient populations in an everyday clinical practice setting. Moreover, consistent with LUX-Lung 7, several real-world comparative studies indicate that afatinib might confer better efficacy than first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Tolerability-guided dose adjustment, undertaken in 21–68% of patients in clinical practice, did not appear to reduce the efficacy of afatinib. Taken together, these findings provide further support for the use of afatinib as a treatment option in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. ?

"Healthcare needs and quality of life in youths with congenital heart disease: Health-promoting behaviors as a mediator","2019","Purpose: The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between healthcare needs, health-promoting behaviors and quality of life (QoL) of youths with congenital heart disease (CHD), and to determine whether health-promoting behaviors were a mediating variable. Design and methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted recruiting 205 youths aged 15 to 24 with either ventricular septal defect (VSD) or tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect demographic information; furthermore, the thickness of the triceps skinfold was measured. The Healthcare Needs Scale for Youth with CHD, Adolescent Health Promotion-short form scale, and World Health Organization QoL-BREF scale were administered, and Pearson's correlation, multiple regressions, and the Sobel test were conducted. Results: The triceps skinfold of participants with VSD was significantly thicker than that of participants with TOF (p < 0.05). Healthcare needs, health-promoting behaviors, and QoL were positively correlated. The overall health-promoting behaviors served as a partial mediator between overall healthcare needs and QoL, accounting for 40.1% of the total variation. Conclusions: The study illustrates that health-promoting behaviors have an impact on healthcare needs and QoL of youths with CHD. The development of tailored health consulting interventions to fulfill healthcare needs is required to improve physical and psychosocial wellness among youths with CHD. Practice implications: Targeting individual and public health strategies for enhancing health-promoting behaviors should be integrated in CHD care planning. ? 2019",""
"The impact of national viral hepatitis therapy program and hepatitis B vaccination program on mortality from acute and chronic viral hepatitis in Taiwan","2019","Background: In Taiwan, the national hepatitis B virus vaccination program and national viral hepatitis therapy program were implemented to control the infections of hepatitis viruses and their progressive illnesses. Studies have evaluated the impacts of two national health programs on many liver-related diseases, but not on acute and chronic viral hepatitis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact on the mortality of acute and chronic viral hepatitis. Methods: Poisson regression models were used to estimate the adjusted rate ratios of the different period groups and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for childhood, adulthood and elderhood, and to estimate the adjusted rate ratios of vaccinated cohorts and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results: Compared with period of 2000–2003, the adjusted rate ratios for period groups of 2008–2011 and 2012–2015 reported a significantly increasing risk of acute and chronic viral hepatitis mortality, except for the childhood and female adulthood. For population without vaccination, the adjusted rate ratios of acute and chronic viral hepatitis B mortality were 0.99 (95% CIs 0.88–1.12), 1.30 (95% CIs 1.17–1.45) and 1.42 (95% CIs 1.28–1.55) for periods of 2004–2007, 2008–2011 and 2012–2015, respectively, comparing with unimplemented period of national viral hepatitis therapy program. Compared with 1967–1983 cohorts, the adjusted rate ratio of 1984–2000 cohorts was 0.46 (95% CIs 0.28–0.75), and the adjusted rate ratios were 0.49 (95% CIs 0.28–0.87) and 0.35 (95% CIs 0.11–1.05) for male and female, respectively. Conclusion: This study revealed the significantly higher mortality rates of acute and chronic viral hepatitis during the implemented period of national viral hepatitis therapy program, comparing the unimplemented period. Such ineffectiveness may be attributable to the low coverage rate. The national vaccination program was currently an effective strategy for controlling the mortality of viral hepatitis. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.","hepatitis B vaccine; antivirus agent; hepatitis vaccine; acute hepatitis B; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; child; chronic hepatitis B; disease duration; female; health care system; health program; health service; high risk population; human; ICD-9; infant; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; mortality risk; population research; priority journal; Taiwan; vaccination; vaccination coverage; very elderly; age; chronic hepatitis B; epidemiology; hepatitis B; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; preventive health service; public health; sex factor; Taiwan; trends; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Immunization Programs; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; National Health Programs; Sex Factors; Taiwan; Vaccination Coverage; Viral Hepatitis Vaccines; Young Adult"
"Functioning and quality of life in patients with somatic symptom disorder: The association with comorbid depression","2019","Objectives: Patients with somatic symptoms often have impaired functioning and reduced quality of life (QOL), but the factors identified as responsible for these impairments vary between studies. We examined functioning and QOL in patients with somatic symptom disorder (SSD), exploring their associations with demographic factors, personality traits and psychological features. Methods: The sample comprised 107 SSD patients and 100 healthy controls. Several types of self-report instrument were administered. Group differences were assessed with independent t-tests. We used multiple linear regression to examine relationships between the independent variables and functioning and QOL. Finally, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to perform path analysis and examine the fit of a model based on the earlier results. Results: Most function scores were lower in SSD patients than in healthy controls. In SSD patients overall WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) score was correlated with exercise level and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score. There were also associations between Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) score and age, novelty seeking, Cognitions About Body and Health Questionnaire (CABAH) score and BDI-II score. Family APGAR score was only related to BDI-II score. Path analysis revealed that BDI-II score was related to all three indices of functioning.

"Rosiglitazone has a neutral effect on the risk of dementia in type 2 diabetes patients","2019","This study investigated whether rosiglitazone might increase or reduce dementia risk. Taiwan's National Health Insurance database was used to enroll a cohort of 1:1 matched-pairs of ever and never users of rosiglitazone based on propensity score from patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes during 1999-2006. The patients were alive on January 1, 2007 and were followed up for dementia until December 31, 2011. A total of 5,048 pairs of never users and ever users were identified. The incident case numbers were 127 and 121, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for ever versus never users was 0.895 (95% confidence interval: 0.696-1.151). The adjusted hazard ratios for the first ( < 12.1 months), second (12.1-25.1 months) and third ( > 25.1 months) tertiles of cumulative duration of rosiglitazone therapy were 0.756 (0.509-1.123), 0.964 (0.685-1.357) and 0.949 (0.671-1.341), respectively. When cumulative duration was treated as a continuous variable, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.000 (0.992-1.008). Subgroup analyses conducted in ever users and never users of metformin and in patients diagnosed with diabetes during three different periods of time, i.e., 1999-2000, 2001-2003 and 2004-2006, all supported a neutral effect of rosiglitazone.

"A decision tree–based classifier for E-visit service provision","2019","This study proposes a decision tree-based e-visit classification approach (DTEVCA) to determine clinic visits qualified as e-visits using clinics’ medical records and patients’ demographic data. This study assumes that health care insurance will subsidise e-visit service costs, in which case, identifying patients who benefit most from e-visit service is essential. Using a large data set from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance, this study verifies the efficiency and validity of the DTEVCA. Results indicate that this approach can accurately classify in-office clinic visits that could switch to e-visit services. The straightforward rules of this decision tree also give insurance agencies a clear guideline to understand the circumstances of using e-visits and predict the effects of implementing e-visits in Taiwan. Result of this study can help countries improve the policy formulation process for physicians’ use, or for academic research. The DTEVCA can update classification rules using new data to correct biases and ensure the stability of the e-visit system. In addition, the concept of this approach is feasible not only for e-visit service but also for other ‘new services’ such as new products or new policies. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adult; article; classifier; data mining; decision tree; demography; human; medical record; national health insurance; practice guideline; Taiwan; validity"
"NLRP3 inflammasome is attenuated in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease and correlated with decreased interleukin-1β response and host susceptibility","2019","The incidence of nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease (NTM-LD) is increasing in patients without human immunodeficiency virus. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common pathogenic species. The presence of MAC has a clinical relevance of around 35~42%, indicating the possibility of host susceptibility. Previous studies have shown that interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-1-receptor knock-out mice are susceptible to mycobacterial infections; however, the role of inflammasome-driven interleukin (IL)-1β has not been studied in MAC-LD. We enrolled patients with MAC-LD and healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated by MAC bacilli. The responses of interleukin(IL)-1β and the expression of inflammasome and toll-like receptors (TLRs) were measured. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also examined for NLRP3 and TLR2 genes. In the patients with MAC-LD, the IL-1β responses decreased in PBMCs, monocytes, and macrophages assayed by MAC bacilli in comparison to the healthy controls. In addition, the level of caspase-1 after stimulation was lower in the MAC-LD group, although the mRNA level of IL-1β was not significantly lower. In surveying the activation of IL-1β, the MAC-LD group had an attenuated mRNA level of NLRP3 but similar levels of AIM2 and ASC compared with the controls. The SNPs rs3806268 and rs34298354 in NLRP3 for females and rs3804100 in TLR2 for males were associated with MAC-LD. In conclusion, our patients with MAC-LD had attenuated IL-1β production, which may have been due to lower activation of the NLRP3-caspase-1 axis. Two SNPs of NLRP3 and one of TLR2 were correlated with MAC-LD, possibly indicating host susceptibility. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Inducing a Transient Increase in Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability for Improved Liposomal Drug Therapy of Glioblastoma Multiforme","2019","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) selectively controls the passage of endogenous and exogenous molecules between systemic circulation and the brain parenchyma. Nanocarrier-based drugs such as liposomes and nanoparticles are an attractive prospect for cancer therapy since they can carry a drug payload and be modified to improve targeting and retention at the desired site. However, the BBB prevents most therapeutic drugs from entering the brain, including physically restricting the passage of liposomes and nanoparticles. In this paper, we show that a low dose of systemically injected recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor induces a short period of increased BBB permeability. We have shown increased delivery of a range of nanomedicines to the brain including contrast agents for imaging, varying sizes of nanoparticles, small molecule chemotherapeutics, tracer dyes, and liposomal chemotherapeutics. However, this effect was not uniform across all brain regions, and permeability varied depending on the drug or molecule measured. We have found that this window of BBB permeability effect is transient, with normal BBB integrity restored within 4 h. This strategy, combined with liposomal doxorubicin, was able to significantly extend survival in a mouse model of human glioblastoma. We have found no evidence of systemic toxicity, and the technique was replicated in pigs, demonstrating that this technique could be scaled up and potentially be translated to the clinic, thus allowing the use of nanocarrier-based therapies for brain disorders. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","Blood; Brain; Drug delivery; Liposomes; Mammals; Mechanical permeability; Medical nanotechnology; Molecules; Nanoparticles; Targeted drug delivery; Doxorubicin; Glioblastoma multiforme; Glioblastomas; Liposomal doxorubicin; Permeability effects; Recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor; Systemic circulation; Systemic toxicities; Controlled drug delivery"
"Plasma haptoglobin level can augment NT-proBNP to predict poor outcome in patients with severe acute decompensated heart failure","2019","To evaluate the use of plasma haptoglobin (Hp) levels and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in predicting survival in patients with severe acute decompensated heart failure (AHF). Management of AHF is challenging. Identifying markers associated with patient prognosis in this disease is clinically important. In this prospective observational study, plasma Hp and NT-proBNP levels were measured. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify cut-offs of Hp and NT-proBNP with the greatest specificity and sensitivity for predicting overall survival and cardiovascular-related survival. The cut-off values were tested in patients with AHF (n=41). The cut-off value with the greatest specificity and sensitivity with respect to overall survival and for cardiovascular-related survival for Hp was 177. 1 ng/mL for both outcomes and for NT-proBNP was 34 246.0 pg/mL and 11 848.5 ng/mL, respectively. Using these cut-off values, this study found that patients with lower baseline Hp levels (<177. 1 ng/mL) or higher baseline NT-proBNP (?34 246 pg/mL) were more likely to have shorter overall survival. Similarly, patients with <177. 1 ng/mL of Hp and ?11 848.5 pg/mL of NT-proBNP had the highest risk of death related to cardiovascular disease. Our findings indicate that Hp and NT-proBNP using specific cut-off values for AHF can be used to determine risk of survival in these patients. ?

"Identification of the novel role of CD24 as an oncogenesis regulator and therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer","2019","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, with unfavorable prognosis and 5-year survival. The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in TNBC progression. We determined that CD24 expression was elevated in highly lung and lymph node metastatic TNBC cells. CD24 depletion inhibited primary tumor growth and lymph node and lung metastasis and reduced the number of blood and lymphatic vessels in the tumor microenvironment. CD24 knockdown impaired EGFR/Met-mediated signaling and reduced lymphangiogenesis- and angiogenesis-related molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factors A and C, by promoting EGFR and Met protein instability via the lysosomal degradation pathway. CD24 monoclonal antibody treatment reduced lung metastasis and prolonged the survival in a lung metastasis mouse model. Clinical analyses revealed that the CD24 high /MET high ""double-positive"" signature identified a subset of TNBC patients with worst outcomes. We conclude that CD24 could be a therapeutic target by itself and in combination with the Met expression could be a good prognostic biomarker for TNBC patients. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","CD24 antigen; epidermal growth factor receptor; monoclonal antibody; scatter factor receptor; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin C; CD24 antigen; CD24 protein, human; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; MET protein, human; scatter factor receptor; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; Article; breast carcinogenesis; cancer inhibition; gene knockdown; human; human cell; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; lymphangiogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein depletion; protein expression; triple negative breast cancer; tumor microenvironment; animal; cancer transplantation; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; lymph node; metabolism; pathology; prognosis; signal transduction; triple negative breast cancer; tumor cell line; upregulation; Animals; CD24 Antigen; Cell Line, Tumor; ErbB Receptors; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Lymph Nodes; Mice; Neoplasm Transplantation; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; Signal Transduction; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment; Up-Regulation"
"Occurrence and cycling of trace elements in ultramafic soils and their impacts on human health: A critical review","2019","The transformation of trace metals (TMs) in natural environmental systems has created significant concerns in recent decades. Ultramafic environments lead to potential risks to the agricultural products and, subsequently, to human health. This unique review presents geochemistry of ultramafic soils, TM fractionation (i.e. sequential and single extraction techniques), TM uptake and accumulation mechanisms of ultramafic flora, and ultramafic-associated health risks to human and agricultural crops. Ultramafic soils contain high levels of TMs (i.e. Cr, Ni, Mn, and Co) and have a low Ca:Mg ratio together with deficiencies in essential macronutrients required for the growth of crops. Even though a higher portion of TMs bind with the residual fraction of ultramafic soils, environmental changes (i.e. natural or anthropogenic) may increase the levels of TMs in the bioavailable or extractable fractions of ultramafic soils. Extremophile plants that have evolved to thrive in ultramafic soils present clear examples of evolutionary adaptations to TM resistance. The release of TMs into water sources and accumulation in food crops in and around ultramafic localities increases health risks for humans. Therefore, more focused investigations need to be implemented to understand the mechanisms related to the mobility and bioavailability of TMs in different ultramafic environments. Research gaps and directions for future studies are also discussed in this review. Lastly, we consider the importance of characterizing terrestrial ultramafic soil and its effect on crop plants in the context of multi-decadal plans by NASA and other space agencies to establish human colonies on Mars. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural products; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Crops; Geochemistry; Health; Health risks; NASA; Soils; Trace elements; Agricultural crops; Environmental change; Environmental systems; Evolutionary adaptation; Extremophytes; Soil contamination; Translocation; Uptake and accumulations; Soil pollution; calcium; chromium; cobalt; ground water; magnesium; manganese; nickel; surface water; trace element; vanadium; bioaccumulation; critical analysis; crop plant; fractionation; health impact; soil chemistry; soil pollution; trace metal; translocation; bioaccumulation; crop production; environmental change; extremophile; food crop; food intake; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; macronutrient; nonhuman; plant nutrient; priority journal; recycling; Review; soil analysis; soil property; water supply"
"Primary cardiac sarcomas: A multi-national retrospective review","2019","Background: Primary cardiac sarcoma (PCS) is a rare but often fatal disease. The current study aimed to analyze the impact of baseline demographics, local and systemic therapies in a contemporary cohort. Methods: Clinical records of PCS across six institutions in three continents were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine variables impacting progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). Results: Sixty-one patients with PCS (1996-2016) were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 46 (range 18-79); 36% (n?=?22) presented with metastatic disease. The most common histology was angiosarcoma (n?=?24, 39%). A total of 46 patients received surgery (75%) but only 5 (8%) patients achieved R0 resection. Multi-modality treatment to the primary tumor was given to 28 patients (46%; localized disease 23/39 (59%); metastatic disease 5/22 (23%)). The median OS for the entire cohort was 17.5?months (95% CI 9.5-20.6), with seven (11%) patients surviving longer than 36?months. On multi-variate analysis, age <65 (P?=?0.01) was the only significant favorable prognostic factor. For first-line palliative chemotherapy, the median PFS was 4.4?months (95% CI 2.9-7.7?months). The best response for first-line chemotherapy was 32% (CR?=?1, PR?=?9). No significant improvement in OS was identified in patients presenting throughout the 20-year period of this review. Conclusion: Younger age at diagnosis was associated with improved outcome although the prognosis of PCS remains poor. Given the lack of improvement in survival, further dedicated research is required. ? 2018 The Authors.

"RNA-Binding Proteomics Reveals MATR3 Interacting with lncRNA SNHG1 to Enhance Neuroblastoma Progression","2019","The interaction of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with one or more RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is important to a plethora of cellular and physiological processes. The lncRNA SNHG1 was reported to be aberrantly expressed and associated with poor patient prognosis in several cancers including neuroblastoma. However, the interacting RBPs and biological functions associated with SNHG1 in neuroblastoma remain unknown. In this study, we identified 283, 31, and 164 SNHG1-interacting proteins in SK-N-BE(2)C, SK-N-DZ, and SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells, respectively, using a RNA-protein pull-down assay coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Twenty-four SNHG1-interacting RBPs were identified in common from these three neuroblastoma cell lines. RBPs MATR3, YBX1, and HNRNPL have the binding sites for SNHG1 predicted by DeepBind motif analysis. Furthermore, the direct binding of MATR3 with SNHG1 was validated by Western blot and confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP). Coexpression analysis revealed that the expression of SNHG1 is positively correlated with MATR3 (P = 3.402 × 10 -13 ). The high expression of MATR3 is associated with poor event-free survival (P = 0.00711) and overall survival (P = 0.00064). Biological functions such as ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, RNA processing, and RNA splicing are significantly enriched and in common between SNHG1 and MATR3. In conclusion, we identified MATR3 as binding to SNHG1 and the interaction might be involved in splicing events that enhance neuroblastoma progression. ?

"Recommendations for clinical monitoring of patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)","2019","Background: Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare lysosomal storage disease, results from mutations in SMPD1, the gene encoding acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). As a result, sphingomyelin accumulates in multiple organs including spleen, liver, lung, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and in the most severe form, in the CNS and peripheral nerves. Clinical manifestations range from rapidly progressive and fatal infantile neurovisceral disease, to less rapidly progressing chronic neurovisceral and visceral forms that are associated with significant morbidity and shorter life span due to respiratory or liver disease. Objectives: To provide a contemporary guide of clinical assessments for disease monitoring and symptom management across the spectrum of ASMD phenotypes. Methods: An international group of ASMD experts in various research and clinical fields used an evidence-informed consensus process to identify optimal assessments, interventions, and lifestyle modifications. Results: Clinical assessment strategies for major organ system involvement, including liver, spleen, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological/developmental are described, as well as symptomatic treatments, interventions, and/or life style modifications that may lessen disease impact. Conclusions: There is currently no disease-specific treatment for ASMD, although enzyme replacement therapy with a recombinant human ASM (olipudase alfa) is in clinical development. Current monitoring addresses symptoms and multisystem involvement. Recommended interventions and lifestyle modifications are designed to address morbidity and disease complications and improve patient quality of life. While infantile neurovisceral ASMD is uniformly fatal in early childhood, patients with chronic visceral and chronic neurovisceral ASMD require appropriate management throughout childhood and adulthood by an interdisciplinary clinical team. ? 2018 The Authors","olipudase alfa; sphingomyelin; sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase; acid sphingomyelinase deficiency; adulthood; cardiovascular disease; childhood; clinical assessment; enzyme replacement; fatality; gene; gene mutation; human; lifespan; lifestyle modification; liver disease; lung disease; lysosome storage disease; morbidity; neurologic disease; palliative therapy; patient monitoring; peripheral nerve; phenotype; priority journal; quality of life; respiratory tract disease; Review; smpd1 gene; clinical trial (topic); disease management; mutation; Niemann Pick disease; physiologic monitoring; practice guideline; procedures; risk reduction; statistics and numerical data; Clinical Trials as Topic; Disease Management; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Mutation; Niemann-Pick Disease, Type A; Phenotype; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality of Life; Risk Reduction Behavior"
"Higher urge severity score predicts resumption of overactive bladder (OAB) medication following discontinuation of mirabegron treatment in patients with OAB","2019","Objectives: This study investigated factors predicting the resumption of mirabegron following its discontinuation with successful treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Methods: In all, 374 OAB patients reporting an improvement in subjective symptoms after a minimum of 3 months treatment with mirabegron 25 mg, q.d., were screened. Those wanting to continue with the medication (n = 109) were excluded from the study. The remaining 265 patients discontinued mirabegron and their outcomes were evaluated at baseline (discontinuation) and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), Urgency Severity Scale (USS), Patient's Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), and Global Response Assessment (GRA), as well as uroflowmetry and post-void residual (PVR). Results: After mirabegron discontinuation, 203 patients completed follow-up. The mean (±SD) duration from discontinuing medication to resumption of mirabegron was 2.25 ± 1.17 months (range 1–12 months). Compared with the 111 (54.7%) patients who did not resume mirabegron, the 92 (45.3%) patients who resumed mirabegron had a higher USS at time of discontinuation (1.18 ± 1.76 vs. 0.65 ± 1.33; P = 0.017). The USS was a strong predictor of mirabegron resumption (P = 0.02; odds ratio 1.315; 95% confidence interval 1.051–1.646). Conclusions: Among OAB patients who were successfully treated with mirabegron for ?3 months, nearly half requested resumption of mirabegron after discontinuation. A higher USS was found to predict retreatment after discontinuation of mirabegron in OAB patients. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","alpha adrenergic receptor blocking agent; mirabegron; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; steroid 5alpha reductase inhibitor; acetanilide derivative; mirabegron; thiazole derivative; urinary tract agent; aged; Article; clinical assessment tool; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease severity; drug withdrawal; female; follow up; Global Response Assessment; human; International Prostate Symptom Score; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; overactive bladder; Overactive Bladder Symptom Score; Patient Perception of Bladder Condition; postvoid residual urine volume; prediction; priority journal; rating scale; retreatment; scoring system; side effect; symptom; treatment duration; treatment response; Urgency Severity Scale; uroflowmetry; overactive bladder; pathophysiology; quality of life; recurrent disease; severity of illness index; Acetanilides; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Recurrence; Severity of Illness Index; Thiazoles; Urinary Bladder, Overactive; Urological Agents"
"Improved diagnostic accuracy of thallium-201 myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography with CT attenuation correction","2019","Background: The benefits of attenuation correction (AC) in technetium-99m myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) have been well established. However, the value of thallium (Tl-201) AC and routine computed tomography AC (CTAC) were less well established. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic performance of thallium (Tl-201) MPI with additional CTAC and to determine which participants would benefit most. Methods and Results: A total of 108 consecutive patients who underwent Tl-201 MPI and received coronary angiography within 3?months were enrolled. Diagnostic performance was determined by sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed using gender and obesity. CTAC improved the area under the curve (0.84 vs. 0.77, P?=?0.037 at patient level), primarily due to a significant improvement in specificity (0.78 vs. 0.57, P?=?0.013) and no significant difference in sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.82, P?=?0.75). In subgroup analysis, CTAC was most helpful in obese subjects, men, and especially right coronary artery lesions. Conclusions: CTAC significantly improved diagnostic performance primarily by increasing the specificity, and the improvements were significantly greater in obese patients and male patients. These findings suggest that CTAC should be applied to Tl-201 MPI as routine clinical practice. ? 2018, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.","dipyridamole; dobutamine; thallium 201; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; electrocardiography; exercise test; female; gated single photon emission computed tomography; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; image quality; image reconstruction; major clinical study; male; medical record review; myocardial perfusion imaging; obese patient; obesity; predictive value; priority journal; radiation attenuation; radiodiagnosis; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; right coronary artery; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography"
"Pyrene-based prospective biomaterial: In vitro bioimaging, protein binding studies and detection of bilirubin and Fe3+","2019","Herein, we have meticulously derived the nanosized fluorescent aggregates from pyrene Schiff base (PS) in DMSO:water (10:90) ratio. The aggregation property of PS molecule was characterized by SEM and TEM measurements, revealed the aggregated particles are in spherical shape with ~3 nm in size. Moreover, aggregates exhibit a high fluorescence quantum yield (48%) which was effectively used for the in vitro bioimaging of two different cancer cells such as A549 and MCF-7 cells in which it exhibiting excellent biocompatibility. Further, it was estimated the capability of twofold acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining to identify the apoptotic associated changes in cancer cells. Additionally, the aggregates were successfully demonstrated as a luminescent probe for the perceptive biomolecule detection of bilirubin. On the other hand, the PS molecule was successfully utilized for protein binding and metal ion sensing studies. The interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with PS molecule in DMSO was using fluorescence spectroscopic method and nature of interaction was also confirmed through molecular docking analysis. The PS molecule also acts as an excellent sensor for biologically important Fe3+ ion with detection limit of 336 nM. Overall, PS molecule can be a prospective material in biological field both in solution as well as aggregated forms. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregates; Biochemistry; Biocompatibility; Body fluids; Cells; Diseases; Fluorescence; Mammals; Metal ions; Metals; Particle size analysis; Proteins; Pyrene; Spectroscopic analysis; Aggregation property; Bilirubin detections; Biomolecule detection; Bovine serum albumins; Fluorescence quantum yield; Metal ion sensors; Protein binding; Spectroscopic method; Molecules; acridine orange; bilirubin; bovine serum albumin; ethidium; fluorescent dye; iron; nanomaterial; pyrene; pyrene derivative; Schiff base; A-549 cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; human; limit of detection; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; molecular docking; molecular imaging; particle size; procedures; spectrofluorometry; A549 Cells; Acridine Orange; Bilirubin; Cell Survival; Ethidium; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Iron; Limit of Detection; MCF-7 Cells; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Imaging; Nanostructures; Particle Size; Pyrenes; Schiff Bases; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Spectrometry, Fluorescence"
"Ginkgolide A Prevents the Amyloid-β-Induced Depolarization of Cortical Neurons","2019","Utilizing the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist as a strategy, memantine is the only agent available for clinically treating mild to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our aim was to develop novel similar herb-based drugs. Using a screening platform, ginkgolide A (GA), a pure compound extracted from Ginkgo biloba, was found to attenuate amyloid β (Aβ)-induced abnormal depolarization in mouse primary cortical neurons. Using receptor agonists, it was determined that GA inhibits both NMDA receptors and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors. Furthermore, the Aβ-induced increase in c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation in neurons was prevented by GA. Body weight, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, liver histology, and kidney histology were similar when the wild-type/AD animal model mice with and without GA treatment were compared. This pure compound improves the memory of wild-type mice. Our findings indicate that GA has great potential clinically for the treatment of AD because it might target NMDA receptors just like memantine. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","Depolarization; Diagnosis; Glycoproteins; Histology; Mammals; Neurons; Alzheimer's disease; Ginkgolide A; Glutamate receptor; Herbal medicines; Memantine; Neurodegenerative diseases; amyloid beta protein; Ginkgo biloba extract; ginkgolide; ginkgolide A; lactone; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; neuroprotective agent; plant extract; Alzheimer disease; animal; brain cortex; C57BL mouse; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; genetics; Ginkgo biloba; human; male; metabolism; mouse; nerve cell; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Cerebral Cortex; Ginkgo biloba; Ginkgolides; Humans; Lactones; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neurons; Neuroprotective Agents; Plant Extracts; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate"
"Second victim: Malpractice disputes and quality of life among primary care physicians","2019","Purpose: The health of physicians can have a strong impact on the quality and safety of the health care they provide. Studies have shown a link between work stress, burnout, and depression. The aim of this study was to examine the association between malpractice dispute experiences and the well-being of physicians. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to collect information about the malpractice experiences of primary care physicians in 2004. Data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and SF-36 measures were also collected. We used propensity score matching to estimate the association of medical malpractice experience with the general health, mental health, and vitality of physicians. Results: Among the 1206 primary care physicians who completed the survey (response rate of 13.4%), 25.2% reported having ever experienced a malpractice dispute. After adjustment for baseline variables, physicians who had experienced a malpractice dispute had significantly worse health-related quality of life with regard to general health [?4.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), ?7.61 to ?1.80; P = 0.0016], mental health (?2.68; 95% CI, ?5.03 to ?0.34; P = 0.0252), and vitality (?3.28; 95% CI, ?6.10 to ?0.47; P = 0.0224).

"Enhanced self-efficacy and behavioral changes among patients with diabetes: Cloud-based mobile health platform and mobile app service","2019","Background: The prevalence of chronic disease is increasing rapidly. Health promotion models have shifted toward patient-centered care and self-efficacy. Devices and mobile app in the Internet of Things (IoT) have become critical self-management tools for collecting and analyzing personal data to improve individual health outcomes. However, the precise effects of Web-based interventions on self-efficacy and the related motivation factors behind individuals' behavioral changes have not been determined. Objective: The objective of this study was to gain insight into patients' self-efficacy with newly diagnosed diabetes (type 2 diabetes mellitus) and analyze the association of patient-centered health promotion behavior and to examine the implications of the results for IoT and mobile health mobile app features. Methods: The study used data from the electronic health database (n=3128). An experimental design (n=121) and randomized controlled trials were employed to determine patient preferences in the health promotion program (n=62) and mobile self-management education (n=28). The transtheoretical model was used as a framework for observing self-management behavior for the improvement of individual health, and the theory of planned behavior was used to evaluate personal goals, execution, outcome, and personal preferences. A mobile app was used to determine individualized health promotion interventions and to apply these interventions to improve patients' self-management and self-efficacy. Results: Mobile questionnaires were administered for pre- and postintervention assessment through mobile app. A dynamic questionnaire allocation method was used to follow up and monitor patient behavioral changes in the subsequent 6 to 18 months. Participants at a high risk of problems related to blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ?120 mm Hg) and body mass index (?23 kg/m2) indicated high motivation to change and to achieve high scores in the self-care knowledge assessment (n=49, 95% CI -0.26% to -0.24%, P=.052). The associated clinical outcomes in the case group with the mobile-based intervention were slightly better than in the control group (glycated hemoglobin mean -1.25%, 95% CI 6.36 to 7.47, P=.002). In addition, 86% (42/49) of the participants improved their health knowledge through the mobile-based app and information and communications technology. The behavior-change compliance rate was higher among the women than among the men. In addition, the personal characteristics of steadiness and dominance corresponded with a higher compliance rate in the dietary and wellness intervention (83%, 81/98). Most participants (71%, 70/98) also increased their attention to healthy eating, being active, and monitoring their condition (30% 21/70, 21% 15/70, and 20% 14/70, respectively). Conclusions: The overall compliance rate was discovered to be higher after the mobile app-based health intervention. Various intervention strategies based on patient characteristics, health care-related word-of-mouth communication, and social media may be used to increase self-efficacy and improve clinical outcomes. Additional research should be conducted to determine the most influential factors and the most effective adherence management techniques. ? 2019 Dyna YP Chao, Tom MY Lin, Wen-Ya Ma.",""
"The Social Functioning Scale for Alzheimer's Disease: A Short Informant-based Measure of Functional Status in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease in Taiwan","2019","OBJECTIVE: Evaluating social-functioning impairments in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) objectively is essential for clinical service. However, the existing instruments lack representative content, consensus on purposes of use, and adequate scoring systems and samples. This study was thus to develop a social functioning scale for patients: the Social Functioning Scale for Alzheimer's Disease (SFSAD). METHOD: Questionnaires were analyzed from 142 AD patients, 30 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 50 normal controls. RESULTS: Based on the literature review and experts' opinions, the final scale includes 20 items in four subscales. The SFSAD showed high internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's α = .97) and test-retest reliability (r = .99) coefficients. The content validity was desirable, and the criterion-related validity was demonstrated by a significant association with the MMSE, the IADL, and the Barthel ADL. The discriminant validity of the scale was also demonstrated as the level of social-functioning impairment was significantly related to the degree of dementia, and for construct validity, our findings supported the structure of the four-factor hypothesized model. CONCLUSIONS: The SFSAD is thus a practical, psychometrically sound, and easy-to-administer measure to evaluate social functioning of AD and aMCI in brisk clinical settings. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Cigarette smoking blunts exercise-induced heart rate response among young adult male smokers","2019","This study aimed to examine the exercise-induced heart rate response (HRR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in subjects caused by inhaling smoke from tobacco cigarettes (TC) and aerosolized vapor from electronic nicotine dispensing systems (ENDS) (commonly referred to as e-cigarettes (EC)). A randomized crossover study recruited 24 young adult male smokers with an average age of 23 years and with a smoking habit of at least two years. Heart rate response was recorded after a maximal multistage shuttle 20 m run test (MMST) under three different levels of nicotine: Control 0 mg nicotine of EC (C), 3 mg nicotine of EC (3EC), and 3 mg nicotine of TC (3TC). HRV was evaluated based on the beat-to-beat time interval during the running test. The results showed no statistically significant differences in the run time to exhaustion under the three conditions (C: 398 ± 151 s; 3EC: 399 ± 160 s; 3TC: 381 ± 150 s). Exercise-induced HRR was significantly attenuated under the TC condition (p < 0.05).

"Body Fat Percentage in Relation to Lung Function in Individuals with Normal Weight Obesity","2019","Accumulating evidence indicates the association between obesity and lung function. However, no previous study has examined whether obesity affects lung function in normal weight participants with high body fat. We hypothesized that subjects with normal weight obesity (NWO) were inversely associated with lung function in Taiwan. The study sample was composed of participants who attended health examinations at the Tri-Service General Hospital from 2010 to 2016. A total of 7801 eligible participants who were classified as NWO were divided into quartiles by percentage body fat (PBF), which was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). A multivariable linear regression was performed to assess the association between PBF quartiles and pulmonary function. The relationship between PBF and the presence of obstructive and restrictive lung diseases was analyzed by a logistic regression. PBF quartiles were closely associated with reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in all adjusted models. This relationship remained significant in the male population, and a dose-dependent effect was observed. Increased PBF was associated with increased risks for the presence of restrictive lung diseases. These results presented a novel finding that body fat exhibited an inverse association with pulmonary function in NWO subjects. More comprehensive management of subjects with normal weight but high body fat, which might contribute to metabolic dysfunction and impaired pulmonary function, is needed. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Best practices on immunomodulators and biologic agents for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in Asia","2019","The Asia–Pacific Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease was established in Cebu, Philippines, under the auspices of the Asia–Pacific Association of Gastroenterology with the goal of improving inflammatory bowel disease care in Asia. This consensus is carried out in collaboration with Asian Organization for Crohn's and Colitis. With biologic agents and biosimilars becoming more established, it is necessary to conduct a review on existing literature and establish a consensus on when and how to introduce biologic agents and biosimilars in conjunction with conventional treatments for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in Asia. These statements also address how pharmacogenetics influences the treatments of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and provides guidance on response monitoring and strategies to restore loss of response. Finally, the review includes statements on how to manage treatment alongside possible hepatitis B and tuberculosis infections, both common in Asia. These statements have been prepared and voted upon by members of inflammatory bowel disease workgroup employing the modified Delphi process. These statements do not intend to be all-encompassing, and future revisions are likely as new data continue to emerge. ? 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adalimumab; antivirus agent; azathioprine; biological product; biosimilar agent; C reactive protein; calgranulin; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; hepatitis B core antibody; hepatitis B surface antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; immunomodulating agent; mercaptopurine; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; Asia; capsule endoscopy; clinical practice; comorbidity; Crohn disease; disease activity; hepatitis B; human; irritable colon; pharmacogenetics; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; treatment response; tuberculosis; ulcerative colitis"
"MPT0G413, A novel HDAC6-selective inhibitor, and bortezomib synergistically exert anti-tumor activity in multiple myeloma cells","2019","In multiple myeloma (MM), homeostasis is largely maintained by misfolded protein clearance via the proteasomal and aggresomal pathways. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) binds polyubiquitinated proteins and dynein motors and transports this protein cargo to the aggresome for further degradation. Accordingly, a combination of an HDAC6 inhibitor and bortezomib (BTZ) could increase ubiquitinated protein accumulation, leading to further apoptosis. Here we evaluated the anti-MM activity of MPT0G413, a novel specific HDAC6 inhibitor, using in vitro and in vivo models. MPT0G413 treatment more significantly inhibited cell growth in MM cells than in normal bone marrow cells. Furthermore, the combination of MPT0G413 and BTZ enhanced polyubiquitinated protein accumulation and synergistically reduced MM viability, increased caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 levels, and cleaved poly (ADP) ribosome polymerase and also inhibited adherence of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and reduced VEGF and IL-6 levels and cell growth in a co-culture system. The combination treatment disturbed the bone marrow microenvironment and induced synergic, caspase-dependent apoptosis. Xenograft tumor growth significantly decreased in combination-treated SCID mice. In conclusion, MPT0G413 and BTZ synergistically inhibit MM viability, providing a framework for the clinical evaluation of combined therapies for MM.

"Reduction of aluminum ion neurotoxicity through a small peptide application – NAP treatment of Alzheimer's disease","2019","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in late life. It is difficult to precisely diagnose AD at early stages, making biomarker search essential for further developments. The objective of this study was to identify protein biomarkers associated with aluminum ions toxicity (AD-like toxicity) in a human neuroblastoma cell model, SH-SY5Y and assess potential prevention by NAP (NAPVSIPQ). Complete proteomic techniques were implemented. Four proteins were identified as up-regulated with aluminum ion treatment, CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF), Early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), Leucine-rich repeat neuronal protein 4 (LRRN4) and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit beta (PI3KR2). Of these four proteins, EEA1 and PI3KR2 were down-regulated after NAP-induced neuroprotective activity in neuroblastoma cells. Thus, aluminum ions may increase the risk for neurotoxicity in AD, and the use of NAP is suggested as a treatment to provide additional protection against the effects of aluminum ions, via EEA1 and PI3KR2, associated with sorting and processing of the AD amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the endosomal system. ? 2019","aluminum; amyloid beta protein; amyloid precursor protein; cbp80/20 dependent translation initiation factor; davunetide; early endosome antigen 1; initiation factor; leucine rich repeat neuronal protein 4; malonaldehyde; peptide; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase regulatory subunit beta; pi3kr2 protein; protein; tau protein; unclassified drug; Alzheimer disease; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; animal model; Article; BrdU assay; cell culture; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; human cell; lipid peroxidation; mouse; neuroblastoma cell; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein analysis; protein expression; protein protein interaction; risk; SH-SY5Y cell line; upregulation"
"Association of Daily Aspirin Therapy with Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B","2019","Importance: Antiviral therapy cannot erase hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and it is not indicated for most hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. Another effective way of reducing HCC risk needs to be developed. Aspirin may prevent cancer development, but clinical evidence in patients with HBV-related HCC remains limited. Objective: To investigate the association of daily aspirin therapy with HBV-related HCC risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this Taiwan nationwide cohort study, we screened 204507 patients with chronic hepatitis B for the period January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2012. After excluding patients with confounding conditions, 2123 patients who continuously received daily aspirin for 90 or more days (treated group) were randomly matched 1:4 with 8492 patients who had never received antiplatelet therapy (untreated group) by means of propensity scores, consisting of the follow-up index date, baseline characteristics, and potentially chemopreventive drug use during follow-up. Data were analyzed from August 1 to November 30, 2018. Exposures: Daily aspirin therapy during the study period. Main Outcomes and Measures: Both cumulative incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for HCC development were analyzed after adjusting patient mortality as a competing risk event. Results: Of the 10 615 patients included in the analysis, 7690 (72.4%) were men; mean (SD) age was 58.8 (11.8) years. The cumulative incidence of HCC in the treated group was significantly lower than that in the untreated group in 5 years (5.20%; 95% CI, 4.11%-6.29% vs 7.87%; 95% CI, 7.15%-8.60%; P <.001). In the multivariable regression analysis, aspirin therapy was independently associated with a reduced HCC risk (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.86; P <.001). Sensitivity subgroup analyses also verified this association (all HRs <1.0). In addition, older age (HR, 1.01 per year; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02), male sex (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.43-2.14), and cirrhosis (HR, 2.89; 95% CI, 2.45-3.40) were independently associated with an increased HCC risk, but nucleos(t)ide analogue (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41-0.71) or statin (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.90) use was correlated with a decreased HCC risk. Conclusions and Relevance: Daily aspirin therapy may be associated with a reduced risk of HBV-related HCC. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Dehydroepiandrosterone Induces Temozolomide Resistance Through Modulating Phosphorylation and Acetylation of Sp1 in Glioblastoma","2019","Glioblastoma is the most malignant type of brain tumor for which there are currently no effective treatments. Patient prognosis is improved by radiation combined with temozolomide (TMZ) therapy but only for a short period of time due to the high prevalence of recurrence. Although O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-mediated DNA repair is a well-defined characteristic of TMZ resistance, the mechanism by which MGMT-deficient glioblastoma counteracts TMZ-induced DNA damage, leading to apoptosis, still remains unclear. Previously, we determined that aberrantly activated cytochrome P450 17A1 causes TMZ resistance in MGMT-deficient glioblastoma by increasing the secretion of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a neurosteroid that maintains the health of neurons and astrocytes. However, the precise mechanism by which DHEA alters the response of glioblastoma to TMZ has not been studied. In the present study, we found that DHEA prevents TMZ-induced apoptosis by attenuating DNA damage in MGMT-deficient glioblastoma. In addition, DHEA activated the LYN-AKT cascade to induce Sp1 phosphorylation. Phospho-Sp1 localized in TMZ-damaged DNA, prevented further DNA damage, and was deacetylated through the recruitment of HDAC1/2. Deacetylated Sp1 recruited proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to attenuate DNA damage. To confirm whether the DHEA-induced cellular process contributes to TMZ resistance, we established a TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cell line, A172R, and isolated primary resistant tumor cells, PtR#1, from a glioblastoma patient exhibiting chemotherapeutic resistance. Sp1 exhibited phosphorylated and deacetylated status, and associated with HDAC1/2 and PCNA in TMZ-resistant cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that DHEA induces TMZ resistance in glioblastoma via the induction of phospho-Sp1-mediated DNA repair. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","cycline; histone deacetylase 1; histone deacetylase 2; methylated DNA protein cysteine methyltransferase; prasterone; protein kinase B; protein kinase Lyn; temozolomide; transcription factor Sp1; cycline; histone deacetylase; prasterone; temozolomide; transcription factor Sp1; A-172 cell line; apoptosis; Article; cancer resistance; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; female; glioblastoma; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; male; protein acetylation; protein phosphorylation; acetylation; brain tumor; cell nucleus; drug effect; drug resistance; glioblastoma; metabolism; phosphorylation; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Acetylation; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Nucleus; Dehydroepiandrosterone; DNA Damage; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Glioblastoma; Histone Deacetylases; Humans; Phosphorylation; Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen; Signal Transduction; Sp1 Transcription Factor; Temozolomide"
"Transatlantic combined and comparative data analysis of 1095 patients with urea cycle disorders—A successful strategy for clinical research of rare diseases","2019","Background: To improve our understanding of urea cycle disorders (UCDs) prospectively followed by two North American (NA) and European (EU) patient cohorts. Aims: Description of the NA and EU patient samples and investigation of the prospects of combined and comparative analyses for individuals with UCDs. Methods: Retrieval and comparison of the data from 1095 individuals (NA: 620, EU: 475) from two electronic databases. Results: The proportion of females with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (fOTC-D), particularly those being asymptomatic (asfOTC-D), was higher in the NA than in the EU sample. Exclusion of asfOTC-D resulted in similar distributions in both samples. The mean age at first symptoms was higher in NA than in EU patients with late onset (LO), but similar for those with early (? 28 days) onset (EO) of symptoms. Also, the mean age at diagnosis and diagnostic delay for EO and LO patients were similar in the NA and EU cohorts. In most patients (including fOTC-D), diagnosis was made after the onset of symptoms (59.9%) or by high-risk family screening (24.7%), and less often by newborn screening (8.9%) and prenatal testing (3.7%). Analysis of clinical phenotypes revealed that EO patients presented with more symptoms than LO individuals, but that numbers of symptoms correlated with plasma ammonium concentrations in EO patients only. Liver transplantation was reported for 90 NA and 25 EU patients. Conclusions: Combined analysis of databases drawn from distinct populations opens the possibility to increase sample sizes for natural history questions, while comparative analysis utilizing differences in approach to treatment can evaluate therapeutic options and enhance long-term outcome studies. ? 2018 SSIEM","ammonia; adult; ammonia blood level; Article; asymptomatic disease; clinical research; cohort analysis; comparative study; correlational study; data analysis; data base; female; groups by age; high risk population; human; information retrieval; late onset disorder; liver transplantation; major clinical study; male; mass screening; newborn screening; onset age; ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency; phenotype; prenatal diagnosis; urea cycle disorder"
"Psychosocial safety climate, workplace violence and self-rated health: A multi-level study among hospital nurses","2019","Aims: To validate the Chinese version Psychosocial Safety Climate scale (PSC-12), and examine the associations between PSC, workplace violence and self-rated health (SRH). Background: Psychosocial safety climate moderates the negative effect of workplace violence on health. To address workplace violence experienced by nurses across the Asia-Pacific region, it is important to develop and apply a Chinese language version of the tool. Methods: We conducted a two-part study. In the first part, the Chinese version PSC-12 was developed and tested for its validity in 405 nurses. In the second part, a total of 1690 nurses from 73 hospitals filled a questionnaire concerning their work and health conditions. Multi-level modelling was used to examine the association between PSC, workplace violence and SRH. Results: A comparable validity and reliability of the Chinese version PSC-12 with the original PSC was found. PSC scores were negatively associated with workplace violence. In the hierarchical linear model, participants from hospitals with the lowest PSC score had twofold risks of having poor SRH. Conclusions: The Chinese version PSC-12 is a valid tool. Hospital-level PSC was associated with poor health status in female nurses. Implications for Nursing Management: Psychosocial safety climate should be evaluated and promoted to prevent workplace violence in nurses. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; article; climate; female; health status; human; human experiment; multilevel analysis; nurse; nursing management; prevention; questionnaire; reliability; validity; workplace violence; cross-sectional study; devices; health status; male; middle aged; nurse; procedures; psychology; psychometry; reproducibility; safety; self report; standards; Taiwan; translating (language); trends; workplace; workplace violence; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Safety Management; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Translating; Workplace; Workplace Violence"
"Identifying the functions and biomarkers of Codonopsis pilosula and Astragalus membranaceus aqueous extracts in hepatic cells","2019","Background: Homeostasis is a crucial concept used to describe the condition of patients and the roles of herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. Qi-deficiency pattern is one of the conditions when loss of homeostasis and is usually characterized by symptoms including lassitude, spontaneous sweating, and a weak pulse, which are not easy to quantitate. Codonopsis pilosula and Astragalus membranaceus were usually prescribed for carriers with hepatitis and patients with metastatic colon cancer, because these patients tended to experience fatigue. However, crude drugs were prescribed based on the exterior symptoms of patients without controlling clinical setting, such as gender, age, and dietary habits. Limited molecular evidence of using gene expression as the guide for description is available. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify potential and objective biomarkers of these two qi-related drugs in a simplified cellular system. Methods: Aqueous extracts of crude qi-tonifying herbs, C. pilosula and A. membranaceus, and that of a qi-consuming drug, Citrus reticulata, were prepared. Human liver cancer HepG2 cells were treated with the extracts of qi-tonifying herbs for 24 h. Differentially expressed genes were identified using microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and validated in two other hepatocellular cell lines, Huh7 and L-02. Results: A total of 67 differentially expressed probes that responded to both herbs were identified. A pathway analysis revealed that these genes were involved in the development, growth, movement, and viability of the liver cells. Conclusions: After qRT-PCR validation and examination of clinical data from public domains, our results showed that two genes, GDF15 and HMOX1, could serve as biomarkers in liver cells for identifying responses after treatment with C. pilosula and A. membranaceus. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Astragalus membranaceus extract; Codonopsis pilosula extract; evodiamine; aqueous solution; Article; cell growth; cell maturation; cell motion; cell viability; controlled study; DNA probe; drug activity; drug response; GDF15 gene; gene; gene expression; Hep-G2 cell line; HMOX1 gene; Huh-7 cell line; human; human cell; L-02 cell line; liver cell; mandarin; marker gene; plant root; qi; treatment response"

"Altered frontal aslant tracts as a heritable neural basis of social communication deficits in autism spectrum disorder: A sibling study using tract-based automatic analysis","2019","Investigating social behaviors and brain structural alterations in unaffected siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may help identify intermediate phenotypes of social communication deficits in ASD. This study hypothesized that such intermediate phenotypes could be identified in white matter tracts of the social communication model that exhibited reduced tract integrity and associations with social communication deficits. Boys with ASD (N = 30), unaffected male siblings (N = 27), and typically developing (TD) boys (N = 30) underwent clinical evaluation and MRI scanning. Group differences in generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) values, a white matter integrity index derived from diffusion MRI data, and the relationships of GFA with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4–18) scores were investigated. Significant differences were found in the GFA values of the frontal aslant tract (FAT) among the three groups, with the decreasing order of GFA from TD to siblings to ASD. The GFA values of the FAT were associated with the social communication scores (on the SRS) in the sibling group, and those of the superior longitudinal fasciculus III were associated with the social problems scores (on the CBCL/4–18) in the boys with ASD. Due to the altered tract integrity and association with social communication deficits in the unaffected siblings of individuals with ASD, the FAT might be a heritable neural basis for social communication deficits of ASD.

Lay Summary: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of highly heritable disorders with social communication deficits as one of the core symptoms. This study aimed to identify a neural trait of social communication deficits in individuals with ASD. We investigated brain structural alterations and their associations with social communication scores in unaffected siblings of individuals with ASD. The siblings' frontal aslant tract was found to be impaired, and this tract showed a significant association with the social communication scores.

"Perturbational Gene-Expression Signatures for Combinatorial Drug Discovery","2019","Bioinformatics; Cancer Systems Biology; Pharmacoinformatics ? 2019 The Author(s)Cancer is a complex disease that relies on both oncogenic mutations and non-mutated genes for survival, and therefore coined as oncogene and non-oncogene addictions. The need for more effective combination therapies to overcome drug resistance in oncology has been increasingly recognized, but the identification of potentially synergistic drugs at scale remains challenging. Here we propose a gene-expression-based approach, which uses the recurrent perturbation-transcript regulatory relationships inferred from a large compendium of chemical and genetic perturbation experiments across multiple cell lines, to engender a testable hypothesis for combination therapies. These transcript-level recurrences were distinct from known compound-protein target counterparts, were reproducible in external datasets, and correlated with small-molecule sensitivity. We applied these recurrent relationships to predict synergistic drug pairs for cancer and experimentally confirmed two unexpected drug combinations in vitro. Our results corroborate a gene-expression-based strategy for combinatorial drug screening as a way to target non-mutated genes in complex diseases. ? 2019 The Author(s)",""

"Effect of Fenofibrate on the Expression of Inflammatory Mediators in a Diabetic Rat Model","2019","Purpose: To investigate the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-α agonist, in preventing diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression via a diabetic rat model. Methods: Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin in 6-week-old female Wistar rats. Diabetic rats were divided into diabetes without treatment (n = 10), diabetes treated with low dose fenofibrate (30 mg/kg/day) (n = 10) and high dose fenofibrate (100 mg/kg/day) (n = 10). Serum aqueous humor (AqH) and ocular tissues were gathered after 3-month treatment. Expressions of NF-κB and inflammatory chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, fractalkine, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The levels of oxidative biomarkers, including acrolein, nitrotyrosine, and 8-hydroxy-2?-deoxyguanosin (8-OHdG), were determined by IHC and ELISA. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in serum and AqH were measured by chemiluminescence methods. Results: After 3 months of treatment, the expressions of mRNA and protein of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, fractalkine, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in the retina of diabetic rats were significantly inhibited by fenofibrate in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were mediated by inhibition of NF-κB by fenofibrate. The levels of oxidative markers, including acrolein, nitrotyrosine, and 8-OHdG, decreased in the retina of diabetic rats after fenofibrate treatment. The ROS levels in the AqH of diabetic rats also suppressed by fenofibrate.

After admission, active fluid replacement, anti-infection, nutritional support, and other treatments were performed. After debridement and skin grafting for 3 times and blood transfusion for 2 times, the patient recovered well. On the 20th day post admission, sudden heartbeat and respiratory arrest happened, and the patient died after ineffective rescue. Autopsy showed that thrombus formed in right internal jugular vein and deep veins of lower extremities, and vascular lumina of the bilateral pulmonary artery. The direct cause of death was acute pulmonary thromboembolism, but whether the embolus originated from deep vein of lower extremity or right internal jugular vein was not clear. This case suggests that clinician should not only pay attention to the prevention of deep venous thrombosis of lower extremities of burn patients, but also the possibility of internal jugular vein thrombosis, especially for patients with internal jugular vein access.","blood transfusion; burn; case report; complication; debridement; fatality; female; human; jugular vein; middle aged; mortality; pathology; skin transplantation; thrombosis; vein thrombosis; Blood Transfusion; Burns; Debridement; Fatal Outcome; Female; Humans; Jugular Veins; Middle Aged; Skin Transplantation; Thrombosis; Venous Thrombosis"

"Predicted temperature-increase-induced global health burden and its regional variability","2019","An increase in the global health burden of temperature was projected for 459 locations in 28 countries worldwide under four representative concentration pathway scenarios until 2099. We determined that the amount of temperature increase for each 100 ppm increase in global CO2 concentrations is nearly constant, regardless of climate scenarios. The overall average temperature increase during 2010–2099 is largest in Canada (1.16 °C/100 ppm) and Finland (1.14 °C/100 ppm), while it is smallest in Ireland (0.62 °C/100 ppm) and Argentina (0.63 °C/100 ppm). In addition, for each 1 °C temperature increase, the amount of excess mortality is increased largely in tropical countries such as Vietnam (10.34%p/°C) and the Philippines (8.18%p/°C), while it is decreased in Ireland (?0.92%p/°C) and Australia (?0.32%p/°C). To understand the regional variability in temperature increase and mortality, we performed a regression-based modeling. We observed that the projected temperature increase is highly correlated with daily temperature range at the location and vulnerability to temperature increase is affected by health expenditure, and proportions of obese and elderly population. ? 2019","Health; Daily temperature ranges; Mortality; Projection; Regional variability; Regional variation; Regression-based model; Temperature increase; Vulnerability; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; mortality; public health; regional climate; temperature profile; vulnerability; aged; Argentina; Article; Australia; Canada; climate change; concentration (parameter); Finland; global health burden; health care cost; health status indicator; human; Ireland; major clinical study; mortality; obesity; Philippines; prediction; priority journal; temperature sensitivity; Viet Nam; vulnerable population; Canada"
"Study design and recruitment for a prospective controlled study of diabesity: Taiwan Diabesity Study","2019","Background: Strong evidence has shown that metabolic surgery is more effective than medical treatment in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients. However, no study demonstrated a survival benefit and reduction of diabetes-related end-organ damage. Here, we describe the study design of a large prospective cohort study, the Taiwan Diabesity Study (TDS) which would compare the long-term survival rate and end-organ damage between overweight/obese type 2 diabetic patients receiving metabolic surgery and medical treatment. Methods: Eligibility criteria include type 2 diabetic patients with duration &gt; 6 months, body mass index (BMI) over 25 kg/m 2 and age between 20 and 67 years. Exclusion criteria are serum creatinine over 2.0 mg/dL, C-peptide below 1.0 ng/ml, recent history of cancer, and major diabetic complications. Eligible participants were recruited from six medical centers in Taiwan. The survival rate and diabetes-related end organ damage will be compared between the metabolic surgery group and medical group after follow-up for 10 years. Results: In 3 years, 1016 participants were identified from 38,751 patients. The average BMI of patients was 30.6 (±2.6) kg/m 2 and the average hemoglobin A1c was 8.2% (±1.5%) with 18% of them receiving insulin treatment. Among them, 126 patients received metabolic surgery and 890 patients received conventional medical treatment. The metabolic surgery group are younger, have a higher proportion of females, higher BMI and blood lipids as compared to the medical group. Conclusion: The TDS recruited 1016 overweight/obese type 2 diabetic patients including 126 patients receiving metabolic surgery and 890 patients receiving medical treatment. ? 2018","adult; aged; bariatric surgery; cohort analysis; comparative study; complication; diabetic complication; female; follow up; human; male; middle aged; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prospective study; survival rate; Taiwan; time factor; young adult; Adult; Aged; Bariatric Surgery; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prospective Studies; Survival Rate; Taiwan; Time Factors; Young Adult"
"Introduction to tools for assessing medication use appropriateness in older adults","2019","The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use is high, presenting a serious public health problem. In older adults, PIM increases the risks of adverse drug events, falls, hospitalizations, and emergency treatments as well as related medical expenses. The currently popular criteria for determining medication appropriateness and several common medication appropriateness assessment tools are introduced in this paper, including the Medication Appropriateness Index, the Beers criteria series, the Screening Tool of Older Person’s Prescriptions (STOPP) and the Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (START) series, Thailand criteria, and the PIM-Taiwan criteria, with the goal of facilitating their application by medical professionals in clinical practice. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Place of death and factors associated with hospital death in patients who have died from liver disease in England: a national population-based study","2019","Background: Liver disease is a major cause of mortality, with high numbers of hospital deaths, and disproportionately affects people younger than 65 years. This study aims to examine the place of death and factors associated with hospital death for people who died from liver disease. Method: We did a national population-based, observational study using the National Death Registration Database from the Office for National Statistics, 2001–14. All non-accidental adult deaths (hospital and non-hospital) from liver disease in England were included. Explanatory variables were underlying cause of death, contributory causes of death (number and specific causes), age at death, sex, marital status, year of death, index of multiple deprivation, rural or urban settlement, and residential region. We applied modified Poisson regression models to assess the strength of association between hospital death and explanatory variables using an adjusted prevalence ratio (PR). Findings: 135 953 decedents were included, of whom 56 065 (41·2%) died from alcohol-related liver disease. Annual deaths from liver disease increased from 7811 in 2001, to 11 017 in 2014. Hospitals were the main place of death (66·9% [95% CI 66·6–67·1]) for patients who died from liver disease. The proportion of hospital deaths reduced from 71·5% in 2001 to 60·0% in 2014. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, patients who died from alcohol-related liver disease had the highest chance of hospital death; people who died from liver cancer were less likely to die in hospital than people with alcohol-related liver disease (adjusted PR 0·61 [95% CI 0·60–0·61]). People with four or more contributory causes of death were more likely to die in hospital than those with no contributory causes (1·45 [1·42–1·47]). Patients with sepsis (1·24 [1·23–1·25]), hepatorenal syndrome (1·22 [1·21–1·22]), and peritonitis (1·18 [1·17–1·20]) had higher chances of hospital death than those without these respective contributory causes, and those with alcohol-related disorders (0·67 [0·66–0·69]) had lower chances of hospital death. Interpretation: The high risk of hospital death in patients with sepsis, hepatorenal syndrome, or peritonitis warrants further investigation, and the low chance of hospital death in patients with alcohol-related disorders also needs to be explored. Prevention strategies and end-of-life care services are urgently needed to prevent and tackle harms from liver disease.

"Patients with oral cancer do not undergo surgery as primary treatment: A population-based study in Taiwan","2020","Background: There are still oral cancer patients without surgery. To improve the survival, it is necessary to know the causes of the oral cancer patients without surgery. Methods: 23,217 patients with a newly-diagnosed oral cancer in Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) database between 2011 and 2015 were enrolled. Data from TCR database named “Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site” were extracted for analysis of the causes of those without surgery. Overall survival plots were presented using the Kaplan–Meier method with log-rank test. Results: 3263 (14%) patients did not received surgery. Among them, there were 720 patients (group 3) without surgery although surgery was advised, 154 patients (group 2) because of poor condition or death before surgery, and 2389 patients (group 1) because of other causes. Twenty-four percent of the patients with surgery were treated one month and more after diagnosis. The 5-year overall survival rates were 68.7%, 25.2%, 9.1% and 17.3% for surgery group, group 3, 2 and 1, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean age of the patients with and without surgery were 54.8 and 59.3, respectively (p < 0.01). Female patients were commoner in group 3 (p < 0.01). The patients without surgery was commoner in the middle (15.7%) and southern (14.8%) than in Northern Taiwan (12.1%). All groups without surgery had more advanced stage and lower BMI (p < 0.01). Conclusion: One-sevenths of patients were not treated surgically because of refusal, poor condition, older age, low BMI, and advanced stage. It is necessary to encourage the patients to undergo surgery with shortening the diagnosis-to-treatment interval. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",""
"Age and cystic size are associated with clinical impact of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration on the management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms","2019","Objectives: The clinical impact of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in managing pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to identify which patients with PCNs would benefit from EUS-FNA. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on patients with PCNs who underwent EUS-FNA between January 2009 and June 2018. A discordant or a consistent diagnosis after EUS-FNA was analyzed and was correlated with the clinical demographic data and cystic features. Predictors of the change in the diagnosis after EUS-FNA were analyzed. Results: One hundred eighty-eight cases of PCNs were analyzed. EUS-FNA changed the diagnosis in 45.7% of all patients with PCNs and 54.5% patients with presumed branch ductal type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) and impacted the recommendation in 35.6% of patients with PCNs and 50.5% patients with BD-IPMN. Patients with a discordant diagnosis after EUS-FNA were younger in age (54.8 ± 12.6 vs. 61.2 ± 14.2; p=.037) and had a cyst size larger than 3 cm than patients with a consistent diagnosis after EUS-FNA. The only worrisome feature (WF) that differed between patients with a discordant and a consistent diagnosis after EUS-FNA was the main pancreatic duct (MPD) between 5 and 9 mm (p=.013). In multivariate analysis, a cyst size >3 cm and age were independent predictors of diagnostic changes after EUS-FNA (OR: 5.33, 95% CI: 1.79–15.88, p =.003; OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93–0.99, p =.031). Conclusions: EUS-FNA made a significant change in the management of nearly half of the patients with PCNs, especially in younger patients and in patients with a cyst size larger than 3 cm. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carcinoembryonic antigen; adult; Article; cystic neoplasm; disease association; endoscopic ultrasonography; endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy; female; fine needle aspiration biopsy; human; intraductal papillary mucinous tumor; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; pancreas cyst; pancreatic cystic neoplasm; pancreatic duct; priority journal; retrospective study"
"Child and adolescent psychiatry in the Far East: A 5-year follow up on the Consortium on Academic Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Far East (CACAP-FE) study","2019","Aim: Data pertaining to child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) training systems are limited as extant research has mostly been derived from one-time data collection. This 5-year follow-up survey collects updated information on CAP training systems in the Far East, allowing for the tracking of system changes over the past 5 years. Methods: Data were obtained from 18 countries, or functionally self-governing areas, in the Far East, 17 of which were also included in the original study. An online questionnaire was completed by leading CAP professionals in each country. Questions were expanded in the present study to capture the contents of CAP training. Results: When compared to data from the original study, there has been progress in CAP training systems in the last 5 years. Specifically, there has been an increase in the number of countries with CAP training programs and national guidelines for the training. In addition, the number of CAP departments/divisions affiliated with academic institutions/universities has increased. Findings from 12 of 18 countries in the present study provide data on clinical contents. All informants of the present study reported the need for more child and adolescent psychiatrists and allied professionals. Conclusion: Despite progress in CAP training systems over the last 5 years, the need for more professionals in child and adolescent mental health care in all the relevant areas in this region have yet to be adequately addressed. Continued national efforts and international collaborations are imperative to developing and sustaining new CAP training systems while facilitating improvements in existing programs. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Longitudinal FDG-PET scan study of brain changes in mice with cancer-induced bone pain and after morphine analgesia","2019","Morphine is the most commonly used drug for treating physical and psychological suffering caused by advanced cancer. Although morphine is known to elicit multiple supraspinal analgesic effects, its behavioral correlates with respect to the whole-brain metabolic activity during cancer-induced bone pain have not been elucidated. We injected 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells into the left femur bone marrow cavity of BALB/c mice. All mice developed limb use deficits, mechanical allodynia, and hypersensitivity to cold, which were effectively suppressed with morphine. Serial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was performed for each mouse before cancer induction (0 day), after cancer-induced bone pain was established (14 days), and during effective morphine treatment (16 days). The longitudinal FDG-PET imaging analysis demonstrated that cancer-induced bone pain increased glucose uptake in the insular cortex and hypothalamus and decreased the activity of the retrosplenial cortex. Morphine reversed the activation of the insular cortex and hypothalamus. Furthermore, morphine activated the amygdala and rostral ventromedial medulla and suppressed the activity of anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings of hypothalamic and insular cortical activation support the hypothesis that cancer-induced bone pain has strong inflammatory and affective components in freely moving animals. Morphine may provide descending inhibitory and facilitatory actions in the treatment of cancer-induced bone pain in a clinical setting. ?

"Socioeconomic status and deaths due to unintentional injury among children: A socio-spatial analysis in Taiwan","2019","In Taiwan, unintentional injury is the leading cause of death among children <10 years old. Low socioeconomic status is a risk factor associated with a high prevalence of injuries and our study aimed to explore the geographic distribution of mortality due to unintentional injury in this age group assessing the association between this type of injury on the one hand and socioeconomic disadvantages and family structure on the other using cluster and spatial regression analyses. Using exploratory factor analysis, we assembled nine socioeconomic variables into four composite factors including area-level poverty, family burden, family fragility and unemployment. We found significant spatial clusters of childhood deaths due to unintentional injury and identified three major causes of death involved, i.e. traffic accidents, drowning and suffocation. Significant associations were found between death due to unintentional injury and area-level social disadvantages including poverty, family fragility, family economic burden and unemployment, while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Our conclusion is that socioeconomic disadvantages need to be addressed to reduce the number of deaths due to childhood unintentional injury. ? A-K. Chou, and D-R.",""
"Caring for patients with oral cancer in Taiwan: The challenges faced by family caregivers","2019","Family caregivers face multiple challenges when caring for patients with oral cancer at home. Understanding the difficulties they face may assist health professionals to better organise and provide support for family caregivers of oral cancer patients. The aim of this study was to describe the caregivers’ primary tasks and the difficulties they encounter when caring for a family member with oral cancer. This qualitative study included a purposeful sample of 22 primary family caregivers ranging in age from 25 to 71?years old. The researchers used face-to-face, semi-structured and tape-recorded interviews to collect data and employed qualitative content analysis to elicit caregiving-related themes. Six task-related themes and associated challenges were identified. These included managing the patient's nutritional issues, investigating and making decisions about patient care, managing sudden and unpredictable changes in the patient's condition, managing emotional distress, adjusting their attitudes towards patient care, and seeking resources. Family caregivers handle such essential tasks when they care for patients in home settings and they face specific challenges related to them. This study identified several challenges related to each task. From the outset, healthcare providers should actively offer caregiving information and strategies. Health professionals can incorporate strategies for supporting caregivers’ ability to carry out these tasks into their treatment model and can help caregivers manage difficulties that can impede them from doing so. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; aged; attitude to health; caregiver; decision making; family; female; human; male; mental stress; middle aged; mouth tumor; nursing; psychology; qualitative research; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Attitude to Health; Caregivers; Decision Making; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Qualitative Research; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Stress, Psychological; Taiwan"
"A ten-year study of immunogenicity and safety of the AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine in adolescent girls aged 10-14 years","2019","This study assessed long-term immunogenicity and safety following 3 doses of AS04-adjuvanted human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine in females 10–14 years old. Girls included in the immunogenicity subset in the primary controlled, observer-blinded, randomized study (NCT00196924) who received 3 doses were invited for a 10-year follow-up (NCT00316706 and NCT00877877). Serum antibody responses against HPV-16/18 (vaccine types) and HPV-31/45 (non-vaccine types) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using type-specific VLP as coating antigens. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and pregnancy information were recorded. At Month (M) 120, all subjects (N = 418, according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort) were seropositive for anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were 1589.9 ELISA Units [EU]/mL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1459.8–1731.6) for anti-HPV-16 and 597.2 EU/mL (95% CI: 541.7–658.5) for anti-HPV-18 in subjects seronegative at baseline for the type analyzed. Post hoc mathematical modeling predicted a durability ?50 years for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18. For the non-vaccine humoral type response, all initially seronegative subjects had seroconverted at M7, with anti-HPV-31 GMT of 2030.5 EU/mL (95% CI: 1766.2–2334.4) and anti-HPV-45 GMT of 2300.8 EU/mL (95% CI: 2036.8–2599.0). At M120, 87.7% and 85.1% remained seropositive for anti-HPV-31 with GMT of 242.9 EU/mL (95% CI: 201.4–293.0) and anti-HPV-45 with GMT of 204.7 EU/mL (95% CI: 170.0–246.6). During the 10-year follow-up, no SAEs or abnormal pregnancy outcomes were causally related to vaccination. Three doses of the AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine induced high and sustained antibody response against HPV-16,18,31 and 45 in girls aged 10–14 years during the 10-year follow-up, with an acceptable long-term safety profile. ? 2019, ? 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.

"Crabp2 Promotes Metastasis of Lung Cancer Cells via HuR and Integrin β1/FAK/ERK Signaling","2019","Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone.?The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Early Seroreversion After 2 Doses of Hepatitis A Vaccination in Human Immunodeficiency Virus–Positive Patients: Incidence and Associated Factors","2019","Serological responses (Seroresponse) and durability of hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination are reduced among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Incidence of and associated factors with early seroreversion (loss of seroresponse) among HIV-positive patients who have achieved seroresponses after two doses of HAV vaccination remain unclear. In this multicenter study, we followed HIV-positive adults who had mounted seroresponses after completing two doses of HAV vaccination during a recent outbreak of acute hepatitis A between 2015 and 2017, a 1:4 case-control study was conducted to identify factors associated with seroreversion. Case patients were those with seroreversion, and controls were those with similar follow-up durations who were able to maintain seroresponses. During the study period, 49 of the 1,256 patients (3.9%) seroreverted after a median follow-up of 611 days. In a case-control study, seroreversion was more likely to occur in patients with a higher weight (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.703; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.292-2.323, per 10-kg increment) and HIV viremia at the time of vaccination (aOR, 2.922; 95% CI, 1.067-7.924), whereas positive seroresponse at 6 months of HAV vaccination and higher CD4 lymphocyte counts at vaccination were inversely associated with early seroreversion with an aOR of 0.059 (95% CI, 0.020-0.154) and 0.837 (95% CI, 0.704-0.979, per 100-cell/mm3increment), respectively, in multivariable analyses. Conclusion: During an outbreak setting, early seroreversion following two-dose HAV vaccination occurred in 3.9% of HIV-positive patients. Lower and delayed seroresponses to HAV vaccination, a higher weight, and HIV viremia and lower CD4 lymphocyte counts at the time of HAV vaccination were associated with early seroreversion. Regular monitoring of seroresponse and booster vaccination might be warranted, especially in HIV-positive adults with predictors of early seroreversion. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Chitosan-hyaluronan: promotion of mucociliary differentiation of respiratory epithelial cells and development of olfactory receptor neurons","2019","Developing a biomaterial that promotes regeneration of both respiratory epithelium (RE) and olfactory neuroepithelium (ON) improves the surgical outcome of endoscopic sinus surgery. Although chitosan (CS) inhibits mucociliary differentiation of RE, it has been reported to regenerate ON. In addition, hyaluronic acid (HA) has been demonstrated to promote regeneration of RE. Whether the composite CS + HA would simultaneously benefit RE and ON remains unexplored. Human nasal respiratory epithelial cells (RECs) and olfactory neuroepithelial cells (ONCs) are respectively obtained from the RE and the ON. They are cultured in vitro and divided into groups undergoing four treatments, control, CS, HA, and CS + HA and assessed by scanning electron microscope, immunocytochemistry, and Western blots following indicated growth conditions. RECs keep polygonal morphology with mucociliary differentiation in the CS + HA group. The levels of E-cadherin, zonula occludens-1, mucin 5AC, and forkhead box protein J1 are significantly higher in the CS + HA group than in the CS alone group. In addition, ONCs express lower cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and higher olfactory marker protein (OMP) in the CS + HA group than in HA alone group. ONCs express more signal transduction apparatuses, adenylate cyclase 3, in CS and CS + HA groups than in HA and controls.

"The experience of advance care planning discussion among older residents in a long-term care institution: A qualitative study","2019","Aims and objectives: To explore the experiences and processes of advance care planning (ACP) discussions in older residents of a long-term care institution. Background: Advance care planning can facilitate discussion about end-of-life care and help to identify individual's views, wishes and beliefs about dying at a time when they have the cognitive capacity to reflect on and/or make such decisions. Design: A qualitative study was conducted. Methods: Twenty-eight older adults in a long-term care institution participated in person-to-person interviews using an ACP booklet, which included topics such as life review, healthy habits and behaviours, and end-of-life care issues and information. The discussions were recorded, and thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) checklist was followed. Results: Three themes were identified. First, participants identified that ACP could help to ensure that they achieved their view of a “good death.” Second, the process of ACP bought up difficult decisions that many participants expressed uncertainty about making. Third, participants' ability and willingness to plan for end of life were shaped by considerations about their family members' needs, views and potential role as their future carer. Conclusions: The ACP process involved not only personal ideas about good death but also families' concerns. Uncertainty and lack of information created difficult barriers. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare professionals could address the concept of good death, deliver information for their concerns and promote communication with family members. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","advance care planning; aged; article; checklist; clinical practice; controlled study; death; habit; human; interview; long term care; nursing; qualitative research; resident; thematic analysis; uncertainty; attitude to death; caregiver; decision making; family; female; long term care; male; psychology; qualitative research; terminal care; very elderly; Advance Care Planning; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Death; Caregivers; Decision Making; Family; Female; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Qualitative Research; Terminal Care"
"Profile and value of FIB-4 in patients with dual chronic hepatitis C and B","2019","Background and Aims: Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are at risk of developing adverse outcomes. Coinfection with both viruses may further increase the risk. Currently, little is known about the role of fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, a simple liver fibrosis stage biomarker, in predicting the clinical outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 152 non-cirrhotic patients with dual chronic HCV and HBV infection: 56 patients received pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy, while 96 patients remained untreated. The association between the FIB-4 index and the incidence of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was explored. Results: After a 9.88-year follow-up, the incidence of hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance was 4.97 (95% confidence interval: 3.13–7.89) per 100 person-years in the treated group and was 1.77 (1.10–2.85) in the untreated group. Of the treated group, only three and six patients developed HCC and liver cirrhosis, respectively, while 17 and 23 patients developed HCC and liver cirrhosis, respectively, in untreated group. Baseline FIB-4 index correlated with the development of liver cirrhosis in multivariable analysis of all subjects. High baseline FIB-4 index (per 1 point increase) in the treated groups was associated with a higher risk of developing liver cirrhosis (P?=?0.001) and HCC (P?=?0.038) in univariable analysis. FIB-4 index decreased only in the treated group who achieved sustained virological response (n?=?34, FIB-4 index decreasing from 1.84 to 1.55). Conclusions: In Taiwanese patients coinfected with HCV and HBV, FIB-4 index helps identify patients at risk of developing adverse events, even in patients receiving pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. ? 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","alanine aminotransferase; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antibody; hepatitis B(e) antigen; hepatitis C antibody; peginterferon; ribavirin; virus DNA; virus RNA; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; chronic hepatitis B; chronic hepatitis C; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; digestive system disease assessment; female; Fibrosis 4 Index; follow up; Hepatitis B virus genotype B; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mixed infection; nonhuman; priority journal; reference value; retrospective study; risk factor; sustained virologic response"
"Novel SCA19/22-associated KCND3 mutations disrupt human KV4.3 protein biosynthesis and channel gating","2019","Mutations in the human voltage-gated K+ channel subunit KV4.3-encoding KCND3 gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia types 19 and 22 (SCA19/22). The precise pathophysiology underlying the dominant inheritance pattern of SCA19/22 remains elusive. Using cerebellar ataxia-specific targeted next-generation sequencing technology, we identified two novel KCND3 mutations, c.950 G&gt;A (p.C317Y) and c.1123 C&gt;T (p.P375S) from a cohort with inherited cerebellar ataxias in Taiwan. The patients manifested notable phenotypic heterogeneity that includes cognitive impairment. We employed in vitro heterologous expression systems to inspect the biophysical and biochemical properties of human KV4.3 harboring the two novel mutations, as well as two previously reported but uncharacterized disease-related mutations, c.1013 T&gt;A (p.V338E) and c.1130 C&gt;T (p.T377M). Electrophysiological analyses revealed that all of these SCA19/22-associated KV4.3 mutant channels manifested loss-of-function phenotypes. Protein chemistry and immunofluorescence analyses further demonstrated that these mutants displayed enhanced protein degradation and defective membrane trafficking. By coexpressing KV4.3 wild-type with the disease-related mutants, we provided direct evidence showing that the mutants instigated anomalous protein biosynthesis and channel gating of KV4.3. We propose that the dominant inheritance pattern of SCA19/22 may be explained by the dominant-negative effects of the mutants on protein biosynthesis and voltage-dependent gating of KV4.3 wild-type channel. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cell surface protein; unclassified drug; voltage gated sodium channel beta 4 subunit; voltage gated sodium channel beta 4.3 subunit; adult; aged; animal tissue; Article; cerebellar ataxia; channel gating; dominant inheritance; electrophysiology; exon; female; gene; gene mutation; genetic variability; heterologous expression; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; kcnd3 gene; major clinical study; male; neuropathology; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; protein degradation; protein synthesis; sca19 gene; sca22 gene; sequence homology; young adult"
"Tetrandrine inhibits human brain glioblastoma multiforme GBM 8401 cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro","2019","Tetrandrine (TET) has been reported to induce anti-cancer activity in many human cancer cells and also to inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion. However, there are no reports to show TET inhibits cell migration and invasion in human brain glioblastoma multiforme GBM 8401 cells. In this study, we investigated the anti-metastasis effects of TET on GBM 8401 cells in vitro. Under sub-lethal concentrations (from 1, 5 up to 10 μM), TET significantly inhibited cell mobility, migration and invasion of GBM 8401 cells that were assayed by wound healing and Transwell assays. Gelatin zymography assay showed that TET inhibited MMP-2 activity in GBM 8401 cells. Western blotting results indicated that TET inhibited several key metastasis-related proteins, such as p-EGFR (Tyr1068) , SOS-1, GRB2, Ras, p-AKT (Ser473) and p-AKT (Thr308) , NF-κB-p65, Snail, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, NF-κB, MMP-2 and MMP-9 that were significant reduction at 24 and 48 hours treatment by TET. TET reduced MAPK signaling associated proteins such as p-JNK1/2 and p-c-Jun in GBM 8401 cells. The electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) assay was used to investigate NF-κB and DNA binding was reduced by TET in a dose-dependently. Based on these findings, we suggested that TET could be used in anti-metastasis of human brain glioblastoma multiforme GBM 8401 cells in the future. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Brain; Cells; Cytology; Diseases; Electrophoretic mobility; Glycoproteins; Pathology; Proteins; Anticancer activities; Electrophoretic mobility shift; Gelatin zymography; Glioblastoma multiforme; Lethal concentration; migration and invasion; MMP-2; Tetrandrine; Cell signaling; epidermal growth factor receptor; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; growth factor receptor bound protein 2; nerve cell adhesion molecule; protein c jun; protein kinase B; Ras protein; stress activated protein kinase; tetrandrine; transcription factor RelA; transcription factor Snail; uvomorulin; antineoplastic agent; benzylisoquinoline derivative; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; tetrandrine; antibiotics; antimicrobial activity; bioassay; brain; cell; concentration (composition); inhibition; protein; Article; cell invasion; cell migration; cell motility; DNA binding; GBM8401 cell line; gel mobility shift assay; glioblastoma; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vitro study; MAPK signaling; metastasis inhibition; priority journal; Western blotting; wound healing assay; zymography; brain tumor; cell motion; drug effect; glioblastoma; metabolism; pathology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Gastropoda; Anticarcinogenic Agents; Benzylisoquinolines; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Glioblastoma; Humans; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Neoplasm Invasiveness; NF-kappa B; Signal Transduction"
"Comparison of outcome and cost between the open, laparoscopic, and robotic surgical treatments for colon cancer: a propensity score-matched analysis using nationwide hospital record database","2019","Background: There are limited studies that compare the cost and outcome of robotic-assisted surgery to open and laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer treatment. We aimed to compare the three surgical modalities for colon cancer treatment. Methods: We performed a cohort study using the population-based Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Patients with a primary diagnosis of colon cancer who underwent robotic, laparoscopic, or open surgeries between 2008 and 2014 were eligible for enrollment. We compared in-hospital mortality, complications, length of hospital stay, and cost for patients undergoing one of these three procedures using a multivariate adjusted logistic regression analysis and propensity score matching. Results: Of the 531,536 patients undergoing surgical treatment for colon cancer during the study period, 348,645 (65.6%) patients underwent open surgeries, 174,748 (32.9%) underwent laparoscopic surgeries, and 8143 (1.5%) underwent robotic surgeries. In-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, wound complications, general medical complications, general surgical complications, and costs of the three surgical treatment modalities. Compared to those undergoing laparoscopic surgery, patients undergoing open surgery had a higher mortality rate (OR 2.98, 95% CI 2.61–3.40), more general medical complications (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.67–1.87), a longer length of hospital stay (6.60 vs. 4.36?days), and higher total cost ($18,541 vs. $14,487) in the propensity score matched cohort. Mortality rate and general medical complications were equivalent in the laparoscopic and robotic surgery groups, but the median cost was lower in the laparoscopic group ($14641 vs. $16,628 USD). Conclusions: Laparoscopic colon cancer surgery was associated with a favourable short-term outcome and lower cost compared with open surgery. Robot-assisted surgery had comparable outcomes but higher cost as compared to laparoscopic surgery. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","aged; Article; cohort analysis; colon cancer; comparative study; female; health care cost; hospital mortality; hospitalization; human; laparoscopic surgery; long term survival; major clinical study; male; open surgery; operation duration; postoperative complication; priority journal; robot assisted surgery; surgical approach; surgical mortality; wound complication"
"The development and application of drug review tool: Potentially inappropriate medication-taiwan criteria","2019","The absorption, action, and metabolism characteristics of drugs change in older adults due to factors including the normal process of aging and the impacts of disease on organ functions. Changes in the profile and proportions of drug use among older adults increase with increases in the severity of functional decline and the prevalence of chronic diseases. Drugs that are classified as “potentially inappropriate medications” (PIMs) carry a higher risk of causing adverse reactions in older adults, provide uncertain therapeutic benefits, or may be substituted by alternative drugs that are generally safer to use. Researchers have developed criteria for PIMs in geriatric medicine that are applicable to clinical practice and research. This article introduces the development and application of the PIM-Taiwan criteria to help nurses better understand the current knowledge related to medication use among older adults and the results of related research in Taiwan. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Comprehensive structural characterization of phenolics in litchi pulp using tandem mass spectral molecular networking","2019","Phenolic compounds are a large class of plant secondary metabolites with various health-promoting effects, and are known for their structural diversity. Therefore, high efficiency characterization of phenolic profiles is of key importance in identifying their potential bioactivity. In the present study, Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking was applied to trace the phenolic compounds in plants, which allowed the characterization of 9 procyanidins and 11 flavonoid glycosides (di-, tri-, or tetra-saccharides of kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin and myricetin) in litchi pulp extracts. Six compounds were reported for the first time in litchi pulp. In addition, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside-(1 → 2)-O-rhamnoside, the most abundant flavonoid glycoside in litchi pulp, was proved to have considerable α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, illustrating the anti-diabetic potential of phenolic-rich litchi pulp extracts. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fruit juices; Metabolites; Phenols; Plants (botany); Sugars; GNPS; Inhibitory activity; LC-ESI-MS; Litchi chinensis; Phenolic compounds; Pubchem; Flavonoids; acarbose; alpha glucosidase; antidiabetic agent; flavonoid glycoside; isorhamnetin; isorhamnetin 3 o rutinoside; isorhamnetin 3 o rutinoside (1-2) o rhamnoside; isorhamnetin glucosylrutinoside; kaempferol; kaempferol 3 o rutinoside (1-2) o rhamnoside; keampferol rhamnosylglucosylrutinoside; myricetin; myricetin rutinoside; nicotiflorin; phenol derivative; procyanidin; procyanidin B2; quercetin; quercetin 3 o rutinoside (1-2) o rhamnoside; quercetin glucosylrutinoside; quercetin rhamnosylglucosylrutinoside; rutoside; unclassified drug; glycoside; phenol derivative; plant extract; proanthocyanidin; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; drug structure; enzyme inhibition; fruit pulp; IC50; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lychee; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; structure analysis; tandem mass spectrometry; chemistry; fruit; high performance liquid chromatography; lychee; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Fruit; Glycosides; Litchi; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Phenols; Plant Extracts; Proanthocyanidins; Tandem Mass Spectrometry"
"The disconnect in hepatitis screening: Participation rates, awareness of infection status, and treatment-seeking behavior","2019","Background Over 325 million people in the world are infected with hepatitis B or C virus. Chronic hepatitis is responsible for 78% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and an estimated 1.3 million preventable deaths a year. As ""silent killers"", liver diseases are often asymptomatic and go undiagnosed until their terminal stage. Knowledge of infection status via screening is thus a vital part of preventing spread and seeking early treatment. Recently there has been a worldwide push to eliminate hepatitis. The objective of this study is to assess hepatitis B and C self-reported awareness of infection status vs correct awareness (compared to blood test results) and follow-up rates in Taiwan to inform global health promotion efforts that utilize screening interventions to prevent chronic liver diseases. Methods De-identified data from a Liver Foundation's nationwide community- outreach free blood screening programs was utilized, including 50 909 participants' data from 74 sites with a questionnaire (demographics, screening history, hepatitis awareness, monitoring behavior) and blood test results. Chi square tests were applied using R programing to examine the impacts of demographic variables on infection prevalence, awareness, and behavior relating to hepatitis. Results Among all participants, 41.1% indicated having had a hepatitis screening, of which only 60.8% knew their results. Around 69.7% and 66.5% self-reported awareness of their hepatitis B and C status respectively; 12.8% and 26.4% of individuals who tested positive for HBsAg and Anti-HCV respectively incorrectly thought they were not infected. Of those who self-reported awareness of their positive infection, 43.4% and 26.6% did not follow up with a health care professional for monitoring or treatment; the top reasons were ""no symptoms"", ""too busy"", and ""don't know where to follow up"". Rural populations showed higher infection prevalence but lower screening rates and self-reported awareness. Conclusions Intervention programs must address the substantial number of people that do not recall if they were screened or do not know the results of a screening. Discrepancies between self-reported awareness, correct awareness, and follow-up and disparities across demographic groups deserve further scrutiny. Global hepatitis eradication initiatives should reconsider how screening, test results, and education are presented in order to improve awareness and prevent chronic infection that could develop into life-threatening liver diseases. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; attitude to health; female; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; male; mass screening; middle aged; patient attitude; self report; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Aged; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Self Report; Taiwan; Young Adult"

"Biomaterial aided differentiation and maturation of induced pluripotent stem cells","2019","Engineering/reprogramming differentiated adult somatic cells to gain the ability to differentiate into any type of cell lineage are called as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Offering unlimited self-renewal and differentiation potential, these iPSC are aspired to meet the growing demands in the field of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, disease modeling, nanotechnology, and drug discovery. Biomaterial fabrication with the rapid evolution of technology increased their versatility and utility in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, revolutionizing the stem cell biology research with the property to guide the process of proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Combining traditional culture platforms of iPSC with biomaterials aids to overcome the limitations associated with derivation, proliferation, and maturation, thereby could improve the clinical translation of iPSC.

"A phase 1 study of oral ASP5878, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptors 1–4, as a single dose and multiple doses in patients with solid malignancies","2019","ASP5878 is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). This study investigated safety, tolerability, and antitumor effect of single and multiple oral doses of ASP5878 in patients with solid tumors. This phase 1, open label, first-in-human study comprised dose-escalation and dose-expansion parts. Primary objectives of the dose-escalation part were to identify the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose, and recommended dose of ASP5878 for the dose-expansion part. Nine dose cohorts of ASP5878 were evaluated (0.5─2?mg once daily; 2─40?mg twice daily [BID]). A single dose of ASP5878 was followed by a 2-day pharmacokinetic collection, and then either 28-day?cycles of daily dosing (ASP5878 ? 10?mg BID) or 5-day dosing/2-day interruption (ASP5878 ? 20?mg BID). The primary objective of the dose-expansion part was to determine the safety of ASP5878 (16?mg BID) administered in 28-day?cycles of 5-day dosing/2-day interruption in patients with urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, or squamous cell lung carcinoma with FGFR genetic alterations. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs). Thirty-five patients were enrolled and 31 discontinued in the dose-escalation part; 51 patients were enrolled and 51 discontinued in the dose-expansion part. In the dose-escalation part, 66.7% of patients in the 20?mg BID 5-day dosing/2-day interruption group reported DLTs of hyperphosphatemia. The recommended dose for the dose-expansion part was 16?mg BID. Common AEs included retinal detachment, diarrhea, and increased alanine aminotransferase. One death occurred that was not related to ASP5878. ASP5878 was well tolerated with manageable toxicities including hyperphosphatemia. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Novel mutations in the mitochondrial complex I assembly gene NDUFAF5 reveal heterogeneous phenotypes","2019","Primary mitochondrial complex I deficiency is the most common defect of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is caused by defects in structural components and assembly factors of this large protein complex. Mutations in the assembly factor NDUFAF5 are rare, with only five families reported to date. This study provides clinical, biochemical, molecular and functional data for four unrelated additional families, and three novel pathogenic variants. Three cases presented in infancy with lactic acidosis and classic Leigh syndrome. One patient, however, has a milder phenotype, with symptoms starting at 27 months and a protracted clinical course with improvement and relapsing episodes. She is homozygous for a previously reported mutation, p.Met279Arg and alive at 19 years with mild neurological involvement, normal lactate but abnormal urine organic acids. We found the same mutation in one of our severely affected patients in compound heterozygosity with a novel p.Lys52Thr mutation. Both patients with p.Met279Arg are of Taiwanese descent and had severe hyponatremia. Our third and fourth patients, both Caucasian, shared a common, newly described, missense mutation p.Lys109Asn which we show induces skipping of exon 3. Both Caucasian patients were compound heterozygotes, one with a previously reported Ashkenazi founder mutation while the other was negative for additional exonic variants. Whole genome sequencing followed by RNA studies revealed a novel deep intronic variant at position c.223-907A>C inducing an exonic splice enhancer. Our report adds significant new information to the mutational spectrum of NDUFAF5, further delineating the phenotypic heterogeneity of this mitochondrial defect. ? 2018 The Authors","carboxylic acid; citrate synthase; cytochrome c oxidase; lactic acid; mitochondrial DNA; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; methyltransferase; mitochondrial protein; NDUFAF5 protein, human; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); Article; case report; Caucasian; cell lysate; clinical article; disease course; enhancer region; family history; follow up; gene frequency; gene mutation; heterozygosity; heterozygote; human; human tissue; hyponatremia; immunoblotting; lactic acidosis; Leigh disease; missense mutation; muscle biopsy; neuroimaging; next generation sequencing; oxygen consumption; phenotype; point mutation; prediction; priority journal; punch biopsy; respiratory chain; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Sanger sequencing; Taiwanese; whole exome sequencing; whole genome sequencing; adolescent; biopsy; child; deficiency; disorders of mitochondrial functions; female; genetics; infant; male; mutation; pathology; pedigree; preschool child; skin; young adult; Adolescent; Biopsy; Child; Child, Preschool; Electron Transport Complex I; Female; Humans; Infant; Leigh Disease; Male; Methyltransferases; Mitochondrial Diseases; Mitochondrial Proteins; Mutation; Pedigree; Phenotype; Skin; Whole Exome Sequencing; Whole Genome Sequencing; Young Adult"
"Drug price, dosage and safety: Real-world evidence of oral hypoglycemic agents","2019","Objectives: Drug price reduction is one of the major policies to restrain pharmaceutical expenses worldwide. This study explores whether there is a relationship between drug price and clinical quality using real-world data. Methods: Patients with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes receiving metformin or sulfonylureas during 2001 and 2010 were identified using the claim database of the Taiwan universal health insurance system. Propensity score matching was performed to obtain comparable subjects for analysis. Pharmaceutical products were categorized as brand-name agents (BD), highpriced generics (HP) or low-priced generics (LP). Indicators of clinical quality were defined as the dosage of cumulative oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA), exposure to other pharmacological classes of OHA, hospitalization or urgent visit for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, insulin utilization and diagnosis of diabetic complications within 1 year after diagnosis. Results: A total of 40,152 study subjects were identified. A generalized linear mix model showed that HP and BD users received similar OHA dosages with comparable clinical outcomes. By contrast, LP users had similar outcomes to BD users but received a 39% greater OHA dosage. A marginally higher risk of poor glycemic control in LP users was also observed. Conclusions: Drug price is related to indicators of clinical quality. Clinicians and health authorities should monitor the utilization, effectiveness and clinical safety indicators of generic drugs, especially those with remarkably low prices. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","generic drug; glibenclamide; gliclazide; glimepiride; glipizide; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; sulfonylurea derivative; adult; aged; Article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; diabetic complication; drug cost; drug safety; emergency ward; female; glycemic control; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; propensity score; Taiwan"
"Impact of patient-centred and family-centred care meetings on intensive care and resource utilisation in patients with terminal illness: A single-centre retrospective observational study in Taiwan","2019","Objective Shared decision making is essential for patients and their families when facing serious and life-threatening diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of patient-centred and family-centred care meetings (PFCCM) on intensive measures and resource utilisation during end-of-life (EOL) hospitalisation among terminally ill patients. Design and setting A retrospective cross-sectional study using electronic medical records was conducted in a tertiary referral medical centre in Taiwan. Participants We identified 6843 deceased patients with terminal illness who either received or did not receive PFCCM during EOL hospitalisation between January 2013 and December 2015. Primary and secondary outcome measures Patients who were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Those who underwent invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, haemodialysis and surgical intervention during the final hospitalisation were determined by the use of intensive care measures; secondary measures were individual total and daily medical expenditures. A generalised estimating equation (GEE) model was used to compare the differences between the two groups. OR and beta coefficients (β) with 95% CI were estimated. Results This study identified 459 patients (6.7%) who received PFCCM during EOL hospitalisation. Multivariate analyses showed that patients who received PFCCM were less likely to have ICU admissions (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.57), undergo surgical interventions (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.66) during the final hospitalisation, after adjusting for patient demographics, clinical conditions and year of admission. Additionally, a significant decrease in daily medical expenditures was observed in PFCCM patients (β-0.18, 95% CI-0.25 to-0.12) than in non-PFCCM patients. Conclusions Patient-physician discussion through PFCCM is associated with less intensive care utilisation and daily medical expenditure during EOL hospitalisation in terminally ill patients. ? 2019 Author(s).","adult; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; clinical evaluation; confidence interval; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; doctor patient relationship; electronic medical record; family centered care; female; generalized estimating equation; health care cost; health care utilization; hemodialysis; human; intensive care; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; multivariate analysis; noninvasive ventilation; observational study; outcome assessment; patient care; retrospective study; shared decision making; surgical patient; terminal disease; terminally ill patient; tertiary health care; tracheostomy"
"Noninfectious uveitis in the Asia–Pacific region","2019","Uveitis is a sight-threatening disease. Up to 35% of patients may have impaired vision. Inflammation of the uvea tissue has more than 60 etiologies. Previous reports have shown that 20–40% of uveitis cases were noninfectious. Some of them may be associated with systemic rheumatological and autoimmune diseases but some may affect the eyes only. The epidemiology and clinical situations of some specific uveitis entities vary worldwide because they are influenced by genetic, ethnic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. The Asia–Pacific region comprises more than 30 countries. Epidemiology and patterns of uveitis vary greatly in this region. However, some uveitis entities, such as Behcet’s disease, sarcoidosis, and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease, are more common in this region. Many studies on the epidemiology, risk factors, and immune pathogenesis of this disease have been conducted.

"Atypical cells in pathology of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions: incidence and clinical significance","2019","Background: Atypical cells may occasionally be the only pathologic finding in radial-probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial biopsy (TBB) of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs); however, it is uncertain how often we encounter such a situation and what clinical features can be used to identify these ambiguous PPLs, which are more likely to be malignant. Methods: From 2009 to 2016, consecutive patients referred for EBUS-guided TBB of PPLs and with pathology reports indicating atypical cells alone were included. Medical records were reviewed to extract patient demographics, clinical characteristics, procedural details and complications. The primary outcome was the final diagnosis of the PPLs on subsequent investigation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with a final malignant diagnosis. Results: One hundred sixty-five (7.2%) of 2291 patients had non-diagnostic TBB showing atypical cells. Benign and malignant diagnoses were subsequently obtained in 45 (27%) and 120 (73%) patients, respectively. The leading malignancy was lung adenocarcinoma; of note, a variety of benign lesions revealed cellular atypia on pathology, in particular, chronic inflammation, tuberculosis and pneumonia. Multivariate analysis indicated lesion appearance [solid vs. others; odds ratio (OR) 7.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.94–21.40; P < 0.001] and probe position (adjacent to vs. within; OR 3.36; 95% CI 1.11–10.15; P = 0.032) were two significant factors predictive of a final diagnosis of malignancy. Conclusions: One out of 14 EBUS-guided TBB procedures for PPLs exhibited atypical cells on pathology. Meticulous management strategies should be formulated to deal with these instances after taking into consideration lesion appearance, probe position and patient preferences. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; chronic inflammation; clinical feature; demography; endobronchial ultrasonography; female; human; human cell; incidence; lung adenocarcinoma; lung carcinoma; lung metastasis; lung sarcoidosis; lung tuberculosis; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; mycetoma; non small cell lung cancer; organizing pneumonia; peripheral lung lesion; pneumonia; priority journal; pulmonary cryptococcosis; small cell lung cancer; squamous cell lung carcinoma; transbronchial biopsy; tumor biopsy; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery"
"Galectin-3 and S100A9: Novel diabetogenic factors mediating pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes","2019","OBJECTIVE Pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes (PCDM) is a paraneoplastic phenomenon accounting for 1% of new-onset diabetes.We aimed to identify themediators of PCDM and evaluate their usefulness in distinguishing PCDM from type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Secreted proteins of MIA PaCa-2 cells were identified by proteomics, and those with ?10-fold overexpression in transcriptome analysis were assessed by bioinformatics and glucose uptake assay to identify candidate factors. Expression of factors was compared between tumors with and without PCDM by immunohistochemistry. Serum levels were measured in a training set including PC with and without PCDM, type 2 diabetes, pancreatitis, other pancreatic/peripancreatic tumors, and control subjects (n = 50 each). Cutoff values for differentiation between PCDM and type 2 diabetes from the training set were validated in a test set (n = 41 each). RESULTS Galectin-3 and S100A9 were overexpressed in tumors with PCDM and dosedependently suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes. In the training set, serum galectin-3 and S100A9 levels were exclusively increased in patients with PCDM and distinguished PCDM from type 2 diabetes (area under the curve [AUC] galectin-3: 0.73 [95% CI 0.64-0.83]; S100A9: 0.79 [95% CI 0.70-0.87]). Similar results were observed in the test set (AUC galectin-3: 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.92]; S100A9: 0.77 [95% CI 0.67-0.87]), with sensitivity and specificity 72.1% and 86.1%, respectively, for galectin-3 and 69.8% and 58.1% for S100A9 in differentiating between PCDM and type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Galectin-3 and S100A9 are overexpressed in PCDM tumors and mediate insulin resistance. Galectin-3 and S100A9 distinguish PCDM from type 2 diabetes in subjects with new-onset diabetes. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","calgranulin B; galectin 3; insulin; Article; bioinformatics; C2C12 cell line; cancer patient; controlled study; diabetic patient; disease association; disease classification; female; glucose transport; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; insulin resistance; major clinical study; male; MIA PaCa-2 cell line; myotube; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; protein blood level; protein expression; proteomics; sensitivity and specificity; transcriptomics"
"A unique B cell epitope-based particulate vaccine shows effective suppression of hepatitis B surface antigen in mice","2020","Objective This study aimed to develop a novel therapeutic vaccine based on a unique B cell epitope and investigate its therapeutic potential against chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in animal models. Methods A series of peptides and carrier proteins were evaluated in HBV-tolerant mice to obtain an optimised therapeutic molecule. The immunogenicity, therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of the candidate were investigated systematically. Results Among the HBsAg-aa119-125-containing peptides evaluated in this study, HBsAg-aa113-135 (SEQ13) exhibited the most striking therapeutic effects. A novel immunoenhanced virus-like particle carrier (CR-T3) derived from the roundleaf bat HBV core antigen (RBHBcAg) was created and used to display SEQ13, forming candidate molecule CR-T3-SEQ13. Multiple copies of SEQ13 displayed on the surface of this particulate antigen promote the induction of a potent anti-HBs antibody response in mice, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. Sera and purified polyclonal IgG from the immunised animals neutralised HBV infection in vitro and mediated efficient HBV/hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance in the mice. CR-T3-SEQ13-based vaccination induced long-term suppression of HBsAg and HBV DNA in HBV transgenic mice and eradicated the virus completely in hydrodynamic-based HBV carrier mice. The suppressive effects on HBsAg were strongly correlated with the anti-HBs level after vaccination, suggesting that the main mechanism of CR-T3-SEQ13 vaccination therapy was the induction of a SEQ13-specific antibody response that mediated HBV/HBsAg clearance. Conclusions The novel particulate protein CR-T3-SEQ13 suppressed HBsAg effectively through induction of a humoural immune response in HBV-tolerant mice. This B cell epitope-based therapeutic vaccine may provide a novel immunotherapeutic agent against chronic HBV infection in humans. ? 2020 Author(s).",""
"Improved quantitative assessment of HBV-associated liver fibrosis using second-harmonic generation microscopy with feature selection","2019","Background and aim: Quantitative assessments of liver fibrosis using second-harmonic generation/two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy provide greater sensitivity and accuracy than collagen proportionate area while eliminating operator-dependent variation in the staining process. In conjunction with sophisticated image analysis algorithms and feature selection, we might reduce the computation cost in future and narrow down the candidates for further clinical studies. Methods: We sampled a total of 244 liver specimens from patients with hepatitis B viral infections who underwent liver biopsy or liver resection at the National Taiwan University Hospital. The samples were then imaged using a Genesis (HistoIndex Pte. Ltd, Singapore)system, wherein second-harmonic generation microscopy was used to visualize collagen, and two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize other cell structures. We used 100 morphological features extracted from the images to assess correlations with METAVIR fibrosis scores. Results: Out of 100 quantitative measurements, 76 showed significant correlation with METAVIR scoring, thereby enabling the statistical discrimination of patients in various stages of the disease. These 76 features were also narrowed down by the nonlinear test to 10 candidate measurements, which can be further investigated in detail. Conclusions: Our experimental results showed that the model with 10 selected features can beat the one with second-harmonic generation only, and performed equivalently well compared the model with 76 features, especially for early-stage discrimination. Features presenting significant correlation were used to fit a single combined index in order to predict pathological staging, thereby making it possible to reveal incremental progress during treatment. ? 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",""
"PI3K inhibitor provides durable response in metastatic metaplastic carcinoma of the breast: A hidden gem in the BELLE-4 study","2019","Purpose: Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast (MCB) is a rare cancer characterized by the histologic presence of two or more histological cell types originating from epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells. Patients with metastatic MCB have a low response rate to conventional chemotherapy and poor survival. Optimal treatment strategies for metastatic MCB are urgently needed. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a patient who had enrolled in the phase II/III seamless study, BELLE-4 (NCT01572727). The patient's response to the study drug assessed by an investigator per protocol and clinical course were examined and compared with those of the main cohorts in the BELLE-4 study. Results: Our patient exhibited metastatic MCB and received systemic chemotherapy, paclitaxel (70 mg/m2/week) and buparlisib (80 mg/day), a pan-class I phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. The optimal response was a confirmed partial response for 17 months in total. During the compassionated use program period, the tumor regrew when buparlisib was stop because of toxicity, and responded to the treatment again after resumed the buparlisib treatment. The overall survival of the patient after the development of metastatic MCB was 42 months. She experienced grade 3 hyperglycemia similar to that observed in the main cohort. Conclusion: Buparlisib plus weekly paclitaxel might be a new treatment option for patients with metastatic MCB harboring a PIK3CA mutation. Additional prospective studies for investigating the efficacy of the proposed combination are warranted. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","buparlisib; cyclophosphamide; cytokeratin; paclitaxel; UFT; vimentin; adjuvant radiotherapy; aged; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer growth; cancer patient; case report; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; drug withdrawal; female; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; hyperglycemia; lung metastasis; major clinical study; metaplastic carcinoma; metastatic breast cancer; multiple cycle treatment; overall survival; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); progression free survival; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; simple mastectomy; systemic therapy; thorax radiography; treatment duration; treatment response; triple negative breast cancer; very elderly"
"Association of loss of muscle mass with mortality in liver cirrhosis without or before liver transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis is a risk factor for the loss of muscle mass, which is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. This meta-analysis aimed to examine whether loss of muscle mass was a predictor of increased mortality in cirrhotic patients without or before liver transplantation. METHODS: Without language restriction, PubMed and Embase were searched for articles published from the earliest records to December 2018 investigating the influence of loss of muscle mass on survival of cirrhotic patients. Those who had undergone liver transplantation and had hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. The main outcome was the hazard ratio (HR) for the association of mortality with loss of muscle mass, and the secondary outcome was the association of loss of muscle mass with Child-Pugh class and death caused by severe infection. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 16 observational studies, comprising 4070 participants. The pooled crude and adjusted HRs for the association of mortality with loss of muscle mass were 2.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-2.78) and 2.36 (95% CI, 1.61-3.46). Using Child-Pugh Class A as reference, the odds ratios (ORs) for the association of loss of muscle mass with Child-Pugh Class B and Class C were 1.68 (95% CI, 0.96-2.92) and 1.94 (95% CI, 0.66-5.65). Patients with loss of muscle mass were likely to have infection-related mortality (OR?=?3.38, 95% CI, 0.61-18.88) but the association did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of muscle mass is associated with mortality in cirrhotic patients without or before liver transplantation. Future studies should be conducted to explore whether exercise and nutritional supplementation can reverse muscle mass loss and improve long-term survival.","aged; complication; female; human; liver cirrhosis; liver transplantation; male; meta analysis; middle aged; mortality; muscle atrophy; observational study; odds ratio; preoperative period; proportional hazards model; risk factor; severity of illness index; Aged; Female; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Muscular Atrophy; Observational Studies as Topic; Odds Ratio; Preoperative Period; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index"
"Short-term prediction of extremely hot days in summer due to climate change and ENSO and related attributable mortality","2019","Summer days with extremely hot temperatures in Taiwan have been increasing for the past few decades, and this continuing trend is expected to worsen heat-related mortality. To mitigate the corresponding health impacts, in this study, we developed a statistical state-space model to predict the number of extremely hot days in June–September for the next year. Based on historical data from 1951 to 2017, we estimated the climate change trend after adjusting for the nonlinear lagged effect of the Ni?o 3.4 index. We then developed a predictive state-space model using these two primary factors and adjusting for residual autocorrelations. Validation results comparing the extremely hot days observed over 2015–2017 with predictions showed that 86% of the average prediction errors were within 4 days of the observations. To assess the health impacts, we applied the model to the projection of heat-attributable mortality (AM) in 2018 by adopting a comparative risk assessment (CRA) approach with the reference period of 2001–2010. The results showed that the Taipei metropolitan area in northern Taiwan is the most affected region with AM of 1501 deaths from all-causes, followed by Taichung in central Taiwan with 490 deaths. The prediction model and the CRA projection provide both a tool and guidance for public health administrators to address the imminent threat posed by climate change. ? 2019","Autocorrelation; Climate models; Forecasting; Health; Health risks; Risk assessment; State space methods; Comparative risk assessments; Lag effects; Non-linear model; Scatter plot smoothing; State - space models; Climate change; autocorrelation; climate change; comparative study; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; health impact; mortality; numerical model; prediction; risk assessment; summer; administrative personnel; article; climate change; controlled study; death; error; heat; human; major clinical study; mortality; prediction; public health; risk assessment; summer; Taiwan; validation process; cardiovascular disease; El Nino; epidemiology; forecasting; procedures; respiratory tract disease; risk assessment; season; theoretical model; Taipei; Taiwan; Cardiovascular Diseases; Climate Change; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Extreme Heat; Forecasting; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Risk Assessment; Seasons; Taiwan"
"Live birth after perimortem cesarean delivery in a 36-year-old out-of-hospital cardiac arrest nulliparous woman","2019","Objective: The aim of this study is to share a valuable experience of perimortem Cesarean delivery (PMCD) when no signs of spontaneous circulation were detected after 4 min of resuscitation. The time interval between maternal cardiac arrest and neonatal delivery was evaluated and reviewed. Case report: We present the case of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in a nulliparous woman who survived a car accident with only seatbelt injuries. The term infant was delivered by PMCD at our emergency department at least 43 min after maternal cardiac arrest. The mother only had concussion and was healthy at the time of discharge. The infant survived but had moderate neurological growth impairment (cerebral palsy) at the age of 7 months. Conclusion: Contrary to previous studies and case reports, maternal and neonatal outcomes seem to be better when performing PMCD within 10 min.

"Mining sequential patterns of diseases contracted and medications prescribed before the development of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome in Taiwan","2019","Medication is designed to cure diseases, but serious risks can arise from severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs can lead to emergency room visits and hospitalization, straining healthcare resources and, thus, they have strong implications for public health. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is one ADR and comprises the highest proportion of all drug relief cases in Taiwan. Pharmacovigilance involves the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention of ADRs, including SJS. Most medical specialists are not fully aware of the risk of drug-induced SJS. Consequently, various drugs may be prescribed to susceptible patients for a great variety of diseases and, in turn, cause SJS. In this research, medical records of SJS patients were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, and the Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) algorithm was used to find the sequential patterns of diseases before SJS onset. Then we mined the sequential patterns of medications prescribed in each disease pattern. Afterwards, we detected significant associations of each pattern of diseases and medications prescribed among age groups with statistical analysis. We found that, first, most patients developed SJS after being prescribed the causative medications fewer than four times. Second, Respiratory System Diseases (RSDs) appeared in disease sequential patterns of all lengths. Patterns involving RSDs were more frequent than others. Third, NSAIDs, H2-antagonists for peptic ulcer, penicillin antibiotics, theophylline bronchodilators, and cephalosporin antibiotics were the most frequent medications prescribed. Fourth, we found that patients in certain age groups had higher risks of developing SJS. This study aimed to mine the sequential patterns of diseases contracted and medications prescribed before patients developed SJS in Taiwan. This useful information can be provided to physicians so that they can stop the administration of suspected drugs to avoid evolution towards more severe cases. ? 2019 by the authors.",""
"The Association of Serum Testosterone Levels With Recurrence and Mortality After Acute Ischemic Stroke in Males","2019","The current study aimed to investigate whether low testosterone predicted the recurrence and clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in males. From June 2015 through August 2017, the study prospectively enrolled 110 male AIS patients. All received detailed evaluations at admission and were followed for at least 1 year. The cumulative incidence, overall survival, length of hospital stay, and the percentage of previous stroke were compared between subjects with testosterone <440 ng/dl and >440 ng/dl. The median age was 62 years (range, 35–93 years). The median serum testosterone at admission was 438 [203] ng/dl (range, 44–816 ng/dl); 55 patients (50%) had testosterone <440 ng/dl and were considered as low testosterone. The median follow-up was 23 months. During the period, 12 recurrences and 10 deaths occurred. The 1-year and 3-year cumulative recurrence rate were 8.3% and 11.9%, respectively; the 1-year and 3-year overall survival were 96.3% and 84.6%, respectively. The cumulative recurrence rates were similar between the two testosterone groups (log-rank test, p =.88). Low testosterone was associated with poor survival with marginal significance (log-rank test, p =.079). Men with low testosterone had a higher percentage of previous stroke (29.1% versus 12.7%, p =.035). The mean lengths of hospital stay were similar between the two testosterone groups (16.6 ± 15.8 days versus 14.0 ± 10.6, p =.31). Total testosterone at admission fails to predict stroke recurrence. However, men with low testosterone at admission are more likely to have previous stroke and may have a higher all-cause mortality rate after AIS. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""

"Statin Use and the Risk of Prostate Cancer in Ischemic Heart Disease Patients in Taiwan","2019","Patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) are more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Statins, which are widely used in such patients, are shown to modify the risk of prostate cancer. To clarify the association between statin use and the risk of prostate cancer among patients with higher risk of developing prostate cancer in Taiwan, a cohort of 26,628 men with IHD and aged between 55 and 100 were acquired from the National Health Insurance Research Database and followed over a period of 8?years. The risk of prostate cancer was calculated by time-dependent Cox regression model. Statin use was associated with significantly lower risk of both total and advanced prostate cancer (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.719, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.570–0.908; adjusted HR: 0.718, 95% CI: 0.530–0.972 respectively). In Taiwan IHD population, the reduction in risk of prostate cancer was observed in statin users as compared with nonusers. ? 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics ? 2019 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acetylsalicylic acid; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; amlodipine; angiotensin receptor antagonist; atorvastatin; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; biguanide; calcium channel blocking agent; clopidogrel; digoxin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; ezetimibe; fenofibrate; finasteride; fluindostatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; meglitinide; mevinolin; nicotinic acid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; pitavastatin; pravastatin; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; sulfonylurea; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer risk; cohort analysis; confidence interval; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary stenting; data base; diabetes mellitus; drug use; hazard ratio; high risk patient; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; middle aged; national health insurance; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prostate cancer; prostate hypertrophy; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk reduction; Taiwan; transluminal coronary angioplasty; very elderly"
"Optimal timing of influenza vaccine during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Pregnant women have an elevated risk of illness and hospitalisation from influenza. Pregnant women are recommended to be prioritised for influenza vaccination during any stage of pregnancy. The risk of seasonal influenza varies substantially throughout the year in temperate climates; however, there is limited knowledge of how vaccination timing during pregnancy impacts the benefits received by the mother and foetus. Objectives: To compare antenatal vaccination timing with regard to influenza vaccine immunogenicity during pregnancy and transplacental transfer to their newborns. Methods: Studies were eligible for inclusion if immunogenicity to influenza vaccine was evaluated in women stratified by trimester of pregnancy. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres, stratified by trimester of vaccination, had to be measured at either pre-vaccination and within one month post-vaccination, post-vaccination and at delivery in the mother, or in cord/newborn blood. Authors searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and EMBASE databases from inception until June 2016 and authors of identified studies were contacted for additional data. Extracted data were tabulated and summarised via random-effect meta-analyses and qualitative methods. Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses found that compared with women vaccinated in an earlier trimester, those vaccinated in a later trimester had a greater fold increase in HI titres (1.33- to 1.96-fold) and higher HI titres in cord/newborn blood (1.21- to 1.64-fold). Conclusions: This review provides comparative analysis of the effect of vaccination timing on maternal immunogenicity and protection of the infant that is informative and relevant to current vaccine scheduling for pregnant women. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Different Disc Characteristics Associated with High Myopia and the Location of Glaucomatous Damage in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma and Normal-Tension Glaucoma","2019","Pr?cis:Disc tilt is a characteristic of high myopia and related to lower wedge-shaped retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defects in normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). In primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the direction of disc torsion corresponds to the location of wedge-shaped RNFL defects.To evaluate the disc characteristics in high myopia and the relationships between disc tilt and torsion and the location of wedge-shaped RNFL defects in primary POAG and NTG.Materials and Methods:The differences in disc properties and clinical characteristics between POAG (n=53) and NTG (n=82), and between high myopic (<-6 D, n=77) and non-high myopic (?-6 D, n=58) glaucoma, were investigated. The association between disc tilt and torsion and the location of wedge-shaped RNFL defects in POAG and NTG were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.Results:In NTG, but not in POAG, high myopia eyes had significantly smaller discs, a lower tilt ratio (0.73±0.09), and more disc tilt (56.5%) than did non-high myopia eyes (0.80±0.09, 33.3%). In POAG, eyes with lower wedge-shaped RNFL defects had a significantly smaller torsion angle (-5.44±19.62 degrees, inferior disc torsion) than did eyes with upper defects (9.70±23.62 degrees, superior disc torsion; P=0.014). In NTG, a significantly decreased tilt ratio (0.74±0.93; P=0.001) and more disc tilt (55.9%, P=0.005) were found in eyes with lower wedge-shaped RNFL defects than in eyes with upper defects (0.81±0.09; 21.7%). The torsion degree and tilt ratio were the only factors associated with the location of wedge-shaped RNFL defects in POAG and NTG, respectively.Conclusions:In NTG, smaller and tilted discs were the characteristics of high myopia. Disc tilt was associated with lower wedge-shaped RNFL defects. In POAG, the direction of disc torsion corresponded to the location of the wedge-shaped RNFL defects. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Clinical-Genomic Models of Node-Positive Breast Cancer: Training, Testing, and Validation","2019","Purpose: There is no useful model for predicting the risk of recurrence in node-positive patients regardless of breast cancer subtype. We developed and validated 2 clinical-genomic models (recurrence index [RI]–local recurrence [LR]) and RI-distant recurrence (RI-DR) for stratifying these patients into low- and high-risk groups. Methods and Materials: The 4 data sets were (1) training group (n = 112); (2) testing group (n = 46); (3) validation group (n = 388); and (4) E-MTAB-365 data set (n = 426). Patients who had undergone mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery and mRNA microarray analysis of their primary tumor tissue and had a pathologic stage of I to III were enrolled in the training, testing, and validation groups. Using preset cut-offs obtained from the training group, the models were tested and validated in the 3 other independent groups. Results: In the validation data set, the RI-LR distinguished between low- and high-risk groups according to 10-year LR-free interval (100% vs 93.0%, P = .015) and relapse-free survival (RFS; 85.0% vs 76.9%, P = .032). The RI-DR distinguished the low-risk group from the high-risk group according to RFS (85.7% vs 77.4%, P = .025). RI-DR and RI-LR scores were independent prognostic factors in N1-N2 patients (hazard ratio [HR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-10.2; and HR, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.7, respectively) by multivariate analysis. The RI-DR and RI-LR genetic models were tested similarly using the E-MTAB data set with HRs of 2.5 (P = .0048) and 2.7 (P = .0285), respectively, in node-positive patients. Conclusions: Both RI-DR and RI-LR can partition N1-N2 patients into low- and high-risk groups for RFS; however, the latter is superior for predicting locoregional recurrence. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Diseases; Genes; Multivariant analysis; Breast conserving surgery; Confidence interval; Local recurrence; Locoregional recurrence; Methods and materials; Microarray analysis; Multi variate analysis; Prognostic factors; Statistical tests; messenger RNA; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; cancer tissue; distant recurrence free survival; female; high risk population; human; local recurrence free survival; low risk population; major clinical study; male; mastectomy; microarray analysis; partial mastectomy; primary tumor; priority journal; recurrence free survival; validation study"

Our data show that CUMA treatment inhibited A375-R melanoma cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. CUMA also suppressed the activity of CDK1/cyclin B1 complex and led to G2/M-phase arrest of A375-R cells. Furthermore, CUMA treatment resulted in induction of apoptosis as shown by the increased activation of caspase 3 and caspase 7, and the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). We also observed that CUMA induced autophagy-like activity in A375-R cells, as shown by the increased expression of autophagy-related genes and increased formation of autophagosomes. Moreover, we found that CUMA treatment induced ER stress response and co-treatment with an ER stress inhibitor (4-PBA) could attenuate apoptosis induced by CUMA. Importantly, orally administered CUMA as a single agent or in combination with PLX4032 exhibited strong tumor growth inhibition in a PLX4032-resistant A375-R xenograft mouse model, and with little toxicity. This is the first report to explore the anti-tumor activity of CUMA in vitro and in vivo mechanistically, and our results imply that this triterpenoid saponin may be suitable for development into an anti-melanoma agent. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Nano-lipospheres as acoustically active ultrasound contrast agents: Evolving tumor imaging and therapy technique","2019","Applying nanobubbles (NBs) for contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging has received increased attention. NBs are biocompatible, multifunctional, theranostic agents. Their properties of high echogenicity and stability create an agent suitable for ultrasonography diagnosis. Their favorable properties of size, in vivo stability, and ease of modification are being exploited to implement a theranostic platform for cancer treatment. The considerable development offers the potential to overcome drug resistance and adverse side effects that are associated with traditional chemotherapy. This review outlines the principles of ultrasonography and angiogenesis. Microbubbles and micelles are also discussed to underline the superior capabilities of NBs for the application. NBs could passively accumulate to tumor tissue by enhanced permeability and retention effect. In addition, it can also achieve the active transportation by surface modification. Active targeting modalities and stimuli-responsive drug delivery modifications generate a therapeutic vehicle. The cytotoxicity of NBs formulations, multimodal imaging capability, active targeting mechanisms, and drug delivery methods are highlighted to confirm the NB as a vehicle for targeted treatment and enhanced ultrasound imaging. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Biocompatibility; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diagnosis; Drug delivery; Micelles; Tumors; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonography; Active targeting; Active transportations; Contrast enhanced ultrasound; Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect; Nanobubbles; Stimuli-responsive drug deliveries; theranostic; Ultrasound contrast agent; Targeted drug delivery; contrast medium; nanoparticle; diagnostic imaging; drug delivery system; drug effect; drug resistance; echography; human; microbubble; neoplasm; procedures; theranostic nanomedicine; Contrast Media; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Microbubbles; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Theranostic Nanomedicine; Ultrasonography"
"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for progressive combined immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferation in patients with activated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase δ syndrome type 1","2019","Background: Activated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase δ syndrome type 1 (APDS1) is a recently described primary immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, lymphoid hyperplasia, and Herpesviridae infections caused by germline gain-of-function mutations of PIK3CD. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be considered to ameliorate progressive immunodeficiency and associated malignancy, but appropriate indications, methods, and outcomes of HSCT for APDS1 remain undefined. Objective: Our objective was to analyze the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, prognosis, and treatment of APDS1 and explore appropriate indications and methods of HSCT. Methods: We reviewed retrospectively the medical records of cohorts undergoing HSCT at collaborating facilities. Results: Thirty-year overall survival was 86.1%, but event-free survival was 39.6%. Life-threatening events, such as severe infections or lymphoproliferation, were frequent in childhood and adolescence and were common indications for HSCT. Nine patients underwent HSCT with fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning. Seven patients survived after frequent adverse complications and engraftment failure. Most symptoms improved after HSCT. Conclusion: Patients with APDS1 showed variable clinical manifestations. Life-threatening progressive combined immunodeficiency and massive lymphoproliferation were common indications for HSCT. Fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning–HSCT ameliorated clinical symptoms, but transplantation-related complications were frequent, including graft failure. ? 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","busulfan; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; etoposide; fludarabine; immunoglobulin; melphalan; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; prednisolone; rapamycin; rituximab; tacrolimus; thymocyte antibody; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; activated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase delta syndrome type 1; adolescent; Article; child; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; combined immunodeficiency; comparative study; controlled study; disease course; event free survival; female; graft failure; graft versus host reaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hepatosplenomegaly; herpes virus infection; human; immune deficiency; laboratory test; lymphocyte proliferation; lymphoid hyperplasia; male; medical record review; overall survival; plasma exchange; preschool child; priority journal; prognosis; reduced intensity conditioning; respiratory tract infection; retrospective study; school child; splenectomy; treatment indication; whole body radiation; adult; allograft; clinical trial; disease free survival; immune deficiency; immunology; lymphoproliferative disease; mortality; pathology; survival rate; Adolescent; Adult; Allografts; Child; Child, Preschool; Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Lymphoproliferative Disorders; Male; Survival Rate"
"Targeting the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in MTAP-deficient renal cell carcinoma","2019","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has emerged as a metabolic disease characterized by dysregulated expression of metabolic enzymes. Patients with metastatic RCC have an unusually poor prognosis and near-universal resistance to all current therapies. To improve RCC treatment and the survival rate of patients with RCC, there is an urgent need to reveal the mechanisms by which metabolic reprogramming regulates aberrant signaling and oncogenic progression. Through an integrated analysis of RCC metabolic pathways, we showed that methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) and its substrate methylthioadenosine (MTA) are dysregulated in aggressive RCC. A decrease in MTAP expression was observed in RCC tissues and correlated with higher tumor grade and shorter overall survival. Genetic manipulation of MTAP demonstrated that MTAP expression inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and migration of RCC cells. Interestingly, we found a decrease in the protein methylation level with a concomitant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation after MTAP knockout. A phospho-kinase array screen identified the type 1 insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) as the candidate with the highest upregulation in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to MTAP loss. We further demonstrated that IGF1R phosphorylation acts upstream of Src and STAT3 signaling in MTAP-knockout RCC cells. IGF1R suppression by a selective inhibitor of IGF1R, linsitinib, impaired the cell migration and invasion capability of MTAP-deleted cells. Surprisingly, an increase in linsitinib-mediated cytotoxicity occurred in RCC cells with MTAP deficiency. Our data suggest that IGF1R signaling is a driver pathway that contributes to the aggressive nature of MTAP-deleted RCC. ? 2019, The Author(s).","5' methylthioadenosine; 5' methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; 6 n,n' dimethylarginine; linsitinib; n(g) methylarginine; n(g),n(g) dimethylarginine; somatomedin C receptor; STAT3 protein; 786-O cell line; Article; cancer growth; cancer staging; cell growth; cell invasion; cell invasion assay; cell migration; cell structure; cell viability; clinical article; colony formation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; down regulation; drug mechanism; enzyme deficiency; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression; gene knockout; gene repression; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; molecular interaction; MTT assay; oncogene src; overall survival; protein expression; protein methylation; protein phosphorylation; renal cell carcinoma; renal cell carcinoma cell line; signal transduction; spectrophotometry; trypan blue assay; upregulation; Western blotting; wound healing assay"

"Mutations in glucokinase and other genes detected in neonatal and type 1B diabetes patient using whole exome sequencing may lead to disease-causing changes in protein activity","2019","Monogenic diabetes is caused by mutations that reduce β-cell function. While Sanger sequencing is the standard method used to detect mutated genes. Next-generation sequencing techniques, such as whole exome sequencing (WES), can be used to find multiple gene mutations in one assay. We used WES to detect genetic mutations in both permanent neonatal (PND) and type 1B diabetes (T1BD). A total of five PND and nine T1BD patients were enrolled in this study. WES variants were assessed using VarioWatch, excluding those identified previously. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the mutations, and their pathogenicity was established via the literature or bioinformatic/functional analysis. The PND and T1BD patients were diagnosed at 0.1–0.5 and 0.8–2.7 years of age, respectively. Diabetic ketoacidosis was present at diagnosis in 60% of PND patients and 44.4% of T1BD patients. We found five novel mutations in five different genes. Notably, patient 602 had a novel homozygous missense mutation c.1295C &gt; A (T432 K) in the glucokinase (GCK) gene. Compared to the wild-type recombinant protein, the mutant protein had significantly lower enzymatic activity (2.5%, p = 0.0002) and Vmax (1.23 ± 0.019 vs. 0.33 ± 0.016, respectively; p = 0.005). WES is a robust technique that can be used to unravel the etiologies of genetically heterogeneous forms of diabetes. Homozygous inactivating mutations of the GCK gene may have a significant role in PND pathogenesis. ? 2018","genomic DNA; glucokinase; glucokinase; Article; child; clinical article; diabetes mellitus; diabetic ketoacidosis; diabetic patient; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; female; gene mutation; human; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; missense mutation; monogenic disorder; newborn disease; next generation sequencing; pathogenicity; permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus; preschool child; priority journal; Sanger sequencing; whole exome sequencing; enzymology; genetics; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; kinetics; metabolism; mutation; newborn; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Glucokinase; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Kinetics; Male; Mutation; Whole Exome Sequencing"
"Effects of screening and universal healthcare on long-term colorectal cancer mortality","2019","Background: To evaluate the time trends of colorectal cancer (CRC) affected by a Nationwide Colorectal Cancer Screening (NCCS) programme with biennial faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and Nationwide Healthcare Insurance (NHI). Methods: Data from the national registries on cancer and death in Taiwan were separated into years 1984-1993, 1994-2003 and 2004-2013 based on the implementations of NHI (starting 1995) and NCCS (starting 2004). The adult population was divided into three age groups (young, 30-49; middle-aged, 50-69; and old, 70-84 years); only the middle-aged were eligible for NCCS. Crude and adjusted effects of NCCS and NHI were quantified by percentage change and 95% confidence interval (CI) with respect to CRC mortality, according to the attributions from incidence and survival. Results: Within 335 million person-years of follow-up, 204 362 incident CRCs and 80 771 CRC-related deaths were identified. Increasing mortality trends were noted for 1994-2003 (post-NHI) vs 1984-1993 due to remarkable increasing incidence trends that could not be offset by improved survival as a result of NHI. During 2004-13 (post-NCCS), mortality continued to increase by 15% (95% CI: 10-21%) in young adults (30-49 years) and 8% (95% CI: 6-11%) in older adults (70-84 years), whereas middle-aged adults (50-69 years) had a reduction of 7% (95% CI: 5-9%) due to a remarkable stage shift and subsequent improvement in survival. In the middle-aged adults, increased incidence was less but survival improvement was more compared with other age groups. Conclusions: Whereas universal healthcare insurance led to improvement in CRC survival, FIT-based screening has made an even greater contribution to reducing CRC mortality. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Ex vivo expanded human Vγ9vδ2 T-cells can suppress epithelial ovarian cancer cell growth","2019","γδ-T-cells have attracted attention because of their potent cytotoxicity towards tumors. Most γδ-T-cells become activated via a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent pathway by the interaction of their receptor, Natural Killer Group 2 Member D (NKG2D) with the tumor-specific NKG2D ligands, including MHC class I-related chain A/B (MICA/B) and UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs), to kill tumor cells. However, despite their potent antitumor effects, the treatment protocols specifically targeting ovarian tumors require further improvements. Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal and challenging female malignancies worldwide because of delayed diagnoses and resistance to traditional chemotherapy. In this study, we successfully enriched and expanded γδ-T-cells up to ~78% from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with mostly the Vγ9Vδ2-T-cell subtype in the circulation. We showed that expanded γδ-T-cells alone exerted significant cytotoxic activities towards specific epithelial-type OVCAR3 and HTB75 cells, whereas the combination of γδ-T cells and pamidronate (PAM), a kind of aminobisphosphonates (NBPs), showed significantly enhanced cytotoxic activities towards all types of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, in tumor xenografts of immunodeficient NSG mice, γδ-T-cells not only suppressed tumor growth but also completely eradicated preexisting tumors with an initial size of ~5 mm. Thus, we concluded that γδ-T-cells alone possess dramatic cytotoxic activities towards epithelial ovarian cancers both in vitro and in vivo. These results strongly support the potential of clinical immunotherapeutic application of γδ-T-cells to treat this serious female malignancy. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Association of maternal allergy with human milk soluble CD14 and fatty acids, and early childhood atopic dermatitis","2019","Background: This study aimed to investigate whether maternal allergy is associated with soluble CD14 (sCD14) and fatty acid composition in different stages of lactation and the onset of atopic dermatitis (AD) in early childhood. Methods: In total, 443 mother-child groups (445 children) were enrolled in the Prediction of Allergies in Taiwanese Children birth cohort study. Colostrum and mature milk at 2?months postpartum (2-month HM) were collected from lactating mothers. Information regarding parental allergy histories and physician-diagnosed atopic diseases was obtained using age-specific questionnaires (0-2?years). We compared sCD14 levels and the composition of 30 fatty acids in the colostrum and 2-month HM, respectively, between allergic and non-allergic mothers and between children with and without AD by the age of 2?years. Results: In total, 185 (41.8%) mothers presented with allergies, and 154 (34.6%) children had physician-diagnosed AD by the age of 2?years. Both in the colostrum and 2-month HM of 289 lactating mothers, sCD14 levels were significantly lower in allergic mothers whose children presented with AD compared with children who did not (P?=?0.015 and 0.044, respectively). Among the children with AD who were born to non-allergic mothers, sCD14 levels were lower. However, the result was not statistically significant (P?=?0.376 and 0.264, respectively). Our data revealed the lack of associations between fatty acid composition and AD (P?>?0.05). Conclusion: Decreased sCD14 levels in the colostrum and 2-month HM were associated with AD at 2?years of age, particularly among children born to mothers with allergies. ? 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

"Automated tongue diagnosis on the smartphone and its applications","2019","Tongue features are important objective basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment in both western medicine and Chinese medicine. The need for continuous monitoring of health conditions inspires us to develop an automatic tongue diagnosis system based on built-in sensors of smartphones. However, tongue images taken by smartphone are quite different in color due to various lighting conditions, and it consequently affects the diagnosis especially when we use the appearance of tongue fur to infer health conditions. In this paper, we captured paired tongue images with and without flash, and the color difference between the paired images is used to estimate the lighting condition based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The color correction matrices for three kinds of common lights (i.e., fluorescent, halogen and incandescent) are pre-trained by using a ColorChecker-based method, and the corresponding pre-trained matrix for the estimated lighting is then applied to eliminate the effect of color distortion. We further use tongue fur detection as an example to discuss the effect of different model parameters and ColorCheckers for training the tongue color correction matrix under different lighting conditions. Finally, in order to demonstrate the potential use of our proposed system, we recruited 246 patients over a period of 2.5 years from a local hospital in Taiwan and examined the correlations between the captured tongue features and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are important bio-markers for liver diseases. We found that some tongue features have strong correlation with AST or ALT, which suggests the possible use of these tongue features captured on a smartphone to provide an early warning of liver diseases. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Amino acids; Color; Colorimetry; Lighting; mHealth; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Alanine aminotransferase; Clinical diagnosis; Color distortions; Continuous monitoring; Image color; Lighting conditions; Strong correlation; Tongue fur; Diagnosis; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; halogen; Article; brightness; colorimetry; human; illumination; incandescence; liver disease; major clinical study; mobile application; support vector machine; tongue; western medicine; algorithm; Chinese medicine; color; computer assisted diagnosis; equipment design; image processing; liver disease; pathophysiology; procedures; smartphone; support vector machine; Taiwan; temperature; tongue; Algorithms; Color; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Equipment Design; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lighting; Liver Diseases; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Smartphone; Support Vector Machine; Taiwan; Temperature; Tongue"
"Autonomic reactivity during reading of a somatic distress script in patients with somatic symptom disorder","2019","Objective: The relationship between resting-state heart rate variability (HRV) and somatic symptom disorder (SSD) has been explored in several studies. We planned to examine HRV during the performance of psychological tasks, and assumed that it could be applied for the diagnosis of SSD. Methods: Fifty-three patients with SSD and 52 healthy controls were recruited. Demographic and psychological data were collected. Subjects' HRV was measured over five 5-minute blocks during which they viewed different scripts (resting state; health anxiety; somatic distress; depression; neutral topic). After each block they completed a self-assessment manikin. Generalized estimated equation analysis was used to analyze the impact of mental scripts, SSD and sex on physiological and psychological indicators. Results: In men there was a script*SSD interaction concerning high-frequency power (HF) involving the neutral script; SSD men showed significantly higher HF than healthy men when viewing neutral script. In women there were script*SSD interactions with respect to low-frequency power (LF) and HF involving the somatic distress script and a script*SSD interaction with respect to LF and emotional valence involving the neutral script; SSD women revealed significantly lower LF and HF than healthy women when viewing somatic distress script, they also showed significantly lower LF and higher valence than healthy ones during neutral script. The somatic distress script*SSD interaction still influenced LF and HF in women after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusion: In women cue-specific HRV is a better method of differentiating people with SSD from healthy individuals than resting-state HRV.

"Three Nurse-administered Protocols Reduce Nutritional Decline and Frailty in Older Gastrointestinal Surgery Patients: A Cluster Randomized Trial","2019","Objective: To evaluate the effects of the modified Hospital Elder Life Program (mHELP)comprising 3 nurse-administered protocols in older patients undergoing gastrointestinal (GI)surgery. Design: Cluster randomized trial. Setting: Two 36-bed GI wards at a university-affiliated medical center in Taiwan. Participants: Older patients (?65 years, N = 377)were recruited if they were scheduled for elective GI surgery with an expected length of hospital stay >6 days. After transferring to the GI ward after surgery, participants were randomly assigned to the mHELP or control group (1:1)by room rather than individually because most patient units are double- or triple-occupancy rooms. Intervention: The mHELP protocols (early mobilization, oral and nutritional assistance, and orienting communication)were administered daily with usual care by a trained nurse until hospital discharge. The control group received usual care only. Measures: Outcomes were in-hospital nutritional decline, measured by body weight and Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA)scores, and Fried's frailty phenotype. Return of GI motility was examined as a potential mechanism contributing to observed outcomes. Results: Participants (mean age = 74.5 years; 56.8% male)primarily underwent colorectal (56.5%), gastric (21.2%), and pancreatobiliary (13.8%)surgery. Participants who received the mHELP [for a median of 7 days (interquartile range = 6–10 days)]had significantly lower in-hospital weight loss and decline in MNA scores (weight ?2.1 vs ?4.0 lb, P =.002; score ?3.2 vs ?4.0, P =.03)than the control group. The mHELP group also had significantly lower rates of incident frailty during hospitalization (12.0% vs 21.7%, P =.022), and persistent frailty (50.0% vs 92.9%, P =.03). Participants in the mHELP group had trends toward an accelerated return of GI motility. Conclusion and Implications: The mHELP effectively reduced nutritional decline, prevented new frailty, and promoted recovery of frailty present before admission. These nurse-administered protocols might be useful in other settings, including conditions managed at home or in nursing facilities. ? 2018 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","aged; Article; body weight; body weight loss; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical protocol; colorectal cancer; controlled study; defecation; elective surgery; female; frailty; gastrointestinal motility; gastrointestinal surgery; hospital discharge; human; intestine motility; laparoscopy; length of stay; long term care; major clinical study; male; Mini Mental State Examination; mobilization; nurse; nursing care; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; operation duration; ostomy; outcome assessment; pancreas cancer; postoperative care; randomized controlled trial; stomach cancer; surgical patient"
"Basal insulin therapy: Unmet medical needs in Asia and the new insulin glargine in diabetes treatment","2019","Diabetes remains a global epidemic and a tremendous health challenge, especially in the Asian population. Dramatic increases in the prevalence of diabetes across different countries or areas in Asia have been reported in recent epidemiological studies. Although clinical guidelines have strengthened appropriate antihyperglycemic medications and lifestyle modifications for optimal diabetes management, inadequate glycemic control still occurs in many patients with an increased risk of developing microvascular and macrovascular complications. Insulin administration is the main therapy for diabetes in response to the inability to secrete insulin, and is recommended in current guidelines to treat patients with type?2 diabetes after failure of oral antidiabetic drugs. Clinical studies have shown that long-acting insulin analogs improve basal glycemic control with reduced risk of hypoglycemia. In the present review, we discuss previous challenges with basal insulin therapy in Asia, the pharmacological development of insulin analogs to overcome the unmet medical needs and recent clinical studies of the new ultra-long-acting insulin analog, insulin glargine U300. Furthermore, relevant findings of current real-world evidence are also included for the comparison of the efficacy and safety of different insulin formulations. Based on the accumulating evidence showing a low incidence of hypoglycemia and technical benefits of dose titration, treatment with glargine U300 can be a promising strategy for Asian diabetes patients to achieve glycemic targets with favorable safety. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Human insulin therapy is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer: A population-based retrospective cohort study","2019","Background: Whether human insulin may affect lung cancer risk requires investigation. Methods: All patients with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus from 1996 to 2009 were enrolled from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance. An entry date was set on January 1, 2004, and 1,007,617 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed before 2004 were followed up for new-onset lung cancer until December 31, 2009. Incidence rates of lung cancer for never-users, ever-users, and tertiles of three dose-response exposure parameters (i.e., time since starting insulin, cumulative dose, and cumulative duration) were calculated. Adjusted hazard ratios were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. The joint effect of insulin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was also evaluated. Results: There were 156,720 ever-users and 850,897 never-users. The respective case numbers of incident lung cancer were 3,007 (1.92%) and 13,677 (1.61%), and the respective incidence rates were 424.45 and 313.60 per 100,000 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratio comparing ever-users vs. never-users was 1.545 (95% confidence interval: 1.478–1.614). The hazard ratios for the different subgroups of the three dose–response parameters all suggested a significantly higher risk of lung cancer associated with insulin use (P trend < 0.0001). Compared to patients without insulin use and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insulin users who also had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had the highest risk of lung cancer (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.891, 95% confidence interval: 1.767–2.024). Conclusions: This study suggests a significant association between human insulin use and lung cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Copyright ? 2019 Tseng.

AG patients had significantly higher frequencies of microcytosis, macrocytosis, blood Hb, iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid deficiencies, and hyperhomocysteinemia than 532 healthy control subjects. Moreover, 284 GPCA + AG patients had significantly higher frequencies of macrocytosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hyperhomocysteinemia than 780 GPCA ? AG patients. Sixty-three (22.2%) of 284 GPCA + AG patients and 139 (17.8%) of 780 GPCA ? AG patients had anemia. The normocytic anemia (42.9%), pernicious anemia (34.9%), and iron deficiency anemia (15.9%) were the three most common types of anemia in the 63 anemic GPCA + AG patients. Moreover, the normocytic anemia (64.8%), iron deficiency anemia (14.4%), and thalassemia trait-induced anemia (13.7%) were the three most common types of anemia in 139 anemic GPCA ? AG patients. Conclusion: The disease of AG itself is a significant factor causing anemia, hematinic deficiencies, and hyperhomocysteinemia in both GPCA + AG and GPCA ? AG patients. The serum GPCA also plays a significant role in causing macrocytosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hyperhomocysteinemia in GPCA + AG patients. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","cyanocobalamin; folic acid; hemoglobin; homocysteine; iron; parietal cell antibody; autoantibody; cyanocobalamin; folic acid; hemoglobin; iron; adult; aged; anemia; antibody blood level; Article; controlled study; cyanocobalamin deficiency; erythrocyte; female; folic acid blood level; folic acid deficiency; glossitis; hemoglobin blood level; human; hyperhomocysteinemia; iron blood level; iron deficiency; iron deficiency anemia; macrocytic anemia; major clinical study; male; mean corpuscular volume; megalocytosis; microcytic anemia; microcytosis; pernicious anemia; thalassemia; very elderly; young adult; anemia; atrophy; blood; case control study; erythrocyte count; glossitis; hyperhomocysteinemia; immunology; middle aged; stomach parietal cell; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anemia; Atrophy; Autoantibodies; Case-Control Studies; Erythrocyte Count; Erythrocyte Indices; Female; Folic Acid; Glossitis; Hemoglobins; Humans; Hyperhomocysteinemia; Iron; Male; Middle Aged; Parietal Cells, Gastric; Taiwan; Vitamin B 12; Young Adult"
"Impact of overdiagnosis on long-term breast cancer survival","2019","Elucidating whether and how long-term survival of breast cancer is mainly due to cure after early detection and effective treatment and therapy or overdiagnosis resulting from the widespread use of mammography provides a new insight into the role mammography plays in screening, surveillance, and treatment of breast cancer. Given information on detection modes, the impact of overdiagnosis due to mammography screening on long-term breast cancer survival was quantitatively assessed by applying a zero (cured or overdiagnosis)-inflated model design and analysis to a 15-year follow-up breast cancer cohort in Dalarna, Sweden. The probability for non-progressive breast cancer (the zero part) was 56.14% including the 44.34% complete cure after early detection and initial treatment and a small 11.80% overdiagnosis resulting from mammography screening program (8.94%) and high awareness (2.86%). The 15-year adjusted cumulative survival of breast cancer was dropped from 88.25% to 74.80% after correcting for the zero-inflated part of overdiagnosis. The present findings reveal that the majority of survivors among women diagnosed with breast cancer could be attributed to the cure resulting from mammography screening and accompanying effective treatment and therapy and only a small fraction of those were due to overdiagnosis. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Association between early acute respiratory distress syndrome after living-donor liver transplantation and perioperative serum biomarkers: The role of club cell protein 16","2019","Background. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is not uncommon, but it lacks the biomarkers for early detection. Club cell protein 16 (CC16), high-motility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-10 have been reported as relevant to the development of ARDS. However, they have not been investigated during LDLT. Methods. Seventy-three consecutive recipients undergoing LDLT were enrolled and received the same perioperative care plan. Perioperative serum CC16, HMGB1, IL-1β, and IL-10 levels were measured at the pretransplant state, 30 minutes after reperfusion, postoperative day 1 (POD1), and POD3. ARDS was diagnosed according to the 2012 Berlin definition. Results. Of the 73 recipients, 13 developed ARDS with significantly longer durations of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay. Serum CC16 levels on POD1 increased significantly from the pretransplant state in the ARDS group but not in the non-ARDS group. Pretransplant serum CC16 levels were also higher in the ARDS group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for POD1 serum CC16 levels used to discriminate ARDS was 0.803 (95% confidence interval: 0.679 to 0.895; p < 0.001). By comparison, HMGB1, IL-1β, and IL-10 were not associated with ARDS after LDLT. Conclusion. The higher pretransplant serum CC16 level and its increased level on POD1 were associated with the development of early ARDS after LDLT.

"The structural changes of the mutated ankyrin repeat domain of the human TRPV4 channel alter its ATP binding ability","2020","The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPV4 is a calcium-permeable cation channel protein which plays a mechanosensory and osmosensory role in several musculoskeletal tissues. Previous studies have shown that some specific mutations in the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV4 can reduce channel activity and further cause the osteoarthropathy related disease. Mutations in this region probably influence the constitutive activity of the channel, which mainly regulated by the binding of a small ligand such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). These findings suggest that it is crucial to understand the fundamental mechanisms regulated by chemical ligands such as ATP binding with the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV4. However, how these mutations at the molecular level resulting in the related diseases are still unclear. Here we use full atomistic simulations to investigate the mutation induced conformational changes and ATP binding ability differences of TRPV4-ARD. Conformation characteristics of different mutations of TRPV4-ARD are explored. Optimal communication paths are studied to explain how a point mutation away from aim region (Finger 3) can cause a significant alteration on the conformation. We identify two molecular mechanisms through the conformation of Finger 3 and through alter the ATP binding mechanism correspondently to explain these unknowns. Our study provides fundamental insights into the mutation induced structural changes of the TRPV4-ARD and helps to explain how the mutations alter the ATP binding ability of the TRPV4-ARD. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adenosinetriphosphate; Ligands; Ankyrin-repeat domain; Atomistic simulations; Channel activity; Conformational change; Fundamental mechanisms; Molecular mechanism; Optimal communication; Transient receptor potentials; Conformations; adenosine triphosphate; ankyrin; finger 3 protein; k197r protein; protein; unclassified drug; vanilloid receptor 4; Article; chemical structure; conformational transition; hydrogen bond; ligand binding; molecular interaction; osteoarthropathy; point mutation; priority journal; protein conformation; protein domain; protein protein interaction; thermostability"

"Remote organ failure in acute kidney injury","2019","Despite supportive care with renal replacement therapy, acute kidney injury (AKI) remains linked with increased short and long-term mortality, not just because of renal failure but also because of accompanying remote organ dysfunction. Increasing evidence from animal studies suggests that numerous factors contribute both to the development of AKI and the impairment of various vital organs, including pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, leukocyte infiltration, vascular permeability changes, ion channel derangement, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. Human studies have reported that AKI with concomitant multi-organ dysfunction is associated with a high death rate. We propose that persistent organ dysfunction after AKI can be considered in relation to three proposed mechanisms (1) classical uremic stress and its associated sequelae (2) systemic inflammation as a consequence of kidney injury (3) treatment-related effects. Using this framework, we discuss the known pathways through which AKI can affect the function of a number of remote organs. We review the short- and long-term clinical impact of AKI on other organ systems and potential mechanisms through which AKI may affect remote organ systems. Further elucidating the effects of AKI on remote organ function may lead to new therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes after AKI. ? 2018","loop diuretic agent; cytokine; acute kidney failure; blood vessel permeability; brain; gastrointestinal tract; heart; human; immune system; inflammation; liver; lung; mortality rate; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; remote organ failure; Review; stress; systemic inflammation; uremic stress; acute kidney failure; adverse drug reaction; adverse event; animal; apoptosis; complication; metabolism; mortality; multiple organ failure; pathophysiology; renal replacement therapy; Acute Kidney Injury; Animals; Apoptosis; Cytokines; Humans; Inflammation; Long Term Adverse Effects; Multiple Organ Failure; Renal Replacement Therapy"
"Antivirals and vaccines for Enterovirus A71","2019","Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is an important emerging virus posing a threat to children under five years old. EV-A71 infection in infants or young children can cause hand-foot-and-mouth disease, herpangina, or severe neurological complications. However, there are still no effective antivirals for treatment of these infections. In this review, we summarize the antiviral compounds developed to date based on various targets of the EV-A71 life cycle. Moreover, development of a vaccine would be the most effective approach to prevent EV-A71 infection. Therefore, we also summarize the development and clinical progress of various candidate EV-A71 vaccines, including inactivated whole virus, recombinant VP1 protein, synthetic peptides, viral-like particles, and live attenuated vaccines. ? 2019 The Author(s).","antivirus agent; virus vaccine; animal; Enterovirus A; Enterovirus infection; human; immunology; mouse; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Enterovirus A, Human; Enterovirus Infections; Humans; Mice; Viral Vaccines"
"Nationwide analysis of medical utilization in people with severe mental illness receiving home care case management","2019","Aim: This nationwide study investigated the change in medical utilization of psychiatric home care case management (CM). Methods: This nationwide study enrolled patients receiving CM (N = 10,274) from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2010, from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Through a 2-year mirror-image comparison weighted by the contributed person-time for each subject, we evaluated changes in medical utilization. Furthermore, a case-crossover analysis was used to verify the independent effect of CM in changing medical utilization by adjusting the time-variant variables between the pre-2-year (within 2 years before receiving CM) and post-2-year (within years after receiving CM) periods. The same methodology was applied for the subsequent 2-year comparison to assess the maintenance effect. Results: Of the 10,274 patients receiving CM, 69.7% had schizophrenia. The results showed a chronological trend for the intervention of CM. The adjusted mirror-image analysis revealed a significant decrement of psychiatric and involuntary admissions after the intervention, and the utilization shifted toward psychiatric outpatient service. The case-crossover analysis with the adjustment of time-variant covariates confirmed the independent effect of CM on the changes of medical utilization. The comparable effect persisted after the next 2 years of intervention. However, CM showed no impact on lowering the admission rate for comorbid physical illnesses after the intervention. Conclusions: The CM model can effectively reduce psychiatric hospitalization and involuntary admission frequency but has no effect on comorbid physical illnesses. Care models aimed at ameliorating physical problems in such patients are needed. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","corticosteroid; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; bipolar disorder; case management; comorbidity; controlled study; disease severity; female; health care utilization; health insurance; home care; hospitalization; human; intensive care; length of stay; long term care; major clinical study; male; mental disease; methodology; middle aged; physical disease; priority journal; psychoeducation; regression analysis; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; urbanization; very elderly; young adult"
"Demography and welfare status of free-roaming dogs in Yangmingshan National Park, Taiwan","2019","Free-roaming dogs (Canis familiaris) cause threats to native wildlife and public health and raise concerns for their welfare. Understanding the demography of free-roaming dog populations is essential for developing an effective management plan. An evaluation of their welfare status would be beneficial to earn public support for the management plan. In this study, we estimated the population size, survivorship, and health of a free-roaming dog population in Yangmingshan National Park (YMSNP), Taiwan, during 2016–2018. YMSNP is a rural area with human settlements but also a protected area of conservation concern. We identified 191, 176, 216 individuals at our sampling sites in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Using a photographic capture-recapture method and extrapolation, we estimated that there were 786–979 dogs in the park during this 3-year period. The annual apparent survival rate of identified dogs was 16.7% for 2016–2017 and 23.9% for 2017–2018. The dogs had a high rate of lameness and dermatosis of 5.1–8.8% and 14.2–18.1%, respectively. Thirty-five blood samples showed that 34.3% of the dogs were anemic, 37.1% showed abnormal white blood cell counts, and 68.6% exhibited abnormal platelet counts. These results suggested that the dogs were at high density with low survivorship and in poor health, and new individuals entered the population continuously. Interventions to manage this dog population and to improve their welfare must be carried out. Our study provides an example for monitoring and managing a free-roaming dog population in a rural, conservation area in Southeast Asia. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","hemoglobin variant; animal health; animal lameness; animal welfare; Article; blood cell count; blood sampling; demography; dog disease; erythrocyte count; female; leukocyte count; male; national park; nonhuman; platelet count; population density; population size; priority journal; public health; rural area; skin disease; stray dog; survival rate; Taiwan; wildlife; wound; animal; dog; physiology; recreational park; Animal Welfare; Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Parks, Recreational; Population Density; Taiwan"
"Opportunities of circulating tumor DNA in lung cancer","2019","Current classification and treatment of lung cancer rely increasingly on molecular and genetic testing. Obtaining tumor tissue is not always feasible and multiple biopsies are undesirable. In response to the demand for non-invasive molecular and genetic testing in cancer care, several liquid biopsy technologies, including circulating DNA (ctDNA), have been developed. ctDNA analysis is now technically feasible to be carried out in large scales and integrated into clinical practice owing to the advances in technology. Despite the challenges in improving test accuracy and cost-effectiveness, there are huge potentials for ctDNA analysis in lung cancer management. This review focuses on the clinical utility of ctDNA analysis in lung cancer, including early detection, monitoring treatment response and detecting residual disease, identification of genetic determinants for targeted therapy, and predicting efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","alectinib; atezolizumab; brigatinib; ceritinib; checkpoint kinase inhibitor; circulating tumor DNA; crizotinib; docetaxel; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; gemcitabine; loratinib; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; unclassified drug; circulating tumor DNA; DNA; tumor marker; cancer prognosis; clinical practice; cost effectiveness analysis; diagnostic accuracy; disease management; DNA determination; drug approval; drug efficacy; early cancer diagnosis; EGFR gene; gene mutation; genetic analysis; human; liquid biopsy; lung cancer; minimal residual disease; molecularly targeted therapy; non small cell lung cancer; patient monitoring; prediction; Review; small cell lung cancer; treatment response; blood; lung tumor; Biomarkers, Tumor; Circulating Tumor DNA; DNA, Neoplasm; Humans; Liquid Biopsy; Lung Neoplasms"
"Compare fuhrman nuclear and chromophobe tumor grade on chromophobe RCC","2019","Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) has a favorable prognosis. Due to irregular nuclei and nuclear pleomorphism, chRCC has a high Fuhrman nuclear grade (FNG). The chromophobe tumor grade (CTG) is a novel three-Tier grading system that has been reported to be a better prognosticator than the traditional FNG. We compared the two nuclear grading systems in terms of patients' clinical outcomes. We performed this retrospective chart review of all patients with chRCC from 2000 to 2017. All pathologic features and CTG and FNG results were re-evaluated. Eighteen patients' records were reviewed with a mean follow-up of 70.6 months. The nuclear grading distribution was as follows: FNG 2, 56%; FNG 3, 39%; FNG 4, 5%; CTG 1, 78%; CTG 2, 17%; and CTG 3, 6%. Only one patient died. This patient had adrenal invasion, lung metastasis, sarcomatoid change and tumor necrosis, and the tumor was graded as FNG 4 and CTG 3. Overall survival was associated with both FNG and CTG.

"E-cigarette use in a country with prevalent tobacco smoking: A population-based study in Taiwan","2019","Background: The different profiles of e-cigarette users in different age groups have seldom been investigated, particularly in populations facing a high prevalence of cigarette smoking. This study aims to examine the prevalence and correlates of e-cigarette use separately for adolescents and adults in nationally representative samples in Taiwan. Methods: Among 17,837 participants in the 2014 National Survey of Substance Use in Taiwan, 4445 were aged 12 to 17 years and 13,392 were aged 18 to 64 years. Individuals’ lifetime tobacco use was divided into four groups: non-use, exclusive e-cigarette use, exclusive cigarette use, and dual use. Questions on sociodemographic features, use and problematic use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, and psychosocial distress, among others, were administered using a computer-assisted selfinterview on tablet computers. Results: Among lifetime users of e-cigarette (2.2% for adults and 0.8% for adolescents), 4.5% for adults and 36.6% for adolescents were exclusive e-cigarette users. From use of exclusive e-cigarettes to use of exclusive cigarettes to dual use, those usage groups were related to an increasing trend of adjusted odds ratios for use of other psychoactive substances, particularly problematic use of alcohol or drugs, and with more depressive symptoms. Two correlates were specific to e-cigarette use: alcohol use had stronger relationships with e-cigarette use among adolescents, and younger adults (18-34) were more likely to try e-cigarettes compared to older adults. Conclusions: These results provide essential information regarding e-cigarette use in the general population, and future prevention strategies should account for its specific correlates in young people. ? 2018 Yi-Lung Chen et al.","adolescent; adult; age distribution; child; cross-sectional study; electronic cigarette; epidemiology; female; health survey; human; male; middle aged; prevalence; smoking; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Taiwan; Tobacco Smoking; Young Adult"
"The relationship of anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody and C5a complement with disease activity and short-term outcome in idiopathic membranous nephropathy","2019","Background: The binding of anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (anti-PLA2R) antibody to podocyte and complement activation is the mechanisms of idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). C5a, a complement activation end product, is a strong inflammatory cell stimulator and can influence the behavior of T cells and dendritic cells. This study examined the etiology–disease relationship and significance of auto-antibody and C5a with short-term remission. Method: Plasma anti-PLA2R antibody and C5a were measured with the blood samples that were collected when patients were admitted for renal biopsy. The deposition of IgA, IgG, IgM, C1q and C3c in glomerulus was graded according to immunofluorescence staining. The relationship of anti-PLA2R antibody with C5a, glomerular immunoglobulin and complement deposition was examined. Antibody and C5a levels as predictors of short-term remission were also examined. Results: In 72 IMN patients, 50 patients had positive plasma anti-PLA2R antibody. The antibody had positive correlation to proteinuria. Patients with high grade IgG or C3c, but not IgA/IgM/C1q, deposition had higher anti-PLA2R antibody titers. C5a was increased in IMN patients, but had no correlation with anti-PLA2R antibody or proteinuria. The analysis revealed that C5a, not initial anti-PLA2R antibody, was a predictor associated with 12-month remission in patients receiving immunosuppression with multivariate-adjusted OR 0.74 (95% CI, 0.58–0.94, P = 0.01). Conclusion: This study provides indirect evidences of etiology–disease relationship of anti-PLA2R antibody in IMN patients.

Two cases reports describing in-vitro liver injury were excluded. Reviews and articles without the detailed report, laboratory data and history were excluded from this study. In the end, there were 53 articles enrolled in this study. These enrolled literatures are from France (n?=?13), Germany (n?=?12), Switzerland (n?=?5) United States of America (n?=?4), Korea (n?=?4), Hong Kong (n?=?4), Greece (n?=?3), China (n?=?2), Canada (n?=?1), Italy (n?=?1), Thailand (n?=?1), Finland (n?=?1), Taiwan (n?=?1), and Japan (n?=?1). The data were analyzed with a commercial statistical software Stata/SE 12.0 program Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA.

"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) beyond EGFR mutations per se is a common mechanism for acquired resistance to EGFR TKI","2019","Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a major advance in treating NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. However, acquired resistance, due partially to secondary mutations limits their use. Here we report that NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib or osimertinib (AZD9291) exhibit EMT features, with a decrease in E-cadherin, and increases in vimentin and stemness, without possessing any EGFR secondary mutations. Knockdown of E-cadherin in parental cells increased gefitinib resistance and stemness, while knockdown of vimentin in resistant cells resulted in opposite effects. Src activation and Hakai upregulation were found in gefitinib-resistant cells. Knockdown of Hakai elevated E-cadherin expression, attenuated stemness, and resensitized the cells to gefitinib. Clinical cancer specimens with acquired gefitinib resistance also showed a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in Hakai expression. The dual HDAC and HMGR inhibitor JMF3086 inhibited the Src/Hakai and Hakai/E-cadherin interaction to reverse E-cadherin expression, and attenuated vimentin and stemness to restore gefitinib sensitivity. The EMT features of AZD9291-resistant H1975 cells were related to the upregulation of Zeb1. Both gefitinib and AZD9291 sensitivity was restored by JMF3086 through reversing EMT. Our study not only revealed a common mechanism of EMT in both gefitinib and AZD9291 resistance beyond EGFR mutations per se, but also provides a new strategy to overcome it. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","Cbl protein; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; gefitinib; Hakai protein; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; jmf 3086; messenger RNA; osimertinib; protein tyrosine kinase; transcription factor ZEB1; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; antineoplastic agent; cadherin; CBLL1 protein, human; CDH1 protein, human; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; histone deacetylase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; leukocyte antigen; osimertinib; piperazine derivative; protein kinase inhibitor; small interfering RNA; transcription factor ZEB1; tumor protein; ubiquitin protein ligase; VIM protein, human; vimentin; ZEB1 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer resistance; cancer stem cell; controlled study; drug potentiation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; HCC827 cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; lung non-small cell carcinoma cell line; male; malignant pleura effusion; mouse; mutation; NCI-H1975 cell line; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; upregulation; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; drug effect; drug resistance; drug screening; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression regulation; genetics; germfree animal; lung tumor; non small cell lung cancer; nude mouse; pathology; physiology; RNA interference; tumor cell line; Animals; Antigens, CD; Antineoplastic Agents; Cadherins; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; ErbB Receptors; Gefitinib; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Piperazines; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Vimentin; Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1"
"Obesity is associated with poor prognosis in cardiogenic arrest survivors receiving coronary angiography","2019","Background: The role of body mass index (BMI) in clinical outcomes in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest (CA) has recently drawn attention. We evaluated the effect of BMI on the prognosis of patients successfully resuscitated from cardiogenic arrest. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 273 non-traumatic adult cardiogenic arrest survivors receiving coronary angiography after return of spontaneous circulation in three hospitals from January 2011 to September 2017. These patients were classified as underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese, based on BMI (&lt;18.5; 18.5–24.9; 25.0–29.9; and ?30 kg/m2, respectively). In-hospital mortality and poor neurological outcomes were compared among groups. Results: The obese group had significantly higher rates of in-hospital mortality and poor neurological outcomes (cerebral performance scale = 3–5) than did the other groups (for underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups, in-hospital mortality rates were 38.5%, 29.8%, 39.0%, and 64.1%, respectively, p = 0.002; poor neurological outcomes were 53.9%, 43.8%, 47.0%, and 71.8%, respectively, p = 0.02). The obese group exhibited higher risks of in-hospital mortality and poor neurological outcomes than did the normal-weight group (in-hospital mortality: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 5.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.16–10.32, p &lt; 0.001; poor neurological outcomes: aHR = 3.77, 95% CI 1.69–8.36, p = 0.002).

"Chronic low dose of AM404 ameliorates the cognitive impairment and pathological features in hyperglycemic 3xTg-AD mice","2019","Rationale: Hyperglycemia accelerates the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and GSK3β plays a potential link between AD and hyperglycemia. Therefore, a direct or indirect GSK3β inhibition may have potential to delay the progression of AD. Our previous biochemical assay identified AM404 as a GSK3β inhibitor at high dose (IC50 = 5.353?μM); however, other study suggests that AM404 impaired synaptic plasticity of hippocampus at high dose (10?mg/kg; i.p.). Therefore, the dose and duration of treatment are crucial for the effects of AM404. Objective: The effects and molecular mechanisms of AM404 at low dose were evaluated from in vitro to in vivo models. Methods: AM404 (0.1–0.5?μM) was tested on tau hyperphosphorylated mouse hippocampal primary cultures treated with Wortmannin (WT) and GF109203X (GFX). Hyperglycemic triple transgenic AD (3×Tg-AD) mice at 6?months old were intraperitoneally injected with AM404 (0.25?mg/kg) for 4?weeks. The spatial learning and memory of mice were measured using the Morris water maze. Mouse brain and serum samples were collected for pathological analyses. Results: AM404 (0.5?μM) exhibited significantly augmented neuroprotection toward tau hyperphosphorylation in primary cultures. The chronic systemic administration of AM404 (0.25?mg/kg) attenuated cognitive deficits in hyperglycemic 3×Tg-AD mice. Moreover, chronic low dose of AM404 significantly attenuated Aβ production, tau protein phosphorylation, and inflammation associated with an increase of pS473Akt and pS9-GSK3β. Therefore, AM404 at low dose, not only increased neuroprotection, but also ameliorated cognitive deficit, could be partly by regulating the Akt/GSK3β signaling, which may contribute to downregulation of Aβ, tau hyperphosphorylation, and inflammation in hyperglycemic 3×Tg-AD mice. Conclusions: These results highlight that chronic administration of AM404 at low dose may be through the Akt/GSK3β pathway to ameliorate the impairment in hyperglycemic 3×Tg-AD mice. ? 2018, The Author(s).","monoclonal antibody PS98; n (4 hydroxyphenyl)arachidonamide; tau protein; wortmannin; amyloid beta protein; arachidonic acid derivative; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)arachidonylamide; tau protein; 3XTg mouse; adult; Akt signaling; Alzheimer disease; animal tissue; Article; chronic drug administration; cognitive defect; controlled study; disease course; down regulation; drug effect; drug megadose; female; hippocampus; human; hyperglycemia; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; low drug dose; memory; Morris water maze test; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; neuroprotection; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; spatial learning; treatment duration; Alzheimer disease; animal; C57BL mouse; cognitive defect; dose response; drug administration; drug effect; genetics; hyperglycemia; male; metabolism; mouse mutant; pregnancy; transgenic mouse; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Arachidonic Acids; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Hippocampus; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Obese; Mice, Transgenic; Pregnancy; tau Proteins"

"Relationship Between Statin Use and Outcomes in Patients Having Cardiac Arrest (from a Nationwide Cohort Study in Taiwan)","2019","Pretreatment with statins is associated with improved outcomes in severe sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke. Patients with cardiac arrest experience sepsis-like syndrome and ischemia reperfusion injuries in the heart and brain. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of statin use before cardiac arrest on outcomes in cardiac arrest patients. Medical records of 142,131 adult patients who experienced nontraumatic cardiac arrest and were resuscitated between 2004 and 2011 were analyzed. Patients were grouped into 2 groups: the “statin group” comprised patients who had received statin treatment for at least 30 days before the cardiac arrest event; the “never statin group” comprised patients who had no statin use within 30 days before the event. Patients with previous statin treatment had better chance of survival to hospital discharge (6.1% vs 4.3%, p <0.0001) and 1-year survival (4.8% vs 3.2%, p <0.0001) after propensity score matching. Previous statin use was an independent predictor for 1-year survival (adjusted odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.71; p = 0.001). A favorable outcome effect of statin on 1-year survival was observed in the presence of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score greater than 5 in the subgroup analysis. In conclusion, statin use before cardiac arrest is associated with 1-year survival in a propensity score-matched nationwide cohort study. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; adult; aged; Article; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drug effect; female; heart arrest; hospital discharge; human; independent variable; major clinical study; male; medical record; observational study; predictor variable; priority journal; propensity score; resuscitation; retrospective study; survival rate; Taiwan; treatment duration; treatment outcome"
"Study of diffusive- and convective-transport mediated microtumor growth in a controlled microchamber","2019","In this paper, we report on using mass transport to control nutrition supply of colorectal cancer cells for developing a microtumor in a confined microchamber. To mimic the spatial heterogeneity of a tumor, two microfluidic configurations based on resistive circuits are designed. One has a convection-dominated microchamber to simulate the tumor region proximal to leaky blood vessels. The other has a diffusion-dominated microchamber to mimic the tumor core that lacks blood vessels and nutrient supply. Thus, the time for nutrition to fill the microchamber can vary from tens of minutes to several hours. Results show that cells cultured under a diffusive supply of nutrition have a high glycolytic rate and a nearly constant oxygen consumption rate. In contrast, cells cultured under convective supply of nutrition have a gradual increase of oxygen consumption rate with a low glycolytic rate. This suggests that cancer cells have distinct reactions under different mass transport and nutrition supply. Using these two microfluidic platforms to create different rate of nutrition supply, it is found that a continuous microtumor that almost fills the mm-size microchamber can be developed under a low-nutrient supply environment, but not for the convective condition. It also is demonstrated that microchannels can simulate the delivery of anti-cancer drugs to the microtumor under controlled mass-transport. This method provides a means to develop a larger scale microtumor in a lab-on-a-Chip system for post development and stimulations, and microchannels can be applied to control the physical and chemical environment for anti-cancer drug screening. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article; blood vessel; cancer cell; cell death; cell growth; colorectal cancer; convective transport; diffusive- transport; drug screening; finite element analysis; growth rate; human; microfluidics; nutrient supply; oxygen consumption; pressure gradient; priority journal; SW620 cell line; thermodynamics; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumor model; active transport; cell culture technique; colorectal tumor; metabolism; microfluidic analysis; pathology; procedures; tumor cell line; Biological Transport, Active; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Line, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Microfluidics"
"A clinical and genetic study of early-onset and familial parkinsonism in taiwan: An integrated approach combining gene dosage analysis and next-generation sequencing","2019","Background: Recent genetic progress has allowed for the molecular diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. However, genetic causes of PD vary widely in different ethnicities. Mutational frequencies and clinical phenotypes of genes associated with PD in Asian populations are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to identify the mutational frequencies and clinical spectrums of multiple PD-causative genes in a Taiwanese PD cohort. Methods: A total of 571 participants including 324 patients with early-onset parkinsonism (onset age, <50 years) and 247 parkinsonism pedigrees were recruited at a tertiary referral center in Taiwan from 2002 to 2017. Genetic causes were identified by an integrated approach including gene dosage analysis, a targeted next-generation sequencing panel containing 40 known PD-causative genes, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, and whole-exome sequencing analysis. Results: Thirty of the 324 patients with early-onset parkinsonism (9.3%) were found to carry mutations in Parkin, PINK1, or PLA2G6 or had increased trinucleotide repeats in SCA8. Twenty-nine of 109 probands with autosomal-recessive inheritance of parkinsonism (26.6%) were found to carry mutations in Parkin, PINK1, GBA, or HTRA2. The genetic causes for the 138 probands with an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern of parkinsonism were more heterogeneous. Seventeen probands (12.3%) carried pathogenic mutations in LRRK2, VPS35, MAPT, GBA, DNAJC13, C9orf72, SCA3, or SCA17. A novel missense mutation in the UQCRC1 gene was found in a family with autosomal-dominant inheritance parkinsonism via whole-exome sequencing analysis. Conclusions: Our findings provide a better understanding of the genetic architecture of PD in eastern Asia and broaden the clinical spectrum of PD-causing mutations. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Clear cell carcinoma of the abdominal wall as a rare complication of general obstetric and gynecologic surgeries: 15 years of experience at a large academic institution","2019","The objective of this article was to report the clinicopathological characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcomes of patients with clear cell carcinoma (CCC) of the abdominal wall. Medical records of six patients diagnosed with CCC of the abdominal wall between May 2003 and May 2018 at the National Taiwan University Hospital were reviewed. All patients had prior obstetric or gynecologic surgeries. The primary clinical presentation was enlarging abdominal masses at previous surgical scars. Four patients underwent initial/primary surgeries with/without adjuvant chemotherapy. One patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical intervention and adjuvant chemotherapy, the other received chemotherapy and sequential radiotherapy without any surgical intervention. Two of four patients undergoing initial/primary surgeries had disease recurrence and the remaining two cases without initial surgery experienced disease progression during primary treatment. Inguinal lymph nodes were the most frequent sites of recurrence. In conclusion, previous obstetric or gynecologic surgery can be a risk factor for CCC of the abdominal wall. Complete resection of abdominal wall tumor and suspected intra-abdominal lesions with hysterectomy and bilateral inguinal lymph nodes dissection may be the primary treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy would be considered for potential benefits. For patients without bilateral inguinal lymph nodes dissection, careful inguinal lymph node palpation during postoperative surveillance is necessary. More cases are still needed to elucidate the clinical management of this disease. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Disparity in Tumor Immune Microenvironment of Breast Cancer and Prognostic Impact: Asian versus Western Populations","2019","Background: The clinicopathological features and prognosis of breast cancer in Asia are different from those in the Western countries. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can influence the outcome of patients with breast cancer, but they have not been systemically evaluated in Asian patients with breast cancer. Methods: We compared the immune score, composition, and prognostic impact of infiltrating immune cells between Asian and Western patients with breast cancer by analyzing gene expression profiles from eight Gene Expression Omnibus data sets and The Cancer Genome Atlas data set. The Estimation of Stromal and Immune Cells in Malignant Tumours Using Expression Data (ESTIMATE) and Cell Type Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of Known RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithms were used to determine the immune score and composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, respectively. Findings: This study included 462 Asian patients and 2,186 Western patients. Tumors of Asian patients had significantly higher immune score, particularly in the luminal B and HER2-enriched subtypes. High immune score was associated with favorable prognosis in both Asian and Western patients, and Asian race with a high ESTIMATE immune score provided additional power to predict longer disease-free survival. Activated CD4 T cells and M2 macrophages were the most strongly associated with survival in both Asian and Western patients. Interpretation: Our study highlights the difference in tumor immune microenvironments between Asian and Western patients. The higher ESTIMATE immune score, which represents more abundant tumor-infiltrating immune cells, in tumors of Asian patients partly explains their favorable prognosis. Implications for Practice: The tumor microenvironment serves as an interface that affects the human body's reaction to cancer cells. Evidence has revealed that tumor-infiltrating immune cells were associated with patient prognosis. This study demonstrated the disparity of tumor microenvironments and their prognostic impact between Asian and Western patients with breast cancer. The differences in immune score partially explained the racial survival differences noted in recent studies. Integrated analysis of tumor cells, tumor microenvironment, and racial effect may significantly improve recurrence risk prediction for patients with stage I–III breast cancer. Because the effect of tumor microenvironment varies across different populations, a model of interaction between immune score and race/ethnicity is recommended in accessing the risk of patients with cancer. ?

"Cordycepin suppresses endothelial cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and tumor growth by regulating focal Adhesion Kinase and p53","2019","Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays an important role in vascular development, including the regulation of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival. 3’-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) is known to suppress FAK expression, cell migration, and the epithelial–mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, whether cordycepin affects FAK expression and cellular functions in ECs and the specific molecular mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we found that cordycepin suppressed FAK expression and the phosphorylation of FAK (p-FAK) at Tyr397 in ECs. Cordycepin inhibited the proliferation, wound healing, transwell migration, and tube formation of ECs. Confocal microscopy revealed that cordycepin significantly reduced FAK expression and decreased focal adhesion number of ECs. The suppressed expression of FAK was accompanied by induced p53 and p21 expression in ECs. Finally, we demonstrated that cordycepin suppressed angiogenesis in an in vivo angiogenesis assay and reduced HCC tumor growth in a xenograft nude mice model. Our study indicated that cordycepin could attenuate cell proliferation and migration and may result in the impairment of the angiogenesis process and tumor growth via downregulation of FAK and induction of p53 and p21 in ECs. Therefore, cordycepin may be used as a potential adjuvant for cancer therapy. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Overexpression of Kynurenine 3-Monooxygenase Correlates with Cancer Malignancy and Predicts Poor Prognosis in Canine Mammary Gland Tumors","2019","Tumor biomarkers are developed to indicate tumor status, clinical outcome, or prognosis. Since currently there are no effective biomarkers for canine mammary tumor (CMT), this study intended to verify whether kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), one of the key enzymes involved in tryptophan catabolism, is competent for predicting prognosis in patients with CMT. By investigating a series of 86 CMT clinical cases, we found that both gene and protein expression of KMO discriminated malignant from benign CMTs and was significantly higher in stage IV and V tumors than in lower-stage CMTs. About 73.7% of malignant CMTs showed strong expression of KMO which correlated with lower overall survival rates in patients. Further, downregulation of KMO activity significantly inhibited cell proliferation of CMT cells. Taken together, the findings indicated that KMO is a potential biomarker for tumor diagnosis, and this might open up new perspectives for clinical applications of CMT. ? 2019 Yi-Han Chiu et al.","actin; complementary DNA; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; kynurenine 3 monooxygenase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; breast tumor; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cell proliferation; child; clinical outcome; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme activity; follow up; gene expression level; gene overexpression; human; major clinical study; nonhuman; overall survival; protein expression; survival prediction; tumor growth; tumor recurrence"
"Prevalence of current oral HPV infection among 100 betel nut chewers or cigarette smokers in Northern Taiwan","2019","Background: The incidence of HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer is increasing in Taiwan. Given this, it is critical to understand the prevalence of oral HPV infection since this cancer is potentially preventable. A community-based study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of oral HPV infection and sexual behavior changes. Methods: Between January and December 2016, 100 subjects between 20 and 70 years-old with current/ever betel nut chewing or current cigarette smoking visited the Department of Health, New Taipei City. Subjects with cancer history or known HIV/AIDS were excluded. Sexual behavior information was collected through a questionnaire. Oral rinse samples and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for HPV genotyping using the EasyChip HPV genotyping array (King-Car, Taiwan). Results: 92 men and 8 women were recruited. The prevalence of oral HPV infection was 3%, present between 60 and 70 (11%) and between 30 and 40 years old (4%). The prevalence of the first sexual contact at younger than 20 years old were 71.4%, 53.6%, 15.4% and 44% in <40, 40–49, 50–59 and 60+ years old, respectively (p for trend = 0.0036). The prevalence of 3 or more lifetime sexual partners were 60.7%, 57.1%, 23.1% and 16.7%, respectively for <40, 40–49, 50–59 and 60+ years old (p for trend = 0.0005). Conclusion: The prevalence of oral HPV infection is 3%, in current/ever betel nut chewers or current cigarette smokers in Northern Taiwan. Younger generation have more lifetime sexual partners and younger first sexual contact. This could explain the rising incidence of HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer in Taiwan. ? 2018","adult; aged; alcoholism; areca nut; Article; cigarette smoking; cohort analysis; drinking behavior; female; fibrosis; genotype; human; infection risk; leukoplakia; major clinical study; male; mastication; middle aged; mouth disease; mouth infection; oral submucosal fibrosis; papillomavirus infection; risk assessment; sexual behavior; sexuality; Taiwan; age; Alphapapillomavirus; Areca; cigarette smoking; genetics; oropharynx tumor; papillomavirus infection; prevalence; risk factor; virology; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Alphapapillomavirus; Areca; Cigarette Smoking; Diagnosis, Oral; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oropharyngeal Neoplasms; Papillomavirus Infections; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sampling Studies; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Decision tree-based classifier in providing telehealth service","2019","Background: Although previous research showed that telehealth services can reduce the misuse of resources and urban-rural disparities, most healthcare insurers do not include telehealth services in their health insurance schemes. Therefore, no target variable exists for the classification approaches to learn from or train with. The problem of identifying the potential recipients of telehealth services when introducing telehealth services into health welfare or health insurance schemes becomes an unsupervised classification problem without a target variable. Methods: We propose a HDTTCA approach, which is a systematic approach (the main process of HDTTCA involves (1) data set preprocessing, (2) decision tree model building, and (3) predicting and explaining of the most important attributes in the data set for patients who qualify for telehealth service) to identify those who are eligible for telehealth services. Results: This work uses data from the NHIRD provided by the NHIA in Taiwan in 2012 as our research scope, which consist of 55,389 distinct hospitals and 653,209 distinct patients with 15,882,153 outpatient and 135,775 inpatient records. After HDTTCA produces the final version of the decision tree, the rules can be used to assign the values of the target variables in the entire NHIRD. Our data indicate that 3.56% (23,262 out of 653,209) of the patients are eligible for telehealth services in 2012. This study verifies the efficiency and validity of HDTTCA by using a large data set from the NHI of Taiwan. Conclusion: This study conducts a series of experiments 30 times to compare the HDTTCA results with the logistic regression findings by measuring their average performance and determining which model addresses the telehealth patient classification problem better. Four important metrics are used to compare the results. In terms of sensitivity, the decision trees generated by HDTTCA and the logistic regression model are on equal grounds. In terms of accuracy, specificity, and precision, the decision tree generated by HDTTCA provides a better performance than that of the logistic regression model. When HDTTCA is applied, the decision tree model generates a competitive performance and provides clear, easily understandable rules. Therefore, HDTTCA is a suitable choice in solving telehealth service classification problems. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; article; classifier; controlled study; data mining; decision tree; female; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; outpatient; patient coding; Taiwan; target variable; telehealth; validity; classification; statistical analysis; telemedicine; theoretical model; Classification; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Data Mining; Decision Trees; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Taiwan; Telemedicine"
"Risk for a second primary hypopharyngeal and esophageal cancer after an initial primary oral cancer","2019","Objective: To investigate the risk for second primary cancer in the hypopharynx and esophagus (SPC-HE) among individuals with an initial oral/oropharyngeal cancer. Materials and Methods: Mass screening data from Taiwan (2004–2009) included individuals who were ?18?years old and smoked cigarettes and/or chewed betel quid. Occurrence of SPC-HE was monitored until December 31, 2014. Results were expressed as adjusted relative risk (aRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: One hundred and fifty-eight out of 4,494 subjects with oral cancer developed SPC-HE (incidence rate: 6.47 per 1,000 person-years). Relative to patients with primary cancers in the lip, the risk of an SPC-HE was higher in patients with primary cancers in oropharynx (aRR: 19.98, 95% CI: 4.72–84.55), floor of mouth (aRR: 12.13, 95% CI: 2.67–55.15), and hard palate (aRR: 7.31, 95% CI: 1.65–32.37), but not in patients with cancers in tongue (aRR: 3.67, 95% CI: 0.89–15.17) or gum (aRR: 3.99, 95% CI: 0.92–17.35). Regression analyses also showed the risk of an SPC-HE was greater in alcohol drinkers than those who did not (aRR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.10–2.48). Conclusions: Compared with the initial cancer in the lip, patients with a cancer in the oropharynx, floor of mouth, and hard palate had a higher risk for the SPC-HE. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Secular trends in liver cancer incidence from 1997 to 2014 in Taiwan and projection to 2035: An age-period-cohort analysis","2019","Background/Purpose: Liver cancer is the second most common cancer in Taiwan. Research on projected cancer incident rates can facilitate appropriate public health planning, and incidence rate studies can offer insights and enable hypotheses about the etiology of particular cancers. Methods: Age-period-cohort models are used to estimate incidence trends in liver cancer from 1997 to 2014 and project trends up to 2035. Results: For men, the age-adjusted incidence rate showed an increasing trend from 1997, which peaked in 2004 (157.6 cases per 100,000 population), and a decreasing trend thereafter. The age-adjusted incidence rate is projected to decrease by 22.2% from 2014 to 2025 and by 37.3% from 2014 to 2035. For women, the age-adjusted incidence rate also showed an increasing trend from 1997, which peaked in 2004 (63.4 cases per 100,000 population), and a decreasing trend thereafter. The age-adjusted incidence rate is projected to decrease by 17.5% from 2014 to 2025 and by 27% from 2014 to 2035. Conclusion: This study revealed a reduction in the incidence rate of liver cancer for both sexes after 2004, and a further decrease until 2035 is projected. ? 2018","adult; aged; Article; cancer incidence; cohort analysis; female; groups by age; human; liver cancer; male; middle aged; sex difference; Taiwan; trend study; very elderly; age distribution; forecasting; incidence; liver tumor; register; sex ratio; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Sex Distribution; Taiwan"
"Explore the needs of the elderly with social awareness","2019","With the growing trend in population aging, declining birthrates, and changing patterns in living arrangements, aging in place has become a primary choice for elderly people after retirement (Hooyman & Kiyak, 2010). Home care service has become a key aspect of successful aging so that recent studies started to examine how to serve the dailyneeds for the elderly by adopting new home care services, in particular technology-enabled services for better living. This study applied Maslow’s theory to conduct an in-depth assessment on elders need and examine the factors that influence their satisfaction.Based on the concept of the social change process model (Glofia 1983), the “social awareness” on seeking external (societal) help to solve the problem was proposed and tested on its moderating effects in satisfying elder’s needs. The results from the empirical testing reveal that that elderly people rely on assistance from others and home-care service providers mediating the service to satisfaction when they are in less favorable health and economic conditions. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","aged; article; awareness; home care; human; Maslow's hierarchy of needs; process model; satisfaction; social change"
"Mortality trends of liver diseases from 1981 to 2016 and the projection to 2035 in Taiwan: An age-period-cohort analysis","2019","Background: Projections on liver diseases mortality can provide a basis for evaluating the World Health Organization's “25 by 25” goal and can help healthcare systems design appropriate control strategies. This study evaluated whether the 25 by 25 goal can be achieved in Taiwan and discussed possible future control strategies. Methods: Age-period-cohort models are used to estimate the mortality trends of liver diseases from 1981 to 2016 and project these trends to 2035. Results: For chronic liver disease and cirrhosis among men, the age-adjusted mortality rate decreased from 1981 to 1991, increased until 1999, and subsequently decreased again until 2016. For women, the age-adjusted mortality rate exhibited an increasing but up-and-down trend from 1981 to 1998 and a decreasing trend to 2016. For liver cancer among men, the age-adjusted mortality rate exhibited an increasing trend from 1981 to 2002 and a decreasing trend to 2016. For women, the age-adjusted mortality rate exhibited an increasing trend from 1981 to 2003 and a decreasing trend to 2016. The age-adjusted mortality rates of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and liver cancer for both sexes are projected to decrease by more than 30% from 2016 to 2025 and by more than 55% from 2016 to 2035. Conclusion: These results indicated that the 25 by 25 goal can be achieved for liver diseases mortality in Taiwan. In addition to viral hepatitis, the following risk factors may become the major causes of liver diseases in Taiwan in the future: alcohol and tobacco use, diabetes and obesity. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Hepatitis C virus core antigen is cost-effective in community-based screening of active hepatitis C infection in Taiwan","2020","Background and purpose: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen is highly sensitive and specific in viremic HCV diagnosis. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HCV core antigen (HCVcAg) in community-based screening for active HCV infection. Methods: Between 2017/07 and 2018/07, community-based screenings for active HCV infection with two-step (anti-HCV for screening and HCVRNA for diagnosis) and one-step processes (HCVcAg for screening and diagnosis) were conducted in two districts in Kaohsiung City. While HCVcAg test was positive at ?3 fmol/L, the lowest level of HCV-RNA detection was 12 IU/mL. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of two algorithms in identifying active HCV infection. Results: There were two large-scale screenings using the two-step process with a total of 2452 residents enrolled; while six hundred and forty-four residents participated in continuous small-scale screening with the one-step process. The prevalence of anti-HCV and positive HCVcAg was 3.4% and 2.8%. The viremic rate was 1.4% and 2.8% for two- and one-step processes (p < 0.001). While all positive HCVcAg were viremic, 42.4% of positive anti-HCV patients had viremia. The positive predictive value was 42.2% and 100% for two- and one-step processes in detecting active HCV infection (p < 0.001). In identifying one active HCV infection, the cost was $755.3 and $711.1 dollars for two- and one-step processes respectively. Conclusion: Compared to the two-step process in community-based screening, continuous screening with the HCVcAg test as a one-step tool for active HCV infection was cost-effective in areas with low seroprevalence of HCV in Taiwan. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",""
"Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101-fermented skim milk as an adjuvant to uracil-tegafur reduces tumor growth and improves chemotherapy side effects in an orthotopic mouse model of colorectal cancer","2019","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Chemotherapy is the usual treatment, but entails side effects. Although lactic acid bacteria (LAB) ameliorate CRC, the effects of LAB-fermented skim milk are unknown. Thus, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101-fermented skim milk (NTU 101FM) in combination with chemotherapy on CRC, and its effect on chemotherapeutic side effects in vivo. NTU 101FM + chemotherapy treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis compared to chemotherapy alone via regulating vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloprotein-9, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 levels. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in the tumor, intestine, and serum were significantly controlled by NTU 101FM compared to chemotherapy alone. In CRC mice, NTU 101FM significantly suppressed increases in spleen weight and inflammation-related factors induced by chemotherapy. These findings indicate that NTU 101FM potentially improves the side effects and efficiency of chemotherapy. ? 2019",""
"Adenoma detection rates in colonoscopies for positive fecal immunochemical tests versus direct screening colonoscopies","2019","Background and Aims: Recent guidelines propose higher adenoma detection rate (ADR) benchmarks for colonoscopies performed for positive results for fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), but this is based on low-quality evidence. We aimed to compare ADR, advanced ADR (AADR), and number of adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) in direct screening colonoscopy (DSC) versus FIT-positive colonoscopy (FITC) in a multicenter Asia-Pacific cohort to justify differential targets. Methods: Asymptomatic average-risk patients ?50 years of age who underwent screening colonoscopy directly or as follow-up for positive OC-Sensor FIT results were identified from 8 sites across the Asia-Pacific region. Overall, sex-specific ADR, overall AADR, and overall APC were compared between the 2 screening methods. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounding by differences in patient characteristics. Linear regression was used to correlate ADR with APC and to propose APC benchmarks. Results: A total of 2901 (mean age, 60.1 years; 57% men) individuals had DSC, and 2485 (mean age, 62.8 years; 57% men) underwent FITC. Overall ADR (53.6% vs 37.5%; odds ratio [OR], 1.93; P <.001), male-specific ADR (61.6% vs 44.6%; OR, 2; P <.001), female-specific ADR (43.2% vs 28.2%; OR, 1.94; P <.001) and overall AADR (29.9% vs 4.9%; OR, 8.2; P <.001) in FITC were significantly higher than the corresponding values for DSC. Differences remained significant after adjustment for patient characteristics. ADR was strongly and positively correlated to APC, with an ADR of 45% and 35% correlating to an APC of ?1 and ?0.65. Conclusions: Results from this international multicenter cohort study provide early evidence that newly proposed higher ADR targets are justified as quality indicators for FITC. ? 2019 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy","adult; Article; cohort analysis; colon adenoma; colonoscopy; direct screening colonoscopy; female; human; intermediate risk patient; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; occult blood test; priority journal; prospective study; adenoma; aged; chemistry; colonoscopy; colorectal tumor; early cancer diagnosis; feces; Hong Kong; immunochemistry; Japan; multivariate analysis; pathology; procedures; Singapore; South Korea; statistical model; Taiwan; hemoglobin; Adenoma; Aged; Cohort Studies; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Feces; Female; Hemoglobins; Hong Kong; Humans; Immunochemistry; Japan; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Republic of Korea; Singapore; Taiwan"
