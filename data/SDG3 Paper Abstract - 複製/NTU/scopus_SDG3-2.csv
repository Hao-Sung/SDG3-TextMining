METHODS We evaluated the associations of inhalable particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) and fine PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) with daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality across multiple countries or regions. Daily data on mortality and air pollution were collected from 652 cities in 24 countries or regions. We used overdispersed generalized additive models with random-effects meta-analysis to investigate the associations. Two-pollutant models were fitted to test the robustness of the associations. Concentration–response curves from each city were pooled to allow global estimates to be derived. RESULTS On average, an increase of 10 μg per cubic meter in the 2-day moving average of PM10 concentration, which represents the average over the current and previous day, was associated with increases of 0.44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.50) in daily all-cause mortality, 0.36% (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.43) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.58) in daily respiratory mortality. The corresponding increases in daily mortality for the same change in PM2.5 concentration were 0.68% (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.77), 0.55% (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.66), and 0.74% (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.95). These associations remained significant after adjustment for gaseous pollutants. Associations were stronger in locations with lower annual mean PM concentrations and higher annual mean temperatures. The pooled concentration–response curves showed a consistent increase in daily mortality with increasing PM concentration, with steeper slopes at lower PM concentrations. CONCLUSIONS Our data show independent associations between short-term exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 and daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality in more than 600 cities across the globe. These data reinforce the evidence of a link between mortality and PM concentration established in regional and local studies. (Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and others.)

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of risankizumab with adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Methods: IMMvent was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-comparator-controlled trial completed at 66 clinics in 11 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using interactive response technology to receive 150 mg risankizumab subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4 or 80 mg adalimumab subcutaneously at randomisation, then 40 mg at weeks 1, 3, 5, and every other week thereafter during a 16-week double-blind treatment period (part A). For weeks 16–44 (part B), adalimumab intermediate responders were re-randomised 1:1 to continue 40 mg adalimumab or switch to 150 mg risankizumab. In part A, participants and investigators were masked to study treatment. Randomisation was stratified by weight and previous tumour necrosis factor inhibitor exposure. Co-primary endpoints in part A were a 90% improvement from baseline (PASI 90) and a static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 at week 16, and for part B was PASI 90 at week 44 (non-responder imputation). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in the safety population (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug or placebo). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02694523. Findings: Between March 31, 2016, and Aug 24, 2017, 605 patients were randomly assigned to receive either risankizumab (n=301, 50%) or adalimumab (n=304, 50%). 294 (98%) of patients in the risankizumab group and 291 (96%) in the adalimumab group completed part A, and 51 (96%) of 53 patients re-randomised to risankizumab and 51 (91%) of 56 patients re-randomised to continue adalimumab completed part B. At week 16, PASI 90 was achieved in 218 (72%) of 301 patients given risankizumab and 144 (47%) of 304 patients given adalimumab (adjusted absolute difference 24·9% [95% CI 17·5–32·4]; p<0·0001), and sPGA scores of 0 or 1 were achieved in 252 (84%) patients given risankizumab and 252 (60%) patients given adalimumab (adjusted absolute difference 23·3% [16·6–30·1]; p<0·0001). In part B, among adalimumab intermediate responders, PASI 90 was achieved by 35 (66%) of 53 patients switched to risankizumab and 12 (21%) of 56 patients continuing adalimumab (adjusted absolute difference 45·0% [28·9–61·1]; p<0·0001) at week 44. Adverse events were reported in 168 (56%) of 301 patients given risankizumab and 179 (57%) of 304 patients given adalimumab in part A, and among adalimumab intermediate responders, adverse events were reported in 40 (75%) of 53 patients who switched to risankizumab and 37 (66%) of 56 patients who continued adalimumab in part B. Interpretation: Risankizumab showed significantly greater efficacy than adalimumab in providing skin clearance in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. No additional safety concerns were identified for patients who switched from adalimumab to risankizumab. Treatment with risankizumab provides flexibility in the long-term treatment of psoriasis.

Populations living in cities are likely to be particularly at risk, but the role of urban characteristics in modifying the direct effects of temperature on health is still unclear. In this contribution, we used a multi-country dataset to study effect modification of temperature-mortality relationships by a range of city-specific indicators. Methods: We collected ambient temperature and mortality daily time-series data for 340 cities in 22 countries, in periods between 1985 and 2014. Standardized measures of demographic, socio-economic, infrastructural and environmental indicators were derived from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Regional and Metropolitan Database. We used distributed lag non-linear and multivariate meta-regression models to estimate fractions of mortality attributable to heat and cold (AF%) in each city, and to evaluate the effect modification of each indicator across cities. Results: Heat- and cold-related deaths amounted to 0.54% (95% confidence interval: 0.49 to 0.58%) and 6.05% (5.59 to 6.36%) of total deaths, respectively. Several city indicators modify the effect of heat, with a higher mortality impact associated with increases in population density, fine particles (PM2.5), gross domestic product (GDP) and Gini index (a measure of income inequality), whereas higher levels of green spaces were linked with a decreased effect of heat. Conclusions: This represents the largest study to date assessing the effect modification of temperature-mortality relationships. Evidence from this study can inform public-health interventions and urban planning under various climate-change and urban-development scenarios. ? 2019 The Author(s).",cities; climate; epidemiology; heat; mortality; Temperature,climate; data set; database; epidemiology; heating; mortality; OECD; temperature effect; urban planning; vulnerability; article; city planning; climate change; cold stress; controlled study; death; environmental temperature; gross national product; heat; mortality; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; population density; public health; time series analysis,2-s2.0-85067299967

This study assessed whether serum GPCA positivity or AG itself was a significant factor causing hematinic deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia in GPCA+AG or GPCA-negative, thyroglobulin antibody (TGA)-negative, and thyroid microsomal antibody (TMA)-negative AG (GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG) patients. Methods: The mean blood hemoglobin (Hb), iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, and homocysteine levels were measured and compared between any two of three groups of 177 GPCA+AG patients, 476 GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG patients, and 532 healthy control subjects. Results: GPCA+AG patients had significantly lower mean blood Hb and iron (for women only) levels and a significantly higher mean serum homocysteine level than healthy control subjects. Moreover, GPCA+AG patients had significantly greater frequencies of blood Hb, iron, and vitamin B12 deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia than healthy control subjects. GPCA+AG patients have a lower mean serum vitamin B12 level and a significantly higher mean serum homocysteine level as well as significantly greater frequencies of vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia than GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG patients. Moreover, GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG patients did have significantly lower mean blood Hb and iron levels and significantly greater frequencies of blood Hb, iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia than healthy control subjects. Conclusion: The GPCA is a major factor causing vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocyteinemia in GPCA+AG patients. AG itself does play a significant role in causing anemia, hematinic deficiencies, and hyperhomocysteinemia in both GPCA+AG and GPCA?TGA?TMA?AG patients. ? 2019",Atrophic glossitis; Gastric parietal cell antibody; Hyperhomocysteinemia; Iron deficiency; Vitamin B12 deficiency,"cyanocobalamin; folic acid; homocysteine; iron; parietal cell antibody; thyroid antibody; autoantibody; cyanocobalamin; folic acid; hemoglobin; iron; thyroid microsomal antibodies; adult; anemia; Article; B12 deficiency; blood cell count; controlled study; female; folic acid blood level; folic acid deficiency; glossitis; hemoglobin blood level; human; hyperhomocysteinemia; iron blood level; iron deficiency anemia; macrocytic anemia; major clinical study; male; megalocytosis; microcytic anemia; microcytosis; pernicious anemia; thalassemia; vitamin blood level; aged; anemia; atrophy; blood; glossitis; hyperhomocysteinemia; immunology; mean corpuscular volume; middle aged; stomach parietal cell; Taiwan; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anemia; Atrophy; Autoantibodies; Erythrocyte Indices; Female; Folic Acid; Glossitis; Hemoglobins; Humans; Hyperhomocysteinemia; Iron; Male; Middle Aged; Parietal Cells, Gastric; Taiwan; Vitamin B 12; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85064002273

However, little is known as to why KRAS mutations preferentially occur in PDACs and what processes/factors generate these mutations. While abnormal carbohydrate metabolism is associated with a high risk of pancreatic cancer, it remains elusive whether a direct relationship between KRAS mutations and sugar metabolism exists. Here, we show that under high-glucose conditions, cellular O-GlcNAcylation is significantly elevated in pancreatic cells that exhibit lower phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity than other cell types. This post-translational modification specifically compromises the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity, leading to deficiency in dNTP pools, genomic DNA alterations with KRAS mutations, and cellular transformation. These results establish a mechanistic link between a perturbed sugar metabolism and genomic instability that induces de novo oncogenic KRAS mutations preferentially in pancreatic cells. Most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas contain activated KRAS mutations required for cancer initiation and maintenance.

To address this uncertainty and inform international recommendations, we evaluated how in vivo circulating and tissue levels of linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) relate to incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) across multiple international studies. Methods: We performed harmonized, de novo, individual-level analyses in a global consortium of 30 prospective observational studies from 13 countries. Multivariable-adjusted associations of circulating and adipose tissue LA and AA biomarkers with incident total CVD and subtypes (coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular mortality) were investigated according to a prespecified analytic plan. Levels of LA and AA, measured as the percentage of total fatty acids, were evaluated linearly according to their interquintile range (ie, the range between the midpoint of the first and fifth quintiles), and categorically by quintiles. Study-specific results were pooled using inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored by age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, statin use, aspirin use, omega-3 levels, and fatty acid desaturase 1 genotype (when available). Results: In 30 prospective studies with medians of follow-up ranging 2.5 to 31.9 years, 15 198 incident cardiovascular events occurred among 68 659 participants. Higher levels of LA were significantly associated with lower risks of total CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and ischemic stroke, with hazard ratios per interquintile range of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.88-0.99), 0.78 (0.70-0.85), and 0.88 (0.79-0.98), respectively, and nonsignificantly with lower coronary heart disease risk (0.94; 0.88-1.00). Relationships were similar for LA evaluated across quintiles. AA levels were not associated with higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes; in a comparison of extreme quintiles, higher levels were associated with lower risk of total CVD (0.92; 0.86-0.99). No consistent heterogeneity by population subgroups was identified in the observed relationships. Conclusions: In pooled global analyses, higher in vivo circulating and tissue levels of LA and possibly AA were associated with lower risk of major cardiovascular events. These results support a favorable role for LA in CVD prevention. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.",arachidonic acid; biomarkers; cardiovascular diseases; diet; epidemiology; linoleic acid; primary prevention,acetylsalicylic acid; acyl coenzyme A desaturase 1; arachidonic acid; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; linoleic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; adipose tissue; adult; aged; Article; Australia; brain ischemia; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; clinical article; cohort analysis; Costa Rica; Denmark; diabetes mellitus; drug use; fat intake; fatty acid blood level; female; Finland; follow up; France; Germany; human; Iceland; ischemic heart disease; Japan; male; middle aged; Netherlands; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; race; retrospective study; Singapore; Sweden; Taiwan; United Kingdom; United States,2-s2.0-85066456162

Durvalumab is an anti–programmed death ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. The phase III open-label CAURAL trial (NCT02454933) investigated osimertinib plus durvalumab versus osimertinib monotherapy in patients with EGFR-TKI sensitizing and EGFR T790M mutation–positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression after EGFR-TKI therapy. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally administered osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with or without durvalumab (10 mg/kg administered intravenously every 2 weeks) until progression. Treatment could continue beyond progression, providing clinical benefit continued (judged by the investigator). The amended primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib plus durvalumab; efficacy was an exploratory objective. Results: CAURAL recruitment was terminated early because of increased incidence of interstitial lung disease–like events in the osimertinib plus durvalumab arm from the separate phase Ib TATTON trial (NCT02143466). At termination of CAURAL recruitment, 15 patients had been randomly assigned to treatment with osimertinib and 14 to treatment with osimertinib plus durvalumab. The most common AEs were diarrhea (53% [grade ?3 in 6% of patients]) in the osimertinib arm and rash (67% [grade ?3 in 0 patients]) in the combination arm. One patient who had been randomized to the combination arm reported grade 2 interstitial lung disease while receiving osimertinib monotherapy (after discontinuing durvalumab therapy after one dose). The objective response rates were 80% in the osimertinib arm and 64% in the combination arm. Conclusion: Limited patient numbers preclude formal safety and efficacy comparisons between the two treatment arms. The combination of programmed cell death 1/programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors and EGFR-TKIs as therapy for NSCLC is not well understood, but it requires a careful approach if considered in the future. ? 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",Combination; Durvalumab; EGFR; Non–small cell lung cancer; Osimertinib,aspartate aminotransferase; durvalumab; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; osimertinib; adult; aged; arthralgia; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; backache; clinical article; constipation; controlled study; coughing; decreased appetite; diarrhea; disease control; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; dry skin; dyspnea; female; human; hypesthesia; interstitial lung disease; male; monotherapy; nausea; neutropenia; neutrophil count; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; paronychia; phase 3 clinical trial; pneumonia; priority journal; productive cough; progression free survival; pruritus; rash; rhinorrhea; side effect; stomatitis; survival rate; treatment response; upper respiratory tract infection; viral upper respiratory tract infection,2-s2.0-85062970251

Currently, there is debate over whether the daptomycin susceptibility breakpoint for enterococci (ie, minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ?4 mg/L) is appropriate. In bacteremia, observational data support prescription of high doses (>8 mg/kg). However, pharmacodynamic targets associated with positive patient outcomes are undefined. Methods. Data were pooled from observational studies that assessed outcomes in daptomycin-treated enterococcal bacteremia. Patients who received an additional antienterococcal antibiotic and/or a β-lactam antibiotic at any time during treatment were excluded. Daptomycin exposures were calculated using a published population pharmacokinetic model. The free drug area under the concentration-time curve to MIC ratio (fAUC/MIC) threshold predictive of survival at 30 days was identified by classification and regression tree analysis and confirmed with multivariable logistic regression. Monte Carlo simulations determined the probability of target attainment (PTA) at clinically relevant MICs. Results. Of 114 patients who received daptomycin monotherapy, 67 (58.8%) were alive at 30 days. A fAUC/MIC >27.43 was associated with survival in low-acuity (n = 77) patients (68.9 vs 37.5%, P = .006), which remained significant after adjusting for infection source and immunosuppression (P = .026). The PTA for a 6-mg/kg/day (every 24 hours) dose was 1.5%-5.5% when the MIC was 4 mg/L (ie, daptomycin-susceptible) and 91.0%-97.9% when the MIC was 1 mg/L. Conclusions. For enterococcal bacteremia, a daptomycin fAUC/MIC >27.43 was associated with 30-day survival among low-acuity patients. As pharmacodynamics for the approved dose are optimized only when MIC ?1 mg/L, these data continue to stress the importance of reevaluation of the susceptibility breakpoint. ? The Author(s) 2018.

We compared the performance of the Prostate Health Index (PHI) for 2488 men in different ethnic groups (1688 Asian and 800 European men from 9 sites) with PSA 2–20 ng/ml and PHI test and transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy results available. Of these, 1652 men had PSA 2–10 ng/ml and a normal digital rectal examination and underwent initial biopsy. The proportions of PC (Gleason ?6) and higher-grade PC (HGPC, Gleason ?7) across different PHI ranges were compared. The performance of PSA and PHI was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses (DCA). Among Asian men, HGPC would be diagnosed in 1.0%, 1.9%, 13%, and 30% of men using PHI thresholds of <25, 25–35, 35–55, and >55, respectively. At 90% sensitivity for HGPC (PHI >30), 56% of biopsies and 33% of Gleason 6 PC diagnoses could have been avoided. Among European men, HGPC would be diagnosed in 4.1%, 4.3%, 30%, and 34% of men using PHI thresholds of <25, 25–35, 35–55, and >55, respectively. At 90% sensitivity for HGPC (PHI >40), 40% of biopsies and 31% of Gleason 6 PC diagnoses could have been avoided. AUC and DCA confirmed the benefit of PHI over PSA. The benefit of PHI was also seen at repeat biopsy (n = 397) and for PSA 10–20 ng/ml (n = 439). PHI is effective in cancer risk stratification for both European and Asian men. However, population-specific PHI reference ranges should be used. Patient summary: The Prostate Health Index (PHI) blood test helps to identify individuals at higher risk of prostate cancer among Asian and European men, and could significantly reduce unnecessary biopsies and overdiagnosis of prostate cancer. Different PHI reference ranges should be used for different ethnic groups. The Prostate Health Index (PHI) test is effective in cancer risk stratification for both European and Asian men. A higher proportion of biopsies could be avoided among Asian men using PHI. An ethnic-specific reference range should be used. ? 2018 European Association of Urology",Biopsy; Decision curve analysis; Prostate cancer; Prostate health index; [?2]pro–prostate-specific antigen,"Article; Asian; cancer risk; clinical assessment tool; comparative study; digital rectal examination; ethnic group; European; evaluation study; Gleason score; human; human tissue; image guided biopsy; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; prostate health index; receiver operating characteristic; reference value; sensitivity analysis; transrectal ultrasonography; Asia; Asian continental ancestry group; biopsy; blood; cancer grading; Caucasian; clinical trial; epidemiology; ethnology; Europe; health status; health status indicator; multicenter study; predictive value; prostate tumor; reproducibility; risk assessment; risk factor; kallikrein; kallikrein-related peptidase 3, human; prostate specific antigen; Asia; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biopsy; Digital Rectal Examination; Europe; European Continental Ancestry Group; Health Status; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Kallikreins; Male; Neoplasm Grading; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85055890355

The experiment was conducted from controlled moderately-reducing to oxidizing conditions using an automated biogeochemical microcosm system. Arsenic and Mo were more abundant in the dissolved phase due to their predominant in potential mobile fractions, while Co was more abundant in the colloidal phase due to its association with Fe-(hydr)oxides. Biochar increased the dissolved and colloidal concentrations of As, the dissolved concentration of Co, and the colloidal concentration of Mo under oxidizing condition. On the other hand, the application of BC decreased the dissolved concentration of Mo and the colloidal concentration of Co in the first redox cycle under reducing-acidic condition, due to lower pH values, and chemistry of sulfide-sulfate and Fe/Mn oxides. The phytoavailability of As and Co were higher than their potential mobility in the sediment phase, while the same trend was not discerned for Mo. The potential mobility and phytoavailability of As and Co were high under oxic-acidic conditions. The potential mobility and phytoavailability of Mo might be increased under oxic condition due to the dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides under lower pH conditions, especially in the BC treated soil. Application of such rice hull BC to soil might stimulate the release of As, Co, and Mo under flooding conditions, which might increase the environmental and health risks in such wetland ecosystems. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Black carbon; Sediment; Soil contamination; Trace elements; Wetland ecosystem,Colloids; Dissolution; Ecosystems; Health risks; Iron oxides; pH; Redox reactions; Sediments; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Trace elements; Wetlands; Black carbon; Colloidal concentrations; Dissolved concentrations; Environmental and health risks; Oxidizing conditions; Potential mobility; Soil contamination; Wetland ecosystem; Cobalt; arsenic; biochar; charcoal; cobalt; dissolved organic carbon; ferric hydroxide; iron oxide; manganese oxide; molybdenum; organic carbon; sulfate; sulfide; unclassified drug; arsenic; biochar; charcoal; cobalt; molybdenum; arsenic; biochar; black carbon; cobalt; molybdenum; redox conditions; soil pollution; soil remediation; trace element; wetland; Article; biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; colloid; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dissolution; flooding; microcosm; oxidation; oxidation reduction potential; oxidation reduction reaction; pH; physical chemistry; phytoavailability; priority journal; soil amendment; soil pollution; analysis; bioavailability; chemistry; China; ecosystem restoration; mining; pharmacokinetics; soil pollutant; Arsenic; Biological Availability; Charcoal; China; Cobalt; Colloids; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mining; Molybdenum; Oxidation-Reduction; Soil Pollutants,2-s2.0-85058153733

One such case concerns the industrial area of Volos, Greece, a suspected contaminated area which has never been studied. We measured Ag, Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Tl, V, and Zn in soil and maize (leaves and grains) and assessed health risk of human exposure via soil ingestion and grain consumption. We found that the most highly enriched elements in soils were Tl (enrichment factor = 19), Se (17.68), Sb (14.81), As (7.89), Ni (6.91), Mo (5.22) and Cr (4.33); they all likely derived from anthropogenic activities and in particular from a nearby major steel factory, except for Ni which is known to be lithogenically elevated in that area. Synchrotron XANES spectra analysis revealed that As species were associated with ferrihydrite, and predominant species were As(V) (at ca. 85%) and As(III) (at ca. 15%). Although the total content of the studied elements was high, the ammonium bicarbonate-DTPA extractions recovered very low element concentrations, probably due to the fact that soil conditions decelerated solubility (i.e., soils were alkaline, clayey, and with high Fe oxides content). This was confirmed by the soil-to-grain transfer index, which was particularly low for all studied elements. In 5% of sampled grains concerning Cd, and in 40% concerning Pb, the European food-related regulation limits were surpassed. Health risk assessment showed a dramatically elevated risk for Tl via soil ingestion (hazard quotient, HQ = 2.399), a value that contributed 74% of the total risk. Similarly, concerning the grain consumption-related health risk, Tl was the predominant contributor (HQ = 0.128, contributing 40% of the total risk). Such elevated Tl risk which has rarely been reported previously, led to a considerably high hazard index (HI) well above the threshold of HI = 1. Cancer risk was below the 1 × 10?4 risk threshold for As and Pb. Our findings indicate that this study should be pivotal concerning similar industrially-affected agricultural soils of suspected contamination, since less-expected toxic elements such as Tl here may be primary contributors to health risk. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Corn; Heavy metals; Pollution indices; Steel factory,"Ammonium bicarbonate; Grain (agricultural product); Hazards; Health; Health risks; Heavy metals; Iron oxides; Nickel; Risk assessment; Soils; Trace elements; Anthropogenic activity; Contaminated areas; Corn; Element concentrations; Enrichment factors; Industrial activities; Pollution index; Steel factories; Soil pollution; aluminum; ammonia; antimony; aspartic acid; bicarbonate; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; diazepam; ferric hydroxide; iron; iron oxide; lead; manganese; molybdenum; nickel; selenium; silver; thallium; tin; trace element; zinc; heavy metal; trace element; health risk; heavy metal; maize; pollution exposure; risk assessment; soil pollution; trace element; agricultural land; Article; cancer risk; controlled study; crop; grain; Greece; health hazard; industrial area; maize; nonhuman; plant leaf; priority journal; risk assessment; soil pollution; solubility; spectroscopy; chemistry; environmental monitoring; food contamination; human; industry; maize; risk assessment; soil; soil pollutant; Greece; Magnesia; Thessaly; Volos; Zea mays; Environmental Monitoring; Food Contamination; Greece; Humans; Industry; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trace Elements; Zea mays",2-s2.0-85059967549

All patients underwent brain MRI and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging. The mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated using cerebellum as reference. Forty-six patients (57.5%) had mixed ICH. Their demographic and clinical profile as well as amyloid deposition patterns were compared to those of 13 patients with CAA-ICH and 21 patients with strictly deep microbleeds and ICH (HTN-ICH).ResultsPatients with mixed ICH were younger (62.8 ± 11.7 vs 73.3 ± 11.9 years in CAA, p = 0.006) and showed a higher rate of hypertension than patients with CAA-ICH (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with mixed ICH had lower PiB SUVR than patients with CAA (1.06 [1.01-1.13] vs 1.43 [1.06-1.58], p = 0.003). In a multivariable logistic regression model, mixed ICH was associated with hypertension (odds ratio 8.9, 95% confidence interval 1.4-58.4, p = 0.02) and lower PiB SUVR (odds ratio 0.03, 95% confidence interval 0.001-0.87, p = 0.04) compared to CAA after adjustment for age. Compared to HTN-ICH, mixed ICH showed a similar mean age (62.8 ± 11.7 vs 60.1 ± 14.5 years in HTN-ICH) and risk factor profile (all p &gt; 0.1). Furthermore, PiB SUVR did not differ between mixed ICH (values presented above) and HTN-ICH (1.10 [1.00-1.16], p = 0.45).Conclusions:Patients with mixed ICH have much lower amyloid load than patients with CAA-ICH, while being similar to HTN-ICH. Overall, mixed ICH is probably caused by HTN-SVD, an important finding with clinical relevance. ? 2019 American Academy of Neurology.",,"Pittsburgh compound B; 2-(4'-(methylamino)phenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole; aniline derivative; thiazole derivative; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; Asian; brain hemorrhage; cerebellum; confidence interval; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; female; human; hypertension; in vivo study; major clinical study; male; microangiopathy; multivariate logistic regression analysis; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; odds ratio; positron emission tomography; priority journal; risk factor; standardized uptake value ratio; vascular amyloidosis; brain; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular disease; complication; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; Taiwan; vascular amyloidosis; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aniline Compounds; Brain; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intracranial Hemorrhage, Hypertensive; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Taiwan; Thiazoles",2-s2.0-85061866107

Reliable and precise regional multi-step-ahead PM 2.5 forecasts are crucial and beneficial for mitigating health risks. This work explores a novel framework (MM-SVM) that combines the Multi-output Support Vector Machine (M-SVM) and the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) algorithm for effectively increasing the accuracy of regional multi-step-ahead forecasts through tackling error accumulation and propagation that is commonly encountered in regional forecasting. The Single-output SVM (S-SVM) is implemented as a benchmark. Taipei City of Taiwan is our study area, where three types of air quality monitoring stations are selected to represent areas imposed with high traffic influences, high human activities and commercial trading influences, and less human interventions close to nature situation, respectively. We consider forecasts of PM 2.5 concentrations as a function of meteorological and air quality factors based on long-term (2010–2016) observational datasets. Firstly, the Kendall tau coefficient is conducted to extract key spatiotemporal factors from regional meteorological and air quality inputs. Secondly, the M-SVM model is trained by the MTL to capture non-linear relationships and share correlation information across related tasks. Lastly, the MM-SVM model is validated using hourly time series of PM 2.5 concentrations as well as meteorological and air quality datasets. Regarding the applicability of regional multi-step-ahead forecasts, the results demonstrate that the MM-SVM model is much more promising than the S-SVM model because only one forecast model (MM-SVM) is required, instead of constructing a site-specific S-SVM model for each station. Moreover, the forecasts of the MM-SVM are found better consistent with observations than those of any single S-SVM in both training and testing stages. Consequently, the results clearly demonstrate that the MM-SVM model could be recommended as a novel integrative technique for improving the spatiotemporal stability and accuracy of regional multi-step-ahead PM 2.5 forecasts. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Multi-output SVM; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Multi-task learning algorithm; PM 2.5 concentrations; Taipei City,Air quality; Forecasting; Health risks; Learning algorithms; Linearization; Multi-output; Multi-step; Multitask learning; PM2.5 concentration; Taipei cities; Support vector machines; air quality; algorithm; concentration (composition); forecasting method; health risk; machine learning; particulate matter; support vector machine; air quality; article; forecasting; human; learning algorithm; monitoring; support vector machine; Taiwan; time series analysis; Taipei; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85053476196

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide more precise estimates of HBsAg seroclearance rates among subgroups and populations. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library for cohort studies that reported HBsAg seroclearance in adults with chronic HBV infection with more than 1 year of follow-up and at least 1 repeat test for HBsAg. Annual and 5-, 10-, and 15-year cumulative incidence rates were pooled using a random effects model. Results: We analyzed 34 published studies (with 42,588 patients, 303,754 person-years of follow-up, and 3194 HBsAg seroclearance events), including additional and updated aggregated data from 19 studies. The pooled annual rate of HBsAg seroclearance was 1.02% (95% CI, 0.79–1.27). Cumulative incidence rates were 4.03% at 5 years (95% CI, 2.49–5.93), 8.16% at 10 years (95% CI, 5.24–11.72), and 17.99% at 15 years (95% CI, 6.18–23.24). There were no significant differences between the sexes. A higher proportion of patients who tested negative for HBeAg at baseline had seroclearance (1.33%; 95% CI, 0.76–2.05) than those who tested positive for HBeAg (0.40%; 95% CI, 0.25–0.59) (P &lt;.01). Having HBsAg seroclearance was also associated with a lower baseline HBV DNA level (6.61 log 10 IU/mL; 95% CI, 5.94–7.27) vs not having HBsAg seroclearance (7.71 log 10 IU/mL; 95% CI, 7.41–8.02) (P &lt;.01) and with a lower level of HBsAg at baseline (2.74 log 10 IU/mL; 95% CI, 1.88–3.60) vs not having HBsAg seroclearance (3.90 log 10 IU/mL, 95% CI, 3.73–4.06) (P &lt;.01). HBsAg seroclearance was not associated with HBV genotype or treatment history. Heterogeneity was substantial across the studies (I 2 = 97.49%). Conclusion: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found a low rate of HBsAg seroclearance in untreated and treated patients (pooled annual rate, approximately 1%). Seroclearance occurred mainly in patients with less active disease. Patients with chronic HBV infection should therefore be counseled on the need for lifelong treatment, and curative therapies are needed. ? 2019 AGA Institute",CHB; Disease Progression; Natural History; Prognosis,"hepatitis B surface antigen; virus DNA; biological marker; hepatitis B surface antigen; virus DNA; Article; chronic hepatitis B; follow up; genotype; Hepatitis B virus; human; incidence; patient counseling; priority journal; risk factor; adult; blood; chronic hepatitis B; female; immunology; isolation and purification; male; meta analysis; middle aged; prognosis; reference value; seroepidemiology; serology; Adult; Biomarkers; DNA, Viral; Female; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Reference Values; Risk Factors; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Serologic Tests",2-s2.0-85060987197

However, acquired resistance, due partially to secondary mutations limits their use. Here we report that NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib or osimertinib (AZD9291) exhibit EMT features, with a decrease in E-cadherin, and increases in vimentin and stemness, without possessing any EGFR secondary mutations. Knockdown of E-cadherin in parental cells increased gefitinib resistance and stemness, while knockdown of vimentin in resistant cells resulted in opposite effects. Src activation and Hakai upregulation were found in gefitinib-resistant cells. Knockdown of Hakai elevated E-cadherin expression, attenuated stemness, and resensitized the cells to gefitinib. Clinical cancer specimens with acquired gefitinib resistance also showed a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in Hakai expression. The dual HDAC and HMGR inhibitor JMF3086 inhibited the Src/Hakai and Hakai/E-cadherin interaction to reverse E-cadherin expression, and attenuated vimentin and stemness to restore gefitinib sensitivity. The EMT features of AZD9291-resistant H1975 cells were related to the upregulation of Zeb1. Both gefitinib and AZD9291 sensitivity was restored by JMF3086 through reversing EMT. Our study not only revealed a common mechanism of EMT in both gefitinib and AZD9291 resistance beyond EGFR mutations per se, but also provides a new strategy to overcome it. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",,"Cbl protein; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; gefitinib; Hakai protein; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; jmf 3086; messenger RNA; osimertinib; protein tyrosine kinase; transcription factor ZEB1; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; antineoplastic agent; cadherin; CBLL1 protein, human; CDH1 protein, human; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; histone deacetylase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; leukocyte antigen; osimertinib; piperazine derivative; protein kinase inhibitor; small interfering RNA; transcription factor ZEB1; tumor protein; ubiquitin protein ligase; VIM protein, human; vimentin; ZEB1 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer resistance; cancer stem cell; controlled study; drug potentiation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; HCC827 cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; lung non-small cell carcinoma cell line; male; malignant pleura effusion; mouse; mutation; NCI-H1975 cell line; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; upregulation; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; drug effect; drug resistance; drug screening; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression regulation; genetics; germfree animal; lung tumor; non small cell lung cancer; nude mouse; pathology; physiology; RNA interference; tumor cell line; Animals; Antigens, CD; Antineoplastic Agents; Cadherins; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; ErbB Receptors; Gefitinib; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Piperazines; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Vimentin; Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1",2-s2.0-85052331297

However, many microbes have developed resistance to antibiotics through mutation over time. As an alternative to antibiotics, antimicrobial nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their advantageous properties and unique mechanisms of action toward microbes. They inhibit bacterial growth and destroy cells through complex mechanisms, making it difficult for bacteria to develop drug resistance, though some health concerns related to biocompatibility remain for practical applications. Among various antibacterial nanomaterials, carbon-based materials, especially graphene oxide (GO) and carbon dots (C-Dots), are promising candidates due to the ease of production and functionalization, high dispersibility in aqueous media, and promising biocompatibility. The antibacterial properties of these nanomaterials can be easily adjusted by surface modification. They are promising materials for future applications against multidrug-resistant bacteria based on their strong capacity in disruption of microbial membranes. Though many studies have reported excellent antibacterial activity of carbon nanomaterials, their impact on the environment and living organisms is of concern due to the accumulatory and cytotoxic effects.

This study's purpose was to investigate the impact of tobacco, betel quid, and alcohol on head and neck cancer risk in East Asia. Methods: A multicenter case-control study (921 patients with head and neck cancer and 806 controls) in East Asia was conducted. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using logistic regression. Results: Head and neck cancer risks were elevated for tobacco (OR = 1.58), betel quid (OR = 8.23), and alcohol (OR = 2.29). The total attributable risk of tobacco and/or alcohol was 47.2%. Tobacco/alcohol appeared to account for a small proportion of head and neck cancer among women (attributable risk of 2.2%). Betel quid chewing alone accounted for 28.7% of head and neck cancer. Conclusions: Betel quid chewing is the strongest risk factor for oral cavity cancer in this Chinese population. Alcohol may play a larger role for head and neck cancer in this population than in European or U.S. populations. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","alcohol drinking; attributable fraction, head and neck cancer risk; betel quid chewing; tobacco smoking",alcohol; adult; aged; Article; betel quid; cancer risk; case control study; cigarette smoking; controlled study; drinking behavior; East Asian; female; head and neck cancer; human; hypopharynx cancer; larynx cancer; major clinical study; mastication; middle aged; mouth cancer; multicenter study; oropharynx cancer; priority journal; smoking,2-s2.0-85058368730

Findings: Differences in genetics, environment, lifestyle, diet and culture are all likely to influence the management of advanced prostate cancer in the APAC region when compared with the rest of the world. When considering the strong APCCC 2017 recommendation for the use of upfront docetaxel in metastatic castration-na?ve prostate cancer, the panel noted possible increased toxicity in Asian men receiving docetaxel, which would affect this recommendation in the APAC region. Although androgen receptor-targeting agents appear to be well tolerated in Asian men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, access to these drugs is very limited for financial reasons across the region. The meeting highlighted that cost and access to contemporary treatments and technologies are key factors influencing therapeutic decision-making in the APAC region. Whilst lower cost/older treatments and technologies may be an option, issues of culture and patient or physician preference mean, these may not always be acceptable. Although generic products can reduce cost in some countries, costs may still be prohibitive for lower-income patients or communities. The panellists noted the opportunity for a coordinated approach across the APAC region to address issues of access and cost. Developments in technologies and treatments are presenting new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Differences in genetics and epidemiology affect the side-effect profiles of some drugs and influence prescribing. Conclusions: As the field continues to evolve, collaboration across the APAC region will be important to facilitate relevant research and collection and appraisal of data relevant to APAC populations. In the meantime, the APAC APCCC 2018 meeting highlighted the critical importance of a multidisciplinary team-based approach to treatment planning and care, delivery of best-practice care by clinicians with appropriate expertise, and the importance of patient information and support for informed patient choice. ? 2018 The Authors BJU International ? 2018 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",advanced prostate cancer; castration-na?ve prostate cancer; castration-resistant prostate cancer; cost and access to treatment; high-risk localised prostate cancer; oligometastatic prostate cancer,"abiraterone; androgen receptor; docetaxel; enzalutamide; generic drug; platinum complex; prednisone; prescription drug; abiraterone; androstane derivative; antiandrogen; antineoplastic agent; docetaxel; advanced cancer; Asia; Asia Pacific region; cancer radiotherapy; cancer research; cancer therapy; castration resistant prostate cancer; clinical practice; consensus; cultural anthropology; diet; drug targeting; environment; financial deficit; genetics; health care access; health care cost; health care delivery; health care quality; human; lifestyle; medical decision making; medical expert; metastasis; patient information; patient preference; physician attitude; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; Review; treatment planning; consensus development; developing country; economics; Far East; lymph node dissection; male; metastasis; multimodality cancer therapy; Pacific islands; pathology; prostate tumor; radiotherapy; risk factor; Southeast Asia; supply and distribution; Androgen Antagonists; Androstenes; Antineoplastic Agents; Asia, Southeastern; Combined Modality Therapy; Consensus; Developing Countries; Docetaxel; Far East; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Male; Neoplasm Metastasis; Oceania; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiotherapy; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85052790498

We investigated the causal direction of the relationship between adiposity and asthma using genetic markers as instrumental variables (IVs) in bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Subjects/methods: We used data from the Taiwan Children Health Study with 24 body mass index (BMI)-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, combined into a weighted allelic score) and 16 asthma-SNPs (combined into two weighted allelic scores, separately for asthma inflammatory and antioxidative genes) to yield genetic IVs for adiposity and asthma, respectively. Results: The weighted allele score for BMI was strongly associated with adiposity (p = 2 × 10 –16 ) and active asthma (p = 0.03). The two-stage least square regression risk ratio (RR) for the effect of BMI on asthma was 1.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.07, p = 0.03). Although the weighted asthma genetic scores were significantly associated with asthma (p = 8.4 × 10 –3 ), no association was seen for genetically instrumented asthma with BMI using MR. Central obesity was the most accurate predictor of asthma. Adiposity showed higher causal effects on asthma in boys and children with non-atopic asthma. Sensitivity analysis for MR revealed no directional genetic pleiotropy effects. The causal effect RRs of BMI on asthma were 1.04, 1.08, and 1.03 for inverse-variance weighted, MR–Egger regression (slope), and weighted median methods, respectively, all in accordance with the MR estimates. Conclusions: High adiposity may lead to asthma, whereas the effects of asthma on adiposity accumulation are likely to be small. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",,allele; allergic asthma; Article; asthma; body fat; body mass; child; childhood obesity; fat free mass; female; gene frequency; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; genotype; human; major clinical study; male; Mendelian randomization analysis; pleiotropy; priority journal; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; skinfold; waist hip ratio,2-s2.0-85050299479

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be considered to ameliorate progressive immunodeficiency and associated malignancy, but appropriate indications, methods, and outcomes of HSCT for APDS1 remain undefined. Objective: Our objective was to analyze the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, prognosis, and treatment of APDS1 and explore appropriate indications and methods of HSCT. Methods: We reviewed retrospectively the medical records of cohorts undergoing HSCT at collaborating facilities. Results: Thirty-year overall survival was 86.1%, but event-free survival was 39.6%. Life-threatening events, such as severe infections or lymphoproliferation, were frequent in childhood and adolescence and were common indications for HSCT. Nine patients underwent HSCT with fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning. Seven patients survived after frequent adverse complications and engraftment failure. Most symptoms improved after HSCT. Conclusion: Patients with APDS1 showed variable clinical manifestations. Life-threatening progressive combined immunodeficiency and massive lymphoproliferation were common indications for HSCT. Fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning–HSCT ameliorated clinical symptoms, but transplantation-related complications were frequent, including graft failure. ? 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",Activated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase δ syndrome type 1; combined immunodeficiency; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; IgG2; kappa-deleting recombination excision circle; PIK3CD; T-cell receptor excision circle,"busulfan; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; etoposide; fludarabine; immunoglobulin; melphalan; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; prednisolone; rapamycin; rituximab; tacrolimus; thymocyte antibody; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; activated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase delta syndrome type 1; adolescent; Article; child; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; combined immunodeficiency; comparative study; controlled study; disease course; event free survival; female; graft failure; graft versus host reaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hepatosplenomegaly; herpes virus infection; human; immune deficiency; laboratory test; lymphocyte proliferation; lymphoid hyperplasia; male; medical record review; overall survival; plasma exchange; preschool child; priority journal; prognosis; reduced intensity conditioning; respiratory tract infection; retrospective study; school child; splenectomy; treatment indication; whole body radiation; adult; allograft; clinical trial; disease free survival; immune deficiency; immunology; lymphoproliferative disease; mortality; pathology; survival rate; Adolescent; Adult; Allografts; Child; Child, Preschool; Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Lymphoproliferative Disorders; Male; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85048559524

However, at least three issues remain unresolved: (1) the psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-BREF for cancer patients are insufficient; (2) the scoring method used for WHOQOL-BREF needs to be clarify; (3) whether different types of cancer patients interpret the WHOQOL-BREF similarly. Methods: We recruited 1000 outpatients with head/neck cancer, 1000 with colorectal cancer, 965 with liver cancer, 1438 with lung cancer and 1299 with gynecologic cancers in a medical center. Data analyses included Rasch models, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and Pearson correlations. Results: The mean WHOQOL-BREF domain scores were between 13.34 and 14.77 among all participants. CFA supported construct validity; Rasch models revealed that almost all items were embedded in their expected domains and were interpreted similarly across five types of cancer patients; all correlation coefficients between Rasch scores and original domain scores were above 0.9. Conclusion: The linear relationship between Rasch scores and domain scores suggested that the current calculations for domain scores were applicable and without serious bias. Clinical practitioners may regularly collect and record the WHOQOL-BREF domain scores into electronic health records. ? 2018",Cancer; Confirmatory factor analysis; Psychometric properties; Quality of life; Rasch analysis,"adult; Article; cancer center; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer survivor; colorectal cancer; concurrent validity; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; correlation coefficient; cytology; female; female genital tract cancer; head and neck cancer; histopathology; human; internal consistency; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; marriage; middle aged; outpatient; psychometry; quality of life; Rasch analysis; Taiwan; Taiwanese; wellbeing; aged; cancer survivor; classification; evaluation study; factor analysis; outpatient; procedures; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; World Health Organization; Adult; Aged; Cancer Survivors; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outpatients; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; World Health Organization",2-s2.0-85045333389

Methods: The present cross-sectional population-representative Internet-based study investigated OAB symptoms in men and women aged ?40 years using the overactive bladder symptom score. Additional instruments included the International Index of Erectile Function (men only) and the Sexual Quality of Life – Female (women only) questionnaires, as well as Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC). Results: In all, 8284 individuals participated in the study. The prevalence of OAB was 20.8% overall (women 22.1%, men 19.5%) and increased significantly with age, from 10.8% in those aged 40–44 years to 27.9% in those aged >60 years (P =.001). The presence of comorbid conditions (e.g. neurological disease, diabetes) was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of OAB. Increasing symptom severity was associated with significantly worsening patient perception of bladder condition responses. Just under half (48%) of those with no OAB had no lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), whereas 88% of those with severe symptoms had all 3 LUTS (International Continence Society definition) symptom categories (voiding, post-micturition, and storage symptoms). Of those without OAB, 10% reported visiting healthcare professionals for urinary symptoms, compared with 64% of those with severe OAB symptoms (P =.001). Increased symptom severity was significantly associated with lower sexual quality of life in both men and women. Conclusions: OAB symptoms were found to affect 1 in 5 individuals aged ?40 years in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, becoming more common with increasing age. The results suggest that many more individuals with OAB could benefit by consulting healthcare professionals. ? 2017 The Authors.

We aimed to investigate the in vivo therapeutic value of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) intervention in high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD for 10 weeks, and then they received 20 or 100 mg/kg THC along with the HFD for another 10 weeks. Mice fed an HFD for 20 weeks experienced obesity, hepatic steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) intervention for 10 weeks significantly reduced adiposity (epididymal-fat weights of 6.6 ± 0.4 g for the HFD-only group and 5.3 ± 0.8 and 5.6 ± 0.7 g for the HFD with 20 mg/kg THC and HFD with 100 mg/kg THC groups, respectively; p < 0.05) via downregulation of adipogenic factors. Inflammatory macrophage infiltration and polarization were decreased by THC in mouse epididymal adipose tissues. In the liver, THC markedly alleviated steatosis by approximately 28-37% (p < 0.05) via the downregulation of lipogenesis, the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the increase of fatty acid oxidation. Elevated blood glucose and insulin resistance were also improved by THC, which might be caused by regulation of the hepatic insulin signaling cascade, gene transcription involved in glucose metabolism, and reduced macrophage infiltration in the liver and adipose tissue. Our results demonstrated the beneficial effects of THC-mediated intervention against obesity and NAFLD as well as other metabolic syndromes, revealing a novel therapeutic use of THC in obese populations.

Using transcriptomic analysis of prostate cancer data sets, histopathologic examination of clinical specimens, and in vivo experiments of xenograft models, we reveal in this study a coordinated increase in glycan-binding protein, galectin-4, specific glycosyltransferases of core 1 synthase, glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-b-galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GALT1) and ST3 b-galactoside a-2,3-sialyltransferase 1 (ST3GAL1), and resulting mucin-type O-glycans during the progression of CRPC. Furthermore, galectin-4 engaged with C1GALT1-dependent O-glycans to promote castration resistance and metastasis by activating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and cancer cell stemness properties mediated by SRY-box 9 (SOX9). This galectin–glycan interaction up-regulated the MYC-dependent expression of C1GALT1 and ST3GAL1, which altered cellular mucin-type O-glycosylation to allow for galectin-4 binding. In clinical prostate cancer, high-level expression of C1GALT1 and galectin-4 together predict poor overall survival compared with low-level expression of C1GALT1 and galectin-4. In summary, MYC regulates abnormal O-glycosylation, thus priming cells for binding to galectin-4 and downstream signaling, which promotes castration resistance and metastasis. ?

This is lacking in the Asia-Pacific region. Design: The observational Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS) II was established to quantify the extent of hyperlipidemia in adults with acute and stable coronary heart disease globally. Methods: Patients with stable coronary heart disease or hospitalised with an acute coronary syndrome were enrolled across nine Asia-Pacific countries from July 2013 to October 2014. Lipid-lowering therapy and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment (<70 mg/dL) were assessed. The acute coronary syndrome cohort was followed up 4 months post-discharge. Results: Of the 4592 patients enrolled, 2794 had stable coronary heart disease and 1798 were admitted with an acute coronary syndrome. In the coronary heart disease cohort, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 86.9 mg/dL, with 91.7% using lipid-lowering therapy and 31% achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL. In the acute coronary syndrome cohort at admission, the corresponding values were 103.2 mg/dL, 63.4% and 23.0%, respectively. Target attainment was significantly higher in lipid-lowering therapy-treated than non-treated patients in each cohort (32.6% vs. 12.9% and 31.1% vs. 9.0%, respectively). Mean atorvastatin-equivalent dosages were low (20 ± 15 and 22 ± 18 mg/day, respectively), with little use of non-statin adjuvants (13.0% and 6.8%, respectively). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment had improved by follow-up for the acute coronary syndrome patients, but remained low (41.7%). Conclusions: Many patients in Asia at very high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level above the recommended target. Although lipid-lowering therapy was common, it was not used to its full potential. ?

Evaluating the impact of S. argenteus infection on patient outcomes for future therapeutic and infection control decision-making is imperative. A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of S. argenteus bacteraemia at a Taiwanese medical centre between 2010–2012. Staphylococcus argenteus was identified based on absence of the crtM gene and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. Clinical characteristics between S. argenteus and Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia were compared. The independent effect of S. argenteus on bacteraemia mortality was evaluated. A total of 47 S. argenteus isolates were re-identified from 394 S. aureus bacteraemia isolates. All S. argenteus isolates were susceptible to methicillin and multiple other antibiotics. Most of the S. argenteus isolates (36/47; 76.6%) were sequence type 2550 (ST2550). Comparing the 47 S. argenteus bacteraemia cases with 232 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) bacteraemia cases, S. argenteus bacteraemia patients had significantly higher percentages of polymicrobial infection, recent hospitalisation in the past 3 months, thrombocytopenia, lower respiratory tract infection and short-term mortality. Compared with MSSA bacteraemia, S. argenteus bacteraemia was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.845, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.033–3.294] using multivariate Cox regression analysis. In a stratified analysis, S. argenteus bacteraemia was associated with a higher mortality risk than MSSA bacteraemia among patients with prior healthcare-associated exposure (aHR = 2.769, 95% CI 1.489–5.149). Although more susceptible to multiple antibiotics, S. argenteus bacteraemia cases were independently associated with higher mortality than MSSA bacteraemia cases. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Bacteraemia; Mortality; Prevalence; Staphylococcus argenteus; Staphylococcus aureus,"beta lactam antibiotic; cefazolin; meticillin; oxacillin; antiinfective agent; aged; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; cohort analysis; controlled study; crtM gene; disease association; female; high risk patient; human; length of stay; lower respiratory tract infection; male; methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; mortality; mortality risk; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; observational study; priority journal; retrospective study; staphylococcal bacteremia; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus argenteus; thrombocytopenia; adult; bacteremia; classification; community acquired infection; genetics; genotype; incidence; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; middle aged; pathology; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus infection; survival analysis; Taiwan; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Community-Acquired Infections; Female; Genotype; Humans; Incidence; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Retrospective Studies; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus; Survival Analysis; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85055710537

Methods: Patients with stage IV NSCLC that progressed after clinical benefit on erlotinib/gefitinib and/or had activating EGFR or ERBB2 mutations, had exhausted other treatments, and were ineligible for afatinib trials were enrolled in a named patient use program, receiving afatinib 30 to 50 mg/d on a compassionate basis within routine clinical practice. Efficacy and safety were retrospectively assessed in the subgroup with ERBB2 mutation-positive NSCLC. Results: Twenty-eight heavily pretreated patients in the named patient use program had a documented ERBB2 mutation by local testing. Median time-to-treatment failure (TTF; time from treatment initiation to discontinuation for any reason) was 2.9 months; eight patients (29%) had TTF greater than 1 year. Objective response rate was 19% (3 of 16 patients with response data achieved partial response) and disease control rate (DCR) was 69% (11 of 16). Among 12 patients for whom type of ERBB2 mutation was specified, 10 had a p.A775_G776insYVMA insertion in exon 20, four of whom (40%) remained on afatinib for more than 1 year. This subgroup had median TTF of 9.6 months, objective response rate of 33% (two of six), and disease control rate of 100% (six of six). Conclusions: This analysis of patients treated in clinical practice provides further evidence of the activity of afatinib in ERBB2 mutation-positive NSCLC, and suggests that identification of specific subgroups with certain mutations, such as p.A775_G776ins/YVMA insertion in exon 20, could help optimize outcomes with ErbB2-targeted treatment. ? 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",Afatinib; ERBB2 mutation; NSCLC,"afatinib; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; erlotinib; gefitinib; paclitaxel; afatinib; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; adult; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical article; diarrhea; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug response; drug safety; ERBB2 gene; European; exon; gastrointestinal toxicity; gene mutation; genotype; human; lack of drug effect; male; non small cell lung cancer; outcome assessment; priority journal; progression free survival; skin disease; Taiwanese; treatment duration; treatment outcome; aged; female; follow up; genetics; lung tumor; middle aged; mutation; pathology; prognosis; retrospective study; salvage therapy; very elderly; Adult; Afatinib; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Prognosis; Receptor, ErbB-2; Retrospective Studies; Salvage Therapy",2-s2.0-85054185370

Because of the distinct initiating processes between primary and metastatic tumors, we investigate the differences in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from primary and metastatic cancers. Here we show that dual expression of M1 and M2 markers is noted in TAMs from primary tumors, whereas predominant expression of M2 markers is shown in metastatic TAMs. At metastatic sites, TAMs secrete interleukin-35 (IL-35) to facilitate metastatic colonization through activation of JAK2–STAT6-GATA3 signaling to reverse epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. In primary tumors, inflammation-induced EMT upregulates IL12Rβ2, a subunit of the IL-35 receptor, in cancer cells to help them respond to IL-35 during metastasis. Neutralization of IL-35 or knockout of IL-35 in macrophages reduces metastatic colonization. These results indicate the distinct TMEs of primary and metastatic tumors and provide potential targets for intercepting metastasis. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"arginase 1; beta actin; C-C motif chemokine 18; CD11b antigen; CD163 antigen; clodronic acid; CXCL19 chemokine; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 10; interleukin 12 receptor beta2; interleukin 12p35; interleukin 15; interleukin 27beta; interleukin 35; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; Janus kinase 2; messenger RNA; nerve cell adhesion molecule; ruxolitinib; STAT6 protein; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; transcription factor FOXP3; transcription factor GATA 3; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; IL12RB2 protein, human; Il12rb2 protein, mouse; interleukin 12 receptor; interleukin derivative; interleukin-35, human; interleukin-35, mouse; Janus kinase 2; STAT6 protein; transcription factor GATA 3; cancer; cell; chemoreception; colonization; gene; gene expression; genetic marker; neutralization; protein; tumor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; breast cancer; cancer cell; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell plasticity; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; cytokine release; epithelial mesenchymal transition; human; human cell; lung metastasis; macrophage; metastasis inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; regulatory T lymphocyte; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; upregulation; A-549 cell line; animal; cell plasticity; gene expression regulation; gene knockout; genetics; HEK293 cell line; immunology; inflammation; macrophage; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; metastasis; signal transduction; tumor cell line; tumor microenvironment; A549 Cells; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Plasticity; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; GATA3 Transcription Factor; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockout Techniques; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukins; Janus Kinase 2; Macrophages; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Receptors, Interleukin-12; Signal Transduction; STAT6 Transcription Factor; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85053338417

The rate of sustained virologic response at week 12 off-therapy (SVR12) and that of treatment completion were assessed. The baseline characteristics and on-treatment HCV viral kinetics to predict SVR12 were analyzed. By evaluable population (EP) analysis, the SVR12 rate was 95.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.2–96.9%).

Of 517 patients, 514 (99.4%) completed the scheduled treatment. All 15 patients with true virologic failures were relapsers. Two decompensated cirrhotic patients had on-treatment deaths which were not related to DAAs. All 7 patients who were lost to follow-up had undetectable HCV RNA level at the last visit. The SVR12 rates were comparable in terms of baseline patient characteristics and viral decline at week 4 of treatment.

Histological analysis revealed faster re-epithelialization, collagen deposition, less inflammation, and a complete skin structure in the plasma-treated groups was found as compared with the untreated control groups. In addition, the new blood vessels of plasma-treated tissues decreased more than untreated tissues in the middle (Day 14) and late (Day 21) stages of wound healing. The plasma-treated wounds demonstrated more transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) expression in the early stage (Day 7), whereas they decreased in the middle and late stages of wound healing. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) increased after plasma treatment. In addition, plasma-treated water had a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide, nitrite and nitrate when the plasma treatment time was longer. In summary, the proposed argon APPJ based on the current study could be a potential tool for treating diabetic wounds. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"argon; catalase; glutathione peroxidase; streptozocin; superoxide dismutase; transforming growth factor beta; animal; atmospheric pressure; disease model; drug effect; experimental diabetes mellitus; male; metabolism; pharmacology; physiology; plasma gas; rat; skin; Sprague Dawley rat; wound healing; Animals; Argon; Atmospheric Pressure; Catalase; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Disease Models, Animal; Glutathione Peroxidase; Male; Plasma Gases; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Skin; Streptozocin; Superoxide Dismutase; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Wound Healing",2-s2.0-85051624524

This meta-analysis examined linear and nonlinear dose–response relationships between sleep duration and the risk of suicidality in adolescents and explored potential moderators of the associations. Electronic databases, namely EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I Wanfang Data (Chinese database), and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, were searched from their inception to April 18, 2017. Studies examining the association between sleep duration and suicidality in adolescents were included. A random-effects dose–response model was used to estimate the linear and nonlinear dose–response relationships. We identified 13 reports that included a total of 598,281 participants for a systematic review, and 12 reports were further used for a dose–response meta-analysis. Strong curvilinear dose–response associations were obtained for both suicidal ideation and attempts, with the lowest suicidal ideation and attempt risks at sleep durations of 8 h and 8–9 h per day (all Pnonlinearity &lt; 0.001). A linear dose–response relationship between sleep duration and suicide plans (pooled OR = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88–0.90) was obtained, indicating that the risk of suicide plans statistically decreased by 11% for every 1-h increase in sleep duration. Depression did not moderate the association between sleep duration and suicidality in youths. Our findings suggest curvilinear dose–response associations between sleep duration and the risks of suicidal ideation and attempts and a linear dose–response relationship between sleep duration and suicide plan risk. Additional longitudinal studies are warranted to establish causality. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Adolescents; Dose–response meta-analysis; Sleep duration; Suicidality,"adolescent health; causality; data base; depression; human; Review; risk factor; sleep time; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; adolescent; adolescent behavior; complication; insomnia; meta analysis; psychology; suicidal ideation; time factor; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Humans; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85050988862

modified low-density lipoprotein particle that contains apolipoprotein(a), encoded by LPA, and is a highly heritable, causal risk factor for cardiovascular diseases that varies in concentrations across ancestries. Here, we use deep-coverage whole genome sequencing in 8392 individuals of European and African ancestry to discover and interpret both single-nucleotide variants and copy number (CN) variation associated with Lp(a). We observe that genetic determinants between Europeans and Africans have several unique determinants. The common variant rs12740374 associated with Lp(a) cholesterol is an eQTL for SORT1 and independent of LDL cholesterol. Observed associations of aggregates of rare non-coding variants are largely explained by LPA structural variation, namely the LPA kringle IV 2 (KIV2)-CN. Finally, we find that LPA risk genotypes confer greater relative risk for incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases compared to directly measured Lp(a), and are significantly associated with measures of subclinical atherosclerosis in African Americans. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"apolipoprotein B; cholesterol; cholesterol ester transfer protein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; kringle IV 2 protien; lipoprotein A; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; protein; sortilin; unclassified drug; lipoprotein A; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; sortilin; vesicular transport adaptor protein; ancestry; cardiovascular disease; concentration (composition); genetic analysis; genome; plasma; protein; risk factor; African; African American; ancestry group; Article; cohort analysis; copy number variation; coronary artery atherosclerosis; European; expression quantitative trait locus; genetic association; genetic difference; genetic risk; genetic variation; genome analysis; genotype; human; lipoprotein blood level; major clinical study; Mendelian randomization analysis; risk assessment; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing; Black person; blood; cardiovascular disease; Caucasian; copy number variation; ethnology; gene expression; genetics; genome-wide association study; human genome; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing; Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport; African Continental Ancestry Group; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol, LDL; DNA Copy Number Variations; European Continental Ancestry Group; Gene Expression; Genome, Human; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Lipoprotein(a); Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Risk Factors; Whole Genome Sequencing",2-s2.0-85049751193

We aim to investigate the association between a vegetarian diet, change in dietary patterns and diabetes risk in a Taiwanese Buddhist population. Methods: We prospectively followed 2918 non-smoking, non-Alcohol drinking Buddhists free of diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases at baseline, for a median of 5 years, with 183 incident diabetes cases confirmed. Diet was assessed through a validated food frequency questionnaire at baseline and a simple questionnaire during follow-ups. Incident cases of diabetes were ascertained through follow-up questionnaires, fasting glucose and HbA1C. Stratified Cox Proportional Hazards Regression was used to assess the effect of diets on risk of diabetes. Results: Consistent vegetarian diet was associated with 35% lower hazards (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.92), while converting from a nonvegetarian to a vegetarian pattern was associated with 53% lower hazards (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.71) for diabetes, comparing with nonvegetarians while adjusting for age, gender, education, physical activity, family history of diabetes, follow-up methods, use of lipid-lowering medications, and baseline BMI. Conclusion: Vegetarian diet and converting to vegetarian diet may protect against diabetes independent of BMI among Taiwanese. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"glucose; hemoglobin A1c; glycosylated hemoglobin; adult; aged; Article; body mass; Buddhist; cigarette smoking; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; disease association; drinking behavior; family history; female; follow up; food frequency questionnaire; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; incidence; intestine flora; major clinical study; male; medical examination; medical history; middle aged; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; smoking; Taiwanese; vegetarian diet; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; Buddhism; diabetes mellitus; diet; feeding behavior; metabolism; proportional hazards model; questionnaire; risk factor; Taiwan; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Buddhism; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Diet Surveys; Diet, Vegetarian; Feeding Behavior; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85044250306

Patients with IBD had a higher risk of developing colorectal carcinoma (CRC), of which the subset was classified as colitis-associated cancers. Genetic polymorphism of innate immune receptors had long been considered a major risk factor for IBD, and the mutations were also recently observed in CRC. Altered microbial composition (termed microbiota dybiosis) and dysfunctional gut barrier manifested by epithelial hyperpermeability and high amount of mucosa-associated bacteria were observed in IBD and CRC patients. The findings suggested that aberrant immune responses to penetrating commensal microbes may play key roles in fueling disease progression. Accumulative evidence demonstrated that mucosa-associated bacteria harbored colitogenic and protumoral properties in experimental models, supporting an active role of bacteria as pathobionts (commensal-derived opportunistic pathogens). Nevertheless, the host factors involved in bacterial dysbiosis and conversion mechanisms from lumen-dwelling commensals to mucosal pathobionts remain unclear. Based on the observation of gut leakiness in patients and the evidence of epithelial hyperpermeability prior to the onset of mucosal histopathology in colitic animals, it was postulated that the epithelial barrier dysfunction associated with mucosal enrichment of specific bacterial strains may predispose the shift to disease-associated microbiota. The speculation of leaky gut as an initiating factor for microbiota dysbiosis that eventually led to pathological consequences was proposed as the ""common ground hypothesis"", which will be highlighted in this review. Overall, the understanding of the core interplay between gut microbiota and epithelial barriers at early subclinical phases will shed light to novel therapeutic strategies to manage chronic inflammatory disorders and colitis-associated cancers.",bacterial internalization; barrier function; Colitis; colorectal cancers; epithelial permeability; intestinal dysbiosis,"animal; colorectal tumor; dysbiosis; genetics; human; immunology; inflammatory bowel disease; innate immunity; intestine flora; microbiology; mouse; physiology; Animals; Colorectal Neoplasms; Dysbiosis; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Mice",2-s2.0-85056383603

In this regard, carbamazepine has received significant attention due to its negative effect on both ecosystem and human health. However, the need for acidic conditions severely hinders the use of conventional Fenton reagent reactions for the control and elimination of carbamazepine in wastewater effluents and drinking water influents. Herein, we report of the synthesis and use of flexible bifunctional nanoelectrocatalytic textile materials, Fe 3 O 4 -NP@CNF, for the effective degradation and complete mineralization of carbamazepine in water. The nonwoven porous structure of the composite binder-free Fe 3 O 4 -NP@CNF textile is used to generate H 2 O 2 on the carbon nanofiber (CNF) substrate by O 2 reduction. In addition, ·OH radical is generated on the surface of the bonded Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (NPs) at low applied potentials (-0.345 V). The Fe 3 O 4 -NPs are covalently bonded to the CNF textile support with a high degree of dispersion throughout the fiber matrix. The dispersion of the nanosized catalysts results in a higher catalytic reactivity than existing electro-Fenton systems. For example, the newly synthesized Fe 3 O 4 -NPs system uses an Fe loading that is 2 orders of magnitude less than existing electro-Fenton systems, coupled with a current efficiency that is higher than electrolysis using a boron-doped diamond electrode. Our test results show that this process can remove carbamazepine with high pseudo-first-order rate constants (e.g., 6.85 h -1 ) and minimal energy consumption (0.239 kW·h/g carbamazepine). This combination leads to an efficient and sustainable electro-Fenton process.

The purpose of this study was to gain evidence of potent α-glucosidase inhibitory effects, as well as isolate, identify and characterize the active compounds of ACFB. The MeOH extract of ACFB demonstrated potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, and possessed high pH stability (pH 2–11) and thermostable properties at 40–50 °C. Further purification led to the isolation of eight constituents from ACFB, identified as: 25S-antcin K (1), 25R-antcin K (2), dehydrosulphurenic acid (3), 25S-antcin I (4), 25S-antcin B (5), 25R-antcin B (6), dehydroeburicoic acid (7) and eburicoic acid (8).

Moreover, recent studies indicate that Gandoerma also exerts other bioactivities such as skin lighting, gut microbiota regulation, and anti-virus effects. However, since these medical fungi are rare in natural environment, and that the cost of cultivation of fruiting bodies is high, industrial submerged fermentation of Ganoderma mycelia promotes the development of Ganoderma by dint of an increase of biomass and bioactive metabolites used for further application. In addition, various strategies for production of different metabolites are well developed, such as gene regulation, bi-stage pH, and oxygen control.

Whereas there has been a significant improvement of understanding the underlying mechanism of erythropoiesis, the treatment of renal anemia is still restricted to erythropoietin (EPO)-stimulating agents. The purpose of this article is to review the physiology of erythropoiesis, functional role of EPO and underlying molecular and cellular basis that regulate EPO production. Regulation of EPO production is at mRNA level. When anemia or hypoxia occurs, transcriptional factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), binds to EPO 5′ hypoxic response element and EPO gene transcription increases. The renal EPO is mainly produced by pericytes. In CKD, pericytes transdifferentiate to myofibroblasts, and subsequently the ability of EPO production decreases, leading to renal anemia. Recent experimental and clinical studies show the promising efficacy of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors in renal anemia through increasing EPO production by stabilizing HIF. Recent advances on epigenetics create a new field to study EPO gene expression at chromatin level. We will discuss the role of demethylating agent on restoring EPO expression, providing a novel approach to the treatment of renal anemia. ? 2018",Chronic kidney disease; Epigenetics; Erythropoietin; Hypoxia-inducible factor; Myofibroblast; Pericyte,"erythropoietin; hypoxia inducible factor; messenger RNA; prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor; transcription factor; EPO protein, human; erythropoietin; hypoxia inducible factor 1; anemia; burst forming unit E; cell transdifferentiation; chromatin; chronic kidney failure; epigenetics; erythropoiesis; gene control; gene expression; genetic transcription; human; hypoxia; kidney cell; molecular docking; myofibroblast; nonhuman; oxygen sensing; pathophysiology; pericyte; physiology; renal anemia; renal erythropoietin producing cell; Review; anemia; animal; complication; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Anemia; Animals; Erythropoiesis; Erythropoietin; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1; Myofibroblasts; Pericytes; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",2-s2.0-85045221477

Recently, more US research has been conducted to measure the shape of the suprascapular notch and the diameter of the suprascapular nerve. Because the suprascapular nerve is paramount for various shoulder disorders, the present study aims to establish normal values of suprascapular nerve sizes at different levels as well as to investigate potential influence of participants' characteristics on the CSA measurements. The present study used a cross-sectional design investigating the CSA values of the suprascapular nerve from the supraclavicular region to spinoglenoid notch. We employed the inside-epineurium and outside-epineurium methods to quantify CSA of cervical roots (C5 and C6) and the suprascapular nerve on US imaging. Univariate comparisons of nerve sizes among different age and gender groups were carried out. Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze the impact of participants' characteristics on nerve CSA. Repeated measurement analysis of variance was conducted to examine segmental variations of CSA of the suprascapular nerve from its origin to infraspinatus fossa. Our study included 60 healthy adults with 120 shoulders and had three major findings: (1) the inside-epineurium method was more reliable than the outside-epineurium approach for CSA measurements due to higher intra- and inter-rater reliability, (2) women had smaller sizes for cervical nerve roots and for the most proximal segment of the suprascapular nerves, and (3) using the outside-epineurium method, the suprascapular nerve CSA was larger in its distal division than the portion proximal to the mid-clavicular line. In conclusion, the inside-epineurium method has better reliability for nerve CSA assessment but the outside-epineurium method is needed for quantifying the size of distal suprascapular nerve.

We performed a nationwide cohort study to evaluate the effect of metformin on mitigating the risk of active TB among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Among newly diagnosed DM patients identified in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, metformin users, defined on the basis of >90 cumulative defined daily doses within 1 year, and propensity-score-matched metformin nonusers were selected. The primary outcome was incident TB, identified using diagnostic criteria validated by real patient data at a medical center. Independent predictors were investigated using Cox regression analysis. Similar analysis was performed in a subpopulation without a history of hypertensive nephropathy and renal replacement therapy. A total of 88,866 metformin users and 88,866 propensityscore-matched nonusers were selected. Validation results showed that the TB diagnostic criteria had a sensitivity of 99.13% and specificity of 99.90%. During follow-up, 707 metformin users and 807 nonusers developed active TB. Metformin use was independently associated with a lower risk of incident TB (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.84 [0.74-0.96]). TB risk was lower in high-dose metformin users than in low-dose users (HR: 0.83 [0.72-0.97]). The effect of metformin remained when analysis was restricted in the subpopulation without renal function impairment. Newly diagnosed diabetic patients without contraindication should receive metformin as an anti-diabetic medication, with potential additional benefit against TB. ? 2018 Lee et al.

Previous single country reports indicate that Guillain-Barr? syndrome may differ among regions, but no systematic comparative studies have been conducted. Comparative studies are required to identify factors determining disease susceptibility, variation and prognosis, and to improve diagnostic criteria. The International Guillain-Barr? Syndrome Outcome Study is a prospective, observational cohort study including all patients within the diagnostic spectrum, aiming to describe the heterogeneity of Guillain-Barr? syndrome worldwide. The current study was based on the first 1000 inclusions with a follow-up of at least 1 year and confirmed the variation in clinical presentation, course and outcome between patients. The full clinical spectrum of Guillain-Barr? syndrome was observed in patients from all countries participating in the International Guillain-Barr? Syndrome Outcome Study, but the frequency of variants differed between regions. We compared three regions based on geography, income and previous reports of Guillain-Barr? syndrome subtypes: Europe/Americas', Asia' (without Bangladesh), and Bangladesh'. We excluded 75 (8%) patients because of alternative diagnoses, protocol violations, or missing data. The predominant clinical variant was sensorimotor in Europe/Americas (n = 387/562, 69%) and Asia (n = 27/63, 43%), and pure motor in Bangladesh (n = 74/107, 69%). Miller Fisher syndrome and Miller Fisher-Guillain-Barr? overlap syndrome were more common in Asia (n = 14/63, 22%) than in the other two regions (Europe/Americas: n = 64/562, 11%; Bangladesh: n = 1/107, 1%) (P < 0.001). The predominant electrophysiological subtype was demyelinating in all regions (Europe/Americas: n = 312/573, 55%; Asia: n = 29/65, 45%; Bangladesh: n = 38/94, 40%). The axonal subtype occurred more often in Bangladesh (n = 34/94, 36%) than in Europe/Americas (n = 33/573, 6%) and other Asian countries (n = 4/65, 6%) (P < 0.001). In all regions, patients with the axonal subtype were younger, had fewer sensory deficits, and showed a trend towards poorer recovery compared to patients with the demyelinating subtype. The proportion of patients able to walk unaided after 1 year varied between Asia (n = 31/34, 91%), Europe/Americas (n = 334/404, 83%) and Bangladesh (n = 67/97, 69%) (P = 0.003). A similar variation was seen for mortality, being higher in Bangladesh (n = 19/114, 17%) than in Europe/Americas (n = 23/486, 5%) and Asia (n = 1/45, 2%) (P < 0.001). This study showed that factors related to geography have a major influence on clinical phenotype, disease severity, electrophysiological subtype, and outcome of Guillain-Barr? syndrome. ? 2018 The Author(s).",axonal degeneration; clinical course; demyelination; outcome; polyradiculoneuropathy,"adult; areflexia; Article; artificial ventilation; Asia; autonomic dysfunction; Bangladesh; bulbar paralysis; chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; clinical feature; disease severity; electrophysiology; Europe; female; follow up; functional disease; gastroenteritis; geography; Guillain Barre syndrome; human; hyperreflexia; hyporeflexia; leukocyte count; limb weakness; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nerve conduction; outcome assessment; paraplegia; priority journal; quadriplegia; upper respiratory tract infection; Western Hemisphere; adolescent; aged; child; clinical trial; Guillain Barre syndrome; multicenter study; pathophysiology; preschool child; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85054687956

The severity, frequency and duration of AKI are crucial predictors of poor renal outcome. A repair process after AKI can be adaptive and kidney recovers completely after a mild injury. However, severe injury will lead to a maladaptive repair, which frequently progresses to nephron loss, vascular rarefaction, chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Although different mechanisms underlying AKI-CKD transition have been extensively discussed, no definite intervention has been proved effective to block or to retard the transition until recently. In CKD, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor has been proved effective to slow down disease progression. Furthermore, RAS needs to be highlighted again in AKI-CKD transition because recent animal studies have shown the activation of intra-renal RAS after AKI, and RAS blockade can reduce the ensuing CKD and mortality. In patients with the complete renal recovery after AKI, administration of RAS inhibitor is associated with reduced risk of subsequent CKD as well. In this article, we will demonstrate the role of RAS in AKI-CKD transition comprehensively. We will then emphasize the promising effect of RAS inhibitor on CKD prevention in patients recovering from AKI based on evidence from the bench to clinical research. All of these discussions will contribute to the establishment of reliable monitoring and therapeutic strategies for patients with functional recovery from AKI who can be most easily ignored. ? 2018 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology",acute kidney injury; AKI-CKD continuum; AKI-CKD transition; chronic kidney disease; renin-angiotensin system,"angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; acute kidney failure; animal; chronic kidney failure; disease exacerbation; drug effect; human; metabolism; pathophysiology; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Acute Kidney Injury; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Disease Progression; Humans; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Renin-Angiotensin System",2-s2.0-85054600953

Methods: We performed 2 multicenter, open-label trials of patients with H pylori infection (20 years or older) failed by 2 or more previous treatment regimens, from October 2012 through September 2017 in Taiwan. The patients were randomly assigned to groups given genotypic resistance–guided therapy for 14 days (n = 21 in trial 1, n = 205 in trial 2) or empirical therapy according to medication history for 14 days (n = 20 in trial 1, n = 205 in trial 2). Patients received sequential therapy containing esomeprazole and amoxicillin for the first 7 days, followed by esomeprazole and metronidazole, with levofloxacin, clarithromycin, or tetracycline (doxycycline in trial 1, tetracycline in trial 2) for another 7 days (all given twice daily) based on genotype markers of resistance determined from gastric biopsy specimens (group A) or empirical therapy according to medication history. Resistance-associated mutations in 23S ribosomal RNA or gyrase A were identified by polymerase chain reaction with direct sequencing. Eradication status was determined by 13C-urea breath test. The primary outcome was eradication rate. Results: H pylori infection was eradicated in 17 of 21 (81%) patients receiving genotype resistance–guided therapy and 12 of 20 (60%) patients receiving empirical therapy (P =.181) in trial 1. This trial was terminated ahead of schedule due to the low rate of eradication in patients given doxycycline sequential therapy (15 of 26 [57.7%]). In trial 2, H pylori infection was eradicated in 160 of 205 (78%) patients receiving genotype resistance–guided therapy and 148 of 205 (72.2%) patients receiving empirical therapy (P =.170), according to intent to treat analysis. The frequencies of adverse effects and compliance did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions: Properly designed empirical therapy, based on medication history, is an acceptable alternative to genotypic resistance–guided therapy for eradication of refractory H pylori infection after consideration of accessibility, cost, and patient preference.

The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of concomitant therapy and triple therapy given for 5–14 days. Methods: Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of concomitant therapy for 5–14 days and proton pump inhibitor–amoxicillin–clarithromycin (PAC)-based triple therapy for 5–14 days in the first-line treatment of adult patients with H. pylori infection published from 1990 to January 2018 were searched from the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Abstracts from international annual conferences were also searched. The primary and secondary outcomes were the eradication rate according to the intention-to-treat analysis and the adverse effects, respectively. Subgroup analyses were also performed according to treatment length. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017081328. Results: Of the 639 articles identified, 23 RCTs including 3305 patients in the concomitant therapy group and 3327 patients in the triple therapy group were eligible.

However, there were significant heterogeneity (I2 = 74.0%, p &lt; 0.001). In the subgroup analysis, 5-day concomitant therapy was superior to 5-day triple therapy (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04–1.62; p = 0.02), 5- or 7-day concomitant therapy was superior to 7-day triple therapy (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.12–1.21; p &lt; 0.001), and 5- or 7-, or 10- or 14-day concomitant therapy was superior to 10-day triple therapy (RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.08–1.23; p &lt; 0.001). However, 5- or 10-day concomitant therapy was not superior to 14-day triple therapy (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.89–1.16; p = 0.796). The frequency of adverse effects was significantly higher in concomitant therapy than triple therapy (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.06–1.34; P = 0.004). Conclusions: Concomitant therapy given for 5 or 10 days was superior to 5- or 7-, or 10-day PAC-based triple therapy, but was not superior to 14-day triple therapy. ? 2018, American College of Gastroenterology.",,"amoxicillin; clarithromycin; metronidazole; proton pump inhibitor; tinidazole; amoxicillin; antiinfective agent; clarithromycin; metronidazole; proton pump inhibitor; tinidazole; adverse event; bacterial clearance; comparative effectiveness; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; Helicobacter infection; human; intention to treat analysis; long term care; meta analysis; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; treatment outcome; combination drug therapy; comparative study; disease eradication; drug administration; drug effect; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; isolation and purification; microbiology; procedures; Amoxicillin; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Clarithromycin; Disease Eradication; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Intention to Treat Analysis; Metronidazole; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tinidazole; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85053293547

Final safety and efficacy data from an open-label extension study of tofacitinib in psoriasis are reported. Objectives: To evaluate the long-term safety and durability of efficacy of tofacitinib in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Methods: Eligible patients who completed qualifying phase II/III tofacitinib studies received tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily (q12h) until month 3; subsequently, the dose could be adjusted by investigators to either 5 or 10 mg q12h. Adverse events (AEs) are reported up to month 66 and laboratory data up to month 54. Efficacy end points up to month 54 included Physician's Global Assessment of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (PGA response) and 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75). Results: Overall, 2867 patients received tofacitinib, with a median treatment duration of 35·6 months. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were reported in 82·5% and 13·7% of patients, respectively; 13·9% of patients discontinued owing to AEs; and 29 patients died. Incidence rates (patients with event/100 patient-years) were 1·16 for serious infections, 0·67 for malignancies and 0·26 for major adverse cardiovascular events. After initial changes in qualifying studies, most laboratory parameters were generally stable over 54 months. PGA response was achieved by 52–62% of patients and PASI 75 by 56–74% of patients at each study visit through month 54. Conclusions: In patients with psoriasis, the safety profile of tofacitinib over 66 months was similar to previous reports in phase III studies and efficacy was sustained through 54 months (NCT01163253). ? 2018 The Authors.

Different asthma phenotypes evoke various clinical symptoms and vary in their responses to treatments. Methods: We applied k-means clustering algorithm of twelve objective laboratory tests among 351 asthmatic children enrolled in the Taiwanese Consortium of Childhood Asthma Study (TCCAS). We constructed gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from children with different asthma phenotypes. Results: Five distinct phenotypes of childhood asthma were identified and can be characterized by either eosinophil-predominant or neutrophil-predominant inflammatory characteristics. In the gene expression profile analysis, significant differences were noted for neutrophil-predominant asthma, compared with samples from all the other asthma phenotypes. The vast majority of the differentially expressed genes in neutrophil-predominant asthma was associated with corticosteroid response. From an independent inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) response cohort, we also found neutrophils could be activated in this severe asthma phenotype and neutrophil-predominant asthma may be associated with corticosteroid nonresponsiveness. Conclusion: Phenotype clustering of childhood asthma can be helpful to identify clinically relevant patients and reveal different inflammatory characteristics in asthmatic children. Neutrophil-predominant asthma is the most severe asthma phenotype with poor corticosteroid response. Gene expression profile of different asthma phenotypes not only improve our knowledge of childhood asthma, but also can guide asthma precision medicine. ? 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

In this work, we found that the extracellular domain of EpCAM (EpEX) activated EGFR and downstream ERK1/2 signaling to promote colon cancer cell migration and proliferation, as well as tumor growth. Mechanistically, we discovered that EpEX-EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling positively regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of EpCAM and shedding of the intracellular domain (EpICD). Treatment with an EGFR inhibitor ablated the EpEX-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT. Additionally, treatment with inhibitors of either EGFR or MEK decreased EpEX-induced EpICD shedding and further revealed that EpICD is necessary for nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and the induction of HIF1α target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, an anti-EpCAM neutralizing monoclonal antibody, EpAb2-6, inhibited the nuclear translocation of EpICD and β-catenin and induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Importantly, analysis of colorectal cancer tissues showed that nuclear accumulation of EpICD was highly correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis, suggesting that it may play an important functional role in cancer progression. Thus, we provide novel insights into the mechanisms and functions of EpEX-mediated signaling, which may be considered as a promising target for the treatment of colon cancer. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Epithelial cell adhesion molecule; HIF1α; Regulated intramembrane proteolysis; β-catenin,"1,4 diamino 1,4 bis(2 aminophenylthio) 2,3 dicyanobutadiene; 2 [1 (3 dimethylaminopropyl) 5 methoxy 1h indol 3 yl] 3 (1h indol 3 yl)maleimide; 4 (3 chloroanilino) 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline; 4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 methylsulfinylphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl)imidazole; beta catenin; epidermal growth factor receptor; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; gamma secretase inhibitor; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody EpAb2 6; presenilin 2; protein kinase B; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; unclassified drug; EGFR protein, human; EPCAM protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cancer tissue; cell migration; cell proliferation; colon cancer; colon cancer cell line; colorectal cancer; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme phosphorylation; extracellular space; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; intracellular space; MAPK signaling; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein domain; protein function; protein localization; signal transduction; animal; cancer transplantation; cell motion; cell nucleus; chemistry; colon tumor; disease exacerbation; gene expression regulation; HCT 116 cell line; HT-29 cell line; MAPK signaling; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; prognosis; protein domain; tumor cell line; upregulation; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Nucleus; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Progression; Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule; ErbB Receptors; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HCT116 Cells; HT29 Cells; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Neoplasm Transplantation; Phosphorylation; Prognosis; Protein Domains; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85049565625

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the use of Chinese herbs containing aristolochic acid and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among HBV-infected patients. We conducted a retrospective, population-based, cohort study on patients older than 18 years who had a diagnosis of HBV infection between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2010 and had visited traditional Chinese medicine clinics before one year before the diagnosis of HCC or the censor dates. A total of 802,642 HBV-infected patients were identified by using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The use of Chinese herbal products containing aristolochic acid was identified between 1997 and 2003. Each patient was individually tracked from 1997 to 2013 to identify incident cases of HCC since 1999. There were 33,982 HCCs during the follow-up period of 11,643,790 person-years and the overall incidence rate was 291.8 HCCs per 100,000 person-years.

Methods: A comprehensive search up to 1 July 2017 was conducted on Medline and Embase for studies that utilized FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and Prodesse for diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. A summary of diagnostic accuracies for the following five viruses were calculated: influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were used for estimating the viral detection performance per assay. Results: Twenty studies of 5510 patient samples were eligible for analysis. Multiplex PCRs demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) equal to or more than 0.98 for all the above viruses except for adenovirus (AUROC 0.89). FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+ (the only Prodesse assay with enough data) demonstrated a summary sensitivity for FluA of 0.911 (95% confidence interval, 0.848–0.949), 0.949 (95% confidence interval, 0.882–0.979) and 0.954 (95% confidence interval, 0.871–0.985), respectively. The three mPCRs were comparable in terms of detection of FluA. Conclusions: Point estimates calculated from eligible studies showed that the three mPCRs (FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+) are highly accurate and may provide important diagnostic information for early identification of respiratory virus infections.

However, whether pre-frailty or frailty predicts greater healthcare utilization in diabetes patients is unclear. Methods: From the Longitudinal Cohort of Diabetes Patients in Taiwan (n = 840,000) between 2004 and 2010, we identified 560,795 patients with incident type 2 DM, categorized into patients without frailty, or with 1, 2 (pre-frail) and ? 3 frailty components, based on FRAIL scale (Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and body weight Loss). We examined their long-term mortality, cardiovascular risk, all-cause hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Results: Among all participants (56.4 ± 13.8 year-old, 46.1% female, and 84.8% community-dwelling), 77.8% (n = 436,521), 19.2% (n = 107,757), 2.7% (n = 15,101), and 0.3% (n = 1416) patients did not have or had 1, 2 (pre-frail), and ? 3 frailty components (frail), respectively, with Fatigue and Illness being the most common components. After 3.14 years of follow-up, 7.8% patients died, whereas 36.6% and 9.1% experienced hospitalization and ICU stay, respectively. Cox proportional hazard modeling discovered that patients with 1, 2 (pre-frail), and ? 3 frailty components (frail) had an increased risk of mortality (for 1, 2, and ? 3 components, hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 1.13, and 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.07, 1.08-1.17, and 1.15-1.36, respectively), cardiovascular events (HR 1.05, 1.15, and 1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.07, 1.1-1.2, and 1.01-1.25, respectively), hospitalization (HR 1.06, 1.16, and 1.25; 95% CI 1.05-1.07, 1.14-1.19, and 1.18-1.33, respectively), and ICU admission (HR 1.05, 1.13, and 1.17; 95% CI 1.03-1.07, 1.08-1.14, and 1.06-1.28, respectively) compared to non-frail ones. Approximately 6-7% risk elevation in mortality and healthcare utilization was noted for every frailty component increase.

For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the multiplicity of an immunotolerant microenvironment within both the tumor, and the liver per se may limit the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. Since radiation induces immunogenic cell death and inflammatory reactions within the tumor microenvironment, we hypothesized that a combination therapy of radiation and lasting local immunostimulating agents, achieved by intratumoral injection of an adenoviral vector encoding interleukin 12, may reverse the immunotolerant microenvironment within a well-established orthotopic HCC toward a state favorable for inducing antitumor immunities. Our data showed that radiation and IL-12 combination therapy (RT/IL-12) led to dramatic tumor regression in animals bearing large subcutaneous or orthotopic HCC, induced systemic effect against distant tumor, and significantly prolonged survival. Radiation monotherapy induced tumor regression at early times but afterwards most tumors regained exponential growth, while IL-12 monotherapy only delayed tumor growth. Mechanistic studies revealed that RT/IL-12 increased expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 on tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells, suggesting an improvement of their antigen presentation activity. RT/IL-12 also significantly reduced accumulation of tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and impaired their suppressive functions by reducing production of reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and NK cells were significantly activated toward the antitumor phenotype, as revealed by increased expression of CD107a and TNF-α.

The administration of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) to prevent the development of delayed neurological sequelae in CO poisoning have extensively investigated but conflicting results have been reported. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating HBO treatment and its effect on neuropsychometric dysfunction after CO poisoning. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Pubmed, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 2017. Eligible studies compared HBO therapy with normobaric oxygen (NBO) in patients with CO poisoning. Results: Six studies compared HBO with NBO in CO poisoning patients. Compared with patients treated with NBO, a lower percentage of patients treated with HBO reported headache (16.2% vs 16.5%, relative risk [RR] = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.38-1.80), memory impairment (18.2% vs 23.8%, RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.43-1.49), difficulty concentrating (15.0% vs 18.4%, RR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.55-1.34), and disturbed sleep (14.7% vs 16.2%, RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.59-1.39). Two sessions of HBO treatment exhibited no advantage over one session. Conclusions: The meta-analysis indicated that compared with CO poisoning patients treated with NBO, HBO treated patients have a lower incidence of neuropsychological sequelae, including headache, memory impairment, difficulty concentrating, disturbed sleep, and delayed neurological sequelae. Taking into consideration the cost-effectiveness of one session of HBO, one session of HBO treatment could be an economical option for patients with CO poisoning with high severity.

This is achievable using item banks and computerised adaptive tests (CATs). The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) is one of the most widely used PROMs in cancer research and clinical practice. Here we provide an overview of the research program to develop CAT versions of the QLQ-C30's 14 functional and symptom domains. Methods: The EORTC Quality of Life Group's strategy for developing CAT item banks consists of: literature search to identify potential candidate items; formulation of new items compatible with the QLQ-C30 item style; expert evaluations and patient interviews; field-testing and psychometric analyses, including factor analysis, item response theory calibration and simulation of measurement properties. In addition, software for setting up, running and scoring CAT has been developed. Results: Across eight rounds of data collections, 9782 patients were recruited from 12 countries for the field-testing. The four phases of development resulted in a total of 260 unique items across the 14 domains. Each item bank consists of 7–34 items. Psychometric evaluations indicated higher measurement precision and increased statistical power of the CAT measures compared to the QLQ-C30 scales. Using CAT, sample size requirements may be reduced by approximately 20–35% on average without loss of power. Conclusions: The EORTC CAT Core represents a more precise, powerful and flexible measurement system than the QLQ-C30. It is currently being validated in a large independent, international sample of cancer patients. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Computerized adaptive test; EORTC QLQ-C30; Health related quality of life; Item banking; Item development; Item response theory; Patient-reported outcome,adult; Article; automation; cancer patient; cancer research; clinical practice; computer simulation; computerised adaptive test; factor analysis; feedback system; female; human; major clinical study; male; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; psychometry; quality of life assessment; Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30; clinical trial; cost of illness; daily life activity; Europe; health status; health status indicator; middle aged; multicenter study; neoplasm; pathology; pathophysiology; patient-reported outcome; psychology; quality of life; software design; Taiwan; Activities of Daily Living; Cost of Illness; Europe; Female; Health Status; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Software Design; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85048841999

Objective: The present study aimed to describe the characteristics of fever-related AE in a large cohort of patients with BrS. Methods: The Survey on Arrhythmic Events in Brugada Syndrome is a multicenter study on 678 patients with BrS with first AE documented at the time of aborted cardiac arrest (n = 426) or after prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation (n = 252). Results: In 35 of 588 patients (6%) with available information, the AE occurred during a febrile illness. Most of the 35 patients were male (80%), Caucasian (83%), and proband (70%). The mean age at the time of AE was 29 ± 24 years (range 0.3–76 years). Most patients (80%) presented with aborted cardiac arrest and 6 (17%) with arrhythmic storm. Family history of sudden death, history of syncope, and spontaneous type 1 Brugada electrocardiogram were noted in 17%, 40%, and 71% of patients, respectively. Ventricular fibrillation was induced at electrophysiology study in 9 of 19 patients (47%). An SCN5A mutation was found in 14 of 28 patients (50%). The highest proportion of fever-related AE was observed in the pediatric population (age <16 years), with a disproportionally higher event rate in the very young (age 0–5 years) (65%). Males were involved in all age groups and females only in the pediatric and elderly groups. Fever-related AE affected 17 Caucasians aged <24 years, but no Asians aged <24 years. Conclusion: The risk of fever-related AE in BrS markedly varies according to age group, sex, and ethnicity. Taking these factors into account could help the clinical management of patients with BrS with fever. ? 2018 Heart Rhythm Society",Brugada syndrome; Children; Elderly; Ethnicity; Fever; Sex,"sodium channel Nav1.5; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; Asian; Brugada syndrome; cardiac patient; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; child; clinical observation; cohort analysis; comparative study; disease association; ECG abnormality; electrocardiogram; ethnic difference; faintness; family history; female; fever; gene mutation; heart arrest; heart arrhythmia; heart electrophysiology; heart ventricle fibrillation; human; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; pediatric cardiology; priority journal; retrospective study; sex difference; sex ratio; sudden death; Brugada syndrome; clinical trial; complication; electrocardiography; fever; heart ventricle fibrillation; middle aged; multicenter study; pathophysiology; preschool child; prognosis; questionnaire; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Brugada Syndrome; Child; Child, Preschool; Electrocardiography; Female; Fever; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Ventricular Fibrillation; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85047178178

It decreases not only the level of phosphorylation of tau proteins but also the aggregation of tau proteins. Compound 6 also shows neuroprotective activity by triggering ubiquitination. In animal models, compound 6 is able to ameliorate the impaired learning and memory, and it crosses the blood-brain barrier after oral administration.

The major sites for TNBC metastasis include the lungs, brain, liver, and bone. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides and have been reported as important regulators in BC metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms for lncRNAs regulating TNBC metastasis are not fully understood. Here we found that linc-ZNF469-3 was highly expressed in lung-metastatic LM2-4175 TNBC cells and overexpression of linc-ZNF469-3 enhanced invasion ability and stemness properties in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, we found linc-ZNF469-3 physically interacted with miR-574-5p and overexpression of miR-574-5p attenuated ZEB1 expression. Importantly, endogenous high expressions of linc-ZNF469-3 and ZEB1 were correlated with tumor recurrence in TNBC patients with lung metastasis. Taken together, our findings suggested that linc-ZNF469-3 promotes lung metastasis of TNBC through miR-574-5p-ZEB1 signaling axis and may be used as potential prognostic marker for TNBC patients. ? 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"long non coding RNA linc ZNF469 3; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; microRNA 574 5p; unclassified drug; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN574 microRNA, human; transcription factor; transcription factor ZEB1; tumor marker; ZEB1 protein, human; ZNF469 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer stem cell; controlled study; female; gene; gene overexpression; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; interactions with RNA; lung metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; triple negative breast cancer; tumor invasion; ZEB1 gene; animal; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; MCF-7 cell line; metastasis; nonobese diabetic mouse; pathology; SCID mouse; triple negative breast cancer; tumor cell line; tumor recurrence; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; RNA, Long Noncoding; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1",2-s2.0-85046726686

Information on the association between microcirculatory dysfunction and prognosis in cardiogenic shock patients with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) support is limited. Methods: Sublingual microcirculation images were recorded using an incident dark-field video microscope at the following time points: within 12h (T1), 24h (T2), 48h (T3), 72h (T4), and 96h (T5) after VA-ECMO placement. If a patient could be weaned off VA-ECMO, sublingual microcirculation images were recorded before and after VA-ECMO removal. Microcirculatory parameters were compared between 28-day nonsurvivors and survivors with VA-ECMO support. In addition, the microcirculation and clinical parameters were assessed as prognostic tests of 28-day mortality, and patients were divided into three subgroups according to microcirculation parameters for survival analysis. Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled in this study. At T1, the observed heart rate, mean arterial pressure, inotropic score and lactate level of 28-day nonsurvivors and survivors did not differ significantly, but the perfused small vessel density (PSVD) and proportion of perfused vessels (PPV) were lower in the 28-day nonsurvivors than in the survivors. The PSVD and PPV were slightly superior to lactate levels in predicting 28-day mortality (area under curve of 0.68, 0.70, and 0.62, respectively).

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) represents a high percentage of mAb drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To facilitate therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies, we developed a general liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to quantify the concentration of IgG-based mAbs in human plasma. Three IgG-based drugs (bevacizumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab) were selected to demonstrate our method. Protein G beads were used for sample pretreatment due to their universal ability to trap IgG-based drugs. Surrogate peptides that were obtained after trypsin digestion were quantified by using LC-MS/MS. To calibrate sample preparation errors and matrix effects that occur during LC-MS/MS analysis, we used two internal standards (IS) method that include the IgG-based drug-IS tocilizumab and post-column infused IS. Using two internal standards was found to effectively improve quantification accuracy, which was within 15% for all mAb drugs that were tested at three different concentrations. This general method was validated in term of its precision, accuracy, linearity and sensitivity for 3 demonstration mAb drugs. The successful application of the method to clinical samples demonstrated its’ applicability in clinical analysis. It is anticipated that this general method could be applied to other mAb-based drugs for use in precision medicine and clinical studies. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); Plasma; Post-column infusion internal standard (PCI-IS); Protein G purification; Therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb),"Column chromatography; Drug products; Mass spectrometry; Monoclonal antibodies; Patient monitoring; Plasma (human); Plasmas; Purification; Food and Drug Administration; Internal standards; Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS); Monoclonal antibodies (mAb); Protein G; Sample pretreatment; Therapeutic drug monitoring; Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies; Liquid chromatography; bevacizumab; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G1; monoclonal antibody; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; protein G; tocilizumab; immunoglobulin G; accuracy; amino acid sequence; Article; blood sampling; calibration; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug purification; drug selectivity; hydrophobicity; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; priority journal; protein purification; proton transport; retention time; validity; blood; human; isolation and purification; liquid chromatography; tandem mass spectrometry; Calibration; Chromatography, Liquid; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",2-s2.0-85042644534

The harvested adipose tissues are further digested to extract stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which is cultured, and the anchorage-dependent cells are isolated in order to characterize their stemness, surface markers, and multi-differentiation potential. The differentiation potential of ASCs is directed through manipulating culture medium composition with an introduction of growth factors to obtain the desired cell type. ASCs have been widely studied for its regenerative therapeutic solution to neurologic, skin, wound, muscle, bone, and other disorders. These therapeutic outcomes of ASCs are achieved possibly via autocrine and paracrine effects of their secretome comprising of cytokines, extracellular proteins and RNAs. Therefore, secretome-derivatives might offer huge advantages over cells through their synthesis and storage for long-term use. When considering the therapeutic significance and future prospects of ASCs, this review summarizes the recent developments made in harvesting, isolation, and characterization. Furthermore, this article also provides a deeper insight into secretome of ASCs mediating regenerative efficacy. ? 2018 by the authors.

It is still unclear whether a migraine might increase the risk of cochlear disorders, even though a migraine does not occur concurrently with cochlear disorders. OBJECTIVE To investigate the risk of cochlear disorders for patients with a history of migraines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used claims data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 to identify 1056 patients with migraines diagnosed between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2012. A total of 4224 controls were also identified from the same database based on propensity score matching. Statistical analysis was performed from January 23, 1996, to December 28, 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The incidence rate of cochlear disorders (tinnitus, sensorineural hearing impairment, and/or sudden deafness) was compared between the cohorts by use of the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was also used to examine the association of cochlear disorders with migraines. RESULTS Of the 1056 patients with migraines, 672 were women and 384 were men, and the mean (SD) age was 36.7 (15.3) years. Compared with the nonmigraine cohort, the crude hazard ratio for cochlear disorders in the migraine cohort was 2.83 (95%CI, 2.01-3.99), and the adjusted hazard ratio was 2.71 (95%CI, 1.86-3.93). The incidence rates of cochlear disorders were 81.4 (95%CI, 81.1-81.8) per 1 million person-years for the migraine cohort and 29.4 (95%CI, 29.2-29.7) per 1 million person-years for the nonmigraine cohort. The cumulative incidence of cochlear disorders in the migraine cohort (12.2%) was significantly higher than that in the matched nonmigraine cohort (5.5%). Subgroup analysis showed that, compared with the nonmigraine cohort, the adjusted hazard ratios in the migraine cohort were 3.30 (95%CI, 2.17-5.00) for tinnitus, 1.03 (95%CI, 0.17-6.41) for sensorineural hearing impairment, and 1.22 (95%CI, 0.53-2.83) for sudden deafness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this population-based study, the risk of cochlear disorders, especially for tinnitus, was found to be significantly higher among patients with a history of migraines.

M1 polarized macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators resulting in inflammation, while M2 macrophages have an anti-inflammatory effect. Secretion of appropriate cytokines and chemokines from macrophages can lead to the modification of the microenvironment for bridging innate and adaptive immune responses. Increasing evidence suggests that polarized macrophages are pivotal for disease progression, and the regulation of macrophage polarization may provide a new approach in therapeutic treatment of inflammation-related diseases, including cancer, obesity and metabolic diseases, fibrosis in organs, brain damage and neuron injuries, and colorectal disease. Polarized macrophages affect the microenvironment by secreting cytokines and chemokines while cytokines or mediators that are produced by resident cells or tissues may also influence macrophages behavior. The interplay of macrophages and other cells can affect disease progression, and therefore, understanding the activation of macrophages and the interaction between polarized macrophages and disease progression is imperative prior to taking therapeutic or preventive actions. Manipulation of macrophages can be an entry point for disease improvement, but the mechanism and potential must be understood. In this review, some advanced studies regarding the role of macrophages in different diseases, potential mechanisms involved, and intervention of drugs or phytochemicals, which are effective on macrophage polarization, will be discussed. ? 2018 by the authors.

Forty-eight cholestatic infants (9-87 days of age) with direct bilirubin level >1 mg/dL were enrolled. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by TE was performed during the cholestasis workup, and 15 subjects were diagnosed as BA. We assessed liver histology using liver biopsies from 36 subjects and graded fibrosis status using the METAVIR score. BA infants had significantly higher LSM values and METAVIR scores than non-BA cholestatic infants. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that an LSM >7.7 kPa was predictive of BA among cholestatic infants (sensitivity = 80%; specificity = 97%; area under the curve [AUC] = 85.3%; P = 0.0001). Cholestatic infants with an LSM >7.7 kPa were more likely to be diagnosed with BA (odds ratio [OR] = 128; P < 0.001). Very early measurement of LSM after hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) is associated with occurrence of thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and esophageal varices 6 months post-HPE. Five of the BA subjects were awaiting or had received liver transplantation (LT), and they had a significantly higher LSM measured 1 week post-HPE than that in the other BA subjects (26.0 vs. 10.8 kPa; P = 0.006). A Cox proportional analysis demonstrated that the need for LT was significantly higher in BA subjects with LSM >16 kPa measured 1 week post-HPE than other BA subjects (hazard ratio [HR] = 10.16; P = 0.04). Conclusion: LSM assessment during the workup of cholestatic infants may facilitate the diagnosis of BA. LSM post-HPE may predict complications and the need for early LT in infants with BA.

However, bike-sharing research focusing on East Asia is limited. The impacts of bike-sharing on travelers’ usage of other transport modes in an integrated transportation system remain unclear. This study develops a spatial Agent-based model to simulate the use of bike-sharing services and other transport modes in Taipei city, considering their interactions through the modeling of the modal split based on the heterogeneous mode choice behaviors of travelers. Two scenarios are proposed for the development of a bike-sharing system: 1) bike infrastructure extensions; and 2) bike-sharing incentives. Two scenarios are evaluated along with the corresponding environmental and social impacts. The simulation results indicate that free use of bike-sharing to connect the transit system can be most sustainable with 1.5 million US dollars in transportation damage cost saved per year, and 22 premature deaths further prevented per year due to mode shift to cycling and walking based on the business as usual (BAU) scenario. However, bike-sharing has limited influence on the use of motorcycles, which is nearly invariable. This model can be a powerful tool to help policy-makers improve the sustainability of a multi-modal transportation system with bike-sharing. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Agent-based modeling; Bike sharing; Environmental impact; Human health; Mode choice,Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Environmental impact; Multimodal transportation; Sustainable development; Agent-based model; Bike infrastructures; Bike sharing; Human health; Integrated Transportation systems; Mode choice; Multi-modal transportation systems; Spatial agent-based models; Bicycles,2-s2.0-85047380093

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of different definitions on the rates of posttreatment relapse and therefore on the probability of retreatment in patients who have discontinued effective long-term NA therapy. In total, 130 HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients without cirrhosis and before NA treatment were included. All had on-therapy virological remission for ?24 months and close follow-up for ?12 months after stopping NA treatment or until retreatment, which started on stringent predefined criteria. Relapses rates based on several predetermined definitions of virological and perhaps biochemical criteria were assessed. The median duration of therapy was 60 months and the median duration of on-therapy virological remission was 43 months. During a median off-NAs follow-up of 15 months, no patient experienced liver decompensation or died. Cumulative relapse rates were 2%-49%, 4%-73%, 11%-82%, and 16%-90% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, whereas cumulative retreatment rates were 15%, 22%, and 40% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, after discontinuation of NA therapy. No patient characteristic was independently associated with the probability of relapse based on at least two definitions or of retreatment. Conclusion: In HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients who discontinue NA therapy, the definition of relapse has a great impact on off-NAs relapse rates and potentially on the probability of retreatment. Regardless of definition, off-NAs relapses cannot be easily predicted by patient characteristics. A substantial proportion of such patients may not require retreatment if stringent criteria are adopted.

These newly developed micelles exhibit excellent pH-responsive behavior and biocompatibility, highly controlled drug (doxorubicin; DOX) release behavior, and high drug encapsulation stability in different aqueous environments, making the micelles highly attractive potential candidates for safer, more effective drug delivery in applications such as cancer chemotherapy. In addition, in vitro cell studies revealed the drug-loaded micelles possessed excellent drug entrapment stability and low cytotoxicity toward macrophages under normal physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 °C). When the pH of the culture media was reduced to 6.0 to mimic the acidic tumor microenvironment, the drug-loaded micelles triggered rapid release of DOX within the cells, which induced potent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in vitro. Importantly, fluorescent imaging and flow cytometric analyses confirmed the DOX-loaded micelles were efficiently delivered into the cytoplasm of the cells via endocytosis and then subsequently gradually translocated into the nucleus. Therefore, these multifunctional micelles could serve as delivery vehicles for precise, effective, controlled drug release to prevent accumulation and activation of tumor-promoting tumor-associated macrophages in cancer tissues.

Au nanoparticles (NPs) were formed in situ and doped into BiOI nanosheets. The oxygen vacancies generated in BiOI give rise to its oxidase-like activity, and Au doping facilitated the reaction leading to a 4-fold higher oxidase-like activity of the Au/BiOI nanocomposite. The Au/BiOI nanocomposites showed wide spectrum antimicrobial activity not only against non-multidrug-resistant E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. enteritidis, S. aureus, and B. subtilis bacteria, but also against multidrug-resistant bacteria, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The gold doping reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration value by ?2000-fold for the Au/BiOI nanocomposite, in comparison with only BiOI nanoparticles. The bactericidal property of the Au/BiOI nanocomposite arose from the combined effect of the disruption of the bacterial membrane through a strong interaction of the nanocomposite with the bacteria and the generation of reactive oxygen species. Also, the Au/BiOI nanocomposite is highly biocompatible, which has been demonstrated in vitro by analysis of cytotoxicity and hemolysis, and in vivo by evaluating ocular tissue responses. Furthermore, intrastromal administration of Au/BiOI nanocomposites can effectively alleviate S. aureus-induced bacterial keratitis in rabbits, suggesting a significant disinfectant benefit in preclinical studies. The Au/BiOI nanocomposites show great potential for the inactivation of bacterial pathogens in an aqueous environment and treatment of bacterial infection-induced diseases. ? 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Biocompatibility; Bismuth compounds; Escherichia coli; Gold compounds; Gold nanoparticles; Ions; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Oxygen vacancies; Anti-microbial activity; Bacterial infections; Bacterial membranes; Bactericidal properties; Minimal inhibitory concentration; Multidrug resistants; Preclinical studies; Reactive oxygen species; Iodine compounds; bismuth; gold; iodide; nanocomposite; oxygen; animal; bacterial infection; Escherichia coli; green chemistry; HEK293 cell line; human; keratitis; Leporidae; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbiology; mouse; NIH 3T3 cell line; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Animals; Bacterial Infections; Bismuth; Escherichia coli; Gold; Green Chemistry Technology; HEK293 Cells; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Iodides; Keratitis; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Mice; Nanocomposites; NIH 3T3 Cells; Oxygen; Rabbits,2-s2.0-85049530412

In this work, our goal was to establish deep learning models which distinguish responders from non-responders, and also to predict possible antidepressant treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD). To uncover relationships between the responsiveness of antidepressant treatment and biomarkers, we developed a deep learning prediction approach resulting from the analysis of genetic and clinical factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), age, sex, baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, depressive episodes, marital status, and suicide attempt status of MDD patients. The cohort consisted of 455 patients who were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (treatment-response rate = 61.0%; remission rate = 33.0%). By using the SNP dataset that was original to a genome-wide association study, we selected 10 SNPs (including ABCA13 rs4917029, BNIP3 rs9419139, CACNA1E rs704329, EXOC4 rs6978272, GRIN2B rs7954376, LHFPL3 rs4352778, NELL1 rs2139423, NUAK1 rs2956406, PREX1 rs4810894, and SLIT3 rs139863958) which were associated with antidepressant treatment response. Furthermore, we pinpointed 10 SNPs (including ARNTL rs11022778, CAMK1D rs2724812, GABRB3 rs12904459, GRM8 rs35864549, NAALADL2 rs9878985, NCALD rs483986, PLA2G4A rs12046378, PROK2 rs73103153, RBFOX1 rs17134927, and ZNF536 rs77554113) in relation to remission. Then, we employed multilayer feedforward neural networks (MFNNs) containing 1-3 hidden layers and compared MFNN models with logistic regression models. Our analysis results revealed that the MFNN model with 2 hidden layers (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.8228 ± 0.0571; sensitivity = 0.7546 ± 0.0619; specificity = 0.6922 ± 0.0765) performed maximally among predictive models to infer the complex relationship between antidepressant treatment response and biomarkers. In addition, the MFNN model with 3 hidden layers (AUC = 0.8060 ± 0.0722; sensitivity = 0.7732 ± 0.0583; specificity = 0.6623 ± 0.0853) achieved best among predictive models to predict remission. Our study indicates that the deep MFNN framework may provide a suitable method to establish a tool for distinguishing treatment responders from non-responders prior to antidepressant therapy. ? 2018 Lin, Kuo, Liu, Yu, Yang and Tsai.",Antidepressant; Deep learning; Genome-wide association studies; Major depressive disorder; Multilayer feedforward neural networks; Personalized medicine; Single nucleotide polymorphisms,biological marker; citalopram; escitalopram; fluoxetine; paroxetine; ABCA13 gene; adult; age; ARNTL gene; Article; BNIP3 gene; CACNA1E gene; CAMK1D gene; cohort analysis; EXOC4 gene; female; GABRB3 gene; gene; gene locus; genetic susceptibility; genome-wide association study; GRIN2B gene; GRM8 gene; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; LHFPL3 gene; machine learning; major clinical study; major depression; male; molecular genetics; NAALADL2 gene; NCALD gene; NELL1 gene; NUAK1 gene; PLA2G4A gene; PREX1 gene; PROK2 gene; RBFOX1 gene; remission; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLIT3 gene; social status; suicide attempt; treatment response; ZNF536 gene,2-s2.0-85049845461

Several viral, host and external risk factors for the development of HBV-related HCC have been documented. Aims: To summarise and discuss the risk stratification and the preventive strategies of HBV-related HCC. Methods: Recent published studies identified from PubMed were comprehensively reviewed. The key words included chronic hepatitis B, HBV, hepatocellular carcinoma, prevention and antiviral therapy. Results: The incidence of HCC is extremely high in HBV hyperendemic areas. For HBV patients left untreated, significant risk factors for HCC include male gender, aging, advanced hepatic fibrosis, persistent serum transaminase elevation, specific HBV entry receptor (NTCP) genotype, PM2.5 exposure, HBeAg positivity, HBV genotype C/D/F, high proportion of core promoter mutation, pre-S deletion, high serum levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg as well as co-infection with HCV, HDV and HIV. Primary prevention of HBV-related HCC can be achieved through universal HBV vaccination and anti-viral prophylaxis for high viraemic mothers. The goal of secondary prevention has been reached by effective anti-viral therapy to reduce the risk of HCC development in chronic hepatitis B patients. However, whether HCC is prevented or delayed deserves further examination. Finally, several studies confirmed the tertiary preventive effect of anti-viral therapy in reducing risk of HCC recurrence after curative therapies. Conclusions: Through the strategies of three-level prevention, the global burden of HBV-related HCC should decline over time and even be eliminated in conjunction with HBV cure. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"acetylsalicylic acid; adefovir dipivoxil; aminotransferase; antivirus agent; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B vaccine; hepatitis B(e) antigen; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lamivudine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; peginterferon alpha; recombinant alpha interferon; telbivudine; tenofovir alafenamide; tenofovir disoproxil; virus DNA; aging; antiviral therapy; cancer incidence; cancer risk; chronic hepatitis B; delta agent hepatitis; endemic disease; gene deletion; gene mutation; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; Hepatitis B virus genotype D; Hepatitis B virus genotype F; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypertransaminasemia; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; mixed infection; nonhuman; outcome assessment; particulate matter; primary prevention; priority journal; promoter region; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; secondary prevention; sex difference; tertiary prevention; virus load; chronic hepatitis B; complication; genetics; hepatitis B; incidence; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; preventive medicine; procedures; virology; Antiviral Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Incidence; Liver Neoplasms; Preventive Medicine; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85046360685

In these subanalyses of the LUX-Lung 3, 6, and 7 trials, the efficacy of first-line afatinib in older patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer was consistent with the overall study populations, with no unexpected safety signals. Progression-free survival was improved versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (LUX-Lung 3/6) or gefitinib (LUX-Lung 7). Background: Afatinib is approved in the US, Europe, and several other regions for first-line treatment for epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive (EGFRm + ) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Treatment-naive patients with advanced EGFRm + NSCLC were randomized to afatinib (40 mg/d) versus cisplatin/pemetrexed (LUX-Lung 3 [LL3]) or cisplatin/gemcitabine (LUX-Lung 6 [LL6]), or versus gefitinib (250 mg/d; LUX-Lung 7 [LL7]). We report subgroup analyses according to age, including 65 years or older versus younger than 65 years (preplanned; LL3/LL6) and additional cutoffs up to 75 years and older (exploratory; LL7). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. Results: Among the 134 of 345 (39%) and 86 of 364 (24%) patients aged 65 years and older in LL3 and LL6, median PFS was improved with afatinib versus chemotherapy (LL3: hazard ratio [HR], 0.64 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.39-1.03]; LL6: HR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.07-0.39]). Afatinib significantly improved OS versus chemotherapy in elderly patients with Del19 + NSCLC in LL3 (HR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.19-0.80]). Among the 40 of 319 patients (13%) aged 75 years or older in LL7, median PFS (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.33-1.44]) favored afatinib, consistent with the overall population. Afatinib-associated AEs in older patients were consistent with the overall populations. Conclusions: Subgroup analyses of the LL3, LL6, and LL7 trials show that afatinib is an effective and tolerable treatment for patients with EGFRm + NSCLC, independent of age. ? 2018 The Authors",EGFR blocker; Elderly; Gefitinib; NSCLC; Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"afatinib; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; cisplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; gemcitabine; pemetrexed; afatinib; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; deoxycytidine; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; gemcitabine; pemetrexed; acne; age; aged; alanine aminotransferase level; anemia; Article; aspartate aminotransferase level; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; carcinogenesis; conjunctivitis; decreased appetite; diarrhea; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; dry skin; fatigue; female; gene mutation; human; interstitial lung disease; leukocyte count; leukopenia; major clinical study; male; multiple cycle treatment; nausea; neutropenia; neutrophil count; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; paronychia; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); post treatment survival; progression free survival; pruritus; rash; side effect; stomatitis; treatment duration; vomiting; adult; analogs and derivatives; clinical trial; controlled study; genetics; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; phase 2 clinical trial; phase 3 clinical trial; randomized controlled trial; Adult; Afatinib; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cisplatin; Deoxycytidine; ErbB Receptors; Female; Gefitinib; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Pemetrexed; Progression-Free Survival",2-s2.0-85045117284

Methods: This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Sixty-three consecutive patients (mean age, 62.7 ± 12 y; men/women, 40/23) with pancreatic cancer underwent PET/MRI before treatment. The imaging biomarkers were comprised of DCE-MRI parameters (peak, IAUC 60 , K trans , k ep , v e ), the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC min ), choline level, standardized uptake values, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of the tumors. The relationships between these imaging biomarkers with OS were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Seventeen (27%) patients received curative surgery, with the median follow-up duration being 638?days. Univariate analysis showed that patients at a low TNM stage (≦3, P = 0.041), high peak (P = 0.006), high ADC min (P = 0.002) and low TLG (P = 0.01) had better OS. Moreover, high TLG/peak ratio was associated with poor OS (P = 0.016). Multivariate analysis indicated that ADC min (P = 0.011) and TLG/peak ratio (P = 0.006) were independent predictors of OS after adjustment for age, gender, tumor size, and TNM stage. The TLG/peak ratio was an independent predictor of OS in a subgroup of patients who did not receive curative surgery (P = 0.013). Conclusion: The flow-metabolism mismatch reflected by the TLG/peak ratio may better predict OS than other imaging biomarkers from PET/MRI in pancreatic cancer patients. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Diffusion weighted MRI; Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI; MR spectroscopy; Overall survival; Pancreatic cancer; PET/MR,antineoplastic agent; biological marker; carcinoembryonic antigen; choline; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; gadobutrol; biological marker; radiopharmaceutical agent; adjuvant chemotherapy; adjuvant therapy; adult; aged; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; bypass surgery; cancer patient; cancer size; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cohort analysis; diffusion weighted imaging; disease specific survival; distal pancreatectomy; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; female; follow up; glycolysis; human; laparotomy; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; major clinical study; male; median survival time; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreatectomy; pancreaticoduodenectomy; positron emission tomography; whole body MRI; whole body PET; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; mortality; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pancreas tumor; prognosis; prospective study; retrospective study; tumor volume; Aged; Biomarkers; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Radiopharmaceuticals; Retrospective Studies; Tumor Burden,2-s2.0-85044969337

Ultrasound parametric imaging, which is based on statistical models, assesses fatty liver changes, using quantitative visualization of hepatic-steatosis–caused variations in the statistical properties of backscattered signals. One constraint with using statistical models in ultrasound imaging is that ultrasound data must conform to the distribution employed. Small-window entropy imaging was recently proposed as a non–model-based parametric imaging technique with physical meanings of backscattered statistics. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using small-window entropy imaging in the assessment of fatty liver disease and evaluated its performance through comparisons with parametric imaging based on the Nakagami distribution model (currently the most frequently used statistical model). Liver donors (n = 53) and patients (n = 142) were recruited to evaluate hepatic fat fractions (HFFs), using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and to evaluate the stages of fatty liver disease (normal, mild, moderate and severe), using liver biopsy with histopathology. Livers were scanned using a 3-MHz ultrasound to construct B-mode, small-window entropy and Nakagami images to correlate with HFF analyses and fatty liver stages. The diagnostic values of the imaging methods were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. The results demonstrated that the entropy value obtained using small-window entropy imaging correlated well with log10(HFF), with a correlation coefficient r = 0.74, which was higher than those obtained for the B-scan and Nakagami images. Moreover, small-window entropy imaging also resulted in the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.80 for stages equal to or more severe than mild; 0.90 for equal to or more severe than moderate; 0.89 for severe), which indicated that non–model-based entropy imaging—using the small-window technique—performs more favorably than other techniques in fatty liver assessment. ? 2018 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology",Entropy imaging; Fatty liver; Hepatic steatosis; Ultrasound,"Chemical sensors; Diagnosis; Entropy; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Statistics; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonics; Backscattered statistics; Correlation coefficient; Fatty liver; Hepatic steatosis; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Quantitative visualization; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Statistical properties; Diseases; area under the curve; Article; B scan; clinical evaluation; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic value; disease classification; disease severity; entropy; fatty liver; feasibility study; hepatic fat fraction; histopathology; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; liver donor; major clinical study; mathematical analysis; Nakagami distribution model; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; organ donor; parametric imaging; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; small window entropy imaging; statistical model; ultrasound; adult; aged; diagnostic imaging; echography; female; image processing; liver; male; middle aged; nonalcoholic fatty liver; procedures; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Aged; Entropy; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Prospective Studies; Taiwan; Ultrasonography; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85044773517

A quantitative study was conducted to probe what voice characteristics of social robots baby boomers may prefer and what personality traits they would associate with various pitch, speech rate, and intonation in Mandarin. While the findings coincide with previous research in that female, extroverted voices were preferred by most participants, many individual differences remain, which could be attributed to differences in demographics, lifestyles, and personality traits. This study contributes to design decisions that would take individual differences into consideration.

Foreign antigen-specific regulatory T (Treg) cells are induced under subimmunogenic conditions peripherally, although their development and role in vaccine-mediated antiviral immunity is unclear. Here, we demonstrated primary vaccination with peptides alone significantly induced antigen-specific Foxp3+ Treg cells, which were further expanded by repeated vaccination with unadjuvanted peptides. Certain adjuvants, including CpG, suppressed the induction and expansion of antigen-specific Treg cells by peptide vaccination. Interestingly, secondary influenza virus infection significantly increased the frequency of preexisting antigen-specific Treg cells, although primary infection barely induced them. Importantly, specific depletion of vaccine-induced antigen-specific Treg cells promoted influenza viral clearance, indicating their inhibitory role in vivo. Immunization with CpG-adjuvanted peptides by the subcutaneous prime-intranasal-boost strategy restricted the recruitment and accumulation of antigen-specific Treg cells in lung, and stimulated robust T cell immunity. Finally, subcutaneous prime-intranasal-boost immunization with CpG-adjuvanted peptides or whole-inactivated influenza vaccines protected mice from heterosubtypic influenza virus infection. In conclusion, antigen-specific Treg cells induced by peptide vaccines attenuate the antiviral immunity against influenza virus infection. CpG-adjuvanted peptide vaccines provide heterosubtypic influenza protection probably by inhibiting Treg development and enhancing T cell immunity. ? 2018 Society for Mucosal Immunology.",,"influenza vaccine; transcription factor FOXP3; virus antigen; epitope; immunological adjuvant; influenza vaccine; oligodeoxyribonucleotide; subunit vaccine; virus antigen; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antigen specificity; Article; cellular immunity; controlled study; in vivo study; infant; influenza; influenza vaccination; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; viral clearance; virus attenuation; virus immunity; acute disease; animal; C57BL mouse; human; immunological memory; immunology; immunosuppressive treatment; influenza; lymphocyte activation; Orthomyxoviridae; orthomyxovirus infection; physiology; regulatory T lymphocyte; secondary immunization; transgenic mouse; Acute Disease; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Animals; Antigens, Viral; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Humans; Immunization, Secondary; Immunologic Memory; Immunosuppression; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Orthomyxoviridae; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Vaccines, Subunit",2-s2.0-85042216681

We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with adefovir (ADV) or entecavir (ETV) followed by peginterferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2a in Taiwanese patients with HBeAg-positive. Methods: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted at nine sites in Taiwan from April 2010 to October 2013. Patients (N = 280) were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, ETV or ADV alone for four weeks, combined with PEG-IFN alfa-2a for two weeks, then PEG-IFN alfa-2a alone for 46 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was HBeAg seroconversion at 48 weeks post-treatment. Results: No significant differences were observed among groups for HBeAg seroconversion (PEG-IFN alfa-2a+placebo, 36.3%; PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ETV, 29.5%; and PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ADV, 27.4%), HBeAg loss (37.4%, 32.2%, and 28.6%, respectively) or change in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels from baseline (?0.56 IU/mL, ?0.60 IU/mL, and ?0.41 IU/mL, respectively). However, hepatitis B virus DNA levels were higher with PEG-IFN alfa-2a+placebo than PEG-IFN alfa+ETV at week 64 (p = 0.0412), 76 (p = 0.0311), and 88 (p = 0.0113), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization rate was higher with PEG-IFN alfa-2a+placebo than PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ADV (p = 0.0283) or PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ETV (p = 0.0369) at week 88. Sub-analysis of results revealed an association between on-treatment HBsAg and ALT levels and efficacy 48 weeks post-treatment. Safety was comparable among treatment groups. Conclusion: Pre-therapy with ADV or ETV followed by PEG-IFN alfa-2a is not superior to PEG-IFN alfa-2a monotherapy in Taiwanese patients with HBeAg-positive CHB.

It has recently been reported that the rs641738 C>T variant in the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing protein 7 (MBOAT7) gene increased severity of NAFLD in adults of European descent. We aimed to test the hypothesis that MBOAT7 rs641738 variant would increase hepatic steatosis and hepatocellular injury in obese children. Methods: A total of 831 obese children aged 7-15?years were recruited. Hepatic steatosis was measured by ultrasonography. Because PNPLA3 rs738409, GCKR rs780094 and TM6SF2 rs58542926 variants are known to confer susceptibility to NAFLD, we assessed the influence of MBOAT7 rs641738 on hepatic steatosis, and serum levels of CK-18 fragment (a biomarker of hepatocellular injury and apoptosis for NAFLD) after adjusting the effects of PNPLA3, GCKR and TM6SF2 polymorphisms. Results: Of the recruited obese children, 22.7% had hepatic steatosis. PNPLA3 rs738409, GCKR rs780094 and TM6SF2 rs58542926 variants were independent risk factors of hepatic steatosis and elevated ALT levels. In contrast, MBOAT7 rs641738 variants, neither heterozygous nor homozygous genotypes, were not associated with hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, lipid levels and liver enzymes. The multiple linear regression model revealed that after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index z score, PNPLA3 rs738409 and GCKR rs780094 variants, but not MBOAT7 rs641738, were associated with serum levels of CK-18 fragment. Conclusions: The variant MBOAT7 rs641738 genotype is not associated with hepatic steatosis and serum levels of CK-18 fragment in obese Taiwanese children. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Herein, we demonstrate a new approach toward lanthanide-doped UCNPs and a graphene hybrid planar and rippled structure photodetector. The multi-energy sublevels from the 4fn electronic configuration of lanthanides results in longer excited state lifetime for photogenerated charge carriers. This opens up a new regime for ultra-high-sensitivity and broadband photodetection. Under 808 nm infrared light illumination, the planar hybrid photodetector shows a photoresponsivity of 190 AW-1, which is higher than the currently reported responsivities of the same class of devices. Also, the rippled graphene and UCNPs hybrid photodetector on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrate exhibits an excellent stretchability, wearability, and durability with high photoresponsivity. This design makes a significant contribution to the ongoing research in the field of wearable and stretchable optoelectronic devices. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",broadband response; hybrid photodetectors; rippled graphene; stretchable optoelectronics; upconversion nanoparticles; wearable electronics,Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Energy conversion; Excited states; Nanoparticles; Optoelectronic devices; Photodetectors; Photons; Rare earth elements; Wearable technology; Broadband response; Electronic configuration; Excited state lifetimes; Hybrid photo detectors; Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles; Photogenerated charge carriers; Rippled graphene; Upconversion nanoparticles; Graphene,2-s2.0-85048742784

of mean and shape of blood pressure distribution to worldwide trends and variations in raised blood pressure: A pooled analysis of 1018 population-based measurement studies with 88.6 million participants,2018,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050702158&doi=10.1093%2fije%2fdyy016&partnerID=40&md5=a91bc1e3360052f9be6da75b1f479357,"Background: Change in the prevalence of raised blood pressure could be due to both shifts in the entire distribution of blood pressure (representing the combined effects of public health interventions and secular trends) and changes in its high-blood-pressure tail (representing successful clinical interventions to control blood pressure in the hypertensive population). Our aim was to quantify the contributions of these two phenomena to the worldwide trends in the prevalence of raised blood pressure. Methods: We pooled 1018 population-based studies with blood pressure measurements on 88.6 million participants from 1985 to 2016. We first calculated mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and prevalence of raised blood pressure by sex and 10-year age group from 20-29 years to 70-79 years in each study, taking into account complex survey design and survey sample weights, where relevant. We used a linear mixed effect model to quantify the association between (probittransformed) prevalence of raised blood pressure and age-group- and sex-specific mean blood pressure. We calculated the contributions of change in mean SBP and DBP, and of change in the prevalence-mean association, to the change in prevalence of raised blood pressure. Results: In 2005-16, at the same level of population mean SBP and DBP, men and women in South Asia and in Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa would have the highest prevalence of raised blood pressure, and men and women in the highincome Asia Pacific and high-income Western regions would have the lowest. In most region-sex-age groups where the prevalence of raised blood pressure declined, one half or more of the decline was due to the decline in mean blood pressure. Where prevalence of raised blood pressure has increased, the change was entirely driven by increasing mean blood pressure, offset partly by the change in the prevalence-mean association. Conclusions: Change in mean blood pressure is the main driver of the worldwide change in the prevalence of raised blood pressure, but change in the high-blood-pressure tail of the distribution has also contributed to the change in prevalence, especially in older age groups. ?

Herein, we have investigated the anti-obesity effects of two citrus peel extracts obtained via supercritical fluid extraction: PMF A, with a lower content of PMFs and HOPMFs, and PMF B, with a higher content of PMFs and HOPMFs. PMF A and PMF B were administered orally for 16 weeks to mice with high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. The results showed that PMF B decreased the lipid content more statistically significantly (p < 0.05) than PMF A in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, reduced the adipocyte size, decreased the adipose tissue weight and alleviated the total body weight in the HFD mice. Both PMF A and PMF B reduced the adipocyte size in the perigonadal fat by markedly decreasing the levels of lipid droplets (LD) and perilipin 1 protein and Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) expression. Compared to the case of the HFD group, PMF B altered the gut microbiota by increasing Prevotella and decreasing rc4-4 bacteria. The change in the composition of gut microbiota, the community of symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms, may determine the metabolic health and be responsible for the anti-obesity mechanism. Our results indicate that the citrus peel extracts decrease lipid accumulation both in vivo and in vitro and should be considered for the management of overweight and obesity conditions. ? 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Effluent treatment; Mammals; Microorganisms; Molecular weight; Proteins; Supercritical fluid extraction; Supercritical fluids; 3t3-l1 preadipocytes; Citrus peel extracts; Gut microbiota; Lipid accumulations; Lipid droplets; Pathogenic microorganisms; Polymethoxyflavones; Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins; Nutrition; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; plant extract; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; animal; bacterium; C57BL mouse; chemistry; Citrus; classification; drug effect; genetics; human; intestine flora; isolation and purification; lipid diet; male; metabolism; microbiology; mouse; obesity; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Bacteria; Citrus; Diet, High-Fat; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Plant Extracts; PPAR gamma; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1",2-s2.0-85048968345

In this study, the transketolase (TKT) expression correlated with tumor size in the 4T1/BALB/c syngeneic model. In addition, TKT expression was higher in lymph node metastases compared with primary tumor or normal tissues of patients, and high TKT levels were associated with poor survival. Depletion of TKT or addition of alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) enhanced the levels of tumor suppressors succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase (FH), decreasing oncometabolites succinate and fumarate, and further stabilizing HIF prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) and decreasing HIF1a, ultimately suppressing breast cancer metastasis. Reduced TKT or addition of aKG mediated a dynamic switch of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. Various combinations of the TKT inhibitor oxythiamine, docetaxel, and doxorubicin enhanced cell death in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Furthermore, oxythiamine treatment led to increased levels of aKG in TNBC cells. Together, our study has identified a novel TKT-mediated aKG signaling pathway that regulates breast cancer oncogenesis and can be exploited as a modality for improving therapy. Significance: These findings uncover the clinical significance of TKT in breast cancer progression and metastasis and demonstrate effective therapy by inhibiting TKT or by adding aKG. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"2 oxoglutaric acid; docetaxel; doxorubicin; fumarate hydratase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; hypoxia inducible factor proline dioxygenase; oxythiamine; transketolase; 2 oxoglutaric acid; fumarate hydratase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; transketolase; alpha ketoglutarate signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer growth; cancer survival; cell cycle progression; cell death; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; female; glucose metabolism; glycolysis; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; metastasis inhibition; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; protein analysis; protein depletion; protein expression; protein function; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; survival rate; triple negative breast cancer; tumor invasion; tumor volume; Western blotting; animal; Bagg albino mouse; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; physiology; SCID mouse; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Fumarate Hydratase; Glycolysis; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Ketoglutaric Acids; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Metastasis; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Transketolase; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85048040586

Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of generic VEL/SOF-based therapy for HCV infection in patients with or without HIV coinfection in Taiwan. Methods: Sixty-nine HIV/HCV-coinfected and 159 HCV-monoinfected patients receiving 12?weeks of generic VEL/SOF with or without ribavirin (RBV) for HCV were prospectively enrolled. The anti-viral responses and the adverse events (AEs) were compared between the two groups. The characteristics potentially related to sustained virological response 12?weeks off therapy (SVR12) were analysed. Results: The SVR12 was achieved in 67 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (97.1%; 95% CI: 90.0%-99.2%) and in 156 HCV-monoinfected patients (98.1%; 95% CI: 94.6%-99.4%) receiving VEL/SOF-based therapy, respectively. The SVR12 rates were comparable between HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected patients, regardless of pre-specified baseline characteristics. One hundred twenty-two (53.5%) and seven (3.1%) patients had baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in HCV NS5A and NS5B regions, but the SVR12 rates were not affected by the presence or absence of RASs. One (1.4%) and five (3.1%) patients in the HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected groups had serious AEs. No patient died or discontinued treatment due to AEs. The eGFR remained stable throughout the course of treatment in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Conclusions: Generic VEL/SOF-based therapy is well-tolerated and provides comparably high SVR12 rates for HCV infection in patients with and without HIV coinfection. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"alanine aminotransferase; antiretrovirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; atazanavir; bilirubin; efavirenz; emtricitabine; etravirine; generic drug; hemoglobin; lamivudine; nevirapine; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; nonstructural protein 5A; nonstructural protein 5B; proteinase inhibitor; ribavirin; rilpivirine; robatrol; sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir; sofosvel; tenofovir disoproxil; tipranavir; antivirus agent; carbamic acid derivative; fused heterocyclic rings; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; sofosbuvir-velpatasvir drug combination; tenofovir; adult; Article; bacterial peritonitis; blood toxicity; clavicle fracture; controlled study; coughing; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug fatality; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; esophagus varices bleeding; estimated glomerular filtration rate; fatigue; female; Gilbert disease; headache; hepatitis C; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hyperbilirubinemia; insomnia; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mixed infection; nausea; platelet count; priority journal; prospective study; pruritus; side effect; stomach varices bleeding; Taiwan; treatment response; aged; drug combination; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; isolation and purification; sustained virologic response; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Carbamates; Coinfection; Drug Combinations; Female; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ribavirin; Sofosbuvir; Sustained Virologic Response; Taiwan; Tenofovir; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85048031877

Currently, normative values for water-perfused HRIM systems for Chinese populations are lacking. Methods: Healthy volunteers were enrolled for comprehensive anthropometric measures, blood biochemistry tests, and an HRIM study using 22 water-perfused pressure sensors and 12 impedance channels. Ten 5-mL liquid swallows of saline at 30-second intervals were conducted. The following parameters were calculated: distal contractile integral (DCI), distal latency (DL), lower esophageal sphincter (LES) basal pressure, 4-second integrated relaxation pressure (IRP-4s), and complete bolus transit percentage. Normal values were established based on the 5th and 95th percentiles. Key Results: All 66 participants (34 male, 32 female, aged 21-64?years) completed the study and tolerated the HRIM procedure well. The upper normal limit (95th percentile) of IRP-4?second was 20?mmHg. The 5th-95th percentile range for DCI, DL, and complete bolus transit was 99-2186?mmHg●s●cm, 6.2-11.3?second, and 50%-100%, respectively. Age was negatively correlated with DL. Females had significantly higher upper limits for IRP-4s and median DCI than males. Multivariate analyses confirmed that IRP-4s was higher in females, and that higher body mass index and waist circumference were associated with reduced DL and better bolus transit, respectively. Conclusions and Inferences: We established normative values for the water-perfused HRIM system for a Chinese population. Gender and anthropometric factors may affect various major HRIM parameters and should be taken into account when interpreting HRIM results in clinical practice. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",anthropometrics; esophageal motility disorder; high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM); normative values; water-perfused,sodium chloride; water; water; adult; Article; blood biochemistry; body mass; Chinese; esophagus manometry; esophagus motility; esophagus pressure; female; high resolution impedance manometry; human; human experiment; latent period; lower esophagus sphincter; male; normal human; normal value; pilot study; priority journal; sex difference; smooth muscle contraction; smooth muscle relaxation; swallowing; waist circumference; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; esophagus; health survey; manometry; middle aged; physiology; procedures; reference value; young adult; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Deglutition; Esophagus; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Manometry; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Reference Values; Water; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85047852423

Methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched up to June 2017. All published or unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Two independent raters assessed the risk of bias of RCTs with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The primary outcome was Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles (VISA-A) score. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were used for random effect meta-analysis. Results: Seven RCTs were enrolled in meta-analysis. The ABP injection and placebo revealed equal effectiveness in VISA-A score improvement at 4 to 6 weeks (short term, WMD 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: ?1.69, 6.27), 12 weeks (medium term, WMD 2.63, 95% CI: ?1.72, 6.98), 24 weeks (long term, WMD 4.61, 95% CI: ?1.25, 10.47), and 48 weeks (very long term, WMD 4.16, 95% CI: ?6.82, 15.14). In meta-regression, there was no association between change in VISA-A score and duration of symptoms at 4 to 6 weeks (short term), 12 weeks (medium term), and 24 weeks (long term).

Adequate health literacy may be an important factor in the effective treatment and management of familial hypercholesterolemia, and may also be implicated in genetic screening for familial hypercholesterolemia among index cases. The present study examined the prevalence and predictors of health literacy in familial hypercholesterolemia patients attending clinics in seven countries. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: Consecutive FH patients attending clinics in Australia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan and the UK completed measures of demographic variables (age, gender, household income and highest education level) and a brief three-item health literacy scale. Results: Rates of inadequate health literacy were lowest in the UK (7.0%), Australia (10.0%), Hong Kong (15.7%) and Taiwan (18.0%) samples, with higher rates in the Brazil (22.0%), Malaysia (25.0%) and China (37.0%) samples. Income was an independent predictor of health literacy levels, accounting for effects of age. Health literacy was also independently related to China national group membership. Conclusions: Findings indicate non-trivial levels of inadequate health literacy in samples of familial hypercholesterolemia patients. Consistent with previous research in chronic illness, inadequate health literacy is related to income as an index of health disparities. Chinese familial hypercholesterolemia patients are more likely to have high rates of inadequate health literacy independent of income. Current findings highlight the imperative of education interventions targeting familial hypercholesterolemia patients with inadequate health literacy. ? 2018, The European Society of Cardiology 2018.",dyslipidemia; familial hypercholesterolemia; genetic screening; health disparities; Health literacy,"adult; age; Article; cross-sectional study; education; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; gender; health literacy; household income; human; information; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; questionnaire; aged; Asia; Asian continental ancestry group; attitude to health; Australia; clinical trial; epidemiology; ethnology; familial hypercholesterolemia; income; multicenter study; psychology; United Kingdom; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Asia; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Australia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Literacy; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85045051605

Recent recommendations from the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control to routinely use high inspired oxygen concentrations to reduce infection risk have been widely criticized. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of inspired oxygen on infection risk, including a recent large trial. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed. Primary analysis included all eligible trials. Sensitivity analyses distinguished studies of colorectal and non-colorectal surgeries, and excluded studies with high risk of bias. Another post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluded studies from one author that appear questionable. Results: The primary analysis included 26 trials (N=14,710). The RR [95%CI] for wound infection was 0.81 [0.70, 0.94] in the high vs. low inspired oxygen groups. The effect remained significant in colorectal patients (N=10,469), 0.79 [0.66, 0.96], but not in other patients (N=4,241), 0.86 [0.69, 1.09]. When restricting the analysis to studies with low risk of bias, either by strict inclusion criteria (N=5,047) or by researchers’ judgment (N=12,547), no significant benefit remained: 0.84 [0.67, 1.06] and 0.89 [0.76, 1.05], respectively. Conclusions: When considering all available data, intraoperative hyperoxia reduced wound infection incidence. However, no significant benefit remained when analysis was restricted to objective- or investigator-identified low-bias studies, although those analyses were not as well-powered. Meta-analysis of the most reliable studies does not suggest that supplemental oxygen substantively reduces wound infection risk, but more research is needed to fully answer this question. ? 2018 British Journal of Anaesthesia",anaesthesia; hyperoxia; meta-analysis; surgical wound infection,oxygen; anesthesia; colorectal surgery; human; hyperoxia; infection risk; intraoperative period; oxygen concentration; partial pressure; priority journal; Review; surgical infection; wound infection; meta analysis; oxygen therapy; peroperative care; procedures; statistical bias; surgical infection; Bias; Humans; Intraoperative Care; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Surgical Wound Infection,2-s2.0-85045008160

Patients who have advanced NSCLC that is especially aggressive, which is defined as disease that rapidly progresses on first-line treatment or disease that is refractory to first-line treatment, have a critical unmet medical need. These patients have a poor prognosis in the second-line setting. Several studies have recently shown that treatment with an antiangiogenic therapy may benefit these patients. This review summarizes the approved antiangiogenic therapies for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC in the second-line setting, specifically focusing on the outcomes from subgroups of patients with rapidly progressing or refractory disease. Several antiangiogenic agents, as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments, have been or are currently being studied in patients with advanced NSCLC. Antiangiogenics that are approved for use in patients with advanced NSCLC are limited to bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (nonsquamous NSCLC), ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel (all histologies), and nintedanib in combination with docetaxel (adenocarcinoma histology). This review focuses on the efficacy, safety, and quality of life outcomes in the subpopulation of patients with rapidly progressing or refractory NSCLC treated with approved antiangiogenic therapies in the second-line setting. We also discuss the impact of newly approved immunotherapy agents on the outcomes of patients with aggressive or refractory disease. Studies in progress and planned future research will determine if combination treatment with antiangiogenics and immunotherapies will benefit patients with aggressive, advanced NSCLC. ? 2018",Angiogenesis; Immunotherapy; Nintedanib; Non-small-cell lung cancer; Ramucirumab,"bevacizumab; docetaxel; nintedanib; ramucirumab; tumor marker; angiogenesis inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; antiangiogenic therapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer patient; cancer survival; drug efficacy; drug safety; human; monotherapy; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; progression free survival; Review; side effect; animal; cancer staging; disease exacerbation; drug resistance; immunotherapy; lung; lung tumor; multimodality cancer therapy; neovascularization (pathology); non small cell lung cancer; pathology; procedures; quality of life; treatment outcome; vascularization; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease Progression; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Immunotherapy; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Neoplasm Staging; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85044959258

Part one of both studies is reported. Methods: In the itraconazole study (NCT02157883), patients received single-dose osimertinib 80?mg on Days 1 and 10 and itraconazole (200?mg twice daily) on Days 6–18 orally. In the rifampicin study (NCT02197247), patients received osimertinib 80?mg once daily on Days 1–77 and rifampicin 600?mg once daily on Days 29–49. Results: In the itraconazole study (n?=?36), the geometric least squares mean (GMLSM) ratios (osimertinib plus itraconazole/osimertinib alone) for C max and AUC were 80% (90% CI 73, 87) and 124% (90% CI 115, 135), respectively, below the predefined no-effect upper limit of 200%. In the rifampicin study (n?=?40), the GMLSM ratios (osimertinib plus rifampicin/osimertinib alone) for C ss,max and AUCτ were 27% (90% CI 24, 30) and 22% (90% CI 20, 24), respectively, below the predefined no-effect lower limit of 50%. The induction effect of rifampicin was apparent within 7 days of initiation; osimertinib C ss,max and AUCτ values returned to pre-rifampicin levels within 3 weeks of rifampicin discontinuation. No new osimertinib safety findings were observed.

In this study, we obtained evidence that mutant KRAS transcriptionally activates IGF-IR gene expression through Y-box-binding protein (YB)-1 upregulation via a novel MEK-Sp1-DNMT1-miR-137 pathway in CRC cells. The mechanistic link between the tumor suppressive miR-137 and the translational regulation of YB-1 is intriguing because epigenetic silencing of miR-137 represents an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis due to promoter hypermethylation. This proposed signaling axis was further verified by the immunohistochemical evaluations of liver metastases from a cohort of 46 KRAS mutant CRC patients, which showed a significant correlation in the expression levels among Sp1, miR-137, YB-1, and IGF-1R. Moreover, suppression of the expression of YB-1 and IGF-IR via genetic knockdown or the pharmacological inhibition of MEK hampers KRAS-driven colorectal liver metastasis in our animal model studies. From a translational perspective, the identification of this KRAS-driven pathway might provide a mechanistic rationale for the use of a MEK inhibitor as an adjuvant, in combination with standard of care, to prevent the recurrence of colorectal liver metastasis in KRAS mutant CRC patients after receiving liver resection, which warrants further investigation. ? 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"binimetinib; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; K ras protein; microRNA; microRNA 137; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase; mutant protein; somatomedin C receptor; transcription factor Sp1; unclassified drug; Y box binding protein 1; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; DNMT1 protein, human; KRAS protein, human; MAP2K1 protein, human; microRNA; MIRN137 microRNA, human; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1; protein p21; Sp1 protein, human; transcription factor Sp1; tumor marker; Y box binding protein 1; YBX1 protein, human; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; clinical article; colon carcinogenesis; controlled study; DNA methylation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme regulation; epigenetics; gene expression; gene knockdown; gene silencing; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; liver metastasis; metastatic colorectal cancer; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein function; randomized controlled trial; receptor upregulation; signal transduction; transcription initiation; transcription regulation; translation regulation; upregulation; animal; apoptosis; Bagg albino mouse; cell motion; cell proliferation; colorectal tumor; drug screening; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; liver tumor; metabolism; mutation; nude mouse; pathology; secondary; tumor cell culture; Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Kinase 1; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Mutation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Sp1 Transcription Factor; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Y-Box-Binding Protein 1",2-s2.0-85044208683

Further, the complexes demonstrated promising antibacterial properties against Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains, especially complex 18 displayed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 and 4 μg/mL against S. aureus and E. coli, and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Furthermore, complexes 14, 15, 16 and 18 were found cytotoxic against the human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1975 with the IC 50 (concentration of the test sample required to kill 50% of the cell population) value under 10 μM, while mono–NHC complex 20 displayed a potential drug window with the IC 50 of 13.7 ± 2.70 and 14.5 ± 1.20 μM against the cancer cell lines H1975 and A549, respectively. Notably, these complexes displayed relatively lesser cytotoxic behaviour against the normal skin fibroblast cell line, Hs68. All the NHC precursors displayed significantly lower biological activities compared with their respective complexes, indicating the utility of silver(I) ions in antimicrobial and antilung cancer applications. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",4–Bromomethylcoumarin; Antilung–cancer activity; E. coli; N–heterocyclic carbene; Silver(I) complex; X–ray diffraction,"1 benzyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) acetate; 1 benzyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazolium hexafluorophosphate; 1 butyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) acetate; 1 butyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazolium hexafluorophosphate; 1 ethyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) acetate; 1 ethyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazolium bromide; 1 hexyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) acetate; 1 hexyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazolium hexafluorophosphate; 1 pentyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) acetate; 1 pentyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazolium hexafluorophosphate; 1 propyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl) methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) acetate; 1 propyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazolium hexafluorophosphate; antibiotic agent; antineoplastic agent; benzimidazole derivative; bis [1 benzyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) hexafluorophosphate; bis[1 butyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) hexafluorophosphate; bis[1 ethyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) hexafluorophosphate; bis[1 hexyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl) methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) hexafluorophosphate; bis[1 pentyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver(i) hexafluorophosphate; bis[1 propyl 3 [(6 methyl 2 oxo 2h chromen 4 yl)methyl] benzimidazol 2 ylidenesilver hexafluorophosphate; coumarin derivative; silver derivative; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; benzimidazole; benzimidazole derivative; coumarin; coumarin derivative; A-549 cell line; antibacterial activity; antineoplastic activity; Article; bromination; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; comparative study; crystal structure; drug cytotoxicity; drug potency; drug screening; drug synthesis; Escherichia coli; Hs 683 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; minimum inhibitory concentration; NCI-H1975 cell line; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; structure activity relation; X ray diffraction; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effect; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; microbial sensitivity test; tumor cell line; A549 Cells; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Benzimidazoles; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Coumarins; Escherichia coli; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Structure; Staphylococcus aureus",2-s2.0-85043369520

This presumed favorable cost-benefit relationship is encouraging and lends support to expanded implementation of FLS per International Osteoporosis Foundation Best Practice Standards. This study summarizes the economic impact and cost-effectiveness of FLS implemented to reduce subsequent fractures in individuals with osteoporosis. This systematic review identified studies reporting economic outcomes for FLS in osteoporotic patients aged 50 and older through a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and PubMed of studies published January, 2000 to December, 2016. Grey literature (e.g., Google scholar, conference abstracts/posters) were also hand searched through February 2017. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and conducted full-text review on qualified articles. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between reviewers to reach consensus or by a third reviewer. In total, 23 qualified studies that evaluated the economic aspects of FLS were included: 16 cost-effectiveness studies, 2 cost-benefit analyses, and 5 studies of cost savings. Patient populations varied (prior fragility fracture, non-vertebral fracture, hip fracture, wrist fracture), and FLS strategies ranged from mail-based interventions to comprehensive nurse/physician-coordinated programs. Cost-effectiveness studies were conducted in Canada, Australia, USA, UK, Japan, Taiwan, and Sweden. FLS was cost-effective in comparisons with usual care or no treatment, regardless of the program intensity or the country in which the FLS was implemented (cost/QALY from $3023–$28,800 US dollars (USD) in Japan to $14,513–$112,877 USD in USA. Several studies documented cost savings. FLS, implemented in different ways and countries, are reported to be cost-effective or even cost-saving.

This study aimed at validating its application in real CPR scenarios and the potential impact on CPR outcomes. Methods: The US-CAB protocol was implemented at the emergency department of National Taiwan University Hospital since January 2016. The US images, initiation time and operation duration of each US-CAB procedure, and relevant CPR information were recorded for analysis. Results: From January 2016 to March 2017, 177 cardiac arrest patients receiving US-CAB were included. The durations of US-C-A-B procedure were 9.0 ± 1.4, 7.5 ± 1.5, and 16.0 ± 1.9 s, respectively. Cardiac activity was identified in 47 cases (26.6%), with higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (95.7% vs. 21.5%, p <.0001) and survival to hospital discharge (25.5% vs. 10.0%, p <.01). Detection of cardiac activity after 10 min of CPR exhibited 100% sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for ROSC. Cardiac tamponade was noted in eight patients. ROSC was achieved in two (25.0%) after pericardiocentesis, and aortic dissection was diagnosed in one (12.5%). Confirmation of correct intubation was significantly faster by US than by capnography (7.4 ± 1.4 vs. 38.3 ± 110.2 s, p <.001). US detected 21 (11.9%) esophageal intubations and 3 (1.7%) one-lung intubations. All were promptly corrected. Conclusion: The US-CAB protocol is feasible in real CPR scenarios. It confers diagnostic value and prognostic implications which potentially impact the efficacy and outcomes of CPR. However, a future prospective multi-center study to validate its feasibility and indicate the need of structured training is mandated. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cardiac arrest; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Outcome; Ultrasound,"adult; airway; aortic dissection; Article; breathing; capnometry; circulation; clinical evaluation; clinical protocol; echocardiography; emergency ward; endotracheal intubation; esophagus intubation; female; hospital discharge; human; major clinical study; male; medical information; observational study; operation duration; out of hospital cardiac arrest; outcome assessment; patient care; pericardiocentesis; priority journal; prospective study; resuscitation; return of spontaneous circulation; sensitivity and specificity; survival rate; aged; breathing; circulation; diagnostic imaging; echography; emergency health service; feasibility study; middle aged; mortality; out of hospital cardiac arrest; predictive value; procedures; respiration control; resuscitation; time factor; validation study; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Airway Management; Blood Circulation; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Emergency Medical Services; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Respiration; Time Factors; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-85041533677

Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial. Participants diagnosed with heart failure were recruited from two large medical centers in northern Taiwan. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention (n=39) or control (n=41) groups. Patients in the intervention group underwent a 12-week Baduanjin exercise program, which included Baduanjin exercise three times per week for 12 weeks at home, a 35-minute Baduanjin exercise demonstration video, a picture-based educational brochure, and a performance record form. The control group received usual care and received no intervention. Fatigue and quality of life were assessed using a structural questionnaire at baseline, four weeks, eight weeks, and 12 weeks after the intervention. Results: Participants in the Baduanjin exercise group showed significant improvement in fatigue (F=5.08, p=0.009) and quality of life (F=9.11, p=0.001) over time from baseline to week 12 after the intervention. Those in the control group showed significantly worse fatigue (F=3.46, p=0.033) over time from baseline to week 12 and no significant changes in quality of life (F=0.70, p=0.518). Compared to the control group, the exercise group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in fatigue and quality of life at four weeks, eight weeks, and 12 weeks.

Corifollitropin alfa has never been studied in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients because of concerns of excessive ovarian stimulation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The purpose of the study was to evaluate if corifollitropin alfa can be used in PCOS patients. Methods: Forty PCOS patients who were going to undergo in vitro fertilization were enrolled in this study. A single injection of corifollitropin alfa was administered on cycle day 2 or day 3. From stimulation day 8 onwards, daily FSH was administered until the day of final oocyte maturation. Cetrorelix was administered from stimulation day 5 to prevent premature LH surge. Final oocyte maturation was triggered by: acetate. All embryos were cryopreserved and replaced in subsequent cycles. Results: All 40 patients were subjected to oocyte retrieval, and none developed moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (0%, 95% CI 0–0.088). For each patient, an average of 23.4 (±7.4; 95% CI 21.0–25.7) oocytes were retrieved and a mean of 11.7 (±6.4; 95% CI 9.6–13.8) embryos were frozen. Mean serum estradiol level on the day of GnRHa triggering was 7829.9 pg/ml (±3297; 95% CI 6775–8885). The cumulated ongoing pregnancy rate after 3 frozen-thawed embryo transfers was 75.0% (95% CI 61.6%–88.4%).

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of OSF. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF or CCN2) and early growth response-1 (Egr-1) are important mediators in the fibrotic response to TGFβ in several fibrotic disorders including OSF. Arecoline, a major AN alkaloid, induced the synthesis of CCN2 and Egr-1 in human buccal mucosal fibroblast (BMFs). The aims of this study were to investigate whether arecoline-induced CCN2 and Egr-1 syntheses are mediated through TGFβ1 signaling and to inspect the detailed mechanisms involved. Methods: Western blot and TGFβ1 Emax? ImmunoAssay were used to measure the effect of arecoline on the TGFβ signaling pathways. 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and MitoSOX? Red were used to measure the effect of arecoline on the cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Results: Arecoline induced latent TGFβ1 activation, Smad2 phosphorylation, and mitochondrial and total cellular ROS in BMFs. TGFβ-neutralizing antibody completely inhibited the arecoline-induced synthesis of CCN2 and Egr-1. Mito-TEMPO, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, completely suppressed arecoline-induced latent TGFβ1 activation and mitochondrial and total cellular ROS. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) dose-dependently inhibited arecoline-induced TGFβ1 activation and mitochondrial ROS in BMFs. Conclusion: Our results indicated that arecoline-induced mitochondrial ROS plays pivotal roles in the activation of latent TGFβ1 leading to the initiation of TGFβ1 signaling and subsequent increase in the synthesis of CCN2 and Egr-1. EGCG can be a useful agent in the chemoprevention and treatment of OSF. ? 2017",Areca nut chewing; EGCG; Fibroblast; Oral submucous fibrosis; TGFβ,"arecoline; connective tissue growth factor; dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; epigallocatechin gallate; neutralizing antibody; reactive oxygen metabolite; Smad2 protein; transcription factor Egr 1; transforming growth factor beta1; arecoline; catechin; connective tissue growth factor; CTGF protein, human; early growth response factor 1; EGR1 protein, human; epigallocatechin gallate; plant extract; reactive oxygen metabolite; Smad2 protein; SMAD2 protein, human; TGFB1 protein, human; transforming growth factor beta1; antioxidant activity; Article; buccal mucosa; concentration response; fibroblast; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoassay; immunoreactivity; mitochondrion; mouth disease; protein induction; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; TGF beta signaling; Western blotting; analogs and derivatives; Areca; cell culture; chemically induced; drug effect; fibroblast; genetics; metabolism; mitochondrion; mouth disease; mouth mucosa; pathology; phosphorylation; poisonous plant; signal transduction; Areca; Arecoline; Blotting, Western; Catechin; Cells, Cultured; Connective Tissue Growth Factor; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Fibroblasts; Humans; Immunoassay; Mitochondria; Mouth Mucosa; Oral Submucous Fibrosis; Phosphorylation; Plant Extracts; Plants, Toxic; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Smad2 Protein; Transforming Growth Factor beta1",2-s2.0-85023642472

The accumulation of GAGs in lysosomes results in cellular dysfunction and clinical abnormalities. The early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) can slow or prevent the development of severe clinical manifestations. MPS I and II newborn screening has been available in Taiwan since August 2015. Infants who failed the recheck at recall were referred to MacKay Memorial Hospital for a detailed confirmatory diagnosis. Methods: From August 2015 to November 2017, 294,196 and 153,032 infants were screened using tandem mass spectrometry for MPS I and MPS II, respectively. Of these infants, 84 suspected cases (eight for MPS I; 76 for MPS II) were referred for confirmation. Urinary first-line biochemistry examinations were performed first, including urinary GAG quantification, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and tandem mass spectrometry assay for predominant disaccharides derived from GAGs. If the results were positive, a confirmative diagnosis was made according to the results of leukocyte enzymatic assay and molecular DNA analysis. Leukocyte pellets were isolated from EDTA blood and used for fluorescent α-iduronidase (IDUA) or iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) enzymatic assay. DNA sequencing analysis was also performed. Results: Normal IDS and IDUA enzyme activities were found in most of the referred cases except for four who were strongly suspected of having MPS I and three who were strongly suspected of having MPS II. Of these infants, three with novel mutations of the IDS gene (c.817C > T, c.1025A > G, and c.311A > T) and four with two missense mutations of the IDUA gene (C.300-3C > G, c.1874A > C; c.1037 T > G, c.1091C > T) showed significant deficiencies in IDS and IDUA enzyme activities (< 5% of mean normal activity), respectively. Urinary dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate quantitative analyses by tandem mass spectrometry also demonstrated significant elevations. The prevalence rates of MPS I and MPS II in Taiwan were 1.35 and 1.96 per 100,000 live births, respectively. Conclusions: The early initiation of ERT for MPS can result in better clinical outcomes.

It is the primary crustacean used in North America for sediment toxicity testing and an emerging model for molecular ecotoxicology. To provide molecular resources for sediment quality assessments and evolutionary studies, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genome of the H. azteca U.S. Lab Strain. The genome quality and completeness is comparable with other ecotoxicological model species. Through targeted investigation and use of gene expression data sets of H. azteca exposed to pesticides, metals, and other emerging contaminants, we annotated and characterized the major gene families involved in sequestration, detoxification, oxidative stress, and toxicant response. Our results revealed gene loss related to light sensing, but a large expansion in chemoreceptors, likely underlying sensory shifts necessary in their low light habitats. Gene family expansions were also noted for cytochrome P450 genes, cuticle proteins, ion transporters, and include recent gene duplications in the metal sequestration protein, metallothionein. Mapping of differentially expressed transcripts to the genome significantly increased the ability to functionally annotate toxicant responsive genes. The H. azteca genome will greatly facilitate development of genomic tools for environmental assessments and promote an understanding of how evolution shapes toxicological pathways with implications for environmental and human health.

However, intestinal mucositis remains a common adverse effect for which no effective preventive strategies are available. To develop a convenient and novel way to alleviate mucositis, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus (Lcr35) on FOLFOX-induced mucosal injury. BALB/c mice subcutaneously injected with syngeneic CT26 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were orally administered Lcr35 daily before, during, and after 5-day injection of FOLFOX regimen, for 14 days. The following methods were used: diarrhea score for toxicity, ELISA for cytokine production, histopathology for intestinal injury, immunohistochemistry for apoptosis/proliferation and regulatory proteins, RT-PCR for cytokine mRNA expression, and DNA sequencing for fecal gut microbiota. FOLFOX administration to colorectal cancer-bearing mice significantly inhibited tumor growth and the accompanying marked diarrhea and intestinal injury histologically characterized by the shortening of villi and destruction of intestinal crypts. Preventive administration of Lcr35 dose-dependently reduced the severity of diarrhea and intestinal mucositis without affecting the anti-tumor effect of FOLFOX. The numbers of apoptotic, NF-κB-, and BAX-activated cells increased after FOLFOX, and these responses were mitigated by Lcr35. TNF-α and IL-6 upregulation by FOLFOX treatment was attenuated by Lcr35. The fecal gut microbiota composition of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes disturbed by FOLFOX was significantly reversed by Lcr35 toward a preferential profile. In conclusion, the oral probiotic Lcr35 prevented FOLFOX-induced intestinal mucositis in colorectal cancer-bearing mice. The putative mechanism might involve modulation of gut microbiota and proinflammatory responses with suppression of intrinsic apoptosis in intestinal injury. ? 2018 Chang, Liu, Lee, Huang, Li, Chiang Chiau, Wang, Chu, Shih, Tsai and Chen.",Apoptosis; FOLFOX; Gut microbiota; Intestinal mucositis; Lactobacillus,F7878; fluorouracil; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; oxaliplatin; probiotic agent; tumor necrosis factor; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; Bacteroidetes; cancer chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; cytokine production; diarrhea; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Firmicutes; gene expression; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; intestine crypt; intestine flora; intestine injury; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; male; minimum inhibitory concentration; mouse; mRNA expression level; mucosa inflammation; nonhuman; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation,2-s2.0-85047020279

Second, to explore illness perceptions as a mediator of the association between congenital heart disease (CHD) diagnosis and QOL. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Twenty-four cardiology centers from 15 countries across five continents. Patients: Four hundred thirty-five adult patients with congenital heart disease (177 Fontan and 258 ASD/VSD) ages 18-83 years. Outcome Measures: QOL and illness perceptions were assessed by the Satisfaction With Life Scale and the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire, respectively. Results: Patients with a Fontan circulation reported lower QOL (Wald Z = ?3.59, p = <.001) and more negative perceptions of their CHD (Wald Z = ?7.66, p <.001) compared with patients with ASD/VSD. After controlling for demographics, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and New York Heart Association functional class, path analyses revealed a significant mediation model, αβ = 0.15, p =.002, 95% CI = 0.06-0.25, such that CHD diagnosis was indirectly related to QOL through illness perceptions. Conclusions: The Fontan sample's more negative perceptions of CHD were likely a reflection of life with a more complex defect. Illness perceptions appear to account for unique differences in QOL between groups of varying CHD complexity. Psychosocial screening and interventions may be important treatment components for patients with CHD, particularly those with Fontan circulations. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",congenital heart disease; Fontan circulation; illness perceptions; quality of life,"adult; age; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire; cardiovascular disease assessment; congenital heart disease; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; female; Fontan procedure; heart atrium septum defect; heart ventricle septum defect; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; New York Heart Association class; observational study; patient-reported outcome; quality of life; Satisfaction with Life Scale; sex difference; adolescent; attitude to health; child; clinical trial; comparative study; congenital heart malformation; global health; middle aged; morbidity; perception; psychology; quality of life; trends; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Health; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Global Health; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Perception; Quality of Life; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85048272375

Hypertensive small vessel disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and hereditary causes, such as Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), constitute the three common cSVD categories. Diagnosing the underlying vascular pathology in these patients is important because the risk and types of recurrent strokes show significant differences. Recent advances in our understanding of the cSVD-related radiological markers have improved our ability to stratify ICH risk in individual patients, which helps guide antithrombotic decisions. There are general good-practice measures for stroke prevention in patients with cSVD, such as optimal blood pressure and glycemic control, while individualized measures tailored for particular patients are often needed. Antithrombotic combinations and anticoagulants should be avoided in cSVD treatment, as they increase the risk of potentially fatal ICH without necessarily lowering LI risk in these patients. Even when indicated for a concurrent pathology, such as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, nonpharmacological approaches should be considered in the presence of cSVD. More data are emerging regarding the presentation, clinical course, and diagnostic markers of hereditary cSVD, allowing accurate diagnosis, and therefore, guiding management of symptomatic patients. When suspicion for asymptomatic hereditary cSVD exists, the pros and cons of prescribing genetic testing should be discussed in detail in the absence of any curative treatment. Recent data regarding diagnosis, risk stratification, and specific preventive approaches for both sporadic and hereditary cSVDs are discussed in this review article. ? 2018 Korean Stroke Society.",Cerebral hemorrhage; Ischemic stroke; Lacunar; Small vessel disease; Stroke,anticoagulant agent; homocysteine; anticoagulation; atrial fibrillation; blood pressure; brain hemorrhage; CADASIL; cerebrovascular disease; computer assisted tomography; diabetes mellitus; glycemic control; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; kidney failure; lacunar stroke; liver failure; prophylaxis; Review; vascular amyloidosis; vascular disease,2-s2.0-85047927631

We sought to explore whether the current practices of prescribing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for ACS and clinical outcomes have improved over time. Methods: A total of 1534 consecutive diabetic patients with ACS were enrolled between 2013 and 2015 from 27 hospitals in the nationwide registry initiated by the Taiwan Society of Cardiology (the TSOC ACS-DM Registry). Baseline and clinical demographics, treatment, and clinical outcomes were compared to those of 1000 ACS patients with DMrecruited in the Taiwan ACS-full spectrum (ACS-FS) Registry, whichwas performed between 2008 and 2010. Results: Compared to the DMpatients in the Taiwan ACS-FS Registry, even though reperfusion therapy was carried out in significantly fewer patients, the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) rate for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and the prescription rates of GDMT for ACS including P2Y12 inhibitors, renin-angiotensin blockers, beta-blockers, and statins were significantly higher in those in the TSOC ACS-DM Registry. Moreover, significant reductions in 1-year mortality, recurrent nonfatal MI and stroke were observed compared to those of the DM patients in the Taiwan ACS-FS Registry. Multivariate analysis identified reperfusion therapy in combination with GDMT as a strong predictor of better 1-year outcomes [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.54 (0.33-0.89)]. Conclusions: Marked improvements in performing primary PCI for STEMI and prescribing GDMT for ACS were observed over time in Taiwan. This was associated with improved 1-year event-free survival in the diabetic patients with ACS. ? 2018, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

The management of ACS has evolved considerably over recent years with the development of new and more potent antiplatelet agents. Clinical trials on ACS have demonstrated that potent antiplatelet agents can more effectively reduce cardiovascular events. However, there is a tipping point between safety and efficacy, beyond which the risk of bleeding and other adverse effects can outweigh the benefits of antiplatelet therapy. Striking a balance between safety and efficacy remains a major challenge. A consensus meeting of an expert panel composed of Taiwanese experts was held to provide recommendations for the management of adverse effects in patients with ACS receiving antiplatelet therapy. The common adverse effects of antiplatelet therapy include upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ecchymosis, hematuria, epistaxis and ticagrelor-related dyspnea.

The prevalence of OSA based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 1, 1.5, 2, 5, and 10 event/h was estimated using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted for children in different countries, sample size, study year, and risk of bias. Finally, the prevalence of OSA was compared between two types of sleep studies (polysomnography versus polygraphy). Results: A total of 18 studies (1,200 children) were included (mean age: 7.7 years; 56% boys; mean sample size: 67 patients). Five studies had low risk of bias, and nine and four studies had moderate and high risk of bias, respectively. The OSA was evaluated through polygraphy in 2 studies, and polysomnography in 16 studies. For children who underwent polysomnography, the prevalences of OSA based on AHI > 1, 1.5, 2, 5, and 10 events/h were 69%, 76%, 75%, 50%, and 34%, respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed no signifcant difference among all subgroups. Meta-regression showed that AHI > 5 events/h was inversely correlated with age (P < .001). Moreover, the prevalence of OSA based on AHI > 1.5 events/h was lower in polygraphy compared with polysomnography (59% versus 76%, P = .037).

Data on patient characteristics and treatment courses were collected. In total, 259 patients were enrolled (median follow-up, 22.0 months). Of them, 82 (31.7%) were identified to have brain metastases at baseline, which were associated with poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, high incidence of central nervous system progression, and short overall survival. However, the results of our analysis showed that overall survival was not affected by reductions in the afatinib dosage or any upfront local treatments for brain tumors. Multivariate analyses showed that brain metastases at diagnosis and treatment response to afatinib are two important prognostic factors for the overall survival of patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma. ?

To date, it is not well understood what key regulator might coordinate signaling pathways to achieve inflammatory response in TNF-α-stimulated ECs. This study investigated the role of dual specificity phosphatase-6 (DUSP6) in the regulation of endothelial inflammation. Using knockout mice, we found that DUSP6 is important for TNF-α-induced endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in aorta and in vein. Moreover, genetic deletion of Dusp6 in pulmonary circulation significantly alleviated the susceptibility of mice to lung injury caused by neutrophil recruitment during experimental sepsis induced by TNF-α or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The role of DUSP6 was further investigated in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Employing RNAi approach in which endogenous DUSP6 was ablated, we showed a critical function of DUSP6 to facilitate TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression and endothelial leukocyte interaction. Interestingly, DUSP6-promoted?endothelial inflammation is independent of extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. On the other hand, inducible DUSP6 leads to activation of canonical nuclear factor (NF)-κB-mediated transcription of ICAM-1 gene in TNF-α-stimulated human ECs. These results are the first to demonstrate a positive role of DUSP6 in endothelial inflammation-mediated pathological process and the underlying mechanism through which DUSP6 promotes NF-κB signaling in the inflamed ECs. Our findings suggest that manipulation of DUSP6 holds great potential for the treatment of acute inflammatory diseases. ? 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies",DUSP6; endothelial inflammation; ERK; NF-κB; septic lung injury,"dual specificity phosphatase 6; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; lipopolysaccharide; tumor necrosis factor; dual specificity phosphatase 6; DUSP6 protein, human; Dusp6 protein, mouse; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; lipopolysaccharide; mitogen activated protein kinase; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal tissue; aorta; controlled study; DUSP6 gene; Editorial; embryo; enzyme specificity; experimental sepsis; gene; gene deletion; gene expression; human; human cell; HUVEC cell line; ICAM 1 gene; in vivo study; inflammation; leukocyte; lung circulation; lung injury; MAPK signaling; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; vascular endothelial cell; vein; acute lung injury; adoptive transfer; animal; biosynthesis; cell adhesion; deficiency; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; inferior cava vein; inflammation; metabolism; neutrophil chemotaxis; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; reporter gene; U-937 cell line; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vascular endothelium; whole body radiation; Acute Lung Injury; Adoptive Transfer; Animals; Aorta; Cell Adhesion; Chemotaxis, Leukocyte; Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6; Endothelium, Vascular; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Reporter; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Lipopolysaccharides; Mice; Neutrophil Infiltration; NF-kappa B; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; U937 Cells; Vena Cava, Inferior; Whole-Body Irradiation",2-s2.0-85044224500

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to determine the characteristics of an FLS that lead to improved patient outcomes. We conducted a SLR, including articles published between 2000 and February 2017, using global (Medline, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane Library) and local databases. Studies including patients aged ? 50?years with osteoporotic fractures enrolled in an FLS were assessed. Information extracted from each article included key person coordinating the FLS (physician, nurse or other healthcare professional), setting (hospital vs community), intensity (single vs multiple), duration (long vs short term), fracture type and gender. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was conducted based on the key person coordinating the FLS. Out of 7236 articles, 57 were considered to be high quality and identified for further analysis. The SLR identified several components which contributed to FLS success, including multidisciplinary involvement, driven by a dedicated case manager, regular assessment and follow-up, multifaceted interventions and patient education. Meta-analytic data confirm the effectiveness of an FLS following an osteoporotic fracture: approximate 27% increase in the likelihood of BMD testing and up to 21% increase in the likelihood of treatment initiation compared with usual care. The balance of evidence indicates that the multifaceted FLS and dedicated coordination are important success factors that contribute to effective FLS interventions which reduce fracture-related morbidity and mortality. ? 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Fracture liaison service; Intervention; Osteoporosis,"bone density; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; disease classification; evidence based practice; follow up; fracture liaison service; fragility fracture; health care personnel; health program; health service; human; intention to treat analysis; patient care; patient education; practice guideline; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; sex difference; systematic review; time to treatment; treatment outcome; fragility fracture; health care quality; integrated health care system; meta analysis; organization and management; osteoporosis; secondary prevention; bone density conservation agent; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Humans; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic Fractures; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Secondary Prevention",2-s2.0-85043399201

This study elucidates the epidemiology and postoperative hemorrhage of inpatient tonsillectomies in Taiwanese children. Methods: This study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for analysis. From 1997 to 2012, all in-hospital children (aged <18 years) who underwent tonsillectomies were identified through the International Codes of Diseases (9th Revision). Incidence rates and trends of inpatient pediatric tonsillectomies during the study period were identified. Major complications, including readmission, reoperation, and mortality were identified. The factors associated with major complications were analyzed. Results: From 1997 to 2012, 17326 children received inpatient tonsillectomies (mean age, 8.6 ± 3.8 y; 65% boys). The overall incidence rate was 20.6 per 100,000 children. The incidence rate was highest in children who were 6–8 years of age, and boys exhibited a higher rate than girls (P < 0.001). Longitudinal data indicated that the incidence rate increased from 1997 (15.7/100,000 children) to 2012 (19.2/100,000 children) (P trend < 0.001). The proportions of readmission for any reason, readmission for bleeding, and reoperation were 1.8%, 0.9%, and 0.3%, respectively. No mortality occurred within 30 days of the tonsillectomy. A multivariable logistic model indicated that toddlers were associated with an increased risk of readmission for any reason (OR, 2.70; 95% CI 1.60–4.56), and adolescents were at risk of bleeding-related readmission (OR, 2.81; 95% CI 1.91–4.14) and reoperation (OR, 2.86; 95% CI 1.47–5.55). Children with comorbidities (OR, 3.14; 95% CI 1.93–5.09) or a surgical indication of tumor (OR, 11.73; 95% CI 4.93–27.91) had a higher risk of readmission. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids is associated with an increased risk of readmission or reoperation. Moreover, concurrent procedures (i.e., adenoidectomy, ear surgery, or nasal surgery) did not increase the risk of readmission or reoperation. Conclusions: The incidence rate and indications of obstructive sleep disorders for inpatient pediatric tonsillectomy increased during 1997–2012 in Taiwan. Postoperative readmission and reoperation were rare. Age, surgical indication, comorbidities, and drug administration were associated with readmission or reoperation in this study cohort. ? 2018",Child; Postoperative complications; Sleep apnea syndromes; Tonsillectomy,"nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; steroid; adenoidectomy; age; Article; child; cohort analysis; comorbidity; ear surgery; epidemiological data; female; hospital patient; hospital readmission; human; ICD-9; incidence; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; nose surgery; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; reoperation; risk factor; sex difference; sleep disordered breathing; surgical mortality; Taiwan; tonsillectomy; treatment indication; trend study; adolescent; factual database; hospital patient; infant; length of stay; palatine tonsil; postoperative hemorrhage; preschool child; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; surgery; tonsillectomy; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Inpatients; Length of Stay; Male; Palatine Tonsil; Patient Readmission; Postoperative Hemorrhage; Reoperation; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Tonsillectomy",2-s2.0-85042313571

In response to glucose restriction, we found that nuclear translocation of the glycolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), helped cancer cells survive under the metabolic stress. Restriction of glucose stimulated AMPK activation and resulted in co-translocation of AMPK and PKM2 through Ran-mediated nuclear transport. Nuclear PKM2 subsequently bound to Oct4 and promoted the expression of cancer stemness-related genes, which might enrich the cancer stem cell population under the metabolic stress. Nuclear PKM2 was also capable of promoting cancer metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft model. In summary, we found that cytosolic AMPK helped PKM2 carry out its nonmetabolic functions in the nucleus under glucose restriction and that nuclear PKM2 promoted cancer stemness and metastasis.

However, ALK rearrangements are also implicated in other malignancies, including anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs). In this ongoing, multicenter, single-arm, open-label phase 1b study (PROFILE 1013; NCT01121588), patients with ALK-positive advanced malignancies other than NSCLC were to receive a starting dose of crizotinib 250 mg twice daily. Primary endpoints were safety and objective responses based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 or National Cancer Institute International Response Criteria. Forty-four patients were enrolled (lymphoma, n = 18; IMT, n = 9; other tumors, n = 17). The objective response rate was 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28–77) for lymphoma, with 8 complete responses (CRs) and 1 partial response (PR); 67% (95% CI, 30–93) for IMTs, with 1 CR and 5 PRs; and 12% (95% CI, 2–36) for other tumors, with 2 PRs in patients affected by colon carcinoma and medullary thyroid cancer, respectively. The median duration of treatment was almost 3 years for patients with lymphoma and IMTs, with 2-year progression-free survival of 63% and 67%, respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (45.5%) and vision disorders (45.5%), mostly grade 1. These findings indicate strong and durable activity of crizotinib in ALK-positive lymphomas and IMTs.

However, the impacts of lifetime exposure to air pollution on the pulmonary function of children have been inconsistent. The present study investigated the impact of lifetime residential exposure to intermediate levels of air pollution on the pulmonary function of schoolchildren. Methods: In 2011, a survey of children aged 6–15 years was conducted in 44 schools in Taiwan. Atopic history, residential history, and environmental factors were recorded. Spirograms were obtained from a random sample of children without asthma. A total of 535 girls and 481 boys without a history of asthma were enrolled. Lifetime residential exposure to air pollutants, including particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO), was estimated using the kriging method, based on monitored data from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the association between lifetime air pollution exposure and pulmonary function, after adjustment for potential confounders and recent exposure. Results: After adjustment for 7-day average air pollutant levels, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 was related to reductions in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (?2.00%; 95% confidence interval [CI] ?3.09% to ?0.90%), forced vital capacity (?1.86%; CI: ?2.96% to ?0.75%), and maximal midexpiratory flow (?2.28%; CI: ?4.04% to ?0.51%). These associations were independent of the other pollutants. Conclusion: Lifetime exposure to 25–85 μg/m3 of PM10 has negative impacts on the pulmonary function of children. This study provides documentation that lifetime exposure to 25–85 μg/m3 of PM10 reduces the pulmonary function of schoolchildren, after adjustment for short-term exposure. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollution; Child; Lifetime; Particulate matter; Respiratory function tests,Atmospheric movements; Carbon monoxide; Diseases; Housing; Linear regression; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollution exposures; Child; Forced expiratory volume in 1; Lifetime; Multiple linear regressions; Particulate Matter; Respiratory function; Taiwan environmental protection administrations; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; child health; environmental factor; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollution exposure; sulfur dioxide; adolescent; air pollutant; air pollution; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; environmental exposure; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; lung function; major clinical study; male; maximal expiratory flow; particle size; particulate matter; residential area; Taiwan; wheezing; analysis; drug effect; lung; lung function test; particulate matter; pathophysiology; questionnaire; toxicity; Taiwan; Adolescent; Asthma; Carbon Monoxide; Child; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Respiratory Function Tests; Sulfur Dioxide; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85034453608

In 2004, Taiwanese government launched a nationwide screening program and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is offered biennially to individuals aged 50 to 75. The results from the program have demonstrated that FIT screening could effectively reduce the mortality from CRC. Nevertheless, there were some problems needed to deal with. First, the occurrence of interval cancers, which are associated with the performance of screening tests or quality of colonoscopy, has affected the program sensitivity. Second, increasing participation in the program has increased the demand for colonoscopy and the burden on public health workers. Third, some individuals are non-compliant with FIT screening, and with the recommendation for colonoscopy after a positive FIT, which may be the result of insufficient awareness toward CRC and screening of the public. Fourth, long-lasting financial support for this program is necessary for its success. All of these problems need to be solved via collaboration between the screening organizer, screening distributor, and professional societies. ? 2017",Colonoscopy; Colorectal cancer; Fecal immunochemical test; Mortality; Screening,act; cancer mortality; cancer registry; cancer screening; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; data base; financial management; funding; government; health care system; health program; human; occult blood test; practice guideline; Review; screening test; sigmoidoscopy; Taiwan; aged; colorectal tumor; early cancer diagnosis; government; middle aged; occult blood; Taiwan; Aged; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Government Programs; Humans; Middle Aged; Occult Blood; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85030556997

Methods: This was a prospective, international, multicenter cohort study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the Asia-Pacific. Arrests caused by trauma, patients who were not transported by emergency medical services (EMS), and pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases (<18 years) were excluded from the analysis. Modifiable out-of-hospital factors (bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] and defibrillation, out-of-hospital defibrillation, advanced airway, and drug administration) were compared for all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients presenting to EMS and participating hospitals. The primary outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge or 30 days of hospitalization (if not discharged). We used multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models to identify factors independently associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival, accounting for clustering within each community. Results: Of 66,780 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases reported between January 2009 and December 2012, we included 56,765 in the analysis. In the adjusted model, modifiable factors associated with improved out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes included bystander CPR (odds ratio [OR] 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31 to 1.55), response time less than or equal to 8 minutes (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.35 to 1.71), and out-of-hospital defibrillation (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.96 to 2.72). Out-of-hospital advanced airway (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) was negatively associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival. Conclusion: In the PAROS cohort, bystander CPR, out-of-hospital defibrillation, and response time less than or equal to 8 minutes were positively associated with increased out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival, whereas out-of-hospital advanced airway was associated with decreased out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival. Developing EMS systems should focus on basic life support interventions in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation. ? 2017 American College of Emergency Physicians",,"adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; defibrillation; female; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; Japan; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle aged; multicenter study; out of hospital cardiac arrest; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; respiration control; resuscitation; Singapore; South Korea; survival; Taiwan; Thailand; United Arab Emirates; Asia; clinical trial; emergency health service; epidemiology; mortality; out of hospital cardiac arrest; Pacific islands; procedures; resuscitation; risk assessment; standards; survival analysis; survival rate; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asia; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pacific Islands; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Survival Analysis; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85030464901

Therefore, it is important to be able to detect CVD biomarkers early so that patients can be diagnosed properly and begin treatment as soon as possible. To detect biomarkers more conveniently, point-of-care (PoC) biosensors, which are easy to use and are of low cost, are becoming even more necessary. This paper focuses on developing a label-free electrochemical biosensor with high sensitivity for PoC applications to detect CVD biomarkers such as S100 beta proteins and C-reactive proteins (CRP). To meet the requirements of a PoC application and to improve the measurement sensitivity for detection purposes, a three-electrode configuration was miniaturized and fitted onto a biochip. Computer simulation of an electrolyte current density was used to investigate several potential effective possibilities. It was found that an electrolyte current density at an edge tip structure near the working electrode (WE) and counter electrode (CE) was higher than at other locations. A zigzag structure was then designed at the edge near the WE and CE positions. With this design, we can obtain a higher total electrolyte current. This newly-designed biochip was then used to measure the electrochemical feature. It was found that the measurement efficiency was also improved using this newly designed biochip. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Biochip; Cardiovascular disease; Electrochemical; Point-of-care biosensor; Zigzag electrode,"Biochips; Biomarkers; Biosensors; Cardiology; Diseases; Electrolytes; Patient treatment; Proteins; Cardio-vascular disease; Electrochemical; Electrochemical biosensor; Electrochemical features; Electrolyte currents; Measurement efficiency; Measurement sensitivity; Point of care; Electrochemical electrodes; biological marker; C reactive protein; electrolyte; protein S 100; protein S100B; S100B protein, human; Article; cardiovascular disease; chemical structure; computer simulation; density; electrochemical analysis; electrochemical biosensor; ion current; miniaturization; molecular weight; point of care testing; sensitivity analysis; cardiovascular disease; chemistry; genetic procedures; human; isolation and purification; point of care system; procedures; Biomarkers; Biosensing Techniques; C-Reactive Protein; Cardiovascular Diseases; Electrochemical Techniques; Humans; Point-of-Care Systems; S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit",2-s2.0-85039696199

Little is known about the ability of novel biomarkers in combination with clinical risk scores for prediction of advanced AKI. Methods: In this prospectively conducted multicenter study, urine samples were collected from 149 adults at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after cardiovascular surgery. We measured urinary hemojuvelin (uHJV), kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL), α-glutathione S-transferase (uα-GST) and π-glutathione S-transferase (uπ-GST). The primary outcome was advanced AKI, under the definition of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2, 3 and composite outcomes were KDIGO stage 2, 3 or 90-day mortality after hospital discharge. Results: Patients with advanced AKI had significantly higher levels of uHJV and uKIM-1 at 3, 6 and 12 h after surgery. When normalized by urinary creatinine level, uKIM-1 in combination with uHJV at 3 h post-surgery had a high predictive ability for advanced AKI and composite outcome (AUC=0.898 and 0.905, respectively). The combination of this biomarker panel (normalized uKIM-1, uHJV at 3 h post-operation) and Liano's score was superior in predicting advanced AKI (AUC=0.931, category-free net reclassification improvement of 1.149, and p< 0.001). Conclusions: When added to Liano's score, normalized uHJV and uKIM-1 levels at 3 h after cardiovascular surgery enhanced the identification of patients at higher risk of progression to advanced AKI and composite outcomes. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Acute kidney injury; Biomarkers; Hemojuvelin; Kidney injury molecule-1; Liano's score; Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; α-Glutathione S-transferase; π-Glutathione S-transferase,"biological marker; creatinine; glutathione transferase; glutathione transferase alpha; hemojuvelin; kidney injury molecule 1; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; pi glutathione S transferase; unclassified drug; biological marker; glutathione S-transferase alpha; glutathione transferase; glutathione transferase P1; glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; HAVCR1 protein, human; HFE2 protein, human; isoenzyme; kidney injury molecule 1; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; acute kidney failure; adult; area under the curve; Article; cardiovascular surgery; clinical outcome; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; creatinine urine level; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease exacerbation; female; high risk patient; human; intensive care unit; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multicenter study; observational study; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; sensitivity and specificity; urine level; acute kidney failure; aged; analysis of variance; chi square distribution; clinical trial; heart surgery; hospital mortality; mortality; nonparametric test; organ dysfunction score; organization and management; pathophysiology; receiver operating characteristic; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; urine; Acute Kidney Injury; Adult; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Biomarkers; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Glutathione S-Transferase pi; Glutathione Transferase; GPI-Linked Proteins; Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Isoenzymes; Lipocalin-2; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Dysfunction Scores; Prospective Studies; ROC Curve; Statistics, Nonparametric; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85046018180

TGPE is known for its anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, and anti-microbial properties, but the effects and mechanisms of TGPE in the modulation of diabetes are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of TGPE on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a streptozotocin/high-fat-diet (STZ/HFD)-induced T2DM rat model. The results revealed that TGPE delayed the development and progression of T2DM and reduced the severity of β-cell failure. TGPE also attenuated inflammation and reactive oxygen species ROS in the rats. Moreover, there were higher levels of oxidant cytokines, leptin, and adiponectin in the serum of the TGPE-treated group. Unlike Brazilian propolis, TGPE promoted hepatic genes PPAR-α and CYP7A1, which were related to lipid catabolism and removal. TGPE may thus delay the progression of T2DM through anti-inflammation effects, anti-oxidation effects, and balancing lipid metabolism. It is suggested that TGPE can be a potential alternative medicine for T2DM. ? 2018 by the authors.

The rGO/Au nanohybrid was prepared by the one-pot hydrothermal method and well characterized by different physiochemical techniques. The nanohybrid exhibits a weak fluorescence of rGO due to the energy transfer from the rGO to Au NPs. The rGO/Au nanohybrid shows enhanced fluorescence activity due to the restoration of quenched fluorescence of rGO/Au nanohybrid in presence of L-Cys. The rGO/Au nanohybrid exhibits much lower detection limit of 0.51 nM for L-Cys with higher selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism arose from the fluorescence recovery due to the stronger interaction between Au NPs and L-Cys, and consequently, the energy transfer was prevented between rGO and Au NPs.

We assessed the relation between CIMT change and events in individuals at high cardiovascular risk. Methods and results From 31 cohorts with two CIMT scans (total n = 89070) on average 3.6 years apart and clinical follow-up, subcohorts were drawn: (A) individuals with at least 3 cardiovascular risk factors without previous CVD events, (B) individuals with carotid plaques without previous CVD events, and (C) individuals with previous CVD events. Cox regression models were fit to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of the combined endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke or vascular death) per standard deviation (SD) of CIMT change, adjusted for CVD risk factors. These HRs were pooled across studies. In groups A, B and C we observed 3483, 2845 and 1165 endpoint events, respectively. Average common CIMT was 0.79mm (SD 0.16mm), and annual common CIMT change was 0.01mm (SD 0.07mm), both in group A. The pooled HR per SD of annual common CIMT change (0.02 to 0.43mm) was 0.99 (95% confidence interval: 0.95–1.02) in group A, 0.98 (0.93–1.04) in group B, and 0.95 (0.89–1.04) in group C. The HR per SD of common CIMT (average of the first and the second CIMT scan, 0.09 to 0.75mm) was 1.15 (1.07–1.23) in group A, 1.13 (1.05–1.22) in group B, and 1.12 (1.05–1.20) in group C. Conclusions We confirm that common CIMT is associated with future CVD events in individuals at high risk. CIMT change does not relate to future event risk in high-risk individuals. ? 2018 Lorenz et al.

Methods In a PubMed systematic search, we identified case-control studies with extractable data on global and occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake in symptomatic patients with CAA (per Boston criteria) versus control groups (healthy participants or patients with non-CAA deep intracerebral haemorrhage) and patients with Alzheimer's disease. To circumvent PET studies' methodological variation, we generated and used  fold change', that is, ratio of mean amyloid uptake (global and occipital-to-global) of CAA relative to comparison groups. Amyloid-PET uptake biomarker performance was then quantified by random-effects meta-analysis on the ratios of the means. A ratio >1 indicates that amyloid-PET uptake (global or occipital/global) is higher in CAA than comparison groups, and a ratio <1 indicates the reverse. Results Seven studies, including 106 patients with CAA (>90% with probable CAA) and 138 controls (96 healthy elderly, 42 deep intracerebral haemorrhage controls) and 72 patients with Alzheimer's disease, were included. Global amyloid-PET ratio between patients with CAA and controls was above 1, with an average effect size of 1.18 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.28; p<0.0001). Occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake ratio did not differ between patients with CAA versus patients with deep intracerebral haemorrhage or healthy controls. By contrast, occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake ratio was above 1 in patients with CAA versus those with Alzheimer's disease, with an average ratio of 1.10 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.19; p=0.009) and high statistical heterogeneity. Conclusions Our analysis provides exploratory actionable data on the overall effect sizes and strength of amyloid-PET burden and distribution in patients with CAA, useful for future larger studies. ?

Probiotics have been suggested as one of the candidates to resolve the obesity-associated problems, but how they combat obesity is not fully understood. Herein, we investigated the effects of Lactobacillus reuteri 263 (L. reuteri 263) on antiobesity using four groups of Sprague–Dawley rats (n=10/group), namely, C (normal diet with vehicle treatment), HE [high-energy diet (HED) with vehicle treatment], 1X (HED with 2.1×10 9 CFU/kg/day of L. reuteri 263) and 5X (HED with 1.05×10 10 CFU/kg/day of L. reuteri 263), for 8 weeks. L. reuteri 263 improved the phenomenon of obesity, serum levels of proinflammatory factors and antioxidant enzymes. More importantly, L. reuteri 263 increased oxygen consumption in white adipose tissue (WAT). The mRNA expressions of thermogenesis genes uncoupling protein-1, uncoupling protein-3, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector-a were up-regulated in WAT of the 5X group. Moreover, L. reuteri 263 might induce browning of WAT due to the higher mRNA levels of browning-related genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, PR domain containing-16, Pparγ coactivator-1α, bone morphogenetic protein-7 and fibroblast growth factor-21 in the 1X and 5X groups compared to the HE group. Finally, L. reuteri 263 altered the expressions of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolisms in WAT, including increasing the levels of glucose transporter type 4 and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein and decreasing the expression of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1. The results suggest that L. reuteri 263 may treat obesity through energy metabolism remodeling of WAT in the high-energy-diet-induced obese rats. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Antiobesity; Browning of white adipose tissue; Energy metabolism remodeling; Lactobacillus reuteri 263; Probiotics,"acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; adiponectin; carbohydrate responsive element binding protein; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; cell death inducing DFFA like effector alpha; cholesterol; fibroblast growth factor 21; glucose; glucose transporter 4; interleukin 6; low density lipoprotein; messenger RNA; osteogenic protein 1; oxygen; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; PR domain containing 16 protein; protein; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; uncoupling protein 3; antiobesity agent; antioxidant; enzyme; glucose; probiotic agent; animal experiment; animal model; Article; body fat; caloric intake; cell respiration; cholesterol blood level; colony forming unit; comparative study; controlled study; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; fat pad; food intake; glucose blood level; Lactobacillus reuteri; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipoprotein blood level; male; mesenteric fat; nonhuman; obesity; oxygen consumption; rat; triacylglycerol blood level; upregulation; white adipose tissue; animal; blood; energy metabolism; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; oral drug administration; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue, White; Administration, Oral; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Antioxidants; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Enzymes; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose; Lactobacillus reuteri; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Probiotics; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",2-s2.0-85044871654

To date, the efficiency of NAFLD treatment still needs to be improved. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus mali APS1, which was isolated from sugary kefir, on hepatic steatosis in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Methods and results: Sprague Dawley rats were fed a control diet, a HFD with saline, and a HFD with APS1 intervention by gavage daily for 12 weeks. The results showed that APS1 significantly reduced body weight and body weight gain in HFD-fed rats. APS1 reduced hepatic lipid accumulation by regulating SIRT-1/PGC-1α/SREBP-1 expression. Moreover, APS1 increased hepatic antioxidant activity by modulating Nrf-2/HO-1 expression. Notably, APS1 manipulated the gut microbiota, resulting in increasing proportions of the phylum Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes and reducing the abundance of specific NAFLD-associated bacteria. Conclusion: These results suggested that APS1 ameliorated hepatic steatosis by modulating lipid metabolism and antioxidant activity via manipulating specific NAFLD-associated gut microbiota in vivo. ? 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, we demonstrate the induction of blue fluorescence in GO suspensions via a mild thermal annealing procedure. Additionally, this procedure preserves the oxygen functional groups on the graphene plane which enables the conjugation of cancer drugs without obvious cytotoxicity. Consequently, we demonstrate the capability of GO to simultaneously play the dual-role of a: (i) cellular imaging agent and (ii) drug delivery agent in CT26 cancer cells without the need for additional fluorescent protein labeling. Our method offers a simple, controllable strategy to tune and enhance the fluorescence property of GO, which shows potential for biomedical applications and fundamental studies. ?

Methods: Short-term mortality in patients with sepsis was analyzed using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Use of statins was defined as the cumulative use of a specific statin (atorvastatin, simvastatin, or rosuvastatin) for > 30 days prior to the index sepsis admission. We determined the association between statin and sepsis outcome by multivariate-adjusted Cox models and propensity score (PS)-matched analysis, using a 1:1:1 PS matching technique. Results: A total of 52,737 patients with sepsis fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 1,855 were prescribed atorvastatin, 916 were prescribed simvastatin, and 732 were prescribed rosuvastatin. Compared with nonusers, simvastatin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.90) and atorvastatin (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68-0.90) were associated with an improved 30-day survival, whereas rosuvastatin was not (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73-1.04). Using rosuvastatin as the reference, atorvastatin (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.99) and simvastatin (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99) had superior effectiveness in preventing mortality.

The role of Caspase-3 in gastric cancer remains controversial. Methods: A total of 366 gastric cancer patients who received curative surgery were enrolled. Caspase-3 expression in gastric tumors was examined by immunohistochemical staining. Correlations between Caspase-3 expression and the survival rates and between Caspase-3 expression and the clinicopathological parameters of the gastric cancer patients were analyzed. Results: The 5-year overall survival rates of gastric cancer patients with and without Caspase-3 expression were 51.2% and 37.3%, respectively (P = 0.030). The 5-year disease-free survival rates of gastric cancer patients with and without Caspase-3 expression were 49.2% and 34.6%, respectively (P = 0.029). Analyses of the clinicopathological features showed that larger tumor size (P = 0.030), more advanced Borrmann type (P = 0.012), more aggressive stromal reaction (P = 0.001), higher classification using Ming's infiltrating histology type (P = 0.018), more lymph node involvement (P = 0.019), and more lymphovascular involvement (P = 0.045) were significantly correlated with a lack of Caspase-3 expression.

Conclusion: Caspase-3 expression in gastric cancer patients is related to favorable clinicopathological features and a positive prognosis after curative surgery.

HLA-Cw6 is one of the most strongly associated psoriasis susceptibility alleles. It is repeatedly observed to affect disease course, phenotypic features, severity, comorbidities and treatment outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, the roles of HLA-Cw6 in psoriasis have not yet been thoroughly reviewed. The worldwide frequency of the HLA-Cw6 allele varies greatly, with it being generally higher in white people than in Asians. The allele is associated with type I early-onset psoriasis. Stress, obesity and streptococcal pharyngitis are commonly observed in HLA-Cw6-positive patients. Phenotypically, HLA-Cw6 has been found to be associated with guttate psoriasis. In addition, patients carrying the allele are more likely to have arm, leg and trunk involvement, and the Koebner phenomenon. Patients with psoriatic arthritis with HLA-Cw6 more often have early onset and tend to show cutaneous symptoms before musculoskeletal symptoms. HLA-Cw6-positive patients have been shown in several studies to be more responsive to methotrexate and ustekinumab. However, this difference in ustekinumab efficacy was only moderate in a post-hoc analysis of a pivotal phase III study. HLA-Cw6 positivity also tends to be less frequent in high-need patients who fail conventional therapy. Small studies have also investigated the role of HLA-Cw6 in remission of psoriasis during pregnancy, and with the comorbidities of photosensitivity and atherosclerosis. Given the diverse nature of psoriasis pathogenesis, as well as the difference of HLA-Cw6 positivity in different ethnic groups, more studies are needed to confirm the role of HLA-Cw6 in psoriasis. ? 2017 British Association of Dermatologists",,"atherosclerosis; body weight; celiac disease; comorbidity; disease association; disease course; disease severity; gene; gene frequency; hla cw6 gene; HLA system; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; lifestyle; onset age; phenotype; pregnancy; priority journal; psoriasis; psoriatic arthritis; Review; streptococcal pharyngitis; complication; female; genetics; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; pharyngitis; pregnancy complication; psoriasis; Streptococcus infection; HLA C antigen; HLA-C*06 antigen; Age of Onset; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Atherosclerosis; Body Weight; Celiac Disease; Female; Gene Frequency; HIV Infections; HLA-C Antigens; Humans; Life Style; Pharyngitis; Phenotype; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Psoriasis; Streptococcal Infections",2-s2.0-85042597330

The study of CTC clusters might therefore provide more biologically meaningful information for a clear understanding of cancer metastasis. To achieve this goal, the isolation of high-purity, and integral CTC clusters from the blood samples of cancer patients is required. We herein propose to integrate optically-induced-dielectrophoresis (ODEP)-based cell manipulation with a microfluidic system for isolating cancer cell clusters based on their size characteristics. In this work, a two-step ODEP-based cell manipulation was designed. A dynamic square light image array was designed for the preliminary isolation of cancer cell clusters, followed by the utilization of another ODEP-based cell manipulation to refine the purity of the cancer cell clusters harvested in the first step. In this study, the optimal ODEP operating conditions for cell isolation process were experimentally determined. Moreover, the performance of cell isolation was experimentally evaluated for the isolation of CTC clusters with a cell purity and recovery rate of 91.5 ± 5.6%, and 70.5 ± 5.2%, respectively, without compromising the integrity of cancer cell clusters. Overall, this study presents a method and device capable of isolating high-purity and integral cancer cell clusters. ? 2017",Cell isolation; Circulating tumor cells (CTCs); CTC clusters; Microfluidic technology; Optically-induced-dielectrophoresis (ODEP),Cytology; Diseases; Electrophoresis; Fluidic devices; Microfluidics; Molecular biology; Pathology; Tumors; Cell isolation; Circulating tumor cells; CTC clusters; Microfluidic technologies; Optically induced dielectrophoresis; Cells,2-s2.0-85037672238

Data Sources: Electronic databases, comprising PubMed and EMBASE, were searched for the pertinent literature before July 1, 2017. Study Selection: Fourteen trials comparing the ulnar nerve CSA measurements between participants with and without CuTS were included. Data Extraction: Study design, participants' demographic characteristics, diagnostic reference of CuTS, and methods of CSA measurement. Data Synthesis: Among different elbow levels, the between-group difference in CSA was the largest at the medial epicondyle (6.0mm 2 ; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5–7.4mm 2 ). The pooled mean CSA in participants without CuTS was 5.5mm 2 (95% CI, 4.4–6.6mm 2 ) at the arm level, 7.4mm 2 (95% CI, 6.7–8.1mm 2 ) at the cubital tunnel inlet, 6.6mm 2 (95% CI, 5.9–7.2mm 2 ) at the medial epicondyle, 7.3mm 2 (95% CI, 5.6–9.0mm 2 ) at the cubital tunnel outlet, and 5.5mm 2 (95% CI, 4.7–6.3mm 2 ) at the forearm level. The sensitivities, specificities, and diagnostic odds ratios pooled from 5 studies, using 10mm 2 as the cutoff point, were.85 (95% CI,.78–.90),.91 (95% CI,.86–.94), and 53.96 (95% CI, 14.84–196.14), respectively. Conclusions: The ulnar nerve CSA measured by ultrasound imaging is useful for the diagnosis of CuTS and is most significantly different between patients and participants without CuTS at the medial epicondyle. Because the ulnar nerve CSA in healthy participants, at various locations, rarely exceeds 10mm 2 , this value can be considered as a cutoff point for diagnosing ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow region. ? 2017 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine",Rehabilitation; Ulnar nerve compression syndromes; Ulnar neuropathies; Ultrasonography,"cross sectional area; cubital tunnel syndrome; demography; diagnostic accuracy; echography; Embase; forearm; human; Medline; meta analysis; musculoskeletal system parameters; Review; sensitivity and specificity; ulnar nerve; adult; anatomy; anatomy and histology; cubital tunnel syndrome; diagnostic imaging; echography; elbow; female; innervation; male; middle aged; odds ratio; procedures; reference value; Adult; Anatomy, Cross-Sectional; Cubital Tunnel Syndrome; Elbow; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Reference Values; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ulnar Nerve; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-85032725686

Methods Patients with chronic hepatitis B who were discontinuing NUC therapy were prospectively enrolled. Viral and host predictors of relapse were evaluated, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) level, anti-HBV core antibody level, and presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes encoding the receptors NTCP (rs2296651) and CTLA4 (rs231775) and in the 3′ untranslated regions of the genes encoding HLA-DPA1 (rs3077) and HLA-DPB1 (rs9277535); posttherapy predictors of relapse were also investigated. Information about NUC retreatment and outcomes were recorded. Results Overall, 100 patients discontinuing 3-year entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir (TDF) therapy were enrolled. Patients discontinuing TDF exhibited significantly higher rates of VR (52.9% vs 6.1%; P <.001) and CR (15.2% vs. 1.5%, P =.007) at 3 months than those discontinuing ETV, but relapse rates at 12 months were comparable. The end-of-therapy HBsAg levels predicted VR (hazard ratio [HR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.21), CR (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.13-2.81), and SCR (OR, 0.57; 95% CI,.35-.94). The CTLA4 (rs231775) non-GG genotype predicted VR (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.01-3.00) and CR (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.04-4.11), while the HLA-DPA1 (rs3077) AA genotype predicted SCR (OR, 10.84; 95% CI, 1.12-105). The HBV DNA 1 month after NUC treatment cessation was an early predictor of subsequent relapse. Conclusions Discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment rather than entecavir treatment is associated with earlier relapse, and NUC-specific posttherapy monitoring is necessary. ? 2017 The Author(s).",anti-HBc; CTLA4; HBsAg; NTCP; Nucleot(s)ide analogue; retreatment; rs3077; rs9277535,"adenine; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; entecavir; guanine; hepatitis B core antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; HLA antigen class 2; HLA DPA1 antigen; HLA DPB1 antigen; sodium bile acid cotransporter; tenofovir; unclassified drug; virus DNA; antivirus agent; entecavir; guanine; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; tenofovir; virus DNA; 3' untranslated region; adult; Article; chronic hepatitis B; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug withdrawal; female; genotype; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prospective study; recurrence risk; risk assessment; single nucleotide polymorphism; analogs and derivatives; blood; chronic hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; middle aged; physiology; recurrent disease; risk factor; Adult; Antiviral Agents; DNA, Viral; Female; Guanine; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Tenofovir",2-s2.0-85048134207

Although molecular pathways of individual TME are extensively studied, evidence showing interaction and crosstalk between hypoxia and inflammation remain unclear. Thus, we examined whether interferon (IFN) could modulate both inflammatory and hypoxic responses under normoxia and its relation with cancer development. Methods: IFN was used to induce inflammation response and HIF-1α expression in various cancer cell lines. Corresponding signaling pathways were then analyzed by a combination of pharmacological inhibitors, immunoblotting, GST-Raf pull-down assays, dominant-negative and short-hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown approaches. Specifically, roles of functional HIF-1α in the IFN-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and other tumorigenic propensities were examined by knockdown, pharmacological inhibition, luciferase reporter, clonogenic, anchorage-independent growth, wound-healing, vasculogenic mimicry, invasion and sphere-formation assays as well as cellular morphology observation. Results: We showed for the first time that IFN induced functional HIF-1α expression in a time- and dose- dependent manner in various cancer cell lines under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions, and then leading to an activated HIF-1α pathway in an IFN-mediated pro-inflammatory TME. IFN regulates anti-apoptosis activity, cellular metastasis, EMT and vasculogenic mimicry by a novel mechanism through mainly the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. Subsequently, pharmacological and genetic modulations of HIF-1α, JAK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR or p38 pathways efficiently abrogate above IFN-induced tumorigenic propensities. Moreover, HIF-1α is required for the IFN-induced invasiveness, tumorigenesis and vasculogenic mimicry. Further supports for the HIF-1α-dependent tumorigenesis were obtained from results of xenograft mouse model and sphere-formation assay. Conclusions: Our mechanistic study showed an induction of HIF-1α and EMT ability in an IFN-mediated inflammatory TME and thus demonstrating a novel interaction between inflammatory and hypoxic TMEs. Moreover, targeting HIF-1α may be a potential target for inhibiting tumor tumorigenesis and EMT by decreasing cancer cells wound healing and anchorage-independent colony growth. Our results also lead to rationale guidance for developing new therapeutic strategies to prevent relapse via targeting TME-providing IFN signaling and HIF-1α programming. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; HIF-1α; Inflammatory hypoxia; Interferon; Oncogenesis; Tumor microenvironment,"hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; interferon; Janus kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase B; Ras protein; biological marker; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; interferon; Janus kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein kinase inhibitor; Ras protein; target of rapamycin kinase; Akt signaling; anchorage independent growth; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell line; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell structure; clonogenic assay; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene expression; gene silencing; human; human cell; immunoblotting; inflammation; luciferase assay; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; tumor hypoxia; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment; tumor xenograft; wound healing; biological model; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; hypoxia; MAPK signaling; metabolism; neoplasm; pathology; signal transduction; Apoptosis; Biomarkers; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Hypoxia; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Interferons; Janus Kinases; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Models, Biological; Neoplasms; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; ras Proteins; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85044509678

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is necessary for the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). By adulthood, approximately 90% of individuals test EBV-positive, but only a fraction develop cancer. Factors that identify which individuals are most likely to develop disease, including differential antibody response to the virus, could facilitate detection at early stages when treatment is most effective. Methods. We measured anti-EBV IgG and IgA antibody responses in 607 Taiwanese individuals. Antibodies were measured using a custom protein microarray targeting 199 sequences from 86 EBV proteins. Variation in response patterns between NPC cases and controls was used to develop an antibody-based risk score for predicting NPC. The overall accuracy [area under the curve (AUC)] of this risk score, and its performance relative to currently used biomarkers, was evaluated in two independent Taiwanese cohorts. Findings. Levels of 60 IgA and 73 IgG anti-EBV antibodies differed between stage I/IIa NPC cases and controls (P < 0.0002). Risk prediction analyses identified antibody targets that best discriminated NPC status—BXLF1, LF2,BZLF1, BRLF1, EAd, BGLF2, BPLF1, BFRF1, and BORF1. When combined with currently used VCA/EBNA1 IgA biomarkers, the resulting risk score predicted NPC with 93% accuracy (95% CI, 87%–98%) in the general Taiwanese population, a significant improvement beyond current biomarkers alone (82%; 95% CI, 75%–90%, P 0.01). This EBV-based risk score also improved NPC prediction in genetically high-risk families (89%; 95% CI, 82%–96%) compared with current biomarkers (78%; 95% CI, 66%–90%, P 0.03). Interpretation. We identified NPC-related differences in 133 anti-EBV antibodies and developed a risk score using this microarray dataset that targeted immune responses against EBV proteins from all stages of the viral life cycle, significantly improving the ability to predict NPC. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"Epstein Barr virus antibody; Epstein Barr virus antigen; Epstein Barr virus antigen 1; immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; tumor marker; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus antibody; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; virus antibody; adult; amino acid sequence; antibody response; Article; cancer risk; cancer staging; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; early cancer diagnosis; female; genetic risk; high risk population; human; immune response; life cycle stage; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nasopharynx carcinoma; predictive value; priority journal; protein microarray; protein targeting; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; sequence analysis; Taiwan; validation study; aged; blood; complication; cross-sectional study; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; immunology; mass screening; nasopharynx carcinoma; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; virology; young adult; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Female; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Neoplasm Staging; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85045332241

Area covered: A thorough systematic literature review describing the current evidence and future prospects of therapeutic options for infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Expert commentary: The methods of detecting ESBLs have been evolving. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing lowered the MIC breakpoints of cephalosporins against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in 2010. Phenotypic testing for ESBLs is no longer recommended. Instead, the selection of appropriate antimicrobial agents largely depends on the report of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). To date, therapeutic options for these multidrug-resistant organisms remain limited. The clinical efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam and cefepime on in vitro-susceptible ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae remains a concern. Many studies found an in vitro-in vivo discordance based on current breakpoints. Carbapenems are the most reliable antibiotics for severe infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. However, their overuse has led to a serious problem of increasing drug resistance. Recently, ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam have been approved for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections. The introduction of these new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations offers new carbapenem-sparing options for the treatment of ESBL infections. ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Antibiotic resistance; extended-spectrum β–lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae; treatment outcomes; β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations; β-lactamase,"amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; avibactam plus ceftazidime; aztreonam; beta lactamase inhibitor; carbapenem; carbapenem derivative; cefepime; cefmetazole; cefoperazone plus sulbactam; ceftazidime; ceftolozane plus tazobactam; ceftriaxone; cephalosporin derivative; cephamycin; cloxacillin; doripenem; flomoxef; fosfomycin; levofloxacin; meropenem; metronidazole; penicillin derivative; piperacillin plus tazobactam; antiinfective agent; beta lactamase; beta lactamase inhibitor; abdominal infection; acute pyelonephritis; antibiotic sensitivity; antibiotic therapy; bacteremia; bacterial clearance; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bactericidal activity; bacterium isolation; blaSHV 1 gene; blaTEM 1 gene; concentration response; disease severity; drug approval; drug efficacy; drug treatment failure; Enterobacteriaceae infection; Escherichia coli; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae; Gram negative infection; hospital infection; human; in vitro study; infection; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae infection; minimum inhibitory concentration; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; phenotype; pneumonia; point mutation; prevalence; Review; septic shock; survival rate; urinary tract infection; animal; beta-lactam resistance; drug effect; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; beta-Lactam Resistance; beta-Lactamase Inhibitors; beta-Lactamases; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests",2-s2.0-85042927592

Methods: ASCO convened a multidisciplinary, multinational panel of experts in medical oncology, family medicine, radiation oncology, hematology/oncology, palliative and/or hospice care, pain and/or symptom management, patient advocacy, public health, and health economics. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review, a modified ADAPTE process, and a formal consensus-based process with the Expert Panel and additional experts (consensus ratings group). Results: The systematic review included 48 full-text publications regarding palliative care in resource-constrained settings, along with cost-effectiveness analyses; the evidence for many clinical questions was limited. These provided indirect evidence to inform the formal consensus process, which resulted in agreement of ? 75% (by consensus ratings group including Expert Panel). Recommendations The recommendations help define the models of care, staffing requirements, and roles and training needs of team members in a variety of resource settings for palliative care. Recommendations also outline the standards for provision of psychosocial support, spiritual care, and opioid analgesics, which can be particularly challenging and often overlooked in resource-constrained settings.

Mounting data have revealed that body mass index (BMI) is inversely associated with risk of active tuberculosis. The inverse association presents a “paradox” with regard to diabetes, because obesity is a major determinant of diabetes, and diabetes is a well-known risk factor for tuberculosis. Methods. We conducted 2 population-based cohort studies involving 167 392 participants. The main exposure was BMI and diabetes ascertained at baseline. Occurrence of incident tuberculosis was ascertained from Taiwan’s National Tuberculosis Registry. We conducted a causal mediation analysis and a joint effects analysis to characterize the relationship between BMI, diabetes, and tuberculosis. Results. During a median of &gt;7 years of follow-up, 491 individuals developed incident tuberculosis. Compared with normal-weight individuals, obese individuals (&gt;30 kg/m2) had a 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], ?3% to ?90%) and 64% (31%–81%) reduction in tuberculosis hazard in the 2 cohorts. In the causal mediation analysis, obesity had a harmful effect on tuberculosis mediated through diabetes (0.8% and 2.7% increased odds in the 2 cohorts, respectively) but had a strongly protective effect not mediated through diabetes (72% and 67% decreased odds, respectively). Individuals who were simultaneously obese and diabetic had a lower but statistically insignificant risk of tuberculosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, .08–1.22) compared with nondiabetic normal-weight individuals. Conclusions. Our analyses revealed that the relationship between obesity, diabetes, and risk of tuberculosis was complex and nonlinear. Better understanding of the interplay between host metabolism and tuberculosis immunology may lead to novel therapeutic or preventive strategies. ? The Author(s) 2017.

However, previous findings varied depending on the type of air pollutant and study location. OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between air pollutants and suicide in 10 large cities in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. METHODS: We used a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we conducted a time-stratified case-crossover analysis to estimate the short-term association between nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter [aerodynamic diameter ?10 lm (PM10), aerodynamic diameter ?2:5 lm (PM2:5), and PM10 ? 2:5 ] and suicide, adjusted for weather factors, day-of-week, long-term time trends, and season. Then, we conducted a meta-analysis to combine the city-specific effect estimates for NO2, SO2, and PM10 across 10 cities and for PM2:5 and PM10 ? 2:5 across 3 cities. We first fitted single-pollutant models, followed by two-pollutant models to examine the robustness of the associations. RESULTS: Higher risk of suicide was associated with higher levels of NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM10 ? 2:5 over multiple days. The combined relative risks (RRs) were 1.019 for NO2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.999, 1.039), 1.020 for SO2 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.036), 1.016 for PM10 (95% CI: 1.004, 1.029), and 1.019 for PM10 ? 2:5 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.033) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in the 0–1 d average level of each pollutant. We found no evidence of an association for PM2:5. Some of the associations, particularly for SO2 and NO2, were attenuated after adjusting for a second pollutant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that higher levels of air pollution may be associated with suicide, and further research is merited to understand the underlying mechanisms. ? 2018, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinico-pathologic characteristics, especially the prognostic factors, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Taiwan. Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan's National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p<0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p<0.001, p = 0.020, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC. Personalized medicine may be needed for different histological types of EOC because of their different outcomes. ? 2018 Chang et al.

However, which of these two donor types is optimal for patients with leukemia in need of allografting is unknown. Recent findings For patients with acute leukemia, results of UCB SCT have been improved by the use of double umbilical cord units and emerging ex-vivo expansion technologies. However, the costs associated with procuring double cord units and high transplant-related mortality due to delayed immunological reconstitution and infections, particularly in adult patients, remain a problem. Recently, Haplo SCT has become an increasingly utilized alternative donor source. While improvements of ex-vivo T-cell depletion platforms continue, emergence of T-cell-replete platforms, such as the use of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), is increasingly being utilized in treating acute leukemia patients. PTCy-based Haplo SCT is gaining popularity among transplant clinicians due to its relatively easy learning curve, low cost, low incidence of graft-versus-host disease, and favorable survival in acute leukemia patients. Summary The clinical question of whether Haplo SCT should replace UCB SCT needs to be answered by ongoing randomized trials. However, the rapidly increasing adoption of Haplo SCT worldwide as the viable alternative for patients without a human leukocyte antigen-matched donor has seemingly addressed the question ahead of scientific judgment. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In addition, recent case studies have found that VDD is associated with air pollutants. Nearly all reports agree that air pollution affects VD levels by reducing sun exposure, especially UVB radiation. Sun exposure accounts for >90% of VD production in humans. Recent studies have demonstrated that tropospheric ozone and particulate matter are independent risks to VD levels and cause deficiency.

However, there have been few studies to support a causal link between UA, metabolic syndrome (MetS), diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) in young subjects. Methods From the Health Examination Registration System of Taiwanese military service during the period 2013–2015, there were 46,561 eligible participants who were 20 years old or older in our study. Different analytical steps of analysis were performed to examine the association between UA and cardiometabolic risk using logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Cox regression. Results For total population, serum UA had significant associations with the presence of MetS (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.51–2.87), DM (OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.09–6.19) and HTN (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.07–2.07) in the cross-sectional analysis. According to the cut-off values of UA calculating by the ROC curve analysis in each sex/age subgroup, the association between UA and incident adverse outcomes were analyzed in a longitudinal study. In male, higher UA significantly increased the risks for developing MetS in 30–40 years (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01–1.25), DM in < 30 years (HR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.38–5.45) and HTN in all subgroups (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.01–1.37; HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.08–2.53; HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.22–2.43). In females, a higher UA was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident MetS in > 40 years (HR = 2.99, 95% CI = 1.34–6.64), HTN in > 40 years (HR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.02–6.55), and no increased risk of DM. Conclusions Our study concluded that serum UA is an important predictor for the risk of incident MetS, DM, and HTN in adults, especially in male population. ? 2017",Diabetes mellitus; Hypertension; Metabolic syndrome; Serum uric acid,antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; creatinine; high density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; uric acid; uric acid; adult; age distribution; area under the curve; Article; blood pressure; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cholesterol blood level; clinical outcome; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease association; female; glucose blood level; human; hypertension; incidental finding; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; medical examination; metabolic syndrome X; observational study; priority journal; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; Taiwanese; uric acid blood level; young adult; age; blood; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; metabolic syndrome X; sex factor; Adult; Age Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Sex Factors; Uric Acid; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85039165510

We enrolled 8,497 Taipei City residents older than 65 years and calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Taiwanese Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Proteinuria was assessed via dipstick on voided urine. CKD prevalence and risk of progression were defined according to the KDIGO 2012 guidelines. Land-use regression models were used to estimate the participants’ one-year exposures to PM of different sizes and traffic-related exhaust, PM2.5 absorbance, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and NOx. Generalized linear regressions and logistic regressions were used to examine the associations of one-year air pollution exposures with eGFR, proteinuria, CKD prevalence and risk of progression. The results showed that the interquartile range (IQR) increments of PM2.5 absorbance (0.4 × 10?5/m) and NO2 (7.0 μg/m3) were associated with a 1.07% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54–1.57] and 0.84% (95% CI: 0.37–1.32) lower eGFR, respectively; such relationships were magnified in subjects who had an eGFR &gt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or who were non-diabetic. Similar associations were also observed for PM10 and PM2.5-10. Two-pollutant models showed that PM10 and PM2.5 absorbance were associated with a lower eGFR. The odd ratios (ORs) of CKD prevalence and risk of progression also increased with exposures to PM2.5 absorbance and NO2. In summary, one-year exposures to traffic-related air pollution were associated with lower eGFR, higher CKD prevalence, and increased risk of CKD progression among the elderly population. Air pollution-related impaired renal function was stronger in non-CKD and non-diabetic subjects. One-year exposures to traffic-related air pollution are associated with lower eGFR, higher CKD prevalence, and increased risk of CKD progression among the elderly population. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Chronic kidney disease; Land use regression; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate matter; Traffic,"Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Regression analysis; Telecommunication traffic; Air pollution exposures; Chronic kidney disease; Glomerular filtration rate; Impaired renal function; Land use regression; Land-use regression models; Particulate Matter; Traffic-related air pollution; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; disease; disease prevalence; elderly population; epidemiology; health risk; land use change; nitrogen oxides; particle size; particulate matter; pollution exposure; traffic emission; aged; airborne particle; Article; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease course; elderly care; estimated glomerular filtration rate; exhaust gas; female; human; kidney function; land use; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; particle size; practice guideline; prevalence; proteinuria; risk assessment; Taiwan; urinalysis; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; chronic kidney failure; drug effect; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; kidney; particulate matter; pathophysiology; statistical model; toxicity; very elderly; Taipei; Taiwan; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Kidney; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Male; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Taiwan; Vehicle Emissions",2-s2.0-85038000095

However, since the frequency of extreme heat events is increasing, it is difficult to conclude with certainty that the heat mortality burden is decreasing. To examine temporal changes in mortality attributed to heat extremes in Northeast Asia, we collected temperature and mortality data covering the years 1972–2012 from 57 cities of 3 countries (Taiwan, Korea, and Japan) in Northeast Asia. Poisson regression curves were fitted to the data from each city. The temporal changes in heat-mortality association were estimated with a time-varying distributed lag non-linear model. Heat extremes were defined as temperatures greater than the 97.5th percentiles of city-specific average temperatures. Attributable deaths were calculated considering temporal variations in exposure and relative risk. The estimates were then pooled through meta-analysis. The results show that the mortality risk on extreme heat days declined during the study period in all countries. However, as summer temperatures in Japan have shown more heat extremes over time, the mortality risk attributed to heat increased during 2003–2012 (0.32%) compared with 1972–1981 (0.19%). Thus, to assess the total health burden due to heat extremes related to climate change, public health strategies should focus on the temporal variation in heat-mortality association as well as changes in the distribution of heat extremes overtime. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Attributable mortality risk fraction; Climate change; Extreme heat; Mortality burden,Environmental engineering; Pollution; Heat related mortality; Mortality burden; Mortality risk; Non-linear model; Poisson regression; Summer temperature; Temporal change; Temporal variation; Climate change; climate change; extreme event; health risk; heat wave; mortality risk; public health; temporal variation; urban area; Article; Asia; calculation; cardiovascular mortality; climate change; disease association; environmental exposure; geographic distribution; heat; human; Japan; Korea; mortality; mortality risk; priority journal; public health; risk factor; Taiwan; temperature; city; epidemiology; mortality; nonlinear system; statistics and numerical data; trends; Japan; Korea; Taiwan; Asia; Cities; Climate Change; Environmental Exposure; Extreme Heat; Mortality; Nonlinear Dynamics,2-s2.0-85032955609

We conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of fluvoxamine on metabolic parameters and psychopathology in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. Methods: We recruited 85 patients who received a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia. Eligible patients were randomized to receive fluvoxamine 50 mg/day plus clozapine 100 mg/day or clozapine 300 mg/day. We studied metabolic parameters, psychopathology, and drug levels at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the intervention. Plasma levels of clozapine, norclozapine, clozapine N-oxide, and fluvoxamine were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Results: No significant difference was observed in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Clozapine–fluvoxamine combined treatment significantly attenuated the increments in body weight, insulin resistance, and levels of insulin, glucose, and triglycerides compared with clozapine monotherapy. Both groups exhibited significant improvements in their Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and negative scores. The combined treatment group showed significant reduction in the PANSS general psychopathology scores compared with the monotherapy group. No difference was observed in the plasma clozapine level between the two groups. The monotherapy group showed higher levels of norclozapine and clozapine N-oxide than the combined group. Conclusions: Compared with clozapine monotherapy, treatment with adjunctive fluvoxamine with clozapine for 12 weeks can alleviate body weight gain and metabolic abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia, without sacrificing the clinical effect. Clinicians should interpret these findings cautiously considering the short duration of this study.

Our study aims to identify an association between phthalate exposure at different ages and lung function in children at age 9 by conducting a cohort study. The Taiwan Birth Panel Study (TBPS) was established from April 2004 to January 2005. Urine samples were collected from children in the TBPS cohort at ages 2, 5, and 9 years. Urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations were measured via ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Questionnaires, lung function tests and serum IgE levels were obtained from children at the age of 9. Multiple linear regressions adjusted for confounding factors were applied to investigate the associations between phthalate exposure at different ages and lung function at age 9. Our results demonstrate that in children with allergic diseases, a per log unit increase in the urinary phthalate metabolite mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) concentration at age 9 was associated with a decreasing forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) (β = ? 25.22; 95% CI: ? 47.53 to ? 2.91 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (β = ? 32.3; 95% CI: -63.51 to ? 1.09 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr). For children with high serum IgE levels (> 100 kU/L) at age 9, the urinary MEP concentrations at the same age were negatively associated with the FEV1 (β = ? 30.4; 95% CI: ? 56.8 to ? 4.0 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr), FVC (β = ? 47.6; 95% CI: ? 84.2 to ? 11.0 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) (β = ? 102.4; 95% CI: 180.2 to ? 24.7 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr). Phthalate exposure at ages 2 and 5 had little effect on lung function at age 9. Our study suggests that concurrent exposure to phthalates, such as MEP, is negatively associated with lung function in children. Further investigation is required to elaborate on this correlation. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Children; Lung function; Phthalates,Biological organs; Body fluids; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Surveys; Children; Forced expiratory volume in 1; Lung function; Multiple linear regressions; Peak expiratory flows; Phthalate metabolites; Phthalates; Ultra-high performance liquid chromatographies; Esters; immunoglobulin E; monobenzyl phthalate; monobutyl phthalate; monoethyl phthalate; phthalic acid; phthalic acid 2 ethylhexyl monoester; phthalic acid derivative; unclassified drug; phthalic acid; phthalic acid derivative; child health; concentration (composition); health risk; metabolite; phthalate; pollution exposure; allergic disease; Article; child; childhood; cohort analysis; disease association; environmental exposure; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; immunoglobulin blood level; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lung function; lung function test; major clinical study; peak expiratory flow; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; school child; urinalysis; urine level; environmental exposure; female; lung; male; metabolism; physiology; pollutant; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Taiwan; Child; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Phthalic Acids; Respiratory Function Tests; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85031737845

Both methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms and air pollution can affect health status and result in increased risk of HDP for women. The major objective of this study was to investigate the effect of MTHFR polymorphisms, air pollution, and their interaction on the risk of HDP by using meta-predictive analytics. We searched various databases comprehensively to access all available studies conducted for various ethnic populations from countries worldwide, from 1997 to 2017. Seventy-one studies with 8064 cases and 13,232 controls for MTHFR C677T and 11 studies with 1425 cases and 1859 controls for MTHFR A1298C were included. MTHFR C677T homozygous TT (risk ratio (RR) = 1.28, p < 0.0001) and CT plus TT (RR = 1.07, p = 0.0002) were the risk genotypes, while wild-type CC played a protective role (RR = 0.94, p = 0.0017) for HDP. The meta-predictive analysis found that the percentage of MTHFR C677T TT plus CT (p = 0.044) and CT (p = 0.043) genotypes in the HDP case group were significantly increased with elevated levels of air pollution worldwide. Additionally, in countries with higher air pollution levels, the pregnant women with wild-type CC MTHFR 677 had a protection effect against HDP (p = 0.014), whereas, the homozygous TT of MTHFR C677T polymorphism was a risk genotype for developing HDP. Air pollution level is an environmental factor interacting with increased MTHFR C677T polymorphisms, impacting the susceptibility of HDP for women. ? 2018 by the authors.

An accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for controlling the outbreaks of the disease. We therefore propose a simple strategy for rapidly and sensitively detecting the H7N9 virus using an intensity-modulated surface plasmon resonance (IM-SPR) biosensor integrated with a new generated monoclonal antibody. The novel antibody exhibits significant specificity to recognize H7N9 virus compared with other clinical human influenza isolates (p < 0.01). Experimentally, the detection limit of the proposed approach for H7N9 virus detection is estimated to be 144 copies/mL, which is a 20-fold increase in sensitivity compared with homemade target-captured ELISA using the identical antibody. For the measurement of mimic clinical specimens containing the H7N9 virus mixed with nasal mucosa from flu-like syndrome patients, the detection limit is calculated to be 402 copies/mL, which is better than conventional influenza detection assays; quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT). Most importantly, the assay time took less than 10 min. Combined, the results of this study indicate that the proposed simple strategy demonstrates high sensitivity and time-saving in H7N9 virus detection. By incorporating a high specific recognizer, the proposed technique has the potential to be used in applications and development of other emerging or re-emerging microbe detection platforms. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Antibodies; Assays; Biosensors; Diagnosis; Monoclonal antibodies; Polymerase chain reaction; Surface plasmon resonance; Viruses; Avian influenza a; Detection limits; Diagnostic tests; High sensitivity; Intensity-modulated; Microbe detection; Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Sensitive detection; Chemical detection; immobilized antibody; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; monoclonal antibody; animal; avian influenza; bird; chemistry; devices; economics; equipment design; human; immunology; influenza; Influenza A virus (H7N9); isolation and purification; limit of detection; procedures; surface plasmon resonance; virology; Animals; Antibodies, Immobilized; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Birds; Equipment Design; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Limit of Detection; Surface Plasmon Resonance",2-s2.0-85041387529

We investigated the epidemiological profile of ACHD in Taiwan, a country with a congenital heart disease program since 1955, population of 23 million, and easily accessible high-standard medical care. Methods and Results--ACHD patients, born after 1954, were identified from the nationwide database 2000-2014. The ACHD prevalence in the population aged 18 to 59 was 140.53, 157.08, 182.45, and 217.00 per 100 000 in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2014, respectively (increasing time trend, P < 0.0001). Percentage of severe ACHD also increased over time (P < 0.0001) and was 11.70% in 2014. The 5 leading ACHD diagnoses were ventricular septal defect, secundum atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot. Freedom from tachyarrhythmia at age 50 years was 0.574 and 0.710 for severe and simple ACHD, respectively. Cardiac causes accounted for the majority of deaths, followed by malignancy in simple ACHD and external causes/sudden death/out-of-hospital death in severe ACHD patients. The proportion of unexpected death was 10%. Compared with the general population, the standardized mortality ratio was higher not only in severe ACHD (3.164; 95% confidence interval, 2.664-3.664), but also in women with simple ACHD (1.704; 95% confidence interval, 1.499-1.909), with a higher proportion of cardiac, labor, and sudden death as causes of death. Conclusions--We demonstrated an increasing trend in ACHD prevalence and medical complexity. They are at risk of tachyarrhythmia, higher mortality, and unexpected deaths, suggesting a gap in their medical care. ? 2018 The Authors.",Adult congenital heart disease; Arrhythmia; Epidemiology; Mortality rate,"adult; adult congenital heart disease; Article; cause of death; congenital heart disease; disease severity; disease surveillance; Fallot tetralogy; female; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium septum defect; heart ventricle septum defect; human; major clinical study; male; patent ductus arteriosus; population research; prevalence; priority journal; pulmonary valve stenosis; standardized mortality ratio; sudden death; Taiwan; trend study; adolescent; congenital heart malformation; factual database; heart arrhythmia; middle aged; mortality; prognosis; risk assessment; risk factor; sudden cardiac death; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Cause of Death; Databases, Factual; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Female; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Time Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85042141281

Studies reported that searching on the internet for health information may potentially influence an individual?s decision making to change her health-seeking behaviors. Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) develop and validate 2 questionnaires to estimate the strategies of problem-solving in medicine and utilization of online health information, (2) determine the association between searching online for health information and utilization of online health information, and (3) determine the association between online medical help-seeking and utilization of online health information. Methods: The Problem Solving in Medicine and Online Health Information Utilization questionnaires were developed and implemented in this study. We conducted confirmatory factor analysis to examine the structure of the factor loadings and intercorrelations for all the items and dimensions. We employed Pearson correlation coefficients for examining the correlations between each dimension of the Problem Solving in Medicine questionnaire and each dimension of the Online Health Information Utilization questionnaire. Furthermore, we conducted structure equation modeling for examining the possible linkage between each of the 6 dimensions of the Problem Solving in Medicine questionnaire and each of the 3 dimensions of the Online Health Information Utilization questionnaire. Results: A total of 457 patients participated in this study. Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from .12 to .41, all with statistical significance, implying that each dimension of the Problem Solving in Medicine questionnaire was significantly associated with each dimension of the Online Health Information Utilization questionnaire. Patients with the strategy of online health information search for solving medical problems positively predicted changes in medical decision making (P=.01), consulting with others (P<.001), and promoting self-efficacy on deliberating the online health information (P<.001) based on the online health information they obtained. Conclusions: Present health care professionals have a responsibility to acknowledge that patients? medical decision making may be changed based on additional online health information. Health care professionals should assist patients? medical decision making by initiating as much dialogue with patients as possible, providing credible and convincing health information to patients, and guiding patients where to look for accurate, comprehensive, and understandable online health information. By doing so, patients will avoid becoming overwhelmed with extraneous and often conflicting health information.

Cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) is known for its pivotal role in the resistance of cancer cells to death receptor-induced cell death. Here, we show that DTX1 is an E3 ligase for c-FLIP in gastric cancer cells. DTX1 promoted c-FLIP downregulation. Overexpression of DTX1 sensitized gastric cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas DTX1-knockdown attenuated apoptosis induction. DTX1 binds c-FLIP L and directs it into the endosome-lysosomal pathway for proteasome-independent degradation. Moreover, induction of DTX1 in AGS cells by geldanamycin conferred susceptibility of those cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Our results reveal a tumor-suppressive role for DTX1 and suggest a new approach to increasing TRAIL efficacy by raising DTX1 levels in gastric cancer therapy.

However, there are no studies examining the anticancer activity of corylin. In this study, we used cells and animal models to examine the antitumor effects of corylin on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and then studied its downstream regulatory mechanisms. The results showed that corylin significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of HCC cells and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We found that the anti-HCC mechanism of corylin’s action lies in the upregulation of tumor suppressor long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) and the activation of its downstream anticancer pathways. In animal experiments, we also found that corylin can significantly inhibit tumor growth without significant physiological toxicity. The above results suggest that corylin has anti-HCC effects and good potential as a clinical treatment. ? 2018 by the authors.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a by-product of oxidative stress and ageing, has been thought to induce osteoporosis by inhibiting osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, specific mechanisms of how ROS results in alterations on MSC differentiation capacity have been inconsistently reported. We found that H 2 O 2 , an ROS, simultaneously induced MSC lineage commitment towards adipogenesis and away from osteogenesis at the functional as well as transcriptional level. In addition, H 2 O 2 decreased the activities of SIRT1, a histone deacetylase and longevity gene. By silencing and reconstituting SIRT1 in MSCs, we demonstrated that H 2 O 2 exerted its disparate effects on adipogenic/osteoblastic lineage commitment mainly through modulating SIRT1 expression levels. Treatment with resveratrol, a SIRT1 agonist, can also reverse this ROS-induced adipogenesis/osteogenesis lineage imbalance. Moreover, SIRT1 regulation of RUNX2 transcriptional activity was mediated through deacetylation of the ROS-sensitive transcription factor FOXO3a. Taken together, our data implicate SIRT1 as playing a vital role in ROS-directed lineage commitment of MSCs by modulating two lineages simultaneously. Our findings on the critical role of SIRT1 in ROS/age-related perturbations of MSC differentiation capacity highlight this molecule as a target for maintenance of MSC stemness as well as a potential anabolic target in osteoporosis. ? 2017 The Authors.

To perform an accurate and rapid cellular analysis, various magnetic-activated cell sorting techniques are available in the markets. However, large sample requirement and uneven magnetic field distribution limit its application in single-cell trapping and following analysis. To address these problems, we developed a microfluidic microwell device for immunomagnetic single-cell trapping. By adding a microwell layer between the microchannel and magnet, the magnetic field along the device becomes more uniform. Besides, magnetic beads can be retained in the array of microwell after the high-speed washing step, whereas untrapped beads would be flushed away, resulting in high single-particle trapping efficiency (62%) and purity (99.6%). To achieve large-area single-cell trapping, we introduced a “sweeping” loading protocol to further expand the single-particle trapping range. In the microwell region near to the edge of the magnet, over 3000 single magnetic beads were trapped in a 10?mm2 area. Finally, we demonstrated immunomagnetic-labeled THP-1 cells can successfully be trapped at single-cell level in the microwell. The cell trapping process can be done in 10?min. We believe the platform with an accurate and efficient single-cell trapping functionality could potentially be used for various cellular analyses at the single-cell level. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Immunomagnetic; Microfluidics; Microwell; Single-cell trapping,Cytology; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Magnets; Medical applications; Microchannels; Microfluidics; Biomedical applications; Cancer diagnostics; Immunomagnetic; Loading protocols; Magnetic field distribution; Micro wells; Single-cell trapping; Singlecell analysis; Cells,2-s2.0-85040926584

We previously reported that SP94 peptides, identified by phage display, exhibited higher binding affinity to human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than to hepatocytes and other normal cells. Here, we confirm the tumor-targeting properties of SP94 peptide by near-infrared fluorescence imaging. Non-targeted PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (LD) and SP94-conjugated PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (SP94-LD) were compared by assessing pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and antitumor efficacy in xenograftbearing mice, in order to investigate the effectiveness of SP94-mediated targeting for cancer therapy. SP94-LD demonstrated a significant increase in drug accumulation in tumors, while its plasma residence time was the same as its non-targeted equivalent. Consistent with this result, conjugation of targeting peptide SP94 enhances the therapeutic efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin in mouse models with hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts. Furthermore, combination targeted therapy exhibited a significant enhancement against orthotopic tumor growth, and markedly extended the survival of mice compared with all other treatments. Our study shows that SP94-mediated targeting enhances antitumor efficacy by improving tumor pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution, allowing large amounts of antitumor drugs to accumulate in tumors.",Biodistribution; Drug delivery system; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Ligand-targeted therapeutics; Pharmacokinetics,"doxorubicin; nanoparticle; vinorelbine tartrate; antineoplastic agent; drug carrier; liposome; peptide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer survival; cancer therapy; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug distribution; drug dosage form comparison; drug efficacy; drug formulation; encapsulation; liver cell carcinoma; mean residence time; mouse; near infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; outcome assessment; priority journal; survival analysis; tumor xenograft; animal; drug screening; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; molecularly targeted therapy; procedures; SCID mouse; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Drug Carriers; Humans; Liposomes; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, SCID; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Nanoparticles; Peptides; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85040339871

Methods Five databases were searched, including PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, Scopus and NIH clinical trial, to find randomized control trials published before June 2017. Qualitative analysis and meta-analysis were undertaken to examine the difference between the quality of video-instructed and audio-instructed dispatcher-instructed bystander CPR. Results The database search yielded 929 records, resulting in the inclusion of 9 relevant articles in this study. Of these, 6 were included in the meta-analysis. Initiation of chest compressions was slower in the video-instructed group than in the audio-instructed group (median delay 31.5 s; 95% CI: 10.94–52.09). The difference in the number of chest compressions per minute between the groups was 19.9 (95% CI: 10.50–29.38) with significantly faster compressions in the video-instructed group than in the audio-instructed group (104.8 vs. 80.6). The odds ratio (OR) for correct hand positioning was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.53–1.30) when comparing the audio-instructed and video-instructed groups. The differences in chest compression depth (mm) and time to first ventilation (seconds) between the video-instructed group and audio-instructed group were 1.6 mm (95% CI: ?8.75, 5.55) and 7.5 s (95% CI: ?56.84, 71.80), respectively. Conclusions Video-instructed DI-CPR significantly improved the chest compression rate compared to the audio-instructed method, and a trend for correctness of hand position was also observed. However, this method caused a delay in the commencement of bystander-initiated CPR in the simulation setting. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Audio-assisted DI-CPR; Bystander CPR; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); Dispatch-instructed CPR (DI-CPR); Emergency medical service (EMS); Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA); Video-assisted DI-CPR,Article; assisted ventilation; audio assisted dispatcher instructed bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation; hand; health care quality; human; intermethod comparison; meta analysis; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); resuscitation; systematic review; time; video assisted dispatcher instructed bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation; emergency health service; emergency medical dispatcher; heart massage; mobile phone; out of hospital cardiac arrest; procedures; resuscitation; time to treatment; videoconferencing; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Cell Phone; Emergency Medical Dispatcher; Emergency Medical Service Communication Systems; Heart Massage; Humans; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time-to-Treatment; Videoconferencing,2-s2.0-85039736025

However, systolic function via endocardial measurements is similar between patients with primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension. Speckle-Tracking echocardiography is a sensitive tool which can detect subclinical impairments in systolic function. The aim of this study was to investigate aldosterone-induced subclinical impairments in systolic function. Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension and analyzed their clinical data, biochemical data, and echocardiographic parameters, including myocardial strain [global longitudinal strain (GLS)]. Results: Thirty-six patients with primary aldosteronism and 31 patients with essential hypertension were enrolled for analysis. The patients with primary aldosteronism had significantly lower serum potassium levels, lower plasma renin activity, higher aldosterone-To-renin ratio (ARR), and higher 24-h urinary aldosterone levels than patients with essential hypertension. With regards to echocardiographic parameters, the patients with primary aldosteronism had a thicker ventricular wall and higher LV mass index than those with essential hypertension. Most importantly, we found significant degradation of GLS in the patients with primary aldosteronism compared with those with essential hypertension (-17.84 ± 2.36 vs.-20.13 ± 2.32, P < 0.001). In correlation analysis, GLS was significantly correlated with serum potassium level, LV mass index, log-Transformed plasma renin activity, log-Transformed ARR, and log-Transformed 24-h urinary aldosterone levels (all P < 0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis further identified log-Transformed ARR (β = 0.771, 95% confidence interval: 0.011-1.530, P = 0.047), and log-Transformed 24-h urinary aldosterone level (β = 1.765, 95% confidence interval: 0.01-3.529, P = 0.050) as independent factors correlated with GLS. Conclusion: Patients with primary aldosteronism have a lower magnitude of GLS than patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that aldosterone induces a subclinical decline in LV systolic function. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In order to better select patients for SRVRT, this study aimed to evaluate the value of a risk-based radiation field based on PLN location and number in PLN-positive cervical cancer. Methods: We reviewed 198 patients with FIGO stage IB2–IVA cervical cancer, positive PLNs, and negative para-aortic lymph nodes (PALNs) from 2004 to 2015 at two tertiary centers. All patients underwent pelvic radiotherapy (PRT) or SRVRT with IMRT. The SRVRT extended the PRT field cranially to the level of the left renal vein. The prescribed doses were 45–50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy per fraction. Results: Overall, 118 and 80 patients underwent PRT and SRVRT, respectively. The SRVRT group had more advanced disease based on FIGO stage, common iliac PLNs, and number of PLNs. The median follow-up was 63 months (range: 7–151 months). PALN failure was experienced by 28 patients (23.7%) in the PRT group and 1 patient (1.3%) in the SRVRT group (p < 0.001). Compared with PRT, SRVRT significantly improved 5-year PALN recurrence-free survival (56.8% vs. 100%, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (56.5% vs. 93.9%, p < 0.001) among patients with common iliac PLNs or ? 3 PLNs. No significant differences were observed in these outcomes among patients with PLNs below the common iliac bifurcation and 1–2 PLNs. The SRVRT did not increase severe toxicities. Conclusions: Risk-based radiation field based on PLN location and number could optimize outcomes for PLN-positive cervical cancer. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Cervical cancer; Clinical outcome research; Intensity-modulated radiation therapy; Para-aortic irradiation,"cisplatin; squamous cell carcinoma antigen; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; adult; aged; anemia; Article; brachytherapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer specific survival; distant metastasis free survival; female; follow up; gastrointestinal symptom; gastrointestinal toxicity; high risk population; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; leukopenia; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; paraaortic lymph node; patient compliance; pelvis lymph node; priority journal; progression free survival; radiation dose; radiation field; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; senescence; thrombocytopenia; treatment outcome; urogenital tract disease; uterine cervix cancer; aorta; chemoradiotherapy; clinical trial; drug administration; intensity modulated radiation therapy; lymph node metastasis; middle aged; multicenter study; pelvis tumor; procedures; radiotherapy; tumor recurrence; uterine cervix tumor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Aorta; Chemoradiotherapy; Cisplatin; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Pelvic Neoplasms; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Treatment Outcome; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85038822037

A novel DTX-loaded LsbMDDs was optimally prepared by a thin-film hydration method and then hydrated with a lecithin nanosuspension while being subjected to ultrasonication. Physical characteristics of the optimized DTX-loaded LsbMDDs formulations were examined and found to have a mean size of &lt;200 nm, an encapsulation efficiency of &gt;90%, and drug loading of &gt;6% with stability at room temperature and at 4 °C being longer than 2 and 7 days, respectively. The in vitro release of DTX from the DTX-loaded LsbMDDs was slower than that from the generic product of DTX (Tynen?). A cell viability assay demonstrated that the LsbMDDs showed better cytotoxicity than Tynen? against CT26 cancer cells. The in vivo antitumor efficacy of the DTX-loaded LsbMDDs was observed to be better than that of Tynen? in a CT26 tumor-bearing mice model. A high-dose regimen of the DTX-loaded LsbMDDs formulation showed greater inhibition of DU145 tumor growth than did Tynen?, but with less to similar systemic toxicity.

The role of the right ventricle in VA-ECMO has been emphasized, but quantitative right ventricular (RV) analysis in this population has been lacking. Three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) is currently suggested for RV volumetric analysis. The aims of this study were to assess 3DE-derived RV ejection fraction (RVEF) in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock stabilized by VA-ECMO and to explore the association between 3DE-derived RVEF and weaning success as well as the prognosis after the first intent of decannulation. Methods: Three-dimensional echocardiographic data sets before the first intent of decannulation were retrospectively selected and analyzed in 46 patients who underwent VA-ECMO for refractory acute circulatory collapse. Results: Twenty-eight of the 46 patients had protocol-defined success in weaning from VA-ECMO. In the success group, both ventricles were smaller and had better pumping function. By stepwise multivariate linear regression, RV free wall strain, left ventricular ejection fraction, RV fractional area change, and central venous pressure were found to be independently associated with RVEF. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that RVEF had the highest area under the curve (0.90, P <.001) for weaning success with a cutoff value of 24.6%. Worse RVEF (?24.6%) was also associated with poor prognosis in terms of all-cause mortality within 30 days (hazard ratio, 15.86; 95% CI, 3.56–70.73; P <.001). Conclusions: Three-dimensional echocardiography–derived RVEF might represent the composite results of RV contractility, left ventricular performance, and fluid status. Under mechanical circulatory support of VA-ECMO, RVEF > 24.6% was associated with higher weaning success and lower 30-day mortality after the first intent of decannulation. ? 2017 American Society of Echocardiography",Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; Right ventricular ejection fraction; Volumetric analysis,"adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cardiogenic shock; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; decannulation; extracorporeal oxygenation; extracorporeal therapy; female; heart catheterization; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart ventricle contractility; human; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; predictive value; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility; thoracotomy; three dimensional echocardiography; venoarterial extracorporeal life support; very elderly; young adult; cardiogenic shock; diagnostic imaging; heart left ventricle function; heart right ventricle function; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; retrospective study; three dimensional echocardiography; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Shock, Cardiogenic; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Function, Right",2-s2.0-85032199216

We evaluated the effects of EGFR mutation status on responses and outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with BM, treated with upfront or salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Methods and materials: From 2008 to 2015, 147 eligible NSCLC patients with 300 lesions were retrospectively analyzed. Patterns of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy were recorded. Radiographic response was assessed. Brain progression-free survival (BPFS) and overall survival were calculated and outcome prognostic factors were evaluated. Results: Median follow-up time was 13.5 months. Of the EGFR-genotyped patients, 79 (65%) were EGFR mutants, and 42 (35%) were wild type. Presence of EGFR mutations was associated with higher radiographic complete response rates (CRR). Median time to develop new BM after SRS was significantly longer for mutant-EGFR patients (17 versus 10.5 months, p = 0.02), predominantly for those with adjuvant TKI therapy (26.3 versus 15 months, p = 0.01). EGFR mutations independently predicted better BPFS (HR = 0.55, p = 0.048) in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: In patients with NSCLC treated with SRS for BM, the presence of EGFR mutations is associated with a higher CRR, longer time for distant brain control, and better BPFS. The combination of SRS and TKI in selective patient group can be an effective treatment choice for BM with favorable brain control and little neurotoxicity. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Brain metastases; EGFR mutation; Non-small cell lung cancer; Stereotactic radiosurgery,"bevacizumab; epidermal growth factor receptor; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; adjuvant chemotherapy; adjuvant therapy; adult; aged; Article; brain metastasis; brain radiography; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer surgery; cancer survival; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; dysarthria; exon; female; follow up; gene mutation; headache; human; limb weakness; major clinical study; male; memory disorder; middle aged; neurotoxicity; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; postoperative complication; priority journal; progression free survival; radiation necrosis; retrospective study; salvage therapy; seizure; slurred speech; stereotactic radiosurgery; thorax radiography; tumor volume; brain tumor; disease free survival; enzymology; genetics; lung tumor; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; predictive value; procedures; radiosurgery; secondary; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiosurgery; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Retrospective Studies; Salvage Therapy",2-s2.0-85032187749

This 1-year, retrospective study was designed to assess the incidence and clinical determinants of IMI in centers in five countries (Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, China, India). Patients treated in a single year (2012) were identified through discharge diagnoses, microbiology, and histopathology logs, and entered based on published definitions of IMI. A total of 155 cases were included (median age 54 years; 47.7% male). Of these, 47.7% had proven disease; the remainder had probable IMI. The most frequent host factors were prolonged steroid use (39.4%) and recent neutropenia (38.7%). Common underlying conditions included diabetes mellitus (DM; 30.9%), acute myeloid leukemia (19.4%), and rheumatologic conditions (11.6%). DM was more common in patients with no recent history of neutropenia or prolonged steroid use (P = .006). The lung was the most frequently involved site (78.7%), demonstrating a range of features on computed tomography (CT). Aspergillus was the most common mould cultured (71.6%), primarily A. fumigatus and A. flavus, although proportions varied in different centers. The most often used antifungal for empiric therapy was conventional amphotericin. Ninety-day mortality was 32.9%. This is the first multicenter Asian study of IMI not limited to specific patient groups or diagnosticmethods. It suggests that DM and rheumatologic conditions be considered as risk factors for IMI and demonstrates that IMI should not be ruled out in patients whose chest features on CT do not fit the conventional criteria. ?

However, the protean disease manifestations and inaccessibility to diagnostic tests in clinical settings hamper its early diagnosis. Here, we sought to determine whether QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube (QFT-GIT), a commercialized IFN-γ release assay, could be used to screen for neutralizing anti-IFN-γ Abs among previously healthy adults with DNTM infection. Methods: Non-HIV patients with DNTM infection were prospectively enrolled for the QFT-GIT assays. We measured their plasma concentration of anti-IFN-γ Abs and their neutralizing capacity through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. We then analysed the correlation between QFT-GIT results and the presence of neutralizing anti-IFN-γ Abs among patients with and without previously recognized immunosuppression, respectively. Results: Irrespective of the autoantibody concentration or disease activity, all patients with neutralizing anti-IFN-γ Abs (100%, 30/30) had indeterminate QFT-GIT results because of extremely low or undetectable IFN-γ levels in the mitogen tubes. None of the four DNTM patients who were previously healthy and tested negative of anti-IFN-γ Abs had an indeterminate QFT-GIT result, and their IFN-γ levels in the mitogen tube were significantly higher than those of the patients with anti-IFN-γ Abs (8.28 IU/mL vs. 0.05 IU/mL, p 0.001). Conclusion: An indeterminate QFT-GIT result because of undetectable or extremely low IFN-γ level in the mitogen tube suggests the presence of neutralizing anti-IFN-γ Abs in a previously healthy patient with DNTM infection. ? 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",Anti-IFN-γautoantibodies; Clinical utility; Disseminated NTM infections; IGRA; QuantiFERON,"C reactive protein; gamma interferon; neutralizing antibody; STAT1 protein; autoantibody; gamma interferon; neutralizing antibody; adult; aged; antibody blood level; antibody detection; antibody screening; Article; clinical article; controlled study; disease activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; human; male; mycobacteriosis; Mycobacterium abscessus; Mycobacterium avium complex; Mycobacterium chelonae; Mycobacterium fortuitum; Mycobacterium gordonae; Mycobacterium kansasii; nonhuman; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; atypical mycobacteriosis; immunology; interferon gamma release assay; middle aged; procedures; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Autoantibodies; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Interferon-gamma Release Tests; Male; Middle Aged; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous",2-s2.0-85027467124

This is the first guideline that explicitly describes the quality and strength of the evidence to support these recommendations. The strengths of the recommendations are the quality of the evidence, the balance between benefits and harms, resource and cost. The guidelines are not intended nor recommended as a substitute for bedside judgment in the management of individual patients, the advice of qualified health care professionals, and more recent evidence concerning therapeutic efficacy and emergence of resistance. Practical considerations for individualized selection of antifungal agents include patient factors, pathogen, site of infection and drug-related factors, such as drug–drug interaction, drug-food intervention, cost and convenience.

ACO is of considerable interest as it is currently poorly characterised and has been associated with worse health outcomes and higher healthcare costs compared with COPD or asthma alone. Patients with ACO in Asia remain poorly described, and there is limited information regarding their resource utilisation compared with patients with asthma or COPD only. This study investigated the characteristics, disease burden and medical resource utilisation of patients with ACO in Taiwan. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients identified from National Health Insurance (NHI) claims data in Taiwan in 2009-2011. Patients were classified into incident ACO, COPD or asthma cohorts according to International Classification of Disease, ninth revision, clinical modification codes in claims. Eligible patients were ?40 years of age with 12 months' continuous enrolment in the NHI programme pre- and post-index date (date of the first relevant medical claim). Results: Patients with ACO (N = 22,328) and COPD (N = 69,648) were older and more likely to be male than those with asthma (N = 50,293). Patients with ACO had more comorbidities and exacerbations, with higher medication use: short-acting β 2 -agonist prescriptions ranged from 30.4% of patients (asthma cohort) to 43.6% (ACO cohort), and inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β 2 -agonist combination prescriptions ranged from 11.1% (COPD cohort) to 35.0% (ACO cohort) in the 12 months following index. Patients with ACO generally had the highest medication costs of any cohort (long-acting muscarinic antagonist costs ranged from $227/patient [asthma cohort] to $349/patient [ACO cohort]); they also experienced more respiratory-related hospital visits than patients with asthma or COPD (mean outpatient/inpatient visits per patient post-index: 9.1/1.9 [ACO cohort] vs 5.7/1.4 [asthma cohort] and 6.4/1.7 [COPD cohort]). Conclusions: Patients with ACO in Taiwan experience a greater disease burden with greater healthcare resource utilisation, and higher costs, than patients with asthma or COPD alone. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Asthma; Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Epidemiology; Medical resource utilisation; Taiwan,"beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; corticosteroid; corticosteroid; adult; aged; Article; asthma; asthma chronic obstructive lung disease overlap; asthma chronic obstructive lung disease overlap; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; disease burden; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug cost; female; health care cost; health care utilization; hospital care; hospital patient; human; ICD-9; ICD-9-CM; incidence; lung disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; national health insurance; outpatient; population research; retrospective study; Taiwan; age; ambulatory care; asthma; chronic obstructive lung disease; economics; health care planning; hospitalization; recurrent disease; sex factor; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care; Asthma; Drug Costs; Female; Health Resources; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Symptom Flare Up; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85040981901

In addition, PC-immobilized surfaces have been used as a nonfouling coating to prevent nonspecific protein binding. By appropriately using the features of PC-immobilized surfaces, including specific recognition to CRP and nonfouling surface, it is reasonable to create an antibody-free biosensor for the specific capture of CRP. In this study, PC-functionalized 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomers were used to prepare PC-immobilized surfaces. The density of PC groups on the surface can be fine-tuned by changing the composition of the monomer solutions for the electropolymerization. The density of PC group was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The specific interaction of CRP with PC groups was monitored by using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). The amount of protein binding could be estimated by the reduction in frequency readout. Through the QCM-D measurement, we revealed the nonfouling property and the specific CRP capture from our PC-immobilized surfaces. Notably, the dissipation energy also dropped during the binding process between CRP and PC, indicating the release of water molecules from the PC groups during CRP adsorption. We anticipate that surface-bound water molecules are mainly released from areas near the immobilized PC groups. Based on Hofmeister series, we further examined the influence of ions by introducing four different anions including both kosmotrope (order maker) and chaotrope (disorder maker) into the buffer for the CRP binding test. The results showed that the concentration and the type of anions play an important role in CRP binding. The present fundamental study reveals deep insights into the recognition between CRP and surface-immobilized PC groups, which can facilitate the development of CRP sensing platforms. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding energy; Bins; Biochemistry; Electropolymerization; Ions; Molecules; Monomers; Proteins; Quartz; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; 3 ,4 ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT); Cardio-vascular disease; Fundamental studies; Non-fouling coatings; Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation; Specific interaction; Specific recognition; Surface-bound water; Quartz crystal microbalances; C reactive protein; fused heterocyclic rings; phosphorylcholine; poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene); polymer; protein binding; animal; bovine; chemistry; quartz crystal microbalance; surface property; Animals; Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic; C-Reactive Protein; Cattle; Phosphorylcholine; Polymers; Protein Binding; Quartz Crystal Microbalance Techniques; Surface Properties",2-s2.0-85041080545

Material and Methods: Biopsy records of the participating institutions were reviewed for oral cancer cases diagnosed from 2005 to 2014. Demographic data and site of the lesions were collected. Sites of the lesion were subdivided into lip, tongue, floor of the mouth, gingiva, alveolar mucosa, palate, buccal/labial mucosa, maxilla and mandible. Oral cancer was subdivided into 7 categories: epithelial tumors, salivary gland tumors, hematologic tumors, bone tumors, mesenchymal tumors, odontogenic tumors, and others. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics using SPSS software version 17.0. Results: Of the 474,851 accessioned cases, 6,151 cases (1.30%) were diagnosed in the category of oral cancer. The mean age of the patients was 58.37±15.77 years. A total of 4,238 cases (68.90%) were diagnosed in males, whereas 1911 cases (31.07%) were diagnosed in females. The male-to-female ratio was 2.22:1. The sites of predilection for oral cancer were tongue, labial/buccal mucosa, gingiva, palate, and alveolar mucosa, respectively. The three most common oral cancer in the descending order of frequency were squamous cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Conclusions: Although the prevalence of oral cancer is not high compared to other entities, oral cancer pose significant mortality and morbidity in the patients, especially when discovered late in the course of the disease. This study highlights some anatomical locations where oral cancers are frequently encountered. As a result, clinicians should pay attention to not only teeth, but oral mucosa especially in the high prevalence area as well since early detection of precancerous lesions or cancers in the early stage increase the chance of patient being cured and greatly reduce the mortality and morbidity. This study also shows some differences between pediatric and elderly oral cancer patients as well as between Asian and non-Asian oral cancer patients. ? Medicina Oral S. L.

Although nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) can inhibit the reverse transcriptase of HBV and suppress its replication to levels below the detection limit, viremia often rebounds after cessation of therapy. Nuclear cccDNA serves as the HBV replicative template and exhibits extraordinary stability, and is not affected by NAs. Therefore, curing chronic hepatitis B (CHB) requires novel therapy for purging cccDNA from patients. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a newly developed programmable genome-editing tool and allows for sequence-specific cleavage of DNA. Compared to other genome-editing tools, the CRIPSR/Cas9 system is advantageous for its simplicity and flexibility of design. Theoretically, Cas9 can be redirected to specifically cleave any desired genome sequences simply by designing guide RNAs with about 20 nucleotides that match the particular sequences of genomes with downstream protospacer adjacent motifs. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the CRIPSR/Cas9 system can specifically destruct HBV genomes in vitro and in vivo. Although promising, the CRISPR/Cas9 system faces several challenges that need to be overcome for the clinical application, namely, off-target cleavage and the in vivo delivery efficiency. Cutting integrated HBV genomes by CRISPR/Cas9 also raises serious concern because this has the risk of genome instability. In summary, the CRISPR/Cas9 system bears the potential for curing CHB as long as several challenging issues can be successfully solved. ? 2017",Chronic hepatitis B; Covalently closed circular DNA; CRISPR/Cas; Genome editing; Hepatitis B virus,"alpha interferon; circular DNA; bacterial protein; Cas9 endonuclease Streptococcus pyogenes; circular DNA; endonuclease; guide RNA; virus DNA; antiviral therapy; chronic hepatitis B; CRISPR-CAS9 system; gene editing; Hepatitis B virus; human; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; viral clearance; virus genome; virus inactivation; chronic hepatitis B; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; CRISPR Cas system; DNA cleavage; genetics; genomic instability; growth, development and aging; Hepatitis B virus; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; patient safety; procedures; virology; virus replication; Bacterial Proteins; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; CRISPR-Cas Systems; DNA Cleavage; DNA, Circular; DNA, Viral; Endonucleases; Genomic Instability; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Patient Safety; RNA, Guide; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-85021103807

Methods: A total of 1962 patients with hematological malignancy were enrolled and followed-up at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 2008 and 2013. The clinical characteristics, HBV serology, and laboratory data were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: A total of 1962 patients comprising 1048 men and 914 women were studied. The median age of the patients was 55years (range, 15-97years). Chronic HBV carriage was documented at diagnosis of hematological malignancy in 286 (14.6%) patients. A total of 171 (59.8%) of the 286 HBV carriers received primary prophylaxis with anti-HBV agents. Of the HBV carriers, 97 (33.9%) developed hepatitis B reactivation during or after chemotherapy, including 59 patients who had discontinued antiviral therapy. The incidence of hepatitis B reactivation among patients with hematological malignancy and HBV carriage was 10.4 per 100 person-years. A multivariate analysis revealed hepatocellular carcinoma (p<0.001) and antiviral prophylaxis use (p<0.001) were independent risk factors of HBV reactivation in HBV carriers. Of the 1676 patients with initial negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) counts, 41 (2.4%) experienced hepatitis B reactivation, reverse seroconversion of HBsAg, and lost their protective hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). A multivariate analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus (p=0.005, odds ratio (OR): 0.218, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.076-0.629), allogeneic transplantation (p=0.013, OR: 0.182, 95% CI: 0.047-0.701), liver cirrhosis (p<0.001, OR: 0.002, 95% CI: 0-0.047), low anti-HBs titers (p=0.016, OR: 0.020, 95% CI: 0.001-0.480), and positive hepatitis B core antibody (p=0.013, OR: 0.070, 95% CI: 0.009-0.571) were independent risk factors of positive seroconversion of HBsAg in patients with hematological malignancy. Conclusions: The incidence of HBV reactivation among the patients with varying subtypes of hematological malignancy is similar.

Recently, several antiangiogenic agents (lenvatinib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab) have demonstrated antitumor activity for advanced HCC in randomized controlled trials. However, the landscape of drug development for HCC may change dramatically with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, particularly the anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD1) agents. In addition, early-phase clinical trials of combination of anti-PD-1 and antiangiogenic agents have shown very promising anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced HCC. Therefore, the critical research questions at present are whether this combination strategy will be the next generation of standard therapy and which antiangiogenic agents will be the optimal partner for the combination. All of the 4 multikinase inhibitors for HCC (sorafenib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, and cabozantinib) have been reported to have immune modulatory effects. The authors systematically reviewed the pre-clinical evidence of their immune modulatory effects to explore whether these effects were mediated by angiogenesis inhibition or by other off-target effects on the tumor microenvironment. Studies of sorafenib comprised the majority (58 of the 71) of the research articles reviewed. Potentially beneficial effects on anti-tumor immunity may result from increased M1 polarization of macrophages and stimulation of CD8 T cell function. On the other hand, high dosage of the kinase inhibitors in pre-clinical models and hypoxia associated with angiogenesis may contribute to immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Sorafenib and other multikinase inhibitors may promote anti-tumor immunity through modulation of multiple immune cell types as well as the tumor microenvironment. The optimal immune modulatory dosage should be defined to facilitate design of future combination regimens. ? 2018 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.",cabozantinib; immune checkpoint inhibitor; lenvatinib; regorafenib; sorafenib,"angiogenesis inhibitor; cabozantinib; lenvatinib; protein serine threonine kinase inhibitor; ramucirumab; sorafenib; anilide; antineoplastic agent; cabozantinib; carbanilamide derivative; lenvatinib; monoclonal antibody; PDCD1 protein, human; programmed death 1 receptor; protein kinase inhibitor; pyridine derivative; quinoline derivative; ramucirumab; regorafenib; advanced cancer; antiangiogenic therapy; antineoplastic activity; cancer immunotherapy; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical trial; drug megadose; human; immunosuppressive treatment; liver cell carcinoma; natural killer cell; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; T lymphocyte; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; antagonists and inhibitors; clinical trial (topic); immunology; immunotherapy; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; molecularly targeted therapy; procedures; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Anilides; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Immunotherapy; Liver Neoplasms; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Phenylurea Compounds; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Pyridines; Quinolines",2-s2.0-85055607014

Numerous studies have shown that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 concentrations are decreased in AD, when measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and other conventional immunoassays. While most studies report no change in plasma Aβ42, independent studies using the immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) technique report an increase in plasma Aβ42 levels in AD. To confirm the opposite changes of Aβ42 levels in CSF and plasma for AD, we assayed the levels of Aβ42 in plasma of subjects with known CSF Aβ42 levels. In total 43 controls and 63 AD patients were selected at two sites: the VU University Medical Center (n?=?55) and Sahlgrenska University Hospital (n?=?51). IMR and ELISA were applied to assay Aβ42 in plasma and CSF, respectively. We found a moderately negative correlation between plasma and CSF Aβ42 levels in AD patients (r?=?-0.352), and a weakly positive correlation in controls (r?=?0.186). These findings further corroborate that there are opposite changes of Aβ42 levels in CSF and plasma in AD.

Not only aging-associated alterations but also the metabolic factors such as hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and obesity affect articular tissues and may initiate or exacerbate the OA. The poor self-healing ability of articular cartilage due to limited regeneration in chondrocytes further adversely affects the osteoarthritic microenvironment. Traditional and current surgical treatment procedures for OA are limited and incapable to reverse the damage of articular cartilage. To overcome these limitations, cell-based therapies are currently being employed to repair and regenerate the structure and function of articular tissues. These therapies not only depend upon source and type of stem cells but also on environmental conditions, growth factors, and chemical and mechanical stimuli. Recently, the pluripotent and various multipotent mesenchymal stem cells have been employed for OA therapy, due to their differentiation potential towards chondrogenic lineage. Additionally, the stem cells have also been supplemented with growth factors to achieve higher healing response in osteoarthritic cartilage. In this review, we summarized the current status of stem cell therapies in OA pathophysiology and also highlighted the potential areas of further research needed in regenerative medicine.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved virotherapy for use in cancer treatment; however systemic administration remains as a particular challenge. Here we report exploitation of tumor lactate production in designing a hypoxia-responsive carrier, self-assembled from hyaluronic acid (HA) conjugated with 6-(2-nitroimidazole)hexylamine, for localized release of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2). The carrier is loaded with lactate oxidase (LOX) and is permeable to small molecules such as the lactate that accumulates in the tumor. Subsequently, LOX oxidizes the lactate to pyruvate inside the carrier, accompanied by internal lowering of oxygen partial pressure. Bioreduction of the 2-nitroimidazole of the HA conjugated with 6-(2-nitroimidazole)hexylamine converts it into a hydrophilic moiety and electrostatically dissociates the carrier and virus. Efficacious and specific delivery was proven by transduction of a photosensitive protein (KillerRed), enabling significant limitation in tumor growth in vivo with photodynamic therapy. An approximate 2.44-fold reduction in tumor weight was achieved after a 2-week course, compared with control groups. Furthermore, conjugation of the AAV2 with iron oxide nanoparticles (""magnetized"" AAV2) facilitated magnetic resonance imaging tracking of the virus in vivo. Taken together, the solid tumor microenvironment promotes bioreduction of the lactate-responsive carrier, providing rapid and specific delivery of AAV2 for light-triggered virotherapy via systemic administration. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",lactate oxidase; nanoparticle; photodynamic therapy; tumor microenvironment; virotherapy,"Controlled drug delivery; Hyaluronic acid; Iron oxides; Magnetic resonance imaging; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Photodynamic therapy; Tumors; Viruses; Food and Drug Administration; Iron oxide nanoparticle; Lactate oxidase; Oxygen partial pressure; Recombinant adeno-associated virus; Systemic administration; Tumor microenvironment; Virotherapy; Targeted drug delivery; antineoplastic agent; lactate 2-monooxygenase; lactic acid; mixed function oxidase; nanoparticle; photosensitizing agent; animal; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; cell culture; cell proliferation; chemistry; drug effect; HEK293 cell line; human; isolation and purification; lung tumor; metabolism; mouse; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nude mouse; Parvovirinae; pathology; photochemotherapy; tumor microenvironment; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Lactic Acid; Lung Neoplasms; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Nanoparticles; Parvovirinae; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85054607704

This study investigates the possibility of such interactions within the cortical synaptic compartments of APP/PS1 mice. We used label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to study the phosphoproteome of synaptosomes, covering 2400 phosphopeptides and providing an unbiased survey of phosphorylation changes associated with amyloid pathology. Hyperphosphorylation was detected on 36 synaptic proteins, many of which are associated with the cytoskeleton. Importantly, tau is one of the most hyperphosphorylated proteins at the synapse, upregulated at both proline-directed kinase (PDK) sites (S199/S202, S396/S404) and nonPDK sites (S400). These PDK sites correspond to well-known pathological tau epitopes in AD patients, recognized by AT8 and PHF-1 antibodies, respectively. Hyperphosphorylation at S199/S202, a rarely examined combination, was further validated in patient-derived human synaptosomes by immunoblotting. Global surveys of upregulated phosphosites revealed 2 potential kinase motifs, which resemble those of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5, a PDK) and casein kinase II (CK2, a nonPDK). Our data demonstrate that, within synaptic compartments, amyloid pathology is associated with tau hyperphosphorylation at disease-relevant epitopes. This provides a plausible mechanism by which Ab promotes the spreading of tauopathy. ? 2018 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

The reagent for assaying p-tau181 with IMR was synthesized, and its analytic performances were characterized. Seventy-three subjects were recruited. Each participant was examined with neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and IMR assay for plasma p-tau181. Using commercially available IMR kits, the plasma total tau protein (T-tau) of each subject was assayed. The dynamic range for assaying p-tau181 using IMR was 1.96×10-2 pg/ml to 104 pg/ml. There was no significant interference from total tau protein in the assay of p-tau181. The measured concentrations of plasma p-tau181 were 2.46±1.09 pg/ml for healthy controls, 4.41±1.85 pg/ml for MCI due to AD, and 6.14±1.59 pg/ml for very mild AD. Meanwhile, the measured concentrations of plasma T-tau were 18.85±10.16 pg/ml for healthy controls, 32.98±10.18 pg/ml for MCI due to AD, and 37.54±12.29 pg/ml for very mild AD. A significant difference in plasma p-tau181 was observed between healthy controls and MCI due to AD (p &lt; 0.001) and between MCI due to AD and very mild AD (p &lt; 0.001). However, for the plasma T-tau concentration, a significant difference existed only between healthy controls and MCI due to AD (p &lt; 0.001). This implies that the plasma p-tau181 level is correlated more to AD severity than plasma T-tau is. Additionally, p-tau181 was observed as approximately 14% of T-tau in human plasma. ? 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

Like trastuzumab, LAP is commonly used alongside anthracyclines as a combination therapy, due to enhanced anti-cancer efficacy. However, this is notably associated with cardiotoxicity so it is imperative to understand the mechanisms driving this cardiotoxicity and develop cardioprotective strategies. To this end, here we utilize human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs), which exhibit several characteristics representative of in vivo cardiomyocytes that make them breakthrough models to study drug toxicity. Methods: We investigated LAP- and doxorubicin (DOX)-induced toxicity in hPSC-CMs and evaluated the involvement of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS). The significance of iNOS-mediated cardiotoxicity was furthermore evaluated in animal studies. Results: LAP synergistically increased DOX toxicity in hPSC-CMs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At concentrations that were otherwise non-apoptotic when administered separately, LAP significantly potentiated DOX-induced hPSC-CM apoptosis. This was accompanied by increased iNOS expression and pronounced production of NO. iNOS inhibition significantly reduced hPSC-CM sensitivity to LAP and DOX co-treatment (LAP-plus-DOX), leading to reduced apoptosis. Consistent with our observations in vitro, delivery of an iNOS inhibitor in mice treated with LAP-plus-DOX attenuated myocardial apoptosis and systolic dysfunction. Moreover, inhibition of iNOS did not compromise the anti-cancer potency of LAP-plus-DOX in a murine breast cancer xenograft model. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that iNOS inhibition is a promising cardioprotective strategy to accompany HER2-inhibitor/anthracycline combination therapies. Furthermore, these results support the promise of hPSC-CMs as a platform for investigating cardiotoxicity and developing cardioprotectants as a whole. ?

Previous genetic association studies have demonstrated that several cytokine pathways play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and other types of SpA. In addition to several well-known proinflammatory cytokines, recent studies suggest that IL-17 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SpA. Further evidence from human and animal studies have defined that IL-17 and IL-17-producing cells contribute to tissue inflammation, autoimmunity, and host defense, leading to the following pathologic events associated with SpA. Recently, several clinical trials targeting IL-17 pathways demonstrated the positive response of IL-17 blockade in treating AS, indicating a great potential of IL-17-targeting therapy in SpA. In this review article, we have discussed the contributing role of IL-17 and different IL-17-producing cells in the pathogenesis of SpA and provided an outline of therapeutic application of the IL-17 blockade in the treatment of SpA.

We created back wounds in 72 mice and treated them with or without topical curcumin (0.2 mg/mL) in Pluronic F127 gel (20%) daily for 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 days. Healing in wounds was evaluated from gross appearance, microscopically by haematoxylin and eosin staining, by immunohistochemistry for tumour necrosis factor alpha and alpha smooth muscle actin, and by polymerase chain reaction amplification of mRNA expression levels. Treatment caused fast wound closure with well-formed granulation tissue dominated by collagen deposition and regenerating epithelium. Curcumin increased the levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha mRNA and protein in the early phase of healing, which then decreased significantly. However, these levels remained high in controls. Levels of collagen were significantly higher in curcumin-treated wounds. Immunohistochemical staining for alpha smooth muscle actin was increased in curcumin-treated mice on days 7 and 12. Curcumin treatment significantly suppressed matrix metallopeptidase-9 and stimulated alpha smooth muscle levels in tumour necrosis factor alpha-treated fibroblasts via nuclear factor kappa B signalling.

Contrast agents must be utilized to enhance the image resolution. At present, microbubbles (MBs) and nanobubbles (NBs) are the main contrast reagent candidates for improving the signal resolution. Fluorescence upconversion nanoparticles provide high sensitivity and also function as nanocarriers. This can label tumor cells in a specific organ under irradiation of near-infrared (NIR) light. However, despite the use of NIR light, the penetration depth of NIR is only approximately 15 mm. Thus, we combine fluorescence with ultrasonic imaging to achieve the effect of multiple imaging and solve the low penetration depth of fluorescence imaging and the poor resolution of ultrasound imaging. The dual imaging modalities achieved higher resolution or signal to noise ratios. In this study, Nd3+-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are combined with graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (CNs) and embedded in NBs (UCNP-CN@NBs). The UCNPs are excited by 808 nm light and emit visible and ultraviolet light. Then, the energy of the ultraviolet light is transferred to the CNs to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic therapy. Ultrasonic waves are also used to promote NB bursting and the release of ROS molecules in photodynamic therapy, leading to cancer cell apoptosis. ? 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Cell death; Diagnosis; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Medical imaging; Nanoparticles; Photodynamic therapy; Semiconductor quantum dots; Signal to noise ratio; Tumors; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultraviolet radiation; Cancer cell apoptosis; Fluorescence upconversion; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Near infrared light; Reactive oxygen species; Ultra-violet light; Upconversion nanoparticles; Visible and ultraviolet; Fluorescence imaging,2-s2.0-85044412191

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 994 participants completed a self-reported online questionnaire. Structural equation modeling and χ2 difference testing were conducted to compare the predictive capability of the proposed health consciousness TRAM (HC-TRAM) and the TRAM. The comparison of the proposed HC-TRAM in terms of potential and actual users of dietary and fitness apps was also discussed. Findings: The results obtained from the HC-TRAM and the TRAM indicate that in addition to technology readiness, HC exerts a positive effect on the perceived ease of use and usefulness of dietary and fitness apps. χ2 difference test results indicated that the predictive capability of the proposed HC-TRAM is higher than that of the TRAM. Practical implications: The drivers and inhibitors of a person’s readiness to embrace modern information technology play roles when predicting his or her intention to download and use dietary and fitness apps. HC should be promoted by encouraging people to eat right and regularly perform appropriate exercise to prevent obesity and overweight, thereby maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

However, identification of molecular targets as biomarker for elevating therapeutic efficacy is critical to prolong HCC patient survival. Here, we showed that EIF3C (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit C) is upregulated during HCC tumor progression and associated with poor patient survival. Expression of EIF3C did not alter proliferation and expression of other tumor progressive genes such as HIF1A, TGFβ1 and VEGF, but reduced cell migration in HCC cells. Nevertheless, expression of EIF3C in HCC cells significantly increase secretion of extracellular exosomes confirmed by increased exosomes labelling by PKH26 fluorescent dye, vesicles in exosome size detected by electronic microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis, and expression of divergent exosome markers. The EIF3C-increased exosomes were oncogenic to potentiate tumor angiogenesis via tube formation of HUVEC cells and growth of vessels by plugs assays on nude mice. Subcutaneous inoculation of EIF3C-exosomes mixed with Huh7 HCC cells not only promoted growth of vessels but also increased expression of EIF3C in tumors. Conversely, treatment of exosome inhibitor GW4869 reversed aforementioned oncogenic assays. We identified EIF3C activated expression of S100A11 involved in EIF3C-exosome increased tube formation in angiogenesis. Simultaneous high expression of EIF3C and S100A11 in human HCC tumors for RNA level in TCGA and protein level by IHC are associated with poor survival of HCC patients. Collectively, our results demonstrated that EIF3C overexpression is a potential target of angiogenesis for treatment with exosome inhibitor or S100A11 reduction to suppress HCC angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. ?

Therefore, the aims of this study were to identify oxygen-responsive long non-coding RNAs in breast cancer cells, and to delineate their regulatory mechanisms. The expression profiling of long non-coding RNAs in breast cancer cells growing under normoxic, hypoxic, and re-oxygenated conditions was examined using next-generation sequencing technology. Four hundred and seventy-two lncRNAs oxygen-responsive lncRNAs were identified. After examining the top three differentially expressed lncRNAs in hypoxia, we selected N-Myc Downstream Regulated Gene 1-Overlapping 1 (NDRG1-OT1) for further study, especially the most responsive isoform, NDRG1-OT1_ v4. We overexpressed NDRG1-OT1_v4 under normoxia and performed microarray analysis to identify 108 NDRG1-OT1_v4 regulated genes and their functions. Among these genes, we found that both NDRG1 mRNA expression and NDRG1 protein levels were inhibited by NDRG1-OT1_v4. Finally, we used co-immunoprecipitation to show that NDRG1-OT1_v4 destabilizes NDRG1 by promoting ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.

Many methods have been developed for the treatment and prevention of this disease. Determining the expression patterns of certain target genes in specific subtypes of breast cancer is important for developing new therapies for breast cancer. In the present study, we performed a holistic approach to screening the mRNA expression of six members of the cell division cycle-associated gene family (CDCA) with a focus on breast cancer using the Oncomine and The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) databases. Furthermore, Gene Expression-Based Outcome for Breast Cancer Online (GOBO) was also used to deeply mine the expression of each CDCA gene in clinical breast cancer tissue and breast cancer cell lines. Finally, the mRNA expression of the CDCA genes as related to breast cancer patient survival were analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier plot. CDCA3, CDCA5, and CDCA8 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher than the control sample in both clinical tumor sample and cancer cell lines. These highly expressed genes in the tumors of breast cancer patients dramatically reduced patient survival. The interaction network of CDCA3, CDCA5, and CDCA8 with their co-expressed genes also revealed that CDCA3 expression was highly correlated with cell cycle related genes such as CCNB2, CDC20, CDKN3, and CCNB1. CDCA5 expression was correlated with BUB1 and TRIP13, while CDCA8 expression was correlated with BUB1 and CCNB1. Altogether, these findings suggested CDCA3, CDCA5, and CDCA8 could have a high potency as targeted breast cancer therapies. ?

Methods: From 2010 to 2016, patients undergoing epicardial ablation for VAs were consecutively enrolled. The clinical characteristics, disease entity, electrophysiological studies, and ablation outcome were extracted for further analysis. Results: A total of 80 patients were eligible, including 34 patients for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), 16 for Brugada syndrome (BrS), 13 for idiopathic VAs, 11 for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM), 2 for ischemic cardiomyopathy, and 4 for other nonischemic cardiomyopathies (NICM). Epicardial ablation rendering VAs non-inducible was achieved in 78 patients (97.5%). There were no procedure-related deaths.Major complications were reported in 8 (10.0%) patients, including an acute hemopericardium in 5 (6.3%), delayed tamponade in 1 (1.3%), hemothorax in 1 (1.3%), and major pericardial reaction in 1 (1.3%). Two (2.7%) patients died due to causes other than procedure-related deaths. After a mean follow-up of 31 ± 15 months, 20 patients (25.0%) presented with VA recurrences, including 13 with ARVC, 1 with BrS, 1 with idiopathic VAs, 4 with IDCM, and 1 with other NICM. Conclusions: In this tertiary referral center’s experience, the complication rate of an epicardial approach was acceptable. Patients with NICM displayed a growing trend for a referral for epicardial ablation. The long-term follow-up demonstrated that an epicardial ablation for idiopathic VAs and BrS was associated with a better prognosis than that for the other etiologies. ? 2018, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

Gout is not a new disease, which was first documented nearly 5,000 years ago. The prevalence of gout has increased globally in recent years, imposing great disease burden worldwide. Moreover, gout or hyperuricemia is clearly associated with a variety of comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, urolithiasis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and psoriasis. To prevent acute arthritis attacks and complications, earlier use of pharmacothera-peutic treatment should be considered, and patients with hyperuricemia and previous episodes of acute gouty arthritis should receive long-term urate-lowering treatment. Urate-lowering drugs should be used during the inter-critical and chronic stages to prevent recurrent gout attacks, which may elicit gradual resolution of tophi. The goal of urate-lowering therapy should aim to maintain serum uric acid (sUA) level <6.0 mg/dL. For patients with tophi, the initial goal can be set at lowering sUA to <5.0 mg/dL to promote tophi dissolution. The goal of this consensus paper was to improve gout and hyperuricemia management at a more comprehensive level.

Selenium is an essential trace mineral possessing powerful antioxidant functions. Selenium is widely reported as an effective antioxidant against aflatoxicosis. By preventing oxidative liver damage, suppressing pro-apoptotic proteins and improving immune status in AFB1 affected animals; selenium confers specific protection against AFB1 toxicity. Meticulous supplementation of animal feed by elemental selenium in the organic and inorganic forms has proven to be effective to ameliorate AFB1 toxicity. Curcumin is another dietary agent of importance in tackling aflatoxicosis. Curcumin is one of the major active ingredients in the tubers of a spice Curcuma longa L., a widely reported antioxidant, anticarcinogenic agent with reported protective potential against aflatoxin-mediated liver damage. Curcumin restricts the aflatoxigenic potential of Aspergillus flavus. Curcumin inhibits cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, particularly CYP2A6 isoform; thereby reducing the formation of AFB1-8, 9-epoxide and other toxic metabolites causing aflatoxicosis. In this review, we have briefly reviewed important aflatoxicosis symptoms among animals. With the main focus on curcumin and selenium, we have reviewed their underlying protective mechanisms in different animals along with their extraction and production methods for feed applications. ? 2018 by the authors.

This study aimed to explore the association between BZRA use and hospitalization for pneumonia in a general population. Methods This population-based nested case-control study used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2002 and 2012. We included only new users who did not have any BZRA prescriptions on record in the preceding 2 years and identified 12,002 subjects who were hospitalized for pneumonia (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 480-486, and 507) and 12,002 disease risk score-matched control subjects. A logistic regression model was used to determine the association of BZRA use and hospitalization for pneumonia. The exposure date, dose-response relationship, and class of BZRAs were comprehensively assessed. Results Current BZRA exposure was associated with hospitalization for pneumonia (adjusted OR [aOR],1.86; 95% CI, 1.75-1.97). Benzodiazepine hypnotic agents (aOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 2.16-2.71) had a higher risk of pneumonia than did benzodiazepine anxiolytic agents (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.44-1.63) or nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agents (aOR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.46-1.76). The pneumonia risk was increased with ultrashort-acting and short- to intermediate-acting agents, a higher defined daily dose, and the number of BZRAs used. Among individual BZRAs examined, midazolam had a higher risk (aOR, 5.77; 95% CI, 4.31-7.73) of hospitalization for pneumonia than did the others. Conclusions This study suggests that there is a dose-response relationship between current BZRA use and the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia. In addition, benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, especially midazolam, present a greater risk of hospitalization for pneumonia. These findings reinforce the importance of a careful analysis of the benefits vs the risks of BZRA use. ? 2017 American College of Chest Physicians",benzodiazepine-receptor agonist; midazolam; pneumonia,alprazolam; benzodiazepine receptor stimulating agent; bromazepam; brotizolam; chlordiazepoxide; clobazam; clonazepam; clorazepate; diazepam; estazolam; fludiazepam; flunitrazepam; flurazepam; lorazepam; lormetazepam; medazepam; midazolam; nimetazepam; nitrazepam; nordazepam; oxazepam; oxazolam; triazolam; zaleplon; zolpidem; zopiclone; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor stimulating agent; anxiolytic agent; clonazepam; hypnotic sedative agent; adult; age; aged; Article; case control study; Charlson Comorbidity Index; controlled study; disease association; dose response; drug exposure; drug use; female; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pneumonia; population research; priority journal; risk; sex difference; chemically induced; hospitalization; pneumonia; register; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Case-Control Studies; Clonazepam; Female; GABA-A Receptor Agonists; Hospitalization; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia; Registries; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85040169214

Methods: Our study subjects were patients with newly diagnosed SLE aged 18 and older who received at least 1 prescription of systemic GC between 2001 and 2012 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The earliest prescription date of systemic GC for each subject was defined as the index date. For each subject, we calculated the average prednisolone-equivalent dose and the medication possession ratio (MPR) of GC use every 90 days for each patient after the index date. Patients with a diagnosis of AE (defined by the International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical Modification diagnosis code) during the followup were also identified from the NHIRD. Generalized estimating equations adjusted for propensity score were applied to examine the association between longitudinal GC use and risks of prespecified AE (musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, ophthalmologic, infectious, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, metabolic, and dermatologic diseases). Results: We identified 11,288 patients with SLE (mean followup: 6.28 yrs). Higher doses and higher MPR of GC were associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis [adjusted OR (aOR) 2.87-9.09]. Similar results were found regarding the risk of osteoporosis (aOR 1.71-3.67), bacterial infection (aOR 2.12-3.89), Cushingoid syndrome (aOR 6.51-62.03), and sleep disorder (aOR 1.42-3.59). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the dose and intensity of longitudinal use of GC were both associated with risk of AE among a nationwide Asian SLE cohort.

In HCC patients, sorafenib-a multikinase inhibitor drug-has been reported to exert anti-fibrotic activity. However, incomplete inhibition of RAF activity by sorafenib may also induce paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in malignant cells. The consequence of this effect in non-malignant disease (hepatic fibrosis) remains unknown. This study aimed to examine the effects of sorafenib on activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and develop effective therapeutic approaches to treat liver fibrosis and prevent cancer development. Methods: We first examined the effects of sorafenib in combination with MEK inhibitors on fibrosis pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo. To improve the bioavailability and absorption by activated HSCs, we developed CXCR4-targeted nanoparticles (NPs) to co-deliver sorafenib and a MEK inhibitor to mice with liver damage. Results: We found that sorafenib induced MAPK activation in HSCs, and promoted their myofibroblast differentiation. Combining sorafenib with a MEK inhibitor suppressed both paradoxical MAPK activation and HSC activation in vitro, and alleviated liver fibrosis in a CCl4-induced murine model of liver damage. Furthermore, treatment with sorafenib/MEK inhibitor-loaded CXCR4-targeted NPs significantly suppressed hepatic fibrosis progression and further prevented fibrosis-associated HCC development and liver metastasis. Conclusions: Our results show that combined delivery of sorafenib and a MEK inhibitor via CXCR4-targeted NPs can prevent activation of ERK in activated HSCs and has anti-fibrotic effects in the CCl4-induced murine model. Targeting HSCs represents a promising strategy to prevent the development and progression of fibrosis-associated HCC. ?

We conducted an updated review of studies on DM and active TB, and found 11 more cohort studies published after the previous systematic review from 2008. The updated pooled relative risk (RR) (2.03, 95%CI 1.62-2.55) of all the studies was substantially lower than the three-fold risk increase in the previous review. Substantial heterogeneity of RR across studies was found. Possible reasons for such heterogeneity include different levels of residual confounding, the effect of modification by age, and different levels of glycemic control in the population. In a recently published systematic review onDMand LTBI, one cohort study and 12 cross-sectional studies were identified. The results from cross-sectional studies suggest a significant but modestly increased risk of LTBI among patients with DM (pooled odds ratio 1.18, 95%CI 1.06-1.30). We reviewed evidence on the population-level impact of DM on TB epidemiology in studies using population-attributable fraction analysis and infectious disease modelling.

This nationwide surveillance study investigated the prevalence and molecular characteristics of azole-resistant A. fumigatus environmental isolates in Taiwan, an island country with increasing use of azole fungicides. Of the 2760 air and soil samples screened from 2014 to 2016, 451 A. fumigatus isolates were recovered from 266 samples and 34 isolates from 29 samples displayed resistance to medical azoles (itraconazole, voriconazole or posaconazole). The resistance prevalence was 10.9% and 7.5% in A. fumigatus-positive samples and isolates respectively. Most (29, 85.3%) azole-resistant isolates harboured TR34/L98H mutations, which were widely distributed, clustered genetically with clinical isolates, and had growth rates that were similar to those of the wild-type isolates. Microsatellite genotyping revealed both the global spread of the TR34/L98H isolates and the occurrence of TR34/L98H/S297T/F495I isolates belonging to local microsatellite genotypes. AfuMDR3 and atrF, two efflux transporter genes, were constitutively upregulated in two individual resistant isolates without cyp51A mutations, highlighting their potential roles in azole resistance. These results emphasize the need for periodic environmental surveillance at the molecular level in regions in which azole fungicides are applied, and agricultural fungicide management strategies that generate less selective pressure should be investigated. ? 2017 The Authors.

Carboplatin-loaded hydrogel (oxidized hyaluronic acid/adipic acid dihydrazide) enables the sustained drug release and facilitates the synergistic effect with RT. Purpose We investigated the effectiveness and convenience of hydrogel carboplatin combined with RT for mice glioma. Materials and methods Mouse glioma cells (ALTS1C1) were subcutaneously implanted in the right thigh of C57BL/6 mice on Day 0. The mice were categorized by treatments: sham, hydrogel, hydrogel carboplatin, aqueous carboplatin, RT, hydrogel carboplatin/RT, and aqueous carboplatin/RT. Hydrogel carboplatin (300 μg single dose on Day 7) or aqueous carboplatin (100 μg daily dose on Days 7, 8, and 9) was administered via intratumoral injection. RT was delivered a daily dose of 10 Gy on Days 8 and 9. Results For mice administered hydrogel carboplatin/RT versus those administered aqueous carboplatin/RT, the 24-day tumor growth control rate and 104-day recurrence-free survival rate were 100% and 50% versus 100% and 66.7% (p = 0.648), respectively. However, mice receiving other treatments showed tumor progression by Day 24 and died within 40 days of tumor cell implantation.

Methods This case-control study enrolled 93 children with ADHD and 112 control children in north Taiwan. Six dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of OPs and oxidative stress biomarkers were analyzed. Polymorphisms of the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) were identified. Results Children with ADHD had significantly higher dimethylphosphate (DMP, 236.69 nmol/g cre. vs. 186.84 nmol/g cre., p value = 0.01) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid (HNE-MA, 28.95 ?g/g cre. vs. 16.55 ?g/g cre., p value<0.01) concentrations than control children. Children who carried DRD4 GA/AA genotypes (rs752306) were less likely than those who carried the DRD4 GG genotype to have ADHD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24–0.84). The estimated value of the AP (attributable proportion due to interaction) was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.13–1.05), indicating that 59% of ADHD cases in DMP-exposed children with the DRD4 GG genotype were due to the gene-environment interaction. After adjustment for other covariates, children who carried the DRD4 GG genotype, had been exposed to high DMP levels (more than the median), and had high HNE-MA levels had a significantly increased risk for developing ADHD (OR = 11.74, 95% CI: 2.12–65.04). Conclusion This study indicated a gene-environment interaction in the risk of ADHD in children. The association between DMP and ADHD in children might relate to the mechanism of lipid peroxidation.

However, heavy metal accumulation in paddy soil poses a health risk for rice consumption. Although plant uptake of Pb is usually low, Pb concentrations in rice plants have been increasing with Pb contamination in paddy fields. It is known that iron oxide deposits in the rhizosphere influence the absorption of soil Pb by rice plants. In this study, 14 rice cultivars bred in Taiwan, including ten japonica cultivars (HL21, KH145, TC192, TK9, TK14, TK16, TN11, TNG71, TNG84, and TY3) and four indica cultivars (TCS10, TCS17, TCSW2, and TNGS22), were used in a field experiment. We investigated the genotypic variation in rice plant Pb in relation to iron oxides deposited in the rhizosphere, as seen in a suspiciously contaminated site in central Taiwan. The results showed that the cultivars TCSW2, TN11, TNG71, and TNG84 accumulated brown rice Pb exceeding the tolerable level of 0.2 mg kg? 1. In contrast, the cultivars TNGS22, TK9, TK14, and TY3 accumulated much lower brown rice Pb (&lt; 0.1 mg kg? 1); therefore, they should be prioritized as safe cultivars for sites with potential contamination. Moreover, the iron oxides deposited on the rhizosphere soil show stronger affinity to soil-available Pb than those on the root surface to form iron plaque. The relative tendency of Pb sequestration toward rhizosphere soil was negatively correlated with the Pb concentrations in brown rice. The iron oxides deposited on the rhizosphere soil but not on the root surface to form iron plaque dominate Pb sequestration in the rhizosphere. Therefore, the enhancement of iron oxide deposits on the rhizosphere soil could serve as a barrier preventing soil Pb on the root surface and result in reduced Pb accumulation in brown rice. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Heavy metal; Iron plaque; Paddy soil; Radial oxygen loss; Root aeration,Bioaccumulation; Deposits; Health risks; Heavy metals; Iron deposits; Iron oxides; Soils; Contaminated sites; Field experiment; Genotypic variations; Heavy metal accumulation; Iron plaques; Paddy soils; Radial oxygen loss; Rhizosphere soils; Soil pollution; iron oxide; lead; ferric ion; ferric oxide; lead; bioaccumulation; biological uptake; deposition; genotype; heavy metal; iron oxide; lead; oxygen; paddy field; rhizosphere; rice; root; soil pollution; Article; bioaccumulation; controlled study; cultivar; genetic variability; genotype; nonhuman; priority journal; rhizosphere; rice; soil pollution; Taiwan; chemistry; genetics; Oryza; pharmacokinetics; plant root; rhizosphere; soil; soil pollutant; Taiwan; Japonica; Oryza sativa; Ferric Compounds; Genotype; Lead; Oryza; Plant Roots; Rhizosphere; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85027571777

Transmission of bacteria via airborne routes makes infection control difficult. Hence, rapid and accurate identification of TB from clinical sputum samples is essential for minimizing the spread of the disease. However, traditional bacterial identification methods for TB are time consuming and labor intensive. The aim of this study is to propose a straightforward and rapid screening platform for MTBC using a portable organic light-emitting diode- (OLED-) based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor integrated with a nested PCR technique. Experimentally, the limit of detection (LOD) for MTBC PCR products measurement was estimated to be around 63?pg/mL. In addition, the biosensor can successfully differentiate MTBC from other nontuberculous mycobacterium strains. In 600 clinical sputum specimens, the sensitivity and specificity were 96.6% (86/89) and 98.4% (503/511), respectively. These results indicate that the portable OLED-based SPR biosensor may be taken into account as a suitable and convenient tool employed in the remote area and developing country for diagnosing TB diseases. ? 2017",DNA; Organic light-emitting diode (OLED); Polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Portable biosensor; Surface plasmon resonance (SPR); Tuberculosis,Biosensors; Developing countries; Diagnosis; DNA; Light emitting diodes; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Plasmons; Polymerase chain reaction; Screening; Bacterial identifications; Infection control; Limit of detection; Mycobacterium tuberculosis complexes; Portable biosensors; Sensitivity and specificity; Surface plasmon resonance biosensor; Tuberculosis; Surface plasmon resonance,2-s2.0-85026384722

This study examines if DNA content abnormality detected by flow cytometry can serve as a diagnostic marker of dysplasia and facilitate risk stratification of low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and indefinite for dysplasia (IND) patients using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) BO samples with varying degrees of dysplasia. Design D N A flow cytometry was performed on 80 FFPE BO samples with high-grade dysplasia (HGD), 38 LGD, 21 IND and 14 negative for dysplasia (ND). Three to four 60-micron thick sections were cut from each tissue block, and the area of interest was manually dissected. results DNA content abnormality was identified in 76 HGD (95%), 8 LGD (21.1%), 2 IND (9.5%) and 0 ND samples. As a diagnostic marker of HGD, the estimated sensitivity and specificity of DNA content abnormality were 9 5 % and 8 5 %, respectively. For patients with DNA content abnormality detected at baseline LGD or IND, the univariate HRs for subsequent detection of HGD or oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAc) were 7.0 and 20.0, respectively (p =<0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrates the promise of DNA flow cytometry using FFPE tissue in the diagnosis and risk stratification of dysplasia in BO. The presence of DNA content abnormality correlates with increasing levels of dysplasia, as 9 5 % of HGD samples showed DNA content abnormality. DNA flow cytometry also identifies a subset of patients with LGD and IN D who are at higher risk for subsequent detection of HGD or OAC. ?

We previously found a positive association between rat mammary tumor levels of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) and tumor weight. We examined the roles of the major n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), and the major n-6 PUFA, AA, in FASN expression in, and proliferation of, human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Methods: The cells were treated for 48 h with BSA or 60 μM BSA-bound DHA, AA, or oleic acid (OA, 18:1n-9), then were incubated with or without estradiol or insulin. Western blot and 3H-thymidine incorporation assay were used to determine the role of DHA on FASN regulation and MCF-7 cell proliferation. Results: DHA, but neither AA nor OA, inhibits estradiol-induced and insulin-induced expression of the precursor of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (p-SREBP-1), its mature form (m-SREBP-1), and FASN. Estradiol or insulin stimulation increased the pAkt/Akt and pS6/S6 ratios, expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN, and cell proliferation, and these effects were decreased by DHA. The DHA-induced decrease in FASN expression resulted from reduced pAkt/Akt signaling and not pERK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, DHA enhanced the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on pAkt signaling and expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN. However, addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathways, 1 h before addition of estradiol or insulin increased the pAkt/Akt ratio and FASN expression, and this effect was inhibited by addition of DHA 48 h before rapamycin. Conclusion: We conclude that, in MCF-7 cells, DHA inhibits pAKT signaling and thus expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN and cell proliferation. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Arachidonic acid; Breast cancer; Docosahexaenoic acid; Estrogen; Fatty acid synthase; Fatty acids; Insulin; MTOR; PAKT signaling; Proliferation,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; docosahexaenoic acid; estradiol; fatty acid synthase; insulin; mammalian target of rapamycin; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; oleic acid; protein S6; rapamycin; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; thymidine; antidiabetic agent; arachidonic acid; docosahexaenoic acid; estrogen; FASN protein, human; fatty acid synthase; insulin; oleic acid; protein kinase B; SREBF1 protein, human; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; Akt signaling; antineoplastic activity; Article; cell proliferation; cell stimulation; concentration response; controlled study; drug mechanism; drug potentiation; enzyme phosphorylation; human; human cell; MCF-7 cell line; protein expression; Western blotting; breast tumor; cell proliferation; drug effect; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; signal transduction; tumor cell culture; Arachidonic Acid; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Proliferation; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Estrogens; Fatty Acid Synthase, Type I; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Oleic Acid; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-85039922443

Specific diagnostic biomarkers are lacking; hence, treatment options for OA are limited. Synovial inflammation is very common in OA joints and has been associated with both OA's symptoms and pathogenesis. Confirming the role of the synovium in OA pathogenesis is a promising strategy for mitigating the symptoms and progression of OA. CX3CL1 is the only member of the CX3C class of chemokines that combines the properties of chemoattractants and adhesion molecules. CX3CL1 levels in the synovium and serum were both discovered to be positively associated with OA pathogenesis. CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 belong to a family of G protein-coupled receptors. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are responsible for matrix degradation, play a crucial role in OA progression. The relationship between CX3CL1 and MMPs in the pathophysiology of OA is still unclear. Methods: CX3CL1-induced MMP-3 production was assessed with quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. The mechanisms of action of CX3CL1 in different signaling pathways were studied using western blot analysis, quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. Neutralization antibodies of integrin were achieved to block the CX3CR1 signaling pathway. Luciferase assays were used to study NF-ΚB promoter activity. Results: We investigated the signaling pathway involved in CX3CL1-induced MMP-3 production in osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts (OASFs). CX3CL1 was found to induce MMP-3 production in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Using pharmacological inhibitors and CX3CR1 small interfering RNA to block CX3CR1 revealed that the CX3CR1 receptor was involved in the CX3CL1-mediated upregulation of MMP-3. CX3CL1-mediated MMP-3 production was attenuated by c-Raf inhibitors (GW5074) and MEK/ERK inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126). The OASFs were stimulated using CX3CL1-activated p65 phosphorylation. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that CX3CL1 activates c-Raf, MEK, ERK, and NF-ΚB on the MMP-3 promoter through CX3CR1, thus contributing to cartilage destruction during OA. ? 2017 The Author(s).",CX3CL1; CX3CR1; Matrix metalloproteinase 3; Osteoarthritis,"1,4 diamino 1,4 bis(2 aminophenylthio) 2,3 dicyanobutadiene; 2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone; 3 (3,5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzylidene) 1,3 dihydro 5 iodo 2 indolone; chemokine receptor CX3CR1; fractalkine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; integrin; mitogen activated protein kinase; Raf protein; small interfering RNA; stromelysin; synaptotagmin I; chemokine receptor CX3CR1; CX3CL1 protein, human; CX3CR1 protein, human; fractalkine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; MMP3 protein, human; Raf protein; Raf1 protein, human; stromelysin; Article; cell stimulation; clinical article; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme synthesis; fibroblast; human; human cell; luciferase assay; osteoarthritis; pathogenesis; protein phosphorylation; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; synoviocyte; upregulation; Western blotting; biosynthesis; fibroblast; MAPK signaling; metabolism; osteoarthritis; physiology; synovium; Chemokine CX3CL1; CX3C Chemokine Receptor 1; Fibroblasts; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Matrix Metalloproteinase 3; NF-kappa B; Osteoarthritis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf; Signal Transduction; Synovial Membrane",2-s2.0-85038897330

Previous studies have shown that assembly of human CTPS cytoophidia may be correlated with the cellular metabolic status, and is able to promote the activity of CTPS. A correlation between the cytoophidium and cancer metabolism has been proposed but not yet been revealed. In the current study we provide clear evidence of the presence of CTPS cytoophidia in various human cancers and some non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, among 203 tissue samples of hepatocellular carcinoma, 56 (28%) samples exhibited many cytoophidia, whereas no cytoophidia were detected in adjacent non-cancerous hepatocytes for all samples. Our findings suggest that the CTPS cytoophidium may participate in the adaptive metabolism of human hepatocellular carcinoma. ? 2017",CTP synthase; Cytoophidium; Glutamine metabolism; Heatshock protein 90; Human hepatocellular carcinoma; Nucleotide; Protein filamentation; Pyrimidine,"cytidine triphosphate synthase; cytidine triphosphate synthase; heat shock protein 90; ligase; protein aggregate; tumor protein; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; cytoophidium; cytoplasm; female; Huh-7 cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver tissue; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; tissue microarray; chemistry; gene expression; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; pathology; tumor cell line; Aged; Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Gene Expression; Hepatocytes; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Proteins; Protein Aggregates",2-s2.0-85032961802

However, Asian data are not available. Methods This prospective cohort study included 413 patients with suspected non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in 3 hospitals in Japan and Taiwan from November 2014 to April 2017. Patients were divided into 3groups—rule-out, observe, and rule-in—according to the algorithm. Major adverse cardiovascular events were evaluated at the 30-dayfollow-up. Results The algorithm ruled out acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 171 patients with a negative predictive value and sensitivity of 100% (95% confidential interval [CI], 96.8%–100%) and 100% (95% CI, 88.0%–100%), respectively, in the rule-out group. None of the patients were diagnosed with AMI. Among the 127 patients classified into the rule-in group, 47 were diagnosed as having AMI. The positive predictive value and specificity were 33.1% (95% CI, 25.1%–41.9%) and 66.3% (95% CI, 60.2%–72.0%), respectively. Elective catheter intervention was required in 13 patients (5 in the rule-out group, 8 in the observe group) by the 30-dayfollow-up. The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) identified moderate risk in 5 patients and high risk in 8, while the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) 2.0 risk score identified low risk in 6 patients and moderate risk in 7. Conclusion The ESC0-hour/1-hour algorithm could be sufficient in Asian patients. The combination with FRS may be more precise than that with the GRACE 2.0 risk score. ? 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Emergency department; High sensitivity troponin T; Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction,"troponin T; troponin T; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; Asian; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease registry; female; Framingham risk score; heart catheterization; high risk patient; human; intermediate risk patient; Japan; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; sensitivity and specificity; Taiwan; very elderly; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; clinical trial; follow up; international cooperation; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; time factor; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Internationality; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction; Prospective Studies; Taiwan; Time Factors; Troponin T",2-s2.0-85030458241

Their impacts on the neurodevelopment of children are inconclusive. The current study aims to investigate the association between umbilical cord blood levels of BPA, NP, OP and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 and 7?years of age. Methods The study was based on the Taiwan Birth Panel Study, a prospective birth cohort. We collected cord blood plasma to measure phenolic compound levels using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In the follow-up, 208 mother-child pairs with 2-year-old children and 148 mother-child pairs with 7-year-old children were recruited in this study. We used the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers (CDIIT) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) for neurodevelopmental assessments at 2 and 7?years of age, respectively. Multiple linear regressions were used for statistical analysis. Results The detection rates of BPA, NP, and OP were 55.9%, 77.6%, and 68.3%, respectively. In this study, the median BPA, NP, and OP levels in 2-year-olds were 3.3, 72.6, and 3.3 (ng/ml), respectively. However, the median levels of BPA, NP, and OP were 3.2, 49.3, and 6.6 (ng/ml), respectively. The levels of phenolic compounds were log10-transformed for statistical analysis. Gender stratification was performed. In the WISC-IV neurocognitive assessment, we found both a significant negative association and a trend between cord blood plasma BPA levels and full-scale IQ (p for trend?&lt;?0.01), the verbal comprehension index (p for trend?&lt;?0.01), and the perceptual reasoning index (p for trend?&lt;?0.01) in the study population. After stratification by sex, significant associations were found in full-scale IQ (p for trend?=?0.03) and the verbal comprehension (p for trend?&lt;?0.01) index in boys. In girls, prenatal BPA exposure had adverse effects on full-scale IQ (p for trend?=?0.02), perceptual reasoning index (p for trend?&lt;?0.01), and working memory index (p for trend?=?0.02). None of the developmental quotients (DQs) of the CDIIT analysis were significantly associated with phenolic compound levels in cord blood based on continuous or categorical measures. Conclusion Prenatal exposure to BPA affects neurocognitive development, and this effect differs between 7-year-old boys and girls. More studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between phenolic compound exposure in utero and children's neurobehavioral development. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Bisphenol A; CDIIT; Child neurodevelopment; Nonylphenol; Octylphenol; Prenatal exposure; WISC,"Blood; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Statistical methods; Bis-phenol a; CDIIT; Neurodevelopment; Nonylphenols; Octylphenols; Prenatal exposure; WISC; Phenols; 4 octylphenol; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; nonylphenol; phenol derivative; benzhydryl derivative; endocrine disruptor; phenol derivative; blood; child health; mental health; organic compound; phenolic compound; pollution exposure; adult; Article; behavior; child; child behavior; child growth; cognition; cohort analysis; comprehension; controlled study; female; human; limit of quantitation; major clinical study; male; nerve cell differentiation; prenatal development; prenatal exposure; priority journal; prospective study; quality control; Taiwan; tandem mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; umbilical cord blood; Wechsler intelligence scale for children; working memory; child development; drug effect; liquid chromatography; pathophysiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; Taiwan; Benzhydryl Compounds; Child; Child Behavior; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Chromatography, Liquid; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Humans; Male; Phenols; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prospective Studies; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85021634740

Although various methods, such as blood examination, tissue biopsy, and radiography, for tumor detection, exist, these techniques still require further refinement. Researchers have recently explored the use of novel adjuvant methods, specifically luminescence imaging detection, for the detection of tumors. The light-triggered approach is less invasive and induces fewer side effects than traditional detection methods. This paper highlights recent advances in the design, property tuning, and applications of nanoparticles that exhibit upconversion under 808 nm excitation. When doped with neodymium ions, upconverted nanoparticles gain the ability to absorb 808 nm light. The advantageous unique features of 808 nm light include deep tissue penetration and limited thermal side effects. The 808 nm-excited upconverted nanoparticles exhibit superior potential for use in biosensing, bioimaging, therapy, and three-dimensional display. Thus, innovative theranostic nanoplatforms can be developed by incorporating 808 nm-excited upconverted nanoparticles with phototherapy agents. Such a composite technique is expected to possess the individual advantages of each material. ?

In this work, we synthesized a poly(AA-b-NIPAAm) copolymer (PAA-b-PNIPAAm) using a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization method. PAA-b-PNIPAAm and a cationic protein (protamine) were self-assembled into nanogels, which effectively reduced the cytotoxicity of protamine. The protamine/PAA-b-PNIPAAm nanogels were responsive to the stimuli including temperature, pH, and enzyme due to disaggregation of PAA-b-PNIPAAm, change in random coil/α-helix conformation of protamine, and enzymatic hydrolysis of the protein. Changing the pH from 7.4 to a lowered pHe (6.5-5.0) resulted in an increase in mean particle size and smartly converted surface charge from negative to positive. The cationic nanogels easily passed through the cell membrane and enhanced intracellular localization and accumulation of doxorubicin-loaded nanogels in multidrug resistant MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cells. Cold shock treatment triggered rapid intracellular release of doxorubicin against P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated drug efflux, showing significantly improved anticancer efficacy as compared with free DOX. Furthermore, the nanogels were able to carry a rose bengal photosensitizer and caused significant damage to the multidrug resistant cancer cells under irradiation. The cationic nanogels with stimuli-responsive properties show promise as drug carrier for chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy against cancers. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",enzymatic digestion; N-isopropylacrylamide; nanogels; pH-responsive; protamine; thermoresponsive,"copolymer; doxorubicin; enzyme; nanocarrier; nanogel; photosensitizing agent; protein; rose bengal; unclassified drug; acrylic acid resin; antineoplastic agent; doxorubicin; drug carrier; nanoparticle; photosensitizing agent; poly-N-isopropylacrylamide; protamine; Article; breast cancer; cell proliferation; cell viability; cellular distribution; conformational transition; controlled drug release; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug synthesis; hydrolysis; in vitro study; MCF-7 cell line; NCI-ADR-RES cell line; pH; phase transition; photocytotoxicity; photodynamic therapy; polymerization; priority journal; protein conformation; surface charge; temperature; tumor microenvironment; breast tumor; cell membrane permeability; chemistry; drug effect; drug resistance; gel; human; multidrug resistance; pathology; pH; photochemotherapy; procedures; temperature; Acrylic Resins; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Membrane Permeability; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers; Drug Resistance, Multiple; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gels; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; MCF-7 Cells; Nanoparticles; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Protamines; Temperature; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85037640260

OBJECTIVE To quantitatively evaluate the 3-D characteristics of polypoidal structures, branching vascular networks (BVNs), and origin of PCV using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and multiple image systems. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, observational studywas conducted in 47 consecutive Taiwanese patients (47 eyes) from May 21, 2015, to April 30, 2017. All participants were scanned with the Optovue-RTVue-XR-Avanti OCTA system. Patients in whom PCV was identified on OCTA were examined to define characteristics and structures of the original spouting vessels (stalks) from the choroid, polypoidal structures, and BVNs on OCTA. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Quantitative analysis of 3-D structures of the polypoidal complex. RESULTS Among the 47 patients, the mean (SD) patient age was 68.9 (8.0) years, and 28 (59.6%) men were included. Clear images of polypoidal structures could be detected in 17 eyes (36.2%, 22 polypoidal structures), BVNs in 26 eyes (55.3%, 26 tufts of BVNs), and stalks of origin from the choroid in 26 eyes (55.3%, 26 stalks) on the en face plane on OCTA. All polypoidal structures were found at a mean (SD) height of 45.3 (36.1) μmabove the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) reference plane that was preset by the machine, while the BVNs were found at a mean (SD) depth of 28.6 (14.2) μm below the RPE reference plane and the choroidal stalks at 80.4 (24.4) μm below RPE reference plane. The mean (SD) thickness of polypoidal structures was 38.4 (15.5) μm and of BVNs, 60.2 (25.0) μm. The polypoidal structures were all above the Bruch membrane within the dome of the RPE detachment, the choroidal stalks were all in the choroid layer. The BVNs could be either above (up to 18 μm), within, or below (up to 28 μm) the Bruch membrane and were in proximity to the double layers of flattened RPE detachment.

Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor is approved for metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epithermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-nega-tive breast cancer. The nature of cell cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in TNBC cells. Retinoblastoma (RB, a known substrate of CDK4/6) pathway deregulation is a frequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in RB-proficient TNBC models. In addition, recent studies reported that anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical efficacy in androgen-receptor (AR)-positive TNBC cells. Here we examined the effect of palbociclib in combination with an anti-androgen enzalutamide in TNBC cells. Method MDA-MB-453, BT-549, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Protein expressions were assessed by Western blot analysis. Cytostatic effect was examined by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. Results Palbociclib showed inhibitory effect in RB-proficient TNBC cells, and enzalutamide inhibited cell viability in AR-positive TNBC cells. Enzalutamide treatment could enhance the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells. In addition, palbociclib-mediated G1 arrest in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells was attenuated by RB knockdown. Conclusion Our study provided a preclinical rationale in selecting patients who might have therapeutic benefit from combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with AR antagonists. Copyright: ? 2017 Liu et al.

Family-centered care for preterm infants in Western societies has yielded short- to medium-term benefits. However, the intervention effects have rarely been validated in Eastern societies. Objective. The aim of this study was to examine whether a family-centered intervention program (FCIP) could improve the short-term medical and neurobehavioral outcomes in preterm infants with very low birth weight (VLBW; a birth weight of < 1,500 g) in Taiwan over the outcomes seen with a usual care program (UCP). Design. This was a multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial study. Setting. Three medical centers in northern and southern Taiwan were the locations for the study. Participants. The participants were 251 VLBW preterm infants without severe perinatal complications. Intervention. The infants were randomly assigned to receive the FCIP or the UCP during hospitalization. Measurements. Infant morbidities, feeding, growth, and neurobehavioral performance were evaluated during the neonatal period. Parental adherence to interventions was measured in the FCIP group. Results. The FCIP promoted earlier full enteral feeding (β = -1.1 weeks; 95% CI = -1.9 to -0.2 weeks) and hospital discharge (β = -0.6 week; 95% CI = -1.1 to -0.1 weeks), greater weight gain (β = 3.3 g/d; 95% CI = 0.1 to 6.6 g/d), and better neurobehavioral performance than the UCP (β = 1.2 points; 95% CI = 0.2 to 2.3 points). Furthermore, a higher degree of parental motivation in interventions, goal attainment, and comprehensiveness of home activities was significantly associated with greater effects in infants' neurobehavioral performance and weight gain (r =.20-.31; all Ps <.05). Limitations. The findings may not be generalized to preterm infants with severe perinatal diseases and parents with a low level of interest in interventions. Conclusions. Family-centered care facilitated short-term medical and neurobehavioral outcomes in VLBW preterm infants in Taiwan; the effects were likely achieved through parental adherence to interventions. The designated strategies may be considered in a future launch of family-centered care in Taiwan. ? 2017 American Physical Therapy Association.",,"clinical trial; controlled study; family nursing; female; human; male; multicenter study; newborn; newborn intensive care; organization and management; prematurity; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; Taiwan; treatment outcome; very low birth weight; Family Nursing; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infant, Premature, Diseases; Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Intensive Care, Neonatal; Male; Single-Blind Method; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85038130074

This large population-based study demonstrated that patients with osteoporosis had a 1.82-fold higher risk of developing BPPV than those without osteoporosis through the use of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Purpose: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most frequent causes of vertigo. Osteoporosis reflects a homeostatic imbalance in the rate of bone turnover, with the rate of bone resorption exceeding that of bone formation. Recent evidence has indicated that osteoporosis is a risk factor for BPPV. We aimed to validate the risk of BPPV in osteoporotic patients through a nationwide, population-based, cohort study. Methods: Patients treated for osteoporosis were identified from entries made in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) between 2000 and 2013. Each osteoporosis patient was age- and sex-matched with four randomly selected subjects without osteoporosis. We compared the incidence rates of BPPV in the two cohorts (with and without osteoporosis) and identified risk factors. Results: We identified 6649 osteoporosis patients and 26,596 match controls. According to the incidence of BPPV among the two groups, patients with osteoporosis were found to have a 1.82-fold higher risk of developing BPPV than those without osteoporosis. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) between osteoporotic patients and the control cohort was 2.0 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This large population-based study demonstrated that patients with osteoporosis were associated with an increased risk for BPPV. The results of this study provide some insight into the management of BPPV. ? 2017, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",BPPV; Osteoporosis; Vertigo,"adult; Article; benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; bone density; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; evaluation study; female; high risk patient; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; osteoporosis; population research; priority journal; retrospective study; aged; benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; bone remodeling; case control study; complication; factual database; middle aged; osteoporosis; risk factor; Taiwan; Aged; Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo; Bone Remodeling; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Risk Factors; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85037027000

This study provides a 5-year epidemiological overview of NTM-PI in Taiwan and investigated its predictors. The clinical relevance of each respiratory NTM isolate in six hospitals between 2008 and 2014 was determined according to current guidelines. Recurrent episodes were judged by serial bacteriological results. New episodes of NTM-PI and pulmonary colonization (PC) occurring since 2010 were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of NTM-PI. Between 2010 and 2014, the incidence rate of NTM-PI was 46.0 episodes per 100,000 hospital-based patient-years. Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAC) was predominant in Northern Taiwan, whereas MAC and M. abscessus were copredominant in Southern Taiwan. Multiple episodes occurred in 9.5% of NTM-PI patients. No female predominance was observed, except for MAC-PI. Previous pulmonary tuberculosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were the most common pulmonary comorbidities and independent risk factors for NTM-PI. Other risk factors included M. kansasii, M. abscessus, and southern Taiwan. Geographical variation of NTM-PI exists in Taiwan. Clinicians should keep a high suspicion on NTM-PI in the risk population. In endemic area of tuberculosis and COPD, there may be no female predominance in NTM-PI. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"adult; aged; atypical mycobacteriosis; atypical Mycobacterium; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical trial; embryology; female; human; lung; lung tuberculosis; male; metabolism; microbiology; middle aged; multicenter study; pathogenicity; retrospective study; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare Infection; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Nontuberculous Mycobacteria; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary",2-s2.0-85035111680

When the skin is damaged, wound healing must be finely regulated to restore the normal function of skin tissue. Artocarpin (ARTO), a prenylated flavonoid purified from the plant Artocarpus communis, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the wound healing potential and therapeutic mechanism of ARTO. Immunohistochemical staining of neutrophils and macrophages and mouse cytokine array analysis demonstrated that ARTO accelerates inflammatory progression and subsequently decreases persistent inflammation. ARTO increases collagen production and increases human fibroblast proliferation and migration by activating the P38 and JNK pathways. Moreover, ARTO increases the proliferation and migration of human keratinocytes through the ERK and P38 pathways and augments human endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation through the Akt and P38 pathways. Together, our data suggested that ARTO enhances skin wound healing, possibly by accelerating the inflammatory phase and by increasing myofibroblast differentiation, proliferation and migration of fibroblasts and keratinocytes, collagen synthesis and maturation, re-epithelialization, and angiogenesis. These findings indicate that ARTO has potential as a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of skin wounds. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,artocarpin lectin; cytokine; mannose binding lectin; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; plant lectin; protein kinase B; animal; cell motion; cell proliferation; drug effect; fibroblast; genetics; human; injuries; keratinocyte; macrophage; MAPK signaling; mouse; neutrophil; pathology; skin; wound healing; Animals; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cytokines; Fibroblasts; Humans; Keratinocytes; Macrophages; Mannose-Binding Lectins; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Neutrophils; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Plant Lectins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Skin; Wound Healing,2-s2.0-85034420406

We previously reported compassionate use of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector containing the human AADC gene (AAV2-hAADC) in four children with AADC deficiency (aged 4–6 years). In this study, we aimed to establish the efficacy and safety of this treatment. Methods We did an open-label, phase 1/2 trial at the National Taiwan University Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan). We included patients who had a definitive diagnosis and clinical symptoms of AADC deficiency (hypotonia, dystonia, and oculogyric crisis), who were older than 24 months or had skull bones suitable for stereotactic surgery, and who had an anti-AAV2 antibody titre lower than 1·0 optical density. All patients received bilateral intraputaminal injections of AAV2-hAADC (1·81 × 10 11 vg in total) through stereotactic brain surgery. Primary efficacy outcomes were an increase in the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (second edition; PDMS-2) score of greater than 10 points and an increase in homovanillic acid (HVA) or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid 12 months after gene therapy. We assessed patients at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after gene therapy, and every 6 months thereafter for one further year; all patients who received the treatment were included in the analysis. We assessed for surgical complications (cerebrospinal fluid leakage and intracerebral haemorrhage) at days 3–7 after AAV2 gene therapy, and we assessed adverse events during the follow-up evaluations for 12 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01395641. Findings Ten patients (median age 2·71 years, IQR 2·46–6·35) were enrolled from Oct 1, 2014, to Dec 2, 2015. All patients tolerated the surgeries and vector injections. One patient died from influenza B encephalitis during an endemic outbreak 10 months after treatment; therefore, 9 months of data were included in the analyses for this patient. All patients met the primary efficacy endpoint: 12 months after gene therapy, PDMS-2 scores were increased by a median of 62 points (IQR 39–93; p=0·005) and HVA concentrations by a median of 25 nmol/L (IQR 11–48; p=0·012); however, there was no significant change in 5-HIAA concentrations (median difference 0, IQR 0–5; p=0·20). In total, 101 adverse events were reported, with the most common being pyrexia (16 [16%] of 101 events) and orofacial dyskinesia (ten [10%]). 12 serious adverse events occurred in six patients, including one death (treatment-unrelated encephalitis due to influenza B infection), one life-threatening pyrexia, and ten events that led to hospital admission. Transient post-gene therapy dyskinesia occurred in all patients but was resolved with risperidone. Of 31 treatment-related adverse events, only one (patient 1) was severe in intensity, and none led to hospital admission or death. Interpretation Our findings suggest that intraputaminal injection of AAV2-hAADC is well tolerated and might improve motor development in children with AADC deficiency.

Methods: UNITY-4 (NCT02170727) was an open-label, two-cohort study in which 169 patients, treatment-naive (n?=?138) or treatment-experienced (n?=?31), received twice-daily DCV-TRIO for 12?weeks with 24?weeks of post-treatment follow-up. The primary efficacy end point was sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) in treatment-naive patients. Results: Eighty-eight (52%) patients were men, 81 (48%) Taiwanese, 78 (46%) Korean, and 10 (6%) Russian; 23 (14%) had compensated cirrhosis, and 52 (31%) were IL28B (rs1297860) non-CC genotype. Baseline resistance-associated NS5A polymorphisms (L31 and/or Y93) were detected in 25/165 (15%) patients with available genotype-1 sequencing data. SVR12 was achieved by 98.6% (136/138; 95% confidence interval: 94.9–99.8%) of treatment-naive and 100% (31/31; 95% confidence interval: 88.8–100%) of treatment-experienced patients. Both virologic failures were found to be infected with hepatitis C virus genotype-6g; 100% SVR12 was observed for genotype-1a (n?=?8) and genotype-1b (n?=?157).

It is often assumed that C. fetus infection occurs in humans as a zoonosis through food chain transmission. Here we show that mammalian C. fetus consists of distinct evolutionary lineages, primarily associated with either human or bovine hosts. We use whole-genome phylogenetics on 182 strains from 17 countries to provide evidence that C. fetus may have originated in humans around 10,500 years ago and may have ""jumped"" into cattle during the livestock domestication period. We detect C. fetus genomes in 8% of healthy human fecal metagenomes, where the human-associated lineages are the dominant type (78%). Thus, our work suggests that C. fetus is an unappreciated human intestinal pathobiont likely spread by human to human transmission. This genome-based evolutionary framework will facilitate C. fetus epidemiology research and the development of improved molecular diagnostics and prevention schemes for this neglected pathogen. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,bacterium; cattle; digestive system; domestication; food chain; genome; pathogen; phylogenetics; Article; bacterial strain; Campylobacter fetus; Campylobacter jejuni; commensal Escherichia coli; comparative study; controlled study; gene structure; Helicobacter pylori; intestine flora; livestock; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; population structure; type IV secretion system; animal; bovine; Campylobacter fetus; campylobacteriosis; cattle disease; feces; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; male; microbiology; pathogenicity; transmission; veterinary medicine; Bos; Bovinae; Campylobacter fetus; Mammalia; Ovis aries; Animals; Campylobacter fetus; Campylobacter Infections; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Male; Phylogeny,2-s2.0-85033405401

Up-regulation of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 9 (ADAM9) in lung cancer cells is correlated with metastasis to the brain. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this correlation remains to be elucidated. Since angiogenesis is an essential step for brain metastasis, microarray experiments were used to explore ADAM9-regulated genes that function in vascular remodeling. The results showed that the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), and tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT) were suppressed in ADAM9-silenced cells, which in turn leads to decreases in angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, simultaneous high expression of ADAM9 and VEGFA or of ADAM9 and ANGPT2 was correlated with poor prognosis in a clinical dataset. These findings suggest that ADAM9 promotes tumorigenesis through vascular remodeling, particularly by increasing the function of VEGFA, ANGPT2, and PLAT. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"ADAM protein; ADAM9 protein, human; angiopoietin 2; ANGPT2 protein, human; membrane protein; PLAT protein, human; tissue plasminogen activator; vasculotropin A; A-549 cell line; animal; brain tumor; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cell line; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene knockout; genetics; human; lung tumor; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); pathology; procedures; secondary; tumor cell line; vascular remodeling; A549 Cells; ADAM Proteins; Angiopoietin-2; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cells, Cultured; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockout Techniques; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Membrane Proteins; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Vascular Remodeling",2-s2.0-85033396613

We performed a retrospective analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colon tissues with fLGD from 37 patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy for inflammatory bowel disease from 1990 to 2015 at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center, to determine whether detection of aneuploidy is associated with later development of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or colorectal cancer. Medical data were collected from the patients for a mean follow-up time of 37 months. Using flow cytometry analysis of paraffin-embedded colon tissue, we detected aneuploidy in 15 of 37 samples with fLGD (40.5%). By comparison, aneuploidy was detected in 14 of 15 samples with flat HGD (93.3%) and 2 of 45 samples that were negative for dysplasia (4.4%). The univariate hazard ratio for subsequent detection of HGD or colorectal cancer in patients with fLGD and aneuploidy was 5.3 (95% CI, 1.542?24.121) within a mean follow-up time of 37 months. The presence of aneuploidy therefore identifies patients with fLGD in colon tissue who have an increased risk for HGD or colorectal cancer and may provide supportive evidence to a morphologic impression or suspicion of flat HGD. ? 2017 AGA Institute",Colon Cancer Risk Factor; Early Detection; IBD; Marker,"adult; aneuploidy; Article; clinical article; colon tissue; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; dysplasia; female; flat low grade dysplasia; flow cytometry; follow up; high grade dysplasia; human; human tissue; inflammatory bowel disease; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; retrospective study; risk assessment; California; cancer grading; cell transformation; colon; colon resection; colorectal tumor; complication; Crohn disease; disease exacerbation; early cancer diagnosis; genetics; middle aged; pathology; predictive value; prognosis; risk factor; time factor; ulcerative colitis; university hospital; Academic Medical Centers; Aneuploidy; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Colectomy; Colitis, Ulcerative; Colon; Colorectal Neoplasms; Crohn Disease; Disease Progression; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; San Francisco; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85032933675

Importantly, there is soluble RAGE (sRAGE) that forms either by alternative splicing of RAGE messenger ribonucleic acid as the endogenous soluble form of RAGE (esRAGE) or by proteolytic cleavage of full-length RAGE protein. This study aimed to investigate the associations of the plasma levels of sRAGE and esRAGE in ischemic stroke (IS) patients with and without dementia. This cross-sectional study recruited patients with IS at a university medical center. Vascular dementia was defined as the scale of Clinical Dementia Ranking (CDR)???1. Standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the plasma concentration of sRAGE and esRAGE. From November 2014 to October 2015, a total of 172 IS patients (mean age: 72.1?±?7.5?years, 64.5% male) were recruited, including 73 with CDR?=?0, 63 with CDR?=?0.5, and 36 with CDR???1. In univariate analysis, IS patients with dementia were older and had more diabetes mellitus, less atrial fibrillation, and higher post-stroke modified Rankin Scale scores than those without dementia.

However, there have been few studies have investigated the effects of carbon chain length on SFA-induced autophagy impairment and lipotoxicity. To investigate whether SFAs with shorter carbon chain lengths have differential effects on hepatic autophagy and NASH development, we partially replaced lard with coconut oil to elevate the ratio of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) in a mouse high-fat diet (HFD) and fed mice for 16 weeks. In addition, we treated HepG2 cells with different combinations of fatty acids to study the mechanisms of MCFAs-mediated hepatic protections. Our results showed that increasing dietary MCFA/LCFA ratio mitigated HFD-induced Type 2 diabetes and NASH in mice. Importantly, we demonstrated that increased MCFA ratio exerted its protective effects by restoring Rubicon-suppressed autophagy. Our study suggests that the relative amount of LCFAs and MCFAs in the diet, in addition to the amount of SFAs, can significantly contribute to autophagy impairment and hepatic lipotoxicity. Collectively, we propose that increasing dietary MCFAs could be an alternative therapeutic and prevention strategy for Type 2 diabetes and NASH. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85032279661

A Bayesian Weibull proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the effect of comorbidity, age, epidemic period and sex on the fatality rate of MERS cases and its variation across countries. The crude fatality rate of MERS cases was 32.1% (95% credibility interval (CI): 29.9%, 34.3%). Notably, the incremental change of daily death rate was most prominent during the first week since disease onset with an average increase of 13%, but then stabilized in the remaining two weeks when it only increased 3% on average. Neither sex, nor country of infection were found to have a significant impact on fatality rates after taking into account the age and comorbidity status of patients.

A prospective study to investigate the epidemiology and clinical presentation in young children hospitalized with AGE was conducted in a medical center in southern Taiwan. Methods Patients aged less than 5 years who was hospitalized due to AGE in National Cheng Kung University Hospital were enrolled from July 2014 to June 2016. The demographic information, clinical features and laboratory data were collected by chart reviews, and stool samples were sent to Centers of Disease Control, Taiwan (Taiwan CDC) for a panel of pathogen identification consisting of two viruses, nine bacteria, and five parasites. Results Totally 441 patients were enrolled in this study. Salmonella spp. was the leading cause of disease (21.8%), followed by norovirus (17.0%), Clostridium difficile (9.5%), and rotavirus (9.3%). Norovirus identification rate was the highest among patients less than 6 months of age, while Salmonella was highest among patients between 2 and 3 years old. Patients with Salmonella infection frequently presented with fever, lethargy, bloody stool, and elevated serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP); norovirus and rotavirus infection frequently presented with vomiting. Salmonella gastroenteritis also resulted in longer hospitalization and more frequent antibiotics administration. C. difficile could be isolated from both gastroenteritis patients and control children. Conclusion Salmonella spp. was the most common pathogen of AGE in hospitalized children in southern Taiwan during 2014–2016, followed by norovirus and rotavirus.

The association between low to moderate arsenic exposure and kidney disease has not been fully clarified. Study Design The association between arsenic exposure from drinking water and chronic kidney disease (CKD) was examined in a long-term prospective observational study. Setting &amp; Participants 6,093 participants 40 years and older were recruited from arseniasis-endemic areas in northeastern Taiwan. Arsenic levels were 28.0, 92.8, and 295.7 μg/L at the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, respectively. Predictor Well-water arsenic and urinary total arsenic (inorganic plus methylated arsenic species) concentrations, adjusted for urinary creatinine concentration. Outcomes Kidney diseases (ICD-9 codes: 250.4, 274.1, 283.11, 403.*1, 404.*2, 404.*3, 440.1, 442.1, 447.3, or 580-589) and CKD (ICD-9 code: 585) ascertained using Taiwan's National Health Insurance database 1998 to 2011. Measurements HRs contrasting CKD risk across arsenic exposure levels were estimated using Cox regression. Prevalence ORs for proteinuria (protein excretion ? 200 mg/g) comparing quartiles of total urinary arsenic concentrations were estimated using logistic regression. Results We identified 1,104 incident kidney disease cases, including 447 CKD cases (incidence rates, 166.5 and 67.4 per 104 person-years, respectively). A dose-dependent association between well-water arsenic concentrations and kidney diseases was observed after adjusting for age, sex, education, body mass index, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and analgesic use. Using arsenic concentration ? 10.0 μg/L as reference, multivariable-adjusted HRs for incident CKD were 1.12 (95% CI, 0.88-1.42), 1.33 (95% CI, 1.03-1.72), and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.00-1.77) for arsenic concentrations of 10.1 to 49.9, 50.0 to 149.9, and ?150.0 μg/L, respectively (P for trend = 0.02). The association between arsenic concentration and kidney diseases was stronger for women (P for interaction = 0.06). Arsenic values in the range of 50th to 75th and 75th to 100th percentiles of total urinary arsenic concentrations were associated with 50% and 67% higher prevalences, respectively, of proteinuria. Limitations Kidney diseases and CKD outcomes were based on diagnostic codes. Glomerular filtration rates were not available. Other heavy metals were not measured. Conclusions This study describes the temporal relationship between arsenic concentrations ? 10 μg/L in drinking water and CKD. A dose-dependent association between well-water arsenic concentration and kidney diseases was observed. Higher creatinine-adjusted urinary total arsenic concentrations were associated with a higher prevalence of proteinuria. ? 2017 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.",Arsenic; arsenic toxicity; chronic kidney disease (CKD); drinking water; environmental exposure; gender; modifiable risk factor; prospective study; proteinuria; renal disease; sex differences; Taiwan; well water contamination,"alcohol; analgesic agent; arsenic; creatinine; drinking water; well water; drinking water; adult; age; alcohol consumption; Article; body mass; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); controlled study; creatinine urine level; educational status; endemic disease; environmental exposure; female; glomerulus filtration rate; human; ICD-9; incidence; male; observational study; prevalence; prospective study; proteinuria; sex; smoking; Taiwan; aged; chemistry; chronic kidney failure; environmental exposure; middle aged; multivariate analysis; proteinuria; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Arsenic; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Incidence; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prevalence; Proteinuria; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Taiwan; Water Wells",2-s2.0-85028343316

The analytic properties of the IMR assay on tau protein were investigated. The limit of detection was found to be 0.026 pg/ml. Other properties such as Hook effect, assay linearity, dilution recovery range, reagent stability, interference test, and spiked recovery were also characterized. The ultra-sensitive IMR assay was applied to detect the plasma tau protein levels of subjects with prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and vascular dementia (VD). The concentrations of plasma tau protein in patients with VD, PD, MCI due to AD, FTD, and AD patients were higher than that of healthy controls. Using an ROC curve analysis, the cutoff value for discriminating dementia patients from healthy controls was 17.43 pg/ml, resulting in 0.856 and 0.727 for clinical sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 0.908. These results imply that the IMR plasma tau assay would be useful to screen for prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"tau protein; aged; blood; chemistry; degenerative disease; diagnostic test; evaluation study; feasibility study; human; mass screening; middle aged; plasma; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Plasma; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; tau Proteins",2-s2.0-85028029592

A total of 5,483 adults (with a mean age of 66.4 and 73.3% male) with established coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral artery disease were identified from the T-SPARCLE multi-center registry. Of them, 38.6% had diabetes. The residual risk factors for MACE are divergent in these atherosclerotic patients with and without diabetes. In diabetic subpopulation, the risk of MACE was significantly increased with heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4-5 (vs. stage 1-2), without beta blocker use, and higher non-HDL-C, after controlling for covariates including statin use and the intensity of therapy. Increased LDL-C and TG levels were also associated with increased risk, but to a much less extent. Among nondiabetic individuals, HF, CKD stage 4-5, and history of myocardial infarction were the significant independent predictors of MACE. It is suggested that ASCVD patients with concomitant diabetes need stricter control of lipid, particularly non-HDL-C levels, to reduce cardiovascular risk when on statin therapy. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,biological marker; lipid; aged; atherosclerosis; blood; diabetes mellitus; diabetic complication; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; risk factor; Aged; Atherosclerosis; Biomarkers; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85028027200

High hydrogen ion concentration (acidosis) found in synovial fluid in RA patients is associated with disease severity. Acidosis signaling acting on proton-sensing receptors may contribute to inflammation and pain. Previous studies focused on the early phase of arthritis (<5 weeks) and used different arthritis models, so elucidating the roles of different proton-sensing receptors in the chronic phase of arthritis is difficult. We intra-articularly injected complete Freund's adjuvant into mice once a week for 4 weeks to establish chronic RA pain. Mice with knockout of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) or transient receptor potential/vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1) showed attenuated chronic phase (>6 weeks) of RA pain. Mice with T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) knockout showed attenuated acute and chronic phases of RA pain. TDAG8 likely participates in the initiation of RA pain, but all three genes, TDAG8, TRPV1, and ASIC3, are essential to establish hyperalgesic priming to regulate the chronic phase of RA pain. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"Accn3 protein, mouse; acid sensing ion channel; biological marker; CD68 antigen, human; cytokine; differentiation antigen; G protein coupled receptor; GPCR25 protein, mouse; leukocyte antigen; TRPV1 receptor; vanilloid receptor; animal; arthralgia; blood; complication; disease model; experimental arthritis; female; gene expression; genetics; hyperalgesia; immunohistochemistry; immunology; knockout mouse; macrophage; male; metabolism; mouse; pathology; pathophysiology; rheumatoid arthritis; Acid Sensing Ion Channels; Animals; Antigens, CD; Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic; Arthralgia; Arthritis, Experimental; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Biomarkers; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gene Expression; Hyperalgesia; Immunohistochemistry; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; TRPV Cation Channels",2-s2.0-85027882281

Methods: The Taiwan Society of Aldosteronism (TSA) Task Force acknowledges the above-mentioned issues and reached this Taiwan PA consensus at its inaugural meeting, in order to provide updated information of internationally acceptable standards, and also to incorporate our local disease characteristics into the management of PA. Results: When there is suspicion of PA, a plasma aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) should be obtained initially. Patients with abnormal ARR will undergo confirmatory laboratory and image tests. Subtype classification with adrenal venous sampling (AVS) or NP-59 nuclear imaging, if AVS not available, to lateralize PA is recommended when patients are considered for adrenalectomy. The strengths and weaknesses of the currently available identification methods are discussed, focusing especially on result interpretation. Conclusion: With this consensus we hope to raise more awareness of PA among medical professionals and hypertensive patients in Taiwan, and to facilitate reconciliation of better detection, identification and treatment of patients with PA. ? 2017",Guideline; Primary aldosteronism; TAIPAI; TSA,"6beta iodomethyl 19 norcholest 5(10) en 3beta ol i 131; aldosterone; renin; 6beta iodomethyl 19 norcholest 5(10) en 3beta ol; aldosterone; renin; adrenal blood flow; adrenal scintiscanning; aldosterone blood level; aldosterone urine level; Article; blood sampling; captopril challenge test; consensus development; diagnostic procedure; enzyme blood level; genotype; immunohistochemistry; primary hyperaldosteronism; saline infusion test; screening test; somatic mutation; symptomatology; Taiwan; urinalysis; adrenalectomy; blood; consensus; human; hyperaldosteronism; medical society; pathophysiology; scintiscanning; x-ray computed tomography; Adosterol; Adrenalectomy; Aldosterone; Consensus; Humans; Hyperaldosteronism; Radionuclide Imaging; Renin; Societies, Medical; Taiwan; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85025452700

We aimed to investigate the role of microRNA let-7g in phenotypic switching. Bioinformatics prediction was used to find let-7g target genes in the PDGF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Kr?ppel-like factor-4 (KLF4) signalling pathway that affects VSMC phenotypic switching. The luciferase reporter assay and let-7g transfection were used to confirm let-7g target genes. Two contractile proteins alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and calponin were VSMC-specific genes and were measured as the indicators for VSMC phenotype. Lentivirus carrying the let-7g gene was injected to apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE?/?) mice to confirm let-7g's effect on preventing atherosclerosis. Through the PDGF/MEKK1/ERK/KLF4 signalling pathway, PDGF-BB can inhibit α-SMA and calponin. The PDGFB and MEKK1 genes were predicted to harbour let-7g binding sites, which were confirmed by our reporter assays. Transfection of let-7g to VSMC also reduced PDGFB and MEKK1 levels. Moreover, we showed that let-7g decreased phosphorylated-ERK1/2 while had no effect on total ERK1/2. KLF4 can reduce VSMC-specific gene expression by preventing myocardin–serum response factor (SRF) complex from associating with these gene promoters. The immunoprecipitation assay showed that let-7g decreased the interaction between KLF4 and SRF. Further experiments demonstrated that let-7g can increase α-SMA and calponin levels to maintain VSMC in the contractile status. Injection of lentivirus carrying let-7g gene increased let-7g's levels in aorta and significantly decreased atherosclerotic plaques in the apoE?/? mice. We demonstrated that let-7g reduces the PDGF/MEKK1/ERK/KLF4 signalling to maintain VSMC in the contractile status, which further reduce VSMC atherosclerotic change. ? 2017 The Authors.

Developing a noninvasive measure for monitoring the progression of this disease is critical. The present study tested the effectiveness of using ultrasound Nakagami imaging to evaluate the severity of the dystrophic process. A total of 47 participants (40 with DMD and 7 healthy controls) were recruited. Patients were classified into stage 1 (presymptomatic and ambulatory), stage 2 (early nonambulatory), and stage 3 (late nonambulatory). All participants underwent ultrasound examinations on the rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius. The results revealed that the ultrasound Nakagami parameter correlated positively with functional severity in the patients with DMD. The median Nakagami parameter of the gastrocnemius muscle increased from 0.50 to 0.85, corresponding to the largest dynamic range between normal and stage 3. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnosing walking function were 85.52%, 76.31%, and 94.73%, respectively. The Nakagami parameter of the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius muscles correlated negatively with the 6-minute walking distance in the ambulatory patients. Therefore, changes in the Nakagami parameter for the gastrocnemius muscle are suitable for monitoring disease progression in ambulatory patients and for predicting ambulation loss. Ultrasound Nakagami imaging shows potential for evaluating patients with DMD. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"adolescent; adult; algorithm; case control study; child; diagnostic imaging; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; echography; human; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; preschool child; sensitivity and specificity; skeletal muscle; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ultrasonography; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85021675742

Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), which is a member of sirtuin family, plays a dual role either in cancer promotion or suppression. There is no report about the role of SIRT1 in the human chondrosarcoma cells. Resveratrol is a potent activator of SIRT1. However, its effects on chondrosarcoma have not been extensively studied. Here, we investigated the role of SIRT1 induction by resveratrol in human chondrosarcoma cell growth and tumor progression. Resveratrol significantly decreased cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in human chondrosarcoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. The protein expression and activity of SIRT1 were activated after treatment with resveratrol. Resveratrol significantly inhibited NF-κB signaling by deacetylating the p65 subunit of NF-κB complex, which could be reversed by siRNA-SIRT1 transfection or deacetylation inhibitor MS-275. Resveratrol induced-apoptosis involved a caspase-3-mediated mechanism. Both siRNA-SIRT1 transfection and MS-275 significantly inhibited the resveratrol-induced caspase-3 cleavage and activity in human chondrosarcoma cells. Moreover, in vivo chondrosarcoma xenograft study revealed a dramatic reduction in tumor volume and the increased SIRT1 and cleaved caspase-3 expressions in tumors by resveratrol treatment. These results suggest that resveratrol induces chondrosarcoma cell apoptosis via a SIRT1-activated NF-κB deacetylation and exhibits anti-chondrosarcoma activity in vivo. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"protein kinase R; resveratrol; SIRT1 protein, human; sirtuin 1; small interfering RNA; acetylation; animal; apoptosis; bone tumor; cell proliferation; cell survival; chondrosarcoma; disease exacerbation; drug effect; drug screening; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; mouse; pathology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Acetylation; Animals; Apoptosis; Bone Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Chondrosarcoma; Disease Progression; eIF-2 Kinase; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mice; Resveratrol; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Sirtuin 1; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85020620200

Psoriasis severity was assessed using self-reported dermatology questionnaires. Cadmium was measured using blood chemistry. Three adjusted models were applied for the interaction between serum cadmium and severity of psoriasis. Psoriasis patients had significantly higher blood cadmium (0.67 vs. 0.52 μg/L, p = 0.006). There was a strong linear increase in predicted blood cadmium values with an increase in severity of psoriasis (p for trend = 0.002).

Public controversy regarding the potential overdiagnosis and overmedication of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has continued for decades. This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan (NHIRD-TW) to explore trends in ADHD diagnosis in youths and the proportion of those receiving medication, with the aim of determining whether ADHD is overdiagnosed and overmedicated in Taiwan. Method. Youths (age ?18 years) who had at least two NHIRD-TW claims records with ADHD diagnosis between January 2000 and December 2011 were selected as the subject cohort. In total, the study sample comprised 145 018 patients with ADHD (mean age at a diagnosis of ADHD: 7.7 ± 3.1 years; 21.4% females). The number of cases of ADHD were calculated annually for each year (from 2000 to 2011), and the number of cases per year who received medication was determined as those with at least one record of pharmacotherapy (immediate-release methylphenidate, osmotic controlled-release formulation of methylphenidate, and atomoxetine) in each year. Results. The prevalence rates of a diagnosis of ADHD in the youths ranged from 0.11% in 2000 to 1.24% in 2011. Compared with children under 6 years of age, the ADHD diagnosis rates in children aged between 7 and 12 years (ratio of prevalence rates = 4.36) and in those aged between 13 and 18 years (ratio of prevalence rates = 1.42) were significantly higher during the study period. The prevalence in males was higher than that in females (ratio of prevalence rates = 4.09). Among the youths with ADHD, 50.2% received medications in 2000 compared with 61.0% in 2011. The probability of receiving ADHD medication increased with age. More male ADHD patients received medications that females patients (ratio of prevalence rates = 1.16). Conclusions. The rate of ADHD diagnosis was far lower than the prevalence rate (7.5%) identified in a previous community study using face-To-face interviews. Approximately 40-50% of the youths with ADHD did not receive any medications. These findings are not consistent with a systematic public opinion about overdiagnosis or overmedication of ADHD in Taiwan. ?

In viral infections, viruses exploit receptor-ligand interactions to latch onto cellular exterior prior to subsequent entry and invasion. In light of the selective binding affinity between viral pathogens and cells, nanoparticles cloaked in cellular membranes are herein employed for virus targeting. Using the influenza virus as a model, erythrocyte membrane cloaked nanoparticles are prepared and modified with magnetic functionalities (RBC-mNP) for virus targeting and isolation. To maximize targeting and isolation efficiency, density gradient centrifugation and nanoparticle tracking analysis were applied to minimize the presence of uncoated particles and membrane vesicles. The resulting nanoparticles possess a distinctive membrane corona, a sialylated surface, and form colloidally stable clusters with influenza viruses. Magnetic functionality is bestowed to the nanoparticles through encapsulation of superparamagnetic iron-oxide particles, which enable influenza virus enrichment via magnetic extraction. Viral samples enriched by the RBC-mNPs result in significantly enhanced virus detection by multiple virus quantification methods, including qRT-PCR, immunnochromatographic strip test, and cell-based titering assays. The demonstration of pathogen targeting and isolation by RBC-mNPs highlights a biologically inspired approach toward improved treatment and diagnosis against infectious disease threats.

We report QoL and mental health results from a LUTS prevalence study in three Asian countries. Methods: A cross-sectional, population-representative, internet-based study among individuals aged ?40 years in China, Taiwan and South Korea. Instruments included: Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS); International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS); other International Continence Society (ICS) symptom questions; health-related QoL 12-item short-form (HRQoL-SF12v2); Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Presence of LUTS was determined according to ICS criteria, with three symptom groups (storage, voiding and post-micturition). Post-stratification weighting matched the age and sex population distribution per country. Initial data analyses were based on descriptive statistics. Significance testing undertaken post hoc included: independent-samples t-test (differences in HRQoL between sexes and between individuals with/without LUTS; relationship between HRQoL score and OABSS; differences in HADS anxiety and depression scores between individuals with/without LUTS; association between HADS anxiety/depression scores and OABSS), chi-square test (association between LUTS prevalence and workplace productivity) and analysis of variance (differences in HRQoL score and in HADS anxiety/depression scores between individuals with different symptom groups, association between HADS anxiety/depression scores and IPSS). Results: In total, 8284 participants were included. HRQoL scores were significantly worse (p < 0.001) among individuals with versus without LUTS (ICS criteria): mean physical health domain scores were 61.1 (standard deviation [SD], 20.1) and 76.7 (17.0), respectively; corresponding mental health domain scores were 34.8 (12.7) and 43.7 (10.7). Workplace productivity was best among individuals without LUTS (difficulties reported by 2-3% of individuals), and worst in those with all three ICS symptom groups (difficulties reported by 29-38% of individuals; p = 0.001). Mean HADS scores showed significantly worse (p < 0.001) levels of anxiety and depression among individuals with versus without LUTS: anxiety, 6.5 (SD, 3.7) and 4.0 (3.3); corresponding mean depression scores were 6.8 (4.3) and 4.2 (3.6). Increasing OAB severity was also associated with decreasing HRQoL physical and mental health scores. Conclusion: LUTS and increasing OAB severity are both associated with impaired QoL, reduced workplace productivity, and increased tendency towards anxiety and depression. These results highlight the need to ensure that individuals with LUTS receive appropriate, effective treatment.

In growing hair follicles (HF), quiescent stem cells (SC) are maintained in the bulge region, and hair bulbs at the base contain rapidly dividing, yet genotoxicity-sensitive transit-amplifying cells (TAC) that maintain hair growth. How genotoxicity-induced HF injury is repaired remains unclear. We report here that HFs mobilize ectopic progenitors from distinct TAC compartments for regeneration in adaptation to the severity of dystrophy induced by ionizing radiation (IR). Specifically, after low-dose IR, keratin 5? basal hair bulb progenitors, rather than bulge SCs, were quickly activated to replenish matrix cells and regenerated all concentric layers of HFs, demonstrating their plasticity. After high-dose IR, when both matrix and hair bulb cells were depleted, the surviving outer root sheath cells rapidly acquired an SC-like state and fueled HF regeneration. Their progeny then homed back to SC niche and supported new cycles of HF growth. We also revealed that IR induced HF dystrophy and hair loss and suppressed WNT signaling in a p53- and dose-dependent manner. Augmenting WNT signaling attenuated the suppressive effect of p53 and enhanced ectopic progenitor proliferation after genotoxic injury, thereby preventing both IR- and cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia. Hence, targeted activation of TAC-derived progenitor cells, rather than quiescent bulge SCs, for anagen HF repair can be a potential approach to prevent hair loss from chemotherapy and radiotherapy. ?2017 AACR.",,"keratin; protein p53; alkylating agent; cyclophosphamide; cytokeratin 5; alopecia; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cell plasticity; cell proliferation; cell regeneration; controlled study; depletion; disease severity; dystrophy; extracellular matrix; female; genotoxicity; hair follicle cell; hair growth; hair loss; hair root; ionizing radiation; low energy radiation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; progeny; stem cell; stem cell niche; transit amplifying cell; Wnt signaling; alopecia; animal; C57BL mouse; cell proliferation; confocal microscopy; cytology; gene expression; genetics; hair follicle; knockout mouse; metabolism; pathophysiology; regeneration; stem cell; transgenic mouse; Alopecia; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating; Cell Proliferation; Cyclophosphamide; Female; Gene Expression; Hair Follicle; Keratin-5; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Microscopy, Confocal; Radiation, Ionizing; Regeneration; Stem Cells; Wnt Signaling Pathway",2-s2.0-85033789603

The aim of this study was to investigate associations between reproductive factors and BC subtypes, and whether these vary by age at diagnosis. Methods: We used pooled data on tumor markers (estrogen and progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)) and reproductive risk factors (parity, age at first full-time pregnancy (FFTP) and age at menarche) from 28,095 patients with invasive BC from 34 studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). In a case-only analysis, we used logistic regression to assess associations between reproductive factors and BC subtype compared to luminal A tumors as a reference. The interaction between age and parity in BC subtype risk was also tested, across all ages and, because age was modeled non-linearly, specifically at ages 35, 55 and 75 years. Results: Parous women were more likely to be diagnosed with triple negative BC (TNBC) than with luminal A BC, irrespective of age (OR for parity = 1.38, 95% CI 1.16-1.65, p = 0.0004; p for interaction with age = 0.076). Parous women were also more likely to be diagnosed with luminal and non-luminal HER2-like BCs and this effect was slightly more pronounced at an early age (p for interaction with age = 0.037 and 0.030, respectively). For instance, women diagnosed at age 35 were 1.48 (CI 1.01-2.16) more likely to have luminal HER2-like BC than luminal A BC, while this association was not significant at age 75 (OR = 0.72, CI 0.45-1.14). While age at menarche was not significantly associated with BC subtype, increasing age at FFTP was non-linearly associated with TNBC relative to luminal A BC. An age at FFTP of 25 versus 20 years lowered the risk for TNBC (OR = 0.78, CI 0.70-0.88, p < 0.0001), but this effect was not apparent at a later FFTP. Conclusions: Our main findings suggest that parity is associated with TNBC across all ages at BC diagnosis, whereas the association with luminal HER2-like BC was present only for early onset BC. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Age at breast cancer diagnosis; Age at first full-time pregnancy; Age at menarche; Breast cancer subtype; Parity,"epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer risk; case control study; case study; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic test; disease association; female; first full time pregnancy; human; low risk population; major clinical study; menarche; middle aged; onset age; parity; population based case control study; pregnancy; reproductive health; risk assessment; risk factor; triple negative breast cancer; tumor invasion; breast tumor; clinical trial; multicenter study; odds ratio; reproductive history; risk factor; triple negative breast cancer; young adult; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Reproductive History; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85033407313

Because of the removal of parts of the articulator, a patient's speech may be distorted and difficult to understand. To overcome this problem, VC methods can be applied to convert the distorted speech such that it is clear and more intelligible. To design an effective VC method, two key points must be considered: 1) the amount of training data may be limited (because speaking for a long time is usually difficult for postoperative patients); 2) rapid conversion is desirable (for better communication). Methods: We propose a novel joint dictionary learning based non-negative matrix factorization (JD-NMF) algorithm. Compared to conventional VC techniques, JD-NMF can perform VC efficiently and effectively with only a small amount of training data. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed JD-NMF method not only achieves notably higher short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) scores (a standardized objective intelligibility evaluation metric) than those obtained using the original unconverted speech but is also significantly more efficient and effective than a conventional exemplar-based NMF VC method. Conclusion: The proposed JD-NMF method may outperform the state-of-the-art exemplar-based NMF VC method in terms of STOI scores under the desired scenario. Significance: We confirmed the advantages of the proposed joint training criterion for the NMF-based VC. Moreover, we verified that the proposed JD-NMF can effectively improve the speech intelligibility scores of oral surgery patients. ? 1964-2012 IEEE.",Joint dictionary learning; non-negative matrix factorization (NMF); sparse representation; voice conversion (VC),Factorization; Learning systems; Speech; Speech intelligibility; Speech processing; Surgery; Dictionary learning; Evaluation metrics; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Rapid conversion; Sparse representation; State of the art; Surgical patients; Voice conversion; Matrix algebra; adult; female; human; joint; machine learning; male; oral surgery; speech intelligibility; surgery; surgical patient; voice; algorithm; automatic speech recognition; communication aid; oral surgery; physiology; speech intelligibility; Algorithms; Communication Aids for Disabled; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Oral Surgical Procedures; Speech Intelligibility; Speech Recognition Software,2-s2.0-85037049928

The aim of this population-based cohort study was to examine the association between anticholinergic medication burden, as defined by different scales, and adverse clinical outcomes among older adults. METHODS From Taiwan’s Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, we retrieved data on monthly anticholinergic drug use measured by the Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS), the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale (ACB), and the Drug Burden Index - Anticholinergic component (DBI-Ach) for 116,043 people aged 65 years and older during a 10-year follow-up. For all 3 scales, a higher score indicates greater anticholinergic burden. We used generalized estimating equations to examine the association between anticholinergic burden (ARS and ACB: grouped from 0 to ?4; DBI-Ach: grouped as 0, 0-0.5, and 0.5-1) and adverse outcomes, and stratified individuals by age-group (aged 65-74, 75-84, and ?85 years). RESULTS Compared with the ARS and DBI-Ach, the ACB showed the strongest, most consistent dose-response relationships with risks of all 4 adverse outcomes, particularly in people aged 65 to 84 years. For example, among those 65 to 74 years old, going from an ACB score of 1 to a score of 4 or greater, individuals’ adjusted odds ratio increased from 1.41 to 2.25 for emergency department visits; from 1.32 to 1.92 for all-cause hospitalizations; from 1.10 to 1.71 for fracture-specific hospitalizations; and from 3.13 to 10.01 for incident dementia. CONCLUSIONS Compared with the 2 other scales studied, the ACB shows good dose-response relationships between anticholinergic burden and a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults. For primary care and geriatrics clinicians, the ACB may be a helpful tool for identifying high-risk populations for interventions. ? 2017, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

Advances in food science and nutrition research have been devoted to identifying food components that exert anti-obesity effects, as well as investigating the molecular mechanisms by which they modulate the progression of obesity. Soy foods have attracted much interest as high-protein components of the human diet and as unique sources of isoflavones. As they have similar chemical structures to endogenous estrogens, isoflavones are believed to interact with intracellular estrogen receptors, which results in reductions in the accumulation of lipids and the distribution of adipose tissue. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed other signaling pathways in which isoflavones are involved in the inhibition of adipogenesis and lipogenesis by interacting with various transcription factors and upstream signaling molecules. Although the biological mechanisms that cause the biphasic effects of isoflavones and various controversial results remain unknown, it is noteworthy that isoflavones exhibit pleiotropic effects in the human body to regulate metabolism and balance, which may potentially prevent and treat obesity. ? 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Biosynthesis; Flavonoids; Biological mechanisms; Biphasic effects; Estrogen receptor; Molecular mechanism; Pleiotropic effects; Protein components; Signaling molecules; Signaling pathways; Nutrition; antiobesity agent; estrogen receptor; isoflavone derivative; analysis; animal; chemistry; diet therapy; genetics; human; metabolism; obesity; soy food; soybean; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Humans; Isoflavones; Obesity; Receptors, Estrogen; Soy Foods; Soybeans",2-s2.0-85034073118

As mutation of TP53 in HNSCC occurs in 60% to 80% of non–HPV-associated cases and is in turn associated with resistance to these treatments, more effective therapies are needed. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of a regimen combining vorinostat and AZD1775 in HNSCC cells with a variety of p53 mutations. Experimental Design: Clonogenic survival assays and an orthotopic mouse model of oral cancer were used to examine the in vitro and in vivo sensitivity of high-risk mutant p53 HNSCC cell lines to vorinostat in combination with AZD1775. Cell cycle, replication stress, homologous recombination (HR), live cell imaging, RNA sequencing, and apoptosis analyses were performed to dissect molecular mechanisms. Results: We found that vorinostat synergizes with AZD1775 in vitro to inhibit growth of HNSCC cells harboring high-risk mutp53. These drugs interact synergistically to induce DNA damage, replication stress associated with impaired Rad51-mediated HR through activation of CDK1, and inhibition of Chk1 phosphorylation, culminating in an early apoptotic cell death during the S-phase of the cell cycle. The combination of vorinostat and AZD1775 inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo in an orthotopic mouse model of oral cancer and prolongs animal survival. Conclusions: Vorinostat synergizes with AZD1775 in HNSCC cells with mutant p53 in vitro and in vivo.

Early and appropriate intervention may improve patient outcomes, yet at present there is no identified method that can predict mortality risk rapidly and accurately for emergency physicians, surgeons, and intensivists to decide on the ideal course of action. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the performance of Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis Score (MEDS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS) for predicting the mortality risk of adult splenic abscess patients. This will expedite decision making in the emergency department (ED) to increase survival rates and help avoid unnecessary splenectomies. Methods: Data of 114 adult patients admitted to the EDs of 4 research and training hospitals who had undergone an abdominal contrast CT scan and diagnosed with splenic abscess between Jan 2000 and April 2015 were analyzed. The MEDS, MEWS, REMS, and RAPS and their corresponding mortality risks were calculated, with their abilities to predict patient mortality assessed through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and calibration analysis. Results: MEDS was found to be the best performing scoring system across all indicators, with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 92.86%, 88.00%, and 88.60% respectively; its area under curve for AUROC analysis was 0.92. With a cutoff value of 8, negative predictive value of MEDS was 98.88%. Conclusion: Our series is the largest multicenter study in adult ED patients with splenic abscess. The results from the present study show that MEDS is superior to MEWS, REMS and RAPS in predicting mortality, thus allowing earlier detection of critically ill adult ED splenic abscess patients. Therefore, we recommend that MEDS be used for predicting severity of illness and risk stratification in these patients. ? 2017 Hung et al.

However, the different compositions and mechanical properties of cartilage and subchondral bone show the complexity of this tissue interface, making it challenging for the design and fabrication of osteochondral graft substitute. In this study, a bilayer scaffold is developed to promote the regeneration of osteochondral tissue within a single integrated construct. It has the capacity to serve as a gene delivery platform to promote transfection of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and the functional osteochondral tissues formation. For the subchondral bone layer, the bone matrix with organic (type I collagen, Col) and inorganic (hydroxyapatite, Hap) composite scaffold has been developed through mineralization of hydroxyapatite nanocrystals oriented growth on collagen fibrils. We also prepare multi-shell nanoparticles in different layers with a calcium phosphate core and DNA/calcium phosphate shells conjugated with polyethyleneimine to act as non-viral vectors for delivery of plasmid DNA encoding BMP2 and TGF-β3, respectively. Microbial transglutaminase is used as a cross-linking agent to crosslink the bilayer scaffold. The ability of this scaffold to act as a gene-activated matrix is demonstrated with successful transfection efficiency. The results show that the sustained release of plasmids from gene-activated matrix can promote prolonged transgene expression and stimulate hMSCs differentiation into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages by spatial and temporal control within the bilayer composite scaffold. This improved delivery method may enhance the functionalized composite graft to accelerate healing process for osteochondral tissue regeneration. Statement of Significance In this study, a gene-activated matrix (GAM) to promote the growth of both cartilage and subchondral bone within a single integrated construct is developed. It has the capacity to promote transfection of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and the functional osteochondral tissues formation. The results show that the sustained release of plasmids including TGF-beta and BMP-2 from GAM could promote prolonged transgene expression and stimulate hMSCs differentiation into the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages by spatial control manner. This improved delivery method should enhance the functionalized composite graft to accelerate healing process in vitro and in vivo for osteochondral tissue regeneration. ? 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.",Calcium phosphate; Enzymatic cross-linking; Gene-activated matrix; Mesenchymal stem cell; Osteochondral graft substitute,"alkaline phosphatase; bone morphogenetic protein 2; calcium phosphate; collagen type 1; hydroxyapatite; nanocomposite; osteopontin; plasmid DNA; polyethyleneimine; protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase; transcription factor RUNX2; transforming growth factor beta3; bone morphogenetic protein 2; cross linking reagent; DNA; transforming growth factor beta3; Article; articular cartilage; bone development; bone mineralization; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell viability; chondrogenesis; collagen fiber; collagen fibril; compression; controlled study; differential scanning calorimetry; elasticity; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; extracellular matrix; gene activation; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; hyaline cartilage; immunohistochemistry; joint; lipid bilayer; mesenchymal stem cell; priority journal; protein cross linking; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; sustained drug release; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; bone development; chemistry; chondrogenesis; cytology; gene; gene expression regulation; genetic transfection; infrared spectroscopy; mesenchymal stroma cell; metabolism; photon correlation spectroscopy; plasmid; regeneration; tissue scaffold; ultrastructure; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Chondrogenesis; Collagen Type I; Cross-Linking Reagents; DNA; Durapatite; Dynamic Light Scattering; Extracellular Matrix; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; HeLa Cells; Humans; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Osteogenesis; Plasmids; Polyethyleneimine; Regeneration; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Tissue Scaffolds; Transfection; Transforming Growth Factor beta3; Transglutaminases",2-s2.0-85028970096

In the past decade, many cancer centers have adopted SBRT as one mode of radically treating small-sized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), based on encouraging clinical outcomes. SBRT thus seems reasonable as first-line treatment of inoperable HCC confined to the liver. However, most of the clinical studies to date have been retrospective in nature, with key issues still under investigation. Summary: The above-mentioned publications were subjected to scrutiny, fueling discussions at the 7th Asia-Pacific Primary Liver Cancer Expert (APPLE 2016) Meeting on various clinical variables, such as indications for SBRT, therapeutic outcomes, treatment-related toxicities, doses prescribed, and specific techniques. The consensus reached should be of interest to all professionals active in the treatment of HCC, especially radiation oncologists. Key Messages: SBRT is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with small-sized HCC, offering substantial local control, improved overall survival, and low toxicity. ? 2017 S.

We investigated the effect of dietary SlimTrym? on diet-induced obesity and associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice. Methods and results: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet (ND), high fat diet (HFD) or HFD containing 0.1% or 0.5% SlimTrym? for 16 weeks. Dietary SlimTrym? significantly reduced weight gain and relative perigonadal, retroperitoneal, mesenteric fat weight as well as the size of adipocyte in HFD-fed mice. SlimTrym? supplementation also effectively diminished hepatic steatosis and the serum levels of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), triacylglycerol (TG), and total cholesterol (TCHO). Down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, and the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling by SlimTrym? in both adipose tissue and liver may be responsible for the observed anti-obesity effects. Conclusion: SlimTrym? supplementation potentially diminished diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis via regulating AMPK signaling and molecules involved in lipid metabolism. ? 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Studies have shown that integrin-mediated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signal pathway is implicated in cell proliferation, survival and metastasis of tumor cells. Our previous results indicated that diallyl trisulfide (DATS) provided its antimelanoma activity via inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to explore DATS mediated antimetastatic effect and the corresponding mechanism in human melanoma A375 cells. We found that DATS exhibited an inhibitory effect on the abilities of migration and invasion in A375 cells under noncytotoxic concentrations analyzed by wound healing assays and Matrigel invasion chamber system. DATS attenuated invasion of A375 cells with characteristic of decreased activities and protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Moreover, DATS exerted an inhibitory effect on cell adhesion of A375 cells, which is in correlation with the change in integrin signaling pathway. Results of Western blotting showed that DATS decreased the levels of several integrin subunits, including α4, α5, αv, β1, β3 and β4. Subsequently, DATS induced a strong decrease in total FAK, phosphorylated FAK Tyr-397,-576, ?577, and disorganized F-actin stress fibers, resulting in a nonmigratory phenotype. These results suggest that the antimetastatic potential of DATS for human melanoma cells might be due to the disruption of integrin/FAK signaling pathway. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",DATS; invasion; metastasis; migration; skin cancer cells,"Cell adhesion; Cell death; Cell proliferation; Cells; Cytology; Dermatology; Enzymes; Oncology; Pathology; Proteins; DATS; Invasion; Metastasis; Migration; Skin cancers; Cell signaling; alpha4 integrin; alpha5 integrin; beta1 integrin; beta3 integrin; beta4 integrin; CD51 antigen; diallyl trisulfide; F actin; focal adhesion kinase; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; integrin; allyl compound; antineoplastic agent; diallyl trisulfide; focal adhesion kinase; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; integrin; sulfide; apoptosis; bioassay; cause of death; cells and cell components; concentration (composition); correlation; enzyme; enzyme activity; phenotype; protein; survival; tumor; A-375 cell line; Article; cell adhesion; cell invasion; cell viability; controlled study; drug mechanism; human; human cell; melanoma cell; metastasis inhibition; migration inhibition; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; stress fiber; Western blotting; wound healing assay; cell motion; cell proliferation; drug effects; melanoma; metabolism; phosphorylation; signal transduction; skin tumor; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Allyl Compounds; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Humans; Integrins; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Melanoma; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Skin Neoplasms; Stress Fibers; Sulfides",2-s2.0-85026329025

Objectives To investigate the prevalence, incidence, and comorbidities of CU in general population. Methods The data were sourced from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) for 2009–2012. Patients who had a primary/secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 during the year with at least two outpatient visits and an antihistamine prescription, were identified as the cases of CU for each year. The incidence, persistence and comorbidities of CU were examined. Results The prevalence of CU ranged from 0.69% to 0.79% for each year from 2009 to 2012, and the incidence was around 0.50% per year from 2010 to 2012. Comparing to the Standard Population, the standardized prevalence ratios (SPRs) for the rheumatic diseases, thyroid disorders, inflammatory diseases, and psychiatric disorders among CU patients were 2.74, 1.81, 1.57 and 1.87, respectively. Conclusion The prevalence of CU in Taiwan is about 0.69-0.79%. CU is associated with a significantly increased risk of psychiatric disorders, inflammatory diseases, thyroid disorders, and rheumatic diseases. Except for thyroid disorders, the prevalence of these comorbidities tends to increase the longer CU persists. ? 2017",Comorbidity; Psychiatric disorders; Rheumatic diseases; Thyroid disorders; Urticaria,antihistaminic agent; adult; age distribution; Article; chronic urticaria; comorbidity; female; human; inflammatory disease; major clinical study; male; mental disease; outpatient; population research; prescription; prevalence; priority journal; rheumatic disease; risk assessment; risk factor; sex ratio; Taiwan; thyroid disease; aged; chronic disease; comorbidity; incidence; inflammation; mental disease; middle aged; prevalence; rheumatic disease; thyroid disease; time factor; urticaria; young adult; Adult; Aged; Chronic Disease; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Incidence; Inflammation; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Rheumatic Diseases; Taiwan; Thyroid Diseases; Time Factors; Urticaria; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85025159120

Even though the pancreas might be more susceptible to ectopic fat deposition compared with the liver, NAFPD is rarely discussed because of the limitation of detection techniques. In the past, NAFPD was considered as an innocent condition or just part of clinical manifestations during the course of obesity. Recently, a growing body of research suggests that NAFPD might be associated with β-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance and inflammation, which possibly lead to the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The present review summarized the current literature on the epidemiology, potential pathophysiology, diagnostic techniques, impact of NAFPD on β-cell function and insulin resistance, and the clinical relevance of the interplay between NAFPD and glucometabolic disorders. ? 2017 The Authors.

The relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance in CKD patients is still under investigation. The study aimed to quantitatively assess the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance in patients with CKD. Methods: We recruited 39 patients with CKD and 39 age- and sex-matched control participants from a tertiary medical center. All participants underwent 3-T MRI scan neuropsychological assessments, and renal function tests. FreeSurfer software was used for imaging processing and analysis, including measurement of cortical thickness and gray matter (GM) and white matter volumes. Results: Compared with control subjects (73.1±7.5?years old), patients with CKD (76.4±8.4?years old) had significantly lower scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and forward digit span test (P<.01). Patients with CKD had smaller cerebral GM volume, hippocampus, and decreased cortical thickness (P<.01) relative to the control group. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was correlated with cognitive performance, cortical thickness, GM volume, and hippocampal volume (P<.001). Linear regression analysis revealed that eGFR and GM volume were independently negatively associated with cognitive performance (P<.001), while eGFR and age were negatively associated with cortical thinning and GM volume after controlling for confounding factors. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that impaired kidney function is associated not only with poor cognitive performance, but also with small cerebral GM volume and reduced cortical thickness. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Study Design: Retrospective study. Methods: Children aged <18 years were enrolled and underwent T&A for treating SDB. Polysomnography was used to classify the disease severity: primary snoring (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] <1), mild (AHI = 1–5), moderate (AHI = 5–10), and severe obstructive sleep apnea [OSA] (AHI ?10). Postoperative bleeding was graded using a severity scale (level I, self-reported bleeding; level II, requiring inpatient admission; level III, requiring reoperation). Primary bleeding is defined as hemorrhage occurring within the initial 24 postoperative hours. Perioperative respiratory complications are defined as oxygen saturation of less than 90%, 92%, or 95% in the recovery room. Major respiratory complications include laryngospasm, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and intubation at recovery stage. Results: A total of 610 children were included, of whom 42 (6.9%), eight (1.3%), and six (1.0%) children showed levels I, II, and III postoperative bleeding, respectively. Only one child had primary bleeding. The incidence and timing of postoperative bleeding did not differ significantly for children with different OSA severities. The rate of perioperative respiratory complications ranged from 1.6% to 14.3% on the basis of their definitions. The Cochran-Armitage test supported the trend that perioperative respiratory complications increase with the AHI. Six children developed major respiratory complications, which were not significantly associated with OSA severity. Conclusions: Children with severe OSA have increased risks of perioperative respiratory complications. However, OSA severity does not influence major respiratory complications or postoperative bleeding in children. Level of Evidence: 4.

Our previous studies showed the existence of epitopes in the C-terminal region of DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) which are cross-reactive with host Ags and trigger anti-DENV NS1 Ab-mediated endothelial cell damage and platelet dysfunction. To circumvent these potentially harmful events, we replaced the C-terminal region of DENV NS1 with the corresponding region from Japanese encephalitis virus NS1 to create chimeric DJ NS1 protein. Passive immunization of DENV-infected mice with polyclonal anti-DJ NS1 Abs reduced viral Ag expression at skin inoculation sites and shortened DENV-induced prolonged bleeding time. We also investigated the therapeutic effects of anti-NS1 mAb. One mAb designated 2E8 does not recognize the C-terminal region of DENV NS1 in which host-cross-reactive epitopes reside. Moreover, mAb 2E8 recognizes NS1 of all four DENV serotypes. We also found that mAb 2E8 caused complement-mediated lysis in DENV-infected cells. In mouse model studies, treatment with mAb 2E8 shortened DENV-induced prolonged bleeding time and reduced viral Ag expression in the skin. Importantly, mAb 2E8 provided therapeutic effects against all four serotypes of DENV. We further found that mAb administration to mice as late as 1 d prior to severe bleeding still reduced prolonged bleeding time and hemorrhage.

In this study, Ce-doped TiO2 (TiO2:Ce) was synthesized by a modified sol-gel method to act as a photosensitizer activated by low-dose X-rays, less harmful than ionizing radiation, to generate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The A549 cell line was used as the in vitro and in vivo model to evaluate the efficacy of X-ray-irradiated TiO2:Ce to induce cell death. The cell viability significantly decreased with TiO2:Ce exposure under low-dose X-ray irradiation. An LDH assay showed that intracellular TiO2:Ce under X-ray irradiation was cytotoxic to A549 cancer cells. TiO2:Ce produced significant ROS under low-dose X-ray irradiation and promoted apoptosis/necrosis of A549 cancer cells. TiO2:Ce can enhance the efficacy of X-ray-induced PDT, and tumor growth was inhibited in vivo. The mechanisms underlying ROS generation by TiO2:Ce activated by X-ray irradiation to induce cell toxicity, thereby inhibiting tumor growth, is discussed. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",Alternative cancer therapy; Ce-doped TiO2; Reactive oxygen species; X-ray,Cell culture; Cell death; Cytology; Cytotoxicity; Diseases; Ionizing radiation; Irradiation; Light sources; Photodynamic therapy; Photosensitizers; Radiation; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Tumors; X rays; A549 cell lines; Cancer therapy; Ce-doped; Modified sol-gel method; Photodynamic therapy (PDT); Reactive oxygen species; Ros generations; X ray irradiation; Cells,2-s2.0-85021125562

METHODS: The authors analyzed data from patients with TESCC in the Taiwan Cancer Registry database. To compare their outcomes, patients with TESCC were enrolled and categorized into the following groups according to treatment modality: group 1, those who underwent surgery alone; group 2, those who received trimodality therapy; and group 3, those who received definitive CCRT. Group 1 was used as the control arm for investigating the risk of mortality after treatment. RESULTS: In total, 3522 patients who had TESCC without distant metastasis were enrolled. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that a Charlson comorbidity index score ?3, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage ?IIA, earlier year of diagnosis, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and definitive CCRT were significant, independent predictors of a poor prognosis. After adjustment for confounders, adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall mortality in patients with clinical stage I, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC TESCC were 2.01 (95% CI, 0.44-6.18), 1.65 (95% CI, 0.99-2.70), 1.48 (95% CI, 0.91-2.42), 0.66 (95% CI, 1.08-1.14), 0.39 (95% CI, 0.26-0.57), and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.24-0.83), respectively, in group 2; and 2.06 (95% CI, 1.18-3.59), 2.65 (95% CI, 1.76-4.00), 2.25 (95% CI, 1.49-3.39), 1.34 (95% CI, 0.79-2.28), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.57-1.17), and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.51-1.71), respectively, in group 3.

OBJECTIVES: To clarify this issue, we estimated the association between annual mortality and annual summaries of heat and cold in 278 locations from 12 countries. METHODS: Indices of annual heat and cold were used as predictors in regressions of annual mortality in each location, allowing for trends over time and clustering of annual count anomalies by country and pooling estimates using meta-regression. We used two indices of annual heat and cold based on preliminary standard daily analyses: a) mean annual degrees above/below minimum mortality temperature (MMT), and b) estimated fractions of deaths attributed to heat and cold. The first index was simpler and matched previous related research; the second was added because it allowed the interpretation that coefficients equal to 0 and 1 are consistent with none (0) or all (1) of the deaths attributable in daily analyses being displaced by at least 1 y. RESULTS: On average, regression coefficients of annual mortality on heat and cold mean degrees were 1.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.3, 3.1] and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6, 1.6) per degree, respectively, and daily attributable fractions were 0.8 (95% CI: 0.2, 1.3) and 1.1 (95% CI: 0.9, 1.4). The proximity of the latter coefficients to 1.0 provides evidence that most deaths found attributable to heat and cold in daily analyses were brought forward by at least 1 y. Estimates were broadly robust to alternative model assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide strong evidence that most deaths associated in daily analyses with heat and cold are displaced by at least 1 y. ? 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Models were developed for 17 countries (Bahrain, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Colombia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Hong Kong, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Qatar and Taiwan) to quantify and characterize the viremic population as well as forecast the changes in the infected population and the corresponding disease burden from 2015 to 2030. Model inputs were agreed upon through expert consensus, and a standardized methodology was followed to allow for comparison across countries. The viremic prevalence is expected to remain constant or decline in all but four countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Jordan and Oman); however, HCV-related morbidity and mortality will increase in all countries except Qatar and Taiwan. In Qatar, the high-treatment rate will contribute to a reduction in total cases and HCV-related morbidity by 2030. In the remaining countries, however, the current treatment paradigm will be insufficient to achieve large reductions in HCV-related morbidity and mortality. ? 2017 The Authors.

Setting A formal questionnaire was anonymously completed by physicians from different countries/regions in the Asia-Pacific. The survey sought responses relating to general familiarity, awareness of management guidelines, identification (clinical characteristics and lipid profile), prevalence and inheritance, extent of elevation in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and practice on screening and treatment. Participants Practising community physicians from Australia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Philippines, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam and Taiwan were recruited to complete the questionnaire, with the UK as the international benchmark. Primary outcome An assessment and comparison of the knowledge, awareness and preferences of FH among physicians in 10 different countries/regions. Results 1078 physicians completed the questionnaire from the Asia-Pacific region; only 34% considered themselves to be familiar with FH. 72% correctly described FH and 65% identified the typical lipid profile, with a higher proportion of physicians from Japan and China selecting the correct FH definition and lipid profile compared with those from Vietnam and Philippines. However, less than half of the physician were aware of national or international management guidelines; this was significantly worse than physicians from the UK (35% vs 61%, p<0.001). Knowledge of prevalence (24%), inheritability (41%) and CVD risk (9%) of FH were also suboptimal. The majority of the physicians considered laboratory interpretative commenting as being useful (81%) and statin therapy as an appropriate cholesterol-lowering therapy (89%) for FH management. Conclusions The study identified important gaps, which are readily addressable, in the awareness and knowledge of FH among physicians in the region. Implementation of country-specific guidelines and extensive work in FH education and awareness programmes are imperative to improve the care of FH in the region. ? 2017 Article author(s).",Asia-Pacific; awareness; familial hypercholesterolaemia; knowledge; models of care; perception; physicians; practices,"hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lipid; Article; Australia; awareness; benchmarking; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; China; clinical feature; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; general practice; general practitioner; high risk patient; Hong Kong; human; inheritance; Japan; knowledge; laboratory test; lipid analysis; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; Philippines; physician attitude; practice guideline; prevalence; questionnaire; South Korea; Taiwan; United Kingdom; Viet Nam; attitude to health; cardiovascular disease; familial hypercholesterolemia; general practitioner; genetics; international cooperation; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Internationality; Logistic Models; Male; Physicians, Primary Care; Prevalence; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85032631681

However, little is known about how KLF4 regulates TERT expression. Here, we discover poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) as a novel KLF4-interacting partner. Knockdown of PARP1 reduces TERT expression and telomerase activity not only in cancer cells, but also in human and mouse ESCs. Recruitment of KLF4 to TERT promoter is reduced in PARP1-suppressed cells. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity is dispensable, while the oligo(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity is required for the PARP1- and KLF4-mediated TERTactivation. Repression of Parp1 in mouse ESCs decreases expression of pluripotent markers and induces differentiation. These results suggest that PARP1 recruits KLF4 to activate telomerase expression and stem cell pluripotency, indicating a positive regulatory role of the PARP1-KLF4 complex in telomerase expression in cancer and stem cells. ?

However, little is known about the risk factors for readmission in those schizophrenia patients who are involuntarily admitted. Aims: We aim to explore the risk factors for readmission in this population. Method: We enrolled 138 schizophrenia patients with involuntary admission from July 2008 to June 2013 and followed those patients for readmission outcomes at 3 months and at 1 year. Results: The one-year and 3-months readmission rates were 33.3% and 15.2%, respectively. Unmarried status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.28, 95% CI: 1.48–26.62), previous history of involuntary admission (aOR = 4.08, 95% CI: 1.19–14.02), longer involuntary admission days (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07) and shorter total admission days (aOR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05) were associated with increased risk for 1-year readmission. Younger age (aOR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.18) was associated with increased risk for 3-months readmission. Conclusions: Unmarried status, prior history of involuntary admission, longer involuntary admission days and shorter total admission days were associated with increased risk for 1-year readmission. Healthcare providers may need to focus on patients with these risk factors to reduce subsequent readmissions. ? 2017 Hung et al.

Risk models assessing HCC risk in the general population can be used for risk stratification for further HCC surveillance, however, none have been validated externally. Methylation of circulating DNA shows potential for non-invasive diagnosis of HCC. We conducted a prospective case-control study nested within a community-based cohort. We measured methylation levels in six genes (CDKN2A, RASSF1A, STEAP4, TBX2, VIM and ZNF154) which were identified in our previous work, using pre-diagnostic plasma DNA from 237 HCC cases and 257 matched controls. We found TBX2 hypermethylation was associated with increased HCC risk, with ORs (95% CI) of 3.2 (1.8-6.0). The associations were mainly among high-risk subjects; among subjects infected with HBV/HCV, the OR (95% CI) of TBX2 methylation was 5.3 (2.2-12.7). Among subjects with high risk scores, the ORs (95% CIs) were 7.8 (1.5-38.6) for Wen-HCC model =16, 5.8 (2.2-15.5) for Hung-HCC =15 and 7.5 (2.2-26.0) for Michikawa-HCC =8. Adding TBX2 methylation improved the accuracy of risk models for a high-risk population, with the area under the curve (AUC) of 76% for Wen-HCC score with TBX2 methylation compared with 69% with Wen-HCC alone. The AUCs were 63% for Hung-HCC score plus TBX2 methylation, and 53% for Hung-HCC alone, 65% for Michikawa-HCC score plus TBX2 methylation and 58% for Michikawa- HCC alone. Our findings suggest the potential increase in risk assessment discrimination and accuracy from incorporation of DNA methylation. ? The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

Molecular studies showed that the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (also known as CXCL12) and its receptor, CXCR4, are key determinants of tumor initiation, progression and metastasis in ovarian carcinomas. Hence, it is generally believed that blocking the CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway could serve as a potential therapy for patients with ovarian cancer. Herein, we investigated the role of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in regulating ovarian cancer progression. Using flow cytometry, a real-Time PCR and western blot analyses, we showed that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 protein and mRNA were overexpressed in human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines, and these were closely correlated with poor outcomes. Moreover, silencing CXCR4 by small hairpin RNA in HTB75 cells reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion and significantly reduced RhoA and Rac-1/Cdc42 expressions, whereas overexpression of CXCR4 in SKOV3 cells significantly increased cell migration and markedly increased RhoA, Rac-1/Cdc42 levels. Silencing CXCR4 also led to decreased in vitro cytotoxicity of AMD3100, a specific antagonist of CXCR4, which exerts its effect upon CXCR4 expression. Remarkably, knockdown of CXCR4 in HTB75 cells led to a significantly decreased capability to form tumors in vivo, and the Ki67 proliferation index of xenograft tumors showed a dramatic reduction. Our results revealed that the CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway represents a promising therapeutic target for epithelial ovarian carcinoma.",,"chemokine receptor CXCR4; Ki 67 antigen; messenger RNA; plerixafor; protein Cdc42; Rac1 protein; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; short hairpin RNA; stromal cell derived factor 1; chemokine receptor CXCR4; heterocyclic compound; Rac1 protein; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; stromal cell derived factor 1; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; Caov-3 cell line; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; female; flow cytometry; gene overexpression; gene silencing; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; metastasis inhibition; ovary carcinoma; OVCAR-3 cell line; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; SK-OV-3 cell line; TOV-112D cell line; tumor invasion; Western blotting; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; carcinoma; genetics; metabolism; mouse; nonobese diabetic mouse; ovary tumor; procedures; RNAi therapeutics; SCID mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinoma; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemokine CXCL12; Female; Heterocyclic Compounds; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Ovarian Neoplasms; rac1 GTP-Binding Protein; Receptors, CXCR4; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; RNAi Therapeutics",2-s2.0-85032441873

Methods: Clinical information and data of anti-HAV antibody results were collected from 2,860 antiretroviral-na?ve HIV-positive Taiwanese aged 18 years or older who initiated combination antiretroviral therapy at 11 hospitals around Taiwan between 2012 and 2016 (2012–2016 cohort). A multivariate logistic regression model was applied to identify independent variables associated with HAV seropositivity. Comparisons of HAV seroprevalences and associated clinical characteristics were made between this 2012–2016 cohort and a previous cohort of 1580 HIV-positive patients in 2004–2007 (2004–2007 cohort). Results: Of the 2,860 HIV-positive patients between 2012 and 2016, the overall HAV seropositivity rate was 21.2% (605/2860), which was independently associated with an older age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], per 1-year increase, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.11–1.15) and co-infection with hepatitis B virus (AOR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.08–1.93). Residence in southern Taiwan (AOR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34–0.72) was inversely associated with HAV seropositivity. The overall HAV seroprevalence in the 2012–2016 cohort was significantly lower than that in the 2004–2007 cohort (21.2% vs 60.9%, p<0.01). The decreases of HAV seropositivity rate were observed in nearly every age-matched group, which suggested the cohort effect on HAV seroepidemiology. However, among individuals aged 25 years or younger, the HAV seropositivity rate increased from 3.8% (2/52) in the 2004–2007 cohort to 8.5% (50/587) in the 2012–2016 cohort, with 95.4% (560/587) being MSM in this age group of the latter cohort. Conclusions: HAV seroprevalence has decreased with time among HIV-positive adults in Taiwan. The cohort effect has increased the number of young HIV-positive patients that are susceptible to HAV infection in a country without nationwide childhood vaccination program against HAV. ? 2017 Lee et al.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of surgical procedures and quality-of-care (QoC) on qualityof- life (QoL) among breast cancer survivors who underwent breast-conserving therapy (BCT) or mastectomy, and to identify provider- and patient-related factors pertaining to QoL. Method: In this cross-sectional study, structured-questionnaires were distributed among breast cancer survivors in 19 hospitals. QoL was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the breast cancer specific module (EORTC QLQ-BR23). QoC is indicated by adherence to the core measures stipulated for the treatment of breast cancer. Multiple regression and hierarchical linear modeling were used for multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 544 female survivors of Stage 0-III breast cancer were included, among whom 217 (39.9%) underwent BCT and 327 (60.1%) underwent mastectomy. Surgical modality does not appear to have a notable impact on any QoL domains except body image; i.e. patients who underwent BCT reported better body image (diff = 11.20, P < 0.001), particularly at 1-5 years after the initial treatment. Independent factors including age, education, employment, marital status, income, chemotherapy, duration since treatment, recurrence status, primary hospital accreditation level and location all appear to be correlated to QoL. Conclusion: Patients with breast cancer should be informed of differences in QoL when discussing treatment options. Furthermore, physicians should recognize that the impact of surgical treatment modality on QoL may vary according to patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. ? The Author 2017.

Interleukin (IL)-6 is an inflammatory response mediator that can promote angiogenesis. We explored its prognostic role in patients with advanced HCC. Methods: We had two patient cohorts, both comprising patients who received sorafenib-containing therapy as the first-line treatment for advanced HCC. We explored the best cut point for pretreatment plasma IL-6 levels in the exploration cohort and then confirmed it in the validation cohort. Results: In total, 55 and 73 patients constituted the exploration and validation cohorts, respectively. In the exploration cohort, a cut point of 4.28 pg/ml was the best for defining high and low IL- 6 levels because it could most effectively differentiate overall survival (OS). On application of this cut point to the validation cohort, patients with high plasma IL-6 levels, compared with patients with low IL-6 levels, exhibited significantly poorer OS (median, 8.0 vs 13.9 months, P = 0.031) but similar progression-free survival or treatment response. After adjusting for patient demographics and tumor characteristics, a high plasma IL-6 level remained an independent predictor of poor OS (hazard ratio 2.594, P = 0.005).

However, little is known whether fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, a liver fibrosis biomarker, helps identify non-cirrhotic patients with the lowest HCC risk.Methods:A total of 2075 treatment-naive Taiwanese patients with chronic HBV infection were followed for an average period of 16.02 years. None of them had liver cirrhosis at baseline. We explored whether a low FIB-4 index complements the favourable predictors to defines patients with the lowest HCC risk. The finding was validated in 532 non-cirrhotic patients receiving long-term nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) treatment with suppressed viral replication.Results:A total of 137 treatment-naive and 10 NUC-treated patients developed HCC, respectively. We found that HCC risk started to increase when baseline FIB-4 index >1.29 in the treatment-naive cohort. Patients with FIB-4 >1.29, compared to those with FIB-4 <1.29, were associated with a higher risk of HCC with hazards ratio of 5.56 (95% confidence interval: 3.93-7.86). More importantly, among patients with low viral load (HBV DNA level <2,000 IU/ml), baseline FIB-4 index helped stratify different HCC risks such that none of 326 HBeAg-negative patients with FIB-4 index <1.29, ALT level <40 U/l, and HBsAg level <1,000 IU/ml developed HCC. In addition, the patients with the FIB-4 index <1.29 consistently had the lowest HCC risks in the validation cohort receiving long-term NUC treatment.Conclusions:In non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HBV infection, FIB-4 index <1.29 complements the existing clinical profile to define patients with the lowest HCC risk. ? 2017 by the American College of Gastroenterology.",,"adefovir; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; DNA; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; lamivudine; telbivudine; tenofovir; antivirus agent; biological marker; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cancer patient; cancer risk; chronic hepatitis B; cohort analysis; digestive system disease assessment; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; female; fibrosis 4 index; follow up; high risk patient; human; incidence; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; long term care; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; risk factor; Taiwanese; thrombocyte count; virus carrier; virus replication; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; complication; health status indicator; Hepatitis B, Chronic; liver cirrhosis; liver function test; Liver Neoplasms; pathology; predictive value; procedures; risk assessment; Taiwan; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status Indicators; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Function Tests; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85030634285

We identified 5 independent predictors: age>70 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.84 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-3.17]; 1 point), assigned point value in the model), residence in a long-term-care facility (OR, 3.64 [95% CI, 1.57-8.43); 3 points), history of cerebrovascular accidents (OR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.24-4.01]; 2 points), hospitalization within 1 month (OR, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.39-4.96]; 2 points), and recent antibiotic exposure (OR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.16-4.11]; 2 points). The model displayed good discrimination in the derivation and validation sets (area under ROC curve, 0.75 and 0.80, respectively) with the best cutoffs of<4 and ?4 points for low- and high-risk MDR-GNB colonization, respectively. When applied to 998 patients in the second stage of the study, the model successfully stratified the risk of MDR-GNB infection during hospitalization between low- and high-risk groups (probability, 0.02 vs 0.12, respectively; log-rank test, P<.001). CONCLUSION A model was developed to optimize both the decision to initiate antimicrobial therapy and the infection control interventions to mitigate threats from MDR-GNB.

Methods Data were derived from a survey of 17,837 Taiwanese civilians, aged 12–64 years, using stratified, multi-stage, random sampling. Participants completed a computer-assisted self-interview on tablet computers which covered use of legal substances, sedatives/hypnotics and prescription analgesics; use of illicit drugs/inhalants, risky sexual experiences; expectations of drugs; and psychological distress. Findings Approximately 1.29% of respondents reported ever using an illicit drug in their lifetime; prevalence estimates of club drugs (mainly ketamine, marijuana, and ecstasy) were slightly higher than hard drugs (mainly methamphetamine and heroin). Concurrent use of legal substances, particularly problematic use of alcohol and tobacco, as well as non-medical use of prescription drugs, were strong correlates of illicit drug use in general, with club drug use exhibiting an extremely strong association with alcohol use. Club drug users were demographically different from hard drug users, including in terms of their gender, age, and level of educational attainment. They were also more likely to be divorced or widowed, to report risky sexual partnerships and more depressive symptoms than hard drug users. Conclusions Our findings indicate drug type specific distinct psychosocial characteristics, which may warrant further attention in the design of treatment and intervention programs. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Club drug; Hard drug; Illicit drug; National survey; Non-medical use; Prescription drug,"cannabis; club drug; hard drug; hypnotic sedative agent; illicit drug; ketamine; midomafetamine; prescription drug; unclassified drug; street drug; adolescent; adult; age distribution; alcohol abuse; Article; automutilation; child; correlational study; distress syndrome; divorced person; drug use; educational status; female; gender; help seeking behavior; human; male; prevalence; priority journal; psychological well-being; social behavior; social psychology; social stress; substance use; Taiwan; tobacco use; unsafe sex; widowed person; drinking behavior; drug dependence; high risk behavior; mental stress; middle aged; prescription drug misuse; psychology; questionnaire; sexual behavior; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Child; Drug Users; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prescription Drug Misuse; Prevalence; Risk-Taking; Sexual Behavior; Street Drugs; Stress, Psychological; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85029385164

Several Asian countries have launched population CRC screening programs to combat this devastating disease because previous studies have demonstrated that either fecal occult blood test or lower gastrointestinal endoscopy can effectively reduce CRC mortality. Recent Findings: Screening includes engaging the population, testing, administering a confirmation examination, and treating screening-detected neoplasms; thus, monitoring the whole process using measurable indicators over time is of utmost importance. Only when the quality of every step is secured can the effectiveness of CRC screening be maximized. Screening and verification examination rates remain low in Asian countries, and important infrastructure, including cancer or death registry systems, colonoscopy capacity, and reasonable subsidization for screening, is lacking or insufficient. Summary: Future research should identify potential local barriers to screening. Good communication and dialog among screening organizers, clinicians, professional societies, and public health workers are indispensible for successful screening programs. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Asia; Colonoscopy; Colorectal cancer; Fecal immunochemical test; Population screening; Screening,Asia; colonoscopy; colorectal tumor; early cancer diagnosis; human; mass screening; occult blood; Asia; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Mass Screening; Occult Blood,2-s2.0-85027588955

The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term survival and outcomes. Methods Retrospective analysis of 40 consecutive patients with MAAs undergoing EVAR and subsequent intravenous antibiotic treatment between September 2009 and April 2015. Follow-up was truncated on 30 April 2015. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess risk factors of adverse outcomes. Cumulative survival was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results Median age at repair was 73 years (range 48–88 years) and 31 (77%) were men. Eleven (27%) patients were infected with Salmonella, 12 (30%) with non-Salmonella species, and 17 (42%) had negative cultures. Anatomical locations included the aortic arch/thoracic area in 10 (25%), the paravisceral area in seven (17%), and the infrarenal area in 23 (57%). Ten (25%) patients presented with aneurysm rupture and underwent emergency repair. Median follow-up was 25 months (range 1–69 months). Cumulative 1 and 5 year survival rates were 71% and 53%, respectively. Persistent or recurrent infection occurred in 20% (n = 8). Patients with persistent infection were treated with long-term medical therapy, but all died (75%; n = 6) within 6 months of repair. No survival difference was found between patients with or without Salmonella infections. However, there was a trend toward better survival in culture negative patients. Conclusion EVAR of MAA is an acceptable alternative treatment of MAA. However, persistent infection after endovascular treatment does occur and is often fatal without surgical treatment. ? 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery",Abdominal aortic aneurysm; Chimney graft/technique; Emergency procedure; Endovascular aneurysm repair; Mycotic aneurysm; Thoracic aortic aneurysm,"antibiotic agent; ceftriaxone; antiinfective agent; adult; aged; anatomic landmark; aneurysm rupture; antibiotic therapy; aortic aneurysm; aortic arch; Article; clinical article; clinical outcome; emergency surgery; endovascular aneurysm repair; female; follow up; human; Kaplan Meier method; long term care; long term survival; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; mycotic aneurysm; persistent infection; priority journal; recurrent infection; retrospective study; risk factor; Salmonella; salmonellosis; survival rate; univariate analysis; endovascular surgery; infected aneurysm; microbiology; middle aged; mortality; thoracic aorta aneurysm; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aneurysm, Infected; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85027582791

This study reveals the revision rates and factors associated with paediatric revision adenoidectomy in Taiwan. From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified all in-hospital children (age <18?years) who underwent adenoidectomy between 2000 and 2007. All children had received at least 5?years of follow-up from the index date, and the clinical records until 2012 were examined. Factors affecting the paediatric revision adenoidectomy were analysed using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. A total of 10,396 children were enrolled (mean age 7.3?years; 66% boys; mean follow-up period 8.7?years). Two hundred and seventy-five children underwent revision adenoidectomy, and the mean interval between primary adenoidectomy and revision surgery was 2.97?years. Only 58.5% of children underwent revision surgery at the initial hospital. The incidence of revision surgery was highest in the second year (0.69%), followed by the third year (0.53%) after primary adenoidectomy. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed that young age [hazard ratio (HR)?=?0.8], male gender (HR?=?1.57), surgery at an eastern hospital (HR?=?2.08), surgical indication of adenoid hypertrophy (HR?=?1.51), and concurrent ventilation tube insertion (HR?=?2.61) or nasal surgeries (HR?=?4.84) were associated with revision adenoidectomy. The incidence of revision adenoidectomy in Taiwan was 2.6%. Male gender, young age, concurrent nasal or ventilation tube insertion, and surgery at an eastern hospital increased the risk of revision. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Adenoidectomy; Adenoids; Child; Reoperation; Tonsillectomy,adenoid hypertrophy; adenoidectomy; adolescent; adult; age; Article; artificial ventilation; child; cohort analysis; disease predisposition; female; follow up; hospital; human; ICD-9-CM; incidence; major clinical study; male; medical record review; myringotomy; national health insurance; nose surgery; otitis media; otolaryngology tube; population research; postoperative complication; priority journal; public hospital; reoperation; retrospective study; rhinitis; school child; sex difference; sinusitis; sleep disorder; surgical risk; survival analysis; Taiwan; tonsillectomy; tonsillitis; treatment indication; adenoid; epidemiology; hypertrophy; pathology; postoperative complication; procedures; prognosis; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Adenoidectomy; Adenoids; Child; Female; Humans; Hypertrophy; Incidence; Male; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85021288382

Objective This study assessed tofacitinib efficacy and safety vs placebo in Asian patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Methods Patients from China mainland, Taiwan, and Korea were randomized 2:2:1:1 to tofacitinib 5 mg (N = 88), tofacitinib 10 mg (N = 90), placebo → 5 mg (N = 44), or placebo → 10 mg (N = 44), twice daily (BID) for 52 weeks. Placebo-treated patients advanced to tofacitinib at Week 16. Co-primary efficacy endpoints: proportions of patients achieving Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) response (‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’) and proportion achieving ?75% reduction from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) at Week 16. Results At Week 16, more patients achieved PGA and PASI75 responses with tofacitinib 5 mg (52.3%; 54.6%) and 10 mg (75.6%; 81.1%) BID vs placebo (19.3%; 12.5%; all p < 0.0001).

However, there are few large cohort studies, and there is no report about the impact of HBV vaccination. We conducted this study to evaluate these issues. We used the nationwide cohort of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for 1997–2013. We compared the incidence and the risk of developing NHL and CD20+ aggressive lymphoma between HBV and non-HBV cohorts. The hazard ratios (HRs) were computed using Cox proportional hazards models. We matched these two large cohorts to reconfirm the data. We also compared the incidence of NHL between cohorts born before and after the inception of universal HBV vaccination. We found that HBV infection increased the risk for developing NHL and CD20+ aggressive lymphoma, with HRs of 4.14 and 5.52, with a higher incidence of 17.07 and 13.9 per 100?000 person-years, respectively, compared to the non-HBV cohort. The incidence of NHL in the cohort born in the era before universal HBV vaccination was higher with 1.85 per 100?000 person-years compared to 0.74 in the cohort born later aged younger than 20. Our study confirms that HBV confers a greater risk for developing NHL, especially CD20+ aggressive lymphoma. The impact of HBV vaccination is protective against lymphoma development in the teenagers in an endemic area, but longer follow-up is needed for older age. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; hepatitis B; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; risk; vaccination,"CD20 antigen; hepatitis B vaccine; adult; Article; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; hazard ratio; hepatitis B; human; major clinical study; male; nonhodgkin lymphoma; priority journal; risk assessment; vaccination; aged; comorbidity; complication; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; immunology; middle aged; nonhodgkin lymphoma; risk; socioeconomics; Taiwan; vaccination; virology; young adult; Adult; Aged; Comorbidity; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Male; Middle Aged; Risk; Socioeconomic Factors; Taiwan; Vaccination; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85019630816

Fifty-one Taiwanese patients were randomized into s.c. placebo, 150 and 300 mg secukinumab treatment groups. The proportions of patients who achieved 75% or more improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) at week 12 were 87.5% with 300 mg secukinumab, 70% with 150 mg secukinumab, 0% with placebo. Of the patients receiving 300 mg secukinumab, 68.8% achieved PASI-90 at week 12.

Methods This retrospective cohort study included patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes during 1999–2005, recruited from Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. A total of 169,601 patients (original cohort: 153,270 ever-users and 16,331 never-users of metformin) and a subgroup of 1:1 propensity-score-matched pairs of 16,331 ever-users and 16,331 never-users (matched cohort) were followed up to 31 December 2011. Cox regression was constructed with the inverse probability of treatment-weighting, using propensity scores, and was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Results In the original cohort, the incidence of CRC was 242.9 and 480.9 per 100,000 person-years, respectively, in ever- and never-users. The overall HR [0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45–0.56] suggested a significantly lower risk in metformin users, while compared with never-users, the HR (95% CI) for the first (<27.1 months), second (27.1–58.1 months) and third (>58.1 months) tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin therapy was 0.86 (0.76–0.98), 0.51 (0.45–0.59) and 0.26 (0.23–0.30), respectively. Analyses in the matched cohort showed similar findings with an overall HR of 0.62 (0.53–0.74), and a tertile analysis HR of 1.02 (0.81–1.28), 0.70 (0.56–0.89) and 0.32 (0.23–0.43), respectively.

Persistent growth of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in the lungs indicates continuous infection in MAC lung disease (MAC-LD), but its clinical significance has not been investigated. We aimed to evaluate the predictors of persistent culture-positivity for MAC (MAC-PP) and its impact on radiographic deterioration in MAC-LD. Methods. Patients with MAC-LD at multiple medical centers from 2011 to 2016 were enrolled retrospectively. Microbiological persistence of MAC-LD was defined as MAC-PP exceeding 1 year, in contrast with the negative-conversion group. The outcome was radiographic progression, namely, increased number of involved lung areas or cavitary formation. Results. Among 126 patients with MAC-LD, 75 (60%) were in the MAC-PP group; these patients had a higher proportion of radiographic progression (54%) than patients in the negative-conversion group (odds ratio [OR], 3.318; 95% confidence interval, 1.146-9.612). Independent predictors of MAC-PP were low body mass index (BMI), radiographic nodular-bronchiectatic (NB) pattern, and increase in the highest grade of acid-fast bacilli smear (AFS). Patients with BMI <21 kg/m2, NB pattern, and positive AFS had an OR of 17.7 for MAC-PP, and those with ?2 of the factors had a 4.5-fold increased OR for MAC-PP relative to the comparison group. Other than MAC-PP, the highest AFS grade and no anti-MAC treatment were correlated with radiographic progression. Conclusion. Microbiological persistence in patients with MAC-LD is not uncommon and leads to an increased risk of radiographic progression. The predictors of MAC-PP are low BMI, NB pattern, and high AFS grade; if these risk factors are present, anti- MAC treatment should be seriously considered. ?

However, the impact of overweight and obesity on COPD-related outcomes is uncertain. The aim of this study was to examine whether a high BMI is associated with the frequent exacerbator phenotype (?2/year) in Taiwanese patients with COPD. Patients and methods: Data were obtained from the Taiwan Obstructive Lung Disease study, a retrospective, observational nationwide survey of COPD patients conducted at 12 hospitals in Taiwan. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the association between BMI and other factors with the frequency of COPD exacerbations in these patients. Results: Among the whole study cohort (n=1,096), 735 (67.1%) had no exacerbations and 148 (13.5%) were frequent exacerbators in the previous year. The BMI values of the patients with 0, 1, and ?2 exacerbations were 23.6, 23.5, and 22.6 kg/m2, respectively. In all, 256 (23.4%) and 196 (17.9%) patients were overweight (27 kg/m2 &gt; BMI ?24 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ?27 kg/m2), respectively. Even after adjusting for multiple factors, overweight and obesity were associated with the frequency of exacerbations (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.49 [0.28-0.87, P=0.015] and 0.49 [0.26-0.94, P=0.033], respectively). Conclusion: Our results suggest that overweight and obesity are associated with a lower frequency of COPD exacerbations in Taiwan. ? 2017 Wei et al.",Acute exacerbation; COPD; Obesity; Overweight,"adipocytokine; adiponectin; antibiotic agent; leptin; steroid; adult; age; anxiety; Article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical study; cohort analysis; congestive heart failure; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease exacerbation; dyslipidemia; female; gender; health care survey; heart arrhythmia; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; lung cancer; lung function; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; obesity; observational study; osteoporosis; retrospective study; smoking; Taiwan; wheezing; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical trial; comorbidity; disease exacerbation; lung; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; obesity; odds ratio; pathophysiology; phenotype; protection; risk factor; statistical model; Body Mass Index; Comorbidity; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Lung; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Obesity; Odds Ratio; Overweight; Phenotype; Protective Factors; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85029436614

Moreover, the design of a 2D NS-based PSA aptamer sensor system was demonstrated based on a fluorescence turn-on mechanism in the presence of a target. The 2D NSs acted as an excellent sensing platform in which the PSA aptamer was adsorbed on the NSs and subsequent energy transfer between them led to fluorescence quenching of the aptamer. The detection limit of PSA was achieved to be 13 pM for MoO3 NSs, whereas the MoS2 and MoSe2 systems exhibited a detection limit of 72 and 157 pM, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the ultra-sensitive detection of a 2D NS-based aptamer sensor. The in vitro bioimaging measurements were performed using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Herein, PSA detection was successfully demonstrated in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK) live cells.

This phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, proof-of-concept study is the first clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody CNTO 6785 in patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients were treated with CNTO 6785 (n = 93) or placebo (n = 94) intravenously at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 (induction), then Weeks 8 and 12, and followed till Week 24. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1?second at Week?16. Samples were collected at all visits for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation, and standard safety assessments were performed. The mean difference in the primary efficacy endpoint between CNTO 6785 and placebo was not statistically significant (?0.49%; p = 0.599). No other efficacy endpoints demonstrated clinically or statistically significant differences with CNTO 6785 compared with placebo. CNTO 6785 was generally well tolerated; no major safety signals were detected. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were infections and infestations; however, no notable differences were observed between CNTO 6785 and placebo in terms of rates of infections. PK results suggested that the steady state of serum CNTO 6785 concentration was reached within 16?weeks. These results suggest that IL-17A is unlikely to be a dominant driver in the pathology of, or a viable therapeutic target for, COPD.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used as the first-line agent for treatment, but mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene render potential resistance to sulfamide. Despite advances of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), Pneumocystis pneumonia continues to occur in HIV-infected patients with late presentation for cART or virological and immunological failure after receiving cART. Areas covered: This review summarizes the diagnosis and first-line and alternative treatment and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. Articles for this review were identified through searching PubMed. Search terms included: ‘Pneumocystis pneumonia’, ‘Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia’, ‘Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia’, ‘trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole’, ‘primaquine’, ‘trimetrexate’, ‘dapsone’, ‘pentamidine’, ‘atovaquone’, ‘echinocandins’, ‘human immunodeficiency virus infection’, ‘acquired immunodeficiency syndrome’, ‘resistance to sulfamide’ and combinations of these terms. We limited the search to English language papers that were published between 1981 and March 2017. We screened all identified articles and cross-referenced studies from retrieved articles. Expert commentary: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole will continue to be the first-line agent for Pneumocystis pneumonia given its cost, availability of both oral and parenteral formulations, and effectiveness or efficacy in both treatment and prophylaxis. Whether resistance due to mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene compromises treatment effectiveness remains controversial. Continued search for effective alternatives with better safety profiles for Pneumocystis pneumonia is warranted. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",alternative therapy; combination antiretroviral therapy; Interstitial pneumonitis; prophylaxis; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,"alkaline phosphatase; antiretrovirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; atovaquone; caspofungin; clindamycin; corticosteroid; cotrimoxazole; dapsone; dihydropteroate synthase; echinocandin; pentamidine; primaquine; sulfanilamide; trimetrexate; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; cotrimoxazole; dihydropteroate synthase; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; diagnostic test; diarrhea; dihydropteroate synthase gene; disease severity; drug choice; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug treatment failure; dysglycemia; electrolyte disturbance; fever; gene mutation; headache; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hyperglycemia; hyperkalemia; hypersensitivity; hypokalemia; hypotension; infection prevention; kidney disease; kidney injury; liver toxicity; maculopapular rash; megaloblastic anemia; mental disease; nausea; nephrotoxicity; neutropenia; nonhuman; Pneumocystis jiroveci; Pneumocystis pneumonia; primary prevention; Review; secondary prevention; side effect; thrombocytopenia; thrombophlebitis; torsade des pointes; vomiting; AIDS related complex; antibiotic resistance; CD4 lymphocyte count; drug effect; genetics; highly active antiretroviral therapy; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; immunocompromised patient; immunology; metabolism; microbiology; mutation; pathogenicity; Pneumocystis carinii; Pneumocystis pneumonia; treatment outcome; virology; AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-HIV Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Bacterial Proteins; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Dihydropteroate Synthase; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; HIV-1; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Mutation; Pneumocystis carinii; Pneumonia, Pneumocystis; Treatment Outcome; Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination",2-s2.0-85029680469

Although NUC therapy exhibits potent on-Treatment viral suppression, frequent off-Therapy virological relapses suggest an indefinite treatment course. Interferon modulates the innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses and thus increases the chance of viral eradication. Interferon therapy has the advantage of a finite duration, absence of drug resistance, and durable posttreatment responses. Therefore, the combination of NUCs and interferon can theoretically facilitate a synergistic therapeutic effect. This paper summarizes the current strategies of various combination therapies into three categories: The simultaneous ""dual"" strategy, sequential combination ""add-on"" strategy, and ""switch"" strategy. Generally, dual therapy exhibits greater on-Treatment and off-Therapy viral suppression and lower drug resistance compared with NUC monotherapy. Compared with interferon monotherapy, dual therapy has greater on-Treatment viral suppression but shows no difference in off-Therapy sustained virological responses. Specific add-on or switch strategies provide promising on-Treatment efficacy in select patients.

However, how HCV induces the biogenesis of autophagosomes and how HCV RNA replication complex may be assembled on autophagosomes were largely unknown. During autophagy, crescent membrane structures known as phagophores first appear in the cytoplasm, which then progress to become autophagosomes. By conducting electron microscopy and in vitro membrane fusion assay, we found that phagophores induced by HCV underwent homotypic fusion to generate autophagosomes in a process dependent on the SNARE protein syntaxin 7 (STX7). Further analyses by live-cell imaging and fluorescence microscopy indicated that HCV-induced phagophores originated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly, comparing with autophagy induced by nutrient starvation, the progression of phagophores to autophagosomes induced by HCV took significantly longer time, indicating fundamental differences in the biogenesis of autophagosomes induced by these two different stimuli. As the knockdown of STX7 to inhibit the formation of autophagosomes did not affect HCV RNA replication, and purified phagophores could mediate HCV RNA replication, the assembly of the HCV RNA replication complex on autophagosomes apparently took place during the formative stage of phagophores. These findings provided important information for understanding how HCV controlled and modified this important cellular pathway for its own replication. ? 2017 Wang et al.",,"Article; autophagosome; biogenesis; electron microscopy; endoplasmic reticulum; fluorescence microscopy; Hepatitis C virus; human; membrane fusion; protein degradation; RNA replication; Western blotting; autophagosome; autophagy; biosynthesis; cell line; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; physiology; transmission electron microscopy; virology; virus replication; virus RNA; Autophagosomes; Autophagy; Cell Line; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Humans; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; RNA, Viral; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-85030451614

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the etiologic and audiologic characteristics of pediatric-onset unilateral and asymmetric SNHL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study performed from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2016, patients at a tertiary referral center who were diagnosed with pediatric-onset unilateral or asymmetric SNHL were divided into 3 groups according to their hearing levels: unilateral hearing loss with scaled-out levels (UHL-SO), unilateral hearing loss with residual hearing (UHL-RH), and asymmetric hearing loss (AHL). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Basic demographic data, family and medical histories, audiologic results, imaging findings, and genetic results were ascertained and compared among patients of the 3 groups. RESULTS: A total of 133 patients (mean [SD] age, 9.1 [10.9] years; 63 [47.4%] male and 70 [52.6%] female), including 50 with UHL-SO, 42 with UHL-RH, and 41 with AHL, were enrolled for analyses. Of 50 patients with UHL-SO, 49 (98.0%) had stable hearing levels with time, whereas 10 of 42 patients with UHL-RH (23.8%) and 18 of 41 patients with AHL (43.9%) revealed progressive or fluctuating hearing loss. Inner ear malformations detected with temporal bone high-resolution computed tomography, particularly cochlear aperture stenosis, were detected at higher rates in patients with UHL-SO (9 of 31 [29.0%]) and UHL-RH (6 of 24 [25.0%]) than in those with AHL (1 of 30 [3.3%]). In contrast, screening for mutations in 3 common deafness genes—GJB2, SLC26A4, and MTRNR1—achieved definite diagnosis in a higher percentage of patients with AHL (10 of 37 [27.0%]) than patients with UHL-SO (0 of 33) and UHL-RH (1 of 25 [4.0%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The UHL-SO and UHL-RH conditions share a common or similar etiopathogenesis different from that of AHL. Imaging studies and genetic testing might be prioritized during the respective general etiologic workups for patients with UHL and AHL. Regular hearing checkups are warranted for patients with UHL and AHL because a certain proportion of patients might sustain progression in SNHL. ? 2017 American Medical Association.

Materials and Methods. We enrolled 226 patients from June 2011 to May 2013. During this period, gefitinib was the only EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor reimbursed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance of Taiwan. Results. The median progression-free survival and median OS were 11.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.7-14.2) and 26.9 months (21.2-32.5), respectively. The Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that postoperative recurrence, performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Grade [ECOG] ?2), smoking index (?20 pack-years), liver metastasis at initial diagnosis, and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were independent prognostic factors for OS (hazard ratio [95% CI] 0.3 [0.11-0.83], p5.02; 2.69 [1.60-4.51], p<.001; 1.92 [1.24-2.97], p5.003; 2.26 [1.34-3.82], p5.002; 3.38 [1.85-7.78], p<.001, respectively). However, brain metastasis (BM) at initial diagnosis or intracranial progression during gefitinib treatment had no impact on OS (1.266 [0.83-1.93], p5.275 and 0.75 [0.48-1.19], p5.211, respectively). Conclusion. HCV infection, performance status (ECOG ?2), newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC without prior operation, and liver metastasis predicted poor OS in EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC patients treated with first-line gefitinib; however, neither BM at initial diagnosis nor intracranial progression during gefitinib treatment had an impact on OS ?

However, the optimal dosage remains unclear. We aimed to compare different dosage of tolvaptan to determine the optimal dosage in terms of the efficacy and safety. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov through Aug 31, 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tolvaptan of different dosages or to placebo in patients with CHF were included. We used network meta-analysis to look for the optimal dosage in terms of effectiveness and safety. Urine output, body weight change and change in serum sodium were the main outcomes of efficacy. Adverse effects were the secondary outcomes. Quality was assessed by Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Results: Twelve RCTs reporting 14 articles with 5793 patients (mean age, 65.7 ± 11.9 years; 73.7% man) were included. Compared with placebo, the tolvaptan 30 mg had similar effects to tolvaptan 45–90 mg in terms of urine output (mean difference [MD] 2.03 liter; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 2.71), body weight change (MD -1.12 kg; 95% CI -1.37 to -0.88) and change in serum sodium (MD 3.06 meq/L; 95% CI 2.43 to 3.68). Compared with placebo, tolvaptan of different dosage showed a non-significant higher risk of adverse effects. Conclusions: These findings suggest that tolvaptan 30 mg and 45 mg may be the optimum dosage for CHF patients, because of its ability to provide favourable clinical results without greater adverse effects. However, tolvaptan is not beneficial for reducing all-cause mortality in CHF patients. ? 2017 Wu et al.

(AVL)) is a popular beverage in Asia and has been reportedly to be associated with the bioactivities such as cardiotonic, diuretic, antioxidative, and antihypertensive. However, its biofunction as chemoprevention activity is seldom addressed. Herein, we aimed to characterize the anti-androgen-insensitive-prostate-cancer (anti-AIPC) bioactive compounds of Luobuma, and to investigate the associated molecular mechanisms. Activity-guided-fractionation (antioxidative activity and cell survivability) of Luobuma ethanolic extracts was performed to isolate and characterize the major bioactive compounds using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC), Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Plant sterols (lupeol, stigamasterol and β-sitosterol) and polyphenolics (isorhamnetin, kaempferol, and quercetin) were identified. Lupeol, a triterpene found in the fraction (F8) eluted by 10% ethyl acetate/90% hexane and accounted for 19.3% (w/w) of F8, inhibited the proliferation of PC3 cells. Both lupeol and F8 induced G2/M arrest, inhibition of β-catenin signaling, regulation of apoptotic signal molecules (cytochrome c, Bcl-2, P53, and caspase 3 and 8), and suppression DNA repair enzyme expression (Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG)). To our knowledge, our study is the first report that lupeol inhibited the expression of UNG to elicit the cytotoxicity against androgen-insensitive-prostate-cancer cells. Collectively, Luobuma, which contains several antitumor bioactive compounds, holds the potential to be a dietary chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer. ? 2017 by the authors.

However, MEK inhibition leads to the compensatory PI3K/AKT activation and thus contributes to the desensitization of cancer cells to MEK inhibitors. The underlying molecular mechanism of this event is not yet understood. In this study, our data showed that the induction of Akt activity by MEK inhibitors was specifically observed in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Silence of HER2, or overexpression of HER2 kinase-dead mutant, prevents the induction of Akt activation in response to MEK inhibition, indicating HER2 as a critical regulator for this event. Furthermore, HER2 Thr701 was demonstrated as a direct phosphorylation target of ERK1/2. Inhibition of this specific phosphorylation prolonged the dimerization of HER2 with EGFR in a clathrin-dependent manner, leading to the enhanced activation of HER2 and EGFR tyrosine kinase and their downstream Akt pathway. These results suggest that suppression of ERK-mediated HER2 Thr701 phosphorylation contributes to MEK inhibitor-induced Akt activation. ? 2017 The Authors.

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (NAHSIT), 2014–2016. Participants: Noninstitutionalized Taiwanese nationals aged 65 years and older enrolled in the NAHSIT (N = 923). Measurements: Dietary intake was assessed using a 79-item food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Presence of 5 frailty phenotypes was determined using modified Fried criteria and are summed into a frailty score. Using data from the NAHSIT (2014–15), reduced rank regression was used to find a dietary pattern that explained maximal degree of variation of the frailty scores. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between frailty and dietary pattern. The findings were validated with data from 2016. Results: The derived dietary pattern was characterized with a high consumption of fruit, nuts and seeds, tea, vegetables, whole grains, shellfish, milk, and fish. The prevalence of frailty was 7.8% and of prefrailty was 50.8%, defined using the modified Fried criteria. Using data from the NAHSIT (2014–15), the dietary pattern score showed an inverse dose-response relationship with prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty. Individuals in the second dietary pattern tertile were one-third as likely to be frail as those in the first tertile (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.12?0.85), and those in the third tertile were 4% as likely to be frail as those in the first tertile (aOR = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.01?0.18). The dietary pattern score estimated using FFQ data from the NAHSIT 2016 was also significantly and inversely associated with frailty. Conclusion: Individuals with a dietary pattern with more phytonutrient-rich plant foods, tea, omega-3-rich deep-sea fish, and other protein-rich foods such as shellfish and milk had a reduced prevalence of frailty. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings and investigate whether related dietary interventions can reduce frailty in older adults. ? 2017, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation ? 2017, The American Geriatrics Society",dietary pattern; elderly; frailty; Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (NAHSIT); reduced rank regression,"aged; Article; cross-sectional study; dietary intake; dose response; eating habit; female; fish; food frequency questionnaire; frailty; fruit; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; milk; nut; nutrition; phenotype; plant seed; prevalence; shellfish; Taiwan; tea; vegetable; whole grain; frail elderly; Mediterranean diet; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet, Mediterranean; Female; Frail Elderly; Humans; Male; Nutrition Surveys; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85021241831

If injury is mild, a repair process can be adaptive and lead to complete renal recovery. However, severe injury will be accompanied by a maladaptive repair which usually leads to nephron loss, fibrosis, vascular rarefaction, and chronic inflammation. Although various mechanisms underlying AKI-CKD transition have been explored, no intervention has been proved effective to block the transition until very recently. A lack of consensus for monitoring renal function and defining renal recovery after AKI should be the reasons for the slow advance in the discovery of a timely pharmacologic treatment to block AKI-CKD transition. Recently, animal studies have shown the activation of renin–angiotensin system (RAS) after AKI. In patients with complete renal recovery after AKI defined as the decrease of serum creatinine level to within 0.3 mg/dL above the baseline, administration of RAS inhibitor can prevent the ensuing CKD. In this review, we will discuss the renal recovery after AKI and the mechanisms underlying AKI-CKD transition. We will then highlight the promising effect of RAS inhibitor on CKD prevention in patients with complete renal recovery from AKI based on the recent clinical evidence. ? 2017",Acute kidney injury; Chronic kidney disease; Renin–angiotensin system,"biological marker; creatinine; spironolactone; biological marker; acute kidney failure; cell regeneration; chronic kidney failure; convalescence; creatinine blood level; disorders of mitochondrial functions; epigenetics; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; glomerulus filtration; human; inflammatory infiltrate; kidney function; kidney tubule epithelium; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; nonhuman; renal protection; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Review; acute kidney failure; animal; cell cycle checkpoint; chronic kidney failure; complication; genetic epigenesis; mitochondrion; physiology; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Acute Kidney Injury; Animals; Biomarkers; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Mitochondria; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Renin-Angiotensin System",2-s2.0-85020416083

Methods The passive stiffness of the BBM was quantified with shear wave velocity (SWV) measurements obtained from 10 healthy volunteers (5 men and 5 women, mean age 50?years, age range 42–63 years) with the elbow at full extension and 30° flexion in this IRB-approved study. Potential differences between two depths within the muscle, two elbow positions, the two arms, and sexes were assessed by using two-tailed t-test. The reproducibility of SWV measurements was tested by using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Significantly higher passive BBM stiffness was found at full elbow extension compared to 30° of flexion (p???0.00006 for both arms). Significantly higher passive stiffness in women was seen for the right arm (p?=?0.04 for both elbow positions). Good correlation of shear wave velocity measured at the different depths.

Here we aimed to clarify the association between HCV viral load, genotype, and CKD in 13,805 participants aged 30-65 years enrolled in the REVEAL-HCV Study, a community-based prospective study conducted in 1991-1992. CKD was defined by consecutive proteinuria or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Chronic HCV infection was defined by detectable HCV viral load. Logistic regression models were used to estimate prevalence odds ratio of CKD for chronic HCV infection after adjusting for other risk factors. Compared to non-chronically HCV-infected participants, the adjusted prevalence odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for CKD was significantly increased to 1.91 (1.27–2.88) for chronically HCV-infected participants. Compared to non-chronically HCV-infected participants, the adjusted prevalence odds ratio of CKD was 1.21 (0.54-2.70), 1.40 (0.66-3.00) and 3.44 (1.92-6.14) for chronically HCV-infected participants with low to high tertiles of serum HCV RNA, respectively. The adjusted prevalence odds ratios of CKD were 0.54 (0.17-1.75) for participants with low HCV RNA and genotype 1, 1.80 (0.84-3.87) for those with low HCV RNA and genotype 2, 2.62 (1.11-6.17) for those with high HCV RNA and genotype 1 and 4.99 (2.25-11.06) for those with high HCV RNA and genotype 2, compared with non-chronically HCV-infected participants. Thus, chronic HCV infection is associated with an increased risk of CKD. High HCV viral load and HCV genotype 2 are strong CKD predictors. ? 2017 International Society of Nephrology",chronic kidney disease; genotype; hepatitis C; prevalence; viral load,"adult; Article; chronic hepatitis C; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; follow up; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; human; informed consent; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; virus load; blood; chronic hepatitis C; chronic kidney failure; genotype; glomerulus filtration rate; Hepacivirus; isolation and purification; liver function test; middle aged; odds ratio; physiology; proteinuria; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; urine; virology; virus RNA; Adult; Female; Genotype; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Liver Function Tests; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Proteinuria; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; RNA, Viral; Taiwan; Viral Load",2-s2.0-85019924587

This longitudinal study followed workers who were occupationally injured in 2009. Psychological symptoms and return to work were assessed at 3 and 12 months after injury. Injured workers who had completed the initial questionnaire survey at 3 or 12 months after injury were recruited. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to the participants. For workers with high Brief Symptom Rating Scale and Post-traumatic Symptom Checklist scores, an in-depth psychiatric evaluation was performed using the Mini-international Neuropsychiatric Interview. A total of 570 workers completed the questionnaire (response rate, 28.7%). Among them, 243 (42.6%) had high psychological symptom scores and were invited for a phone interview; 135 (55.6%) completed the interview. The estimated rates of major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)/partial PTSD were 9.2 and 7.2%, respectively, and both these rates were higher at 6 years after injury than at 12 months after injury (2.0 and 5.1%). After adjustment for family and social factors, the risk factors for high psychological scores were length of hospitalization immediately after injury, affected physical appearance, repeated occupational injuries, unemployment, and number of quit jobs after the injury. At 6 years after occupational injury, the re-emergence of psychiatric disorders was observed. Relevant factors for poor psychological health were severity of injury and instability of work. Periodic monitoring of psychological and physical health and economic stability are warranted. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Depression; Occupational injury; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Psychological symptoms,"adult; anxiety; Article; Brief Symptom Inventory; checklist; family; female; hospitalization; human; injury severity; longitudinal study; major clinical study; major depression; male; mental disease; middle aged; mini international neuropsychiatric interview; occupational accident; physical appearance; posttraumatic stress disorder; Posttraumatic Symptom Checklist; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; return to work; risk factor; social aspect; symptom assessment; telephone interview; unemployment; anxiety disorder; complication; employment; follow up; major depression; occupational accident; posttraumatic stress disorder; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Depressive Disorder, Major; Employment; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Injuries; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85007524664

Methods: A prospective, repeated-measures, randomized controlled therapeutic intervention design was used. A total of 66 participants were randomly assigned to each group, with 32 in the experimental group and 34 in the control group. The experimental group received a 4-session skin camouflage program, and the control group received routine care. Patients were assessed at 3 time points: baseline assessment (T0) and then at 1, 2, and 3?months (T1, T2, and T3, respectively) after participating in the skin camouflage program. Results: Patients in the experimental group had significantly less facial disfigurement, depression, fear of social interaction, and anxiety regarding social interaction compared with those in the control group. Participants in both groups had significantly lower levels of facial disfigurement, depression, fear of social interaction, anxiety of social interaction, and body image at the final posttest assessment than at the pretest assessment. There were no differences between the groups and within groups with respect to self-esteem. Conclusions: The 3-month skin camouflage program effectively improved facial disfigurement, fear of social interaction, anxiety of social interaction, and body image of female HNC survivors. A survival care plan should include a skin camouflage program to improve body image perception and decrease anxiety after treatment of HNC.

Preclinical and translational applications of MR nano-theranostic hyperthermia are currently limited by a few major theoretical difficulties and experimental challenges in in vivo conditions. For example, conventional models for estimating the heat generated and the optimal magnetic nanoparticle sizes for hyperthermia do not accurately reproduce reported in vivo experimental results. In this work, a revised cluster-based model was proposed to predict the specific loss power (SLP) by explicitly considering magnetic nanoparticle aggregation in in vivo conditions. By comparing with the reported experimental results of magnetite Fe3O4 and cobalt ferrite CoFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles, it is shown that the revised cluster-based model provides a more accurate prediction of the experimental values than the conventional models that assume magnetic nanoparticles act as single units. It also provides a clear physical picture: the aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles increases the cluster magnetic anisotropy while reducing both the cluster domain magnetization and the average magnetic moment, which, in turn, shift the predicted SLP toward a smaller magnetic nanoparticle diameter with lower peak values. As a result, the heating efficiency and the SLP values are decreased. The improvement in the prediction accuracy in in vivo conditions is particularly pronounced when the magnetic nanoparticle diameter is in the range of ~10–20 nm. This happens to be an important size range for MR cancer nano-theranostics, as it exhibits the highest efficacy against both primary and metastatic tumors in vivo. Our studies show that a relatively 20%–25% smaller magnetic nanoparticle diameter should be chosen to reach the maximal heating efficiency in comparison with the optimal size predicted by previous models. ? 2017 Wang et al.",Hyperthermia; Magnetic nanoparticle; Magnetic resonance; Nano-theranostics; Specific loss power,"cobalt ferrite; ferrite; magnetic nanoparticle; magnetite; monomer; unclassified drug; cobalt; ferric ion; magnetite nanoparticle; accuracy; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anisotropy; Article; cancer tissue; controlled study; heating; human; in vivo study; magnetic resonance nano theranostic hyperthermia; magnetism; male; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; pancreatic cancer cell line; photon correlation spectroscopy; prediction; thermotherapy; tumor xenograft; animal; chemistry; devices; drug screening; neoplasm; procedures; theoretical model; theranostic nanomedicine; thermotherapy; Animals; Anisotropy; Cobalt; Ferric Compounds; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Mice; Models, Theoretical; Neoplasms; Theranostic Nanomedicine; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85028594741

In the current study, we found that AML patients with low bone marrow (BM) SOX4 expression had higher remission rates and longer overall survival than those with high SOX4 expression, regardless of age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, karyotype profile and NPM1/FLT3-ITD status. To elucidate the role of SOX4 in leukemogenesis, we generated a transgenic zebrafish model that overexpressed human SOX4 in the myeloid lineage Tg(spi1-SOX4-EGFP). These transgenic zebrafish showed, at 5 months of age, increased myelopoiesis with dedifferentiation in kidney marrow. At 9 months of age, their kidney structure was significantly effaced and distorted by increased infiltration of myeloid progenitor cells.

Therefore, we conducted a comparative study of those who used budesonide/ formoterol and those treated with fluticasone/salmeterol for COPD. Methods: Subjects in this population-based cohort study comprised patients with COPD who were treated with a fixed combination of budesonide/formoterol or fluticasone/salmeterol. All patients were recruited from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. The outcomes including severe exacerbations, pneumonia, and pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) were measured. Results: During the study period, 11,519 COPD patients receiving fluticasone/salmeterol and 7,437 patients receiving budesonide/formoterol were enrolled in the study. Pairwise matching (1:1) of fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol populations resulted in to two similar subgroups comprising each 7,295 patients. Patients receiving fluticasone/salmeterol had higher annual rate and higher risk of severe exacerbation than patients receiving budesonide/ formoterol (1.2219/year vs 1.1237/year, adjusted rate ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.07–1.10). In addition, patients receiving fluticasone/salmeterol had higher incidence rate and higher risk of pneumonia than patients receiving budesonide/formoterol (12.11 per 100 person-years vs 10.65 per 100 person-years, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08–1.20). Finally, patients receiving fluticasone/salmeterol had higher incidence rate and higher risk of pneumonia requiring MV than patients receiving budesonide/formoterol (3.94 per 100 person-years vs 3.47 per 100 person-years, aHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05–1.24). A similar trend was seen before and after propensity score matching analysis, intention-to-treat, and as-treated analysis with and without competing risk. Conclusions: Based on this retrospective observational study, long-term treatment with fixed combination budesonide/formoterol was associated with fewer severe exacerbations, pneumonia, and pneumonia requiring MV than fluticasone/salmeterol in COPD patients. ? 2017 Yang et al.",COPD; Exacerbation; ICS/LABA; Pneumonia,"budesonide plus formoterol; fluticasone propionate plus salmeterol; beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; bronchodilating agent; budesonide plus formoterol; fluticasone propionate plus salmeterol; glucocorticoid; adult; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; chronic obstructive lung disease; disease exacerbation; drug effect; female; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; observational study; outcome assessment; pneumonia; population research; prescription; retrospective study; risk assessment; chronic obstructive lung disease; comparative study; complication; drug effect; factual database; inhalational drug administration; lung; middle aged; pathophysiology; pneumonia; propensity score; proportional hazards model; risk factor; severity of illness index; statistical model; Taiwan; time factor; treatment outcome; Administration, Inhalation; Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists; Aged; Bronchodilator Agents; Budesonide, Formoterol Fumarate Drug Combination; Databases, Factual; Disease Progression; Female; Fluticasone-Salmeterol Drug Combination; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Logistic Models; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia; Propensity Score; Proportional Hazards Models; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiration, Artificial; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85028314477

However, the association of HIV with incident psoriasis has not been extensively studied. Objectives: The aim of this nationwide population-based cohort study was to determine the association of HIV with incident psoriasis. Methods: Since January 1, 2000, we identified adult people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A control cohort without HIV infection, matched for age and sex, was selected for comparison. All patients were followed until December 31, 2012, and observed for the occurrence of psoriasis. The time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association of HIV with incident psoriasis, while considering death as a competing risk event. Results: Of the 102,070 patients (20,294 PLWHA and 81,776 matched controls), 248 (0.24%) had incident psoriasis during a mean follow-up period of 5.53 years, including 81 (0.40%) PLWHA and 171 (0.21%) controls. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, HIV infection was found to be an independent risk factor for incident psoriasis (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.38 to 2.36). Conclusions: The population of PLWHA is living longer; clinicians need to be aware of their higher risk of psoriasis. ? Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) is a key enzyme in generating prostaglandins causing inflammation, is often found to be overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and is correlated with PCa cell invasion and metastasis. We aim to investigate the molecular mechanism of how COX-2 promotes PCa cell invasion and metastasis and to evaluate the effect of COX-2 inhibitors in a selected model of PCa progression. Our results showed that the expression of COX-2 and Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) was upregulated in highly invasive PCa cells and was correlated with the activated levels of membrane-anchored serine protease matriptase. The expression levels of COX-2 were increased and were correlated with matriptase levels in PCa specimens. Moreover, results showed that COX-2 overexpression or a COX-2 product Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) caused an increase in matriptase activation and PCa cell invasion, whereas COX-2 silencing antagonized matriptase activation and cell invasion. In addition, the inhibition of COX-2-mediated matriptase activation by Celebrex and sulindac sulfide suppressed the androgen-independent and COX2-overexpressing PCa PC-3 cell invasion, tumor growth and lung metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft model.

Nintedanib, a multikinase inhibitor, has exhibited efficacy in early clinical trials for HER2-negative breast cancer. In this study, we examined a new molecular mechanism of nintedanib in TNBC. The results demonstrated that nintedanib enhanced TNBC cell apoptosis, which was accompanied by a reduction of p-STAT3 and its downstream proteins. STAT3 overexpression suppressed nintedanib-mediated apoptosis and further increased the activity of purified SHP-1 protein. Moreover, treatment with either a specific inhibitor of SHP-1 or SHP-1-targeted siRNA reduced the apoptotic effects of nintedanib, which validates the role of SHP-1 in nintedanib-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, nintedanib-induced apoptosis was attenuated in TNBC cells expressing SHP-1 mutants with constantly open conformations, suggesting that the autoinhibitory mechanism of SHP-1 attenuated the effects of nintedanib. Importantly, nintedanib significantly inhibited tumor growth via the SHP-1/p-STAT3 pathway. Clinically, SHP-1 levels were downregulated, whereas p-STAT3 was upregulated in tumor tissues, and SHP-1 transcripts were associated with improved disease-free survival in TNBC patients. Our findings revealed that nintedanib induces TNBC apoptosis by acting as a SHP-1 agonist, suggesting that targeting STAT3 by enhancing SHP-1 expression could be a viable therapeutic strategy against TNBC. ?

The objective of this study was to explore the effects of statin discontinuation or statin dose reduction on recurrent stroke risk. Methods and Results--We conducted a nationwide cohort study using the data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Our source population comprised all patients who were prescribed a statin within 90 days of discharge after an ischemic stroke between 2001 and 2012. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: statin-discontinued, statin-reduced, and statin-maintained. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95%CIs of recurrent stroke during 1-year follow-up in the groups who discontinued statins or reduced statin dose compared with the group who maintained statins as the reference. Among the 45 151 ischemic stroke patients meeting criteria, during the day-90 to day-180 period, 7.0% were on reduced statin therapy, and 18.5% were not on any statin therapy. Compared with maintained-statin intensity therapy, discontinuation of statins was associated with an increased hazard of recurrent stroke (adjusted hazard ratio 1.42, 95%CI 1.28-1.57), whereas reduced-statin dose was not associated with an additional risk (adjusted hazard ratio 0.94, 95%CI 0.78-1.12). Propensity-matching analysis obtained similar results. Conclusions--Discontinuation of statin therapy between 3 and 6 months after an index ischemic stroke was associated with a higher risk of recurrent stroke within 1 year after statin discontinuation. ? 2017 The Authors and Medtronic.",Ischemic stroke; Secondary prevention; Statin; Stroke; Stroke prevention,"atorvastatin; fluindostatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; mevinolin; pitavastatin; pravastatin; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; aged; Article; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; drug dose reduction; drug effect; drug utilization; drug withdrawal; female; follow up; hospital discharge; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; prescription; priority journal; recurrent disease; risk assessment; risk factor; secondary prevention; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; comparative study; drug substitution; epidemiology; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; procedures; retrospective study; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; treatment outcome; Aged; Cholesterol, LDL; Drug Substitution; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Discharge; Recurrence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Secondary Prevention; Stroke; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85030724561

When combined with obesity, it is defined as sarcopenic obesity (SO), which can result in more functional limitations and metabolic disorders than either disorder alone. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate body composition changes after elastic band resistance training in elderly women with SO. Design: Randomized single-blinded (assessor blinded) controlled pilot trial. Setting: Academic medical center. Population: Thirty-five elderly (>60 years old) women with SO. Methods: This pilot randomized controlled trial focused on elderly women with SO. The study group underwent progressive elastic band resistance training for 12 weeks (3 times per week). The control group received only a 40-minute lesson about the exercise concept. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed before and after intervention to evaluate body composition. Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to analyze the differences within and between these groups. Results: In total, 35 elderly women with SO were enrolled and divided into study (N.=18) and control groups (N.=17). No difference was observed in age, biochemical parameters, or Body Mass Index between both groups. After the intervention, the fat proportion of body composition in the right upper extremity (P=0.03), left upper extremity (P=0.04), total fat (P=0.035), and fat percentage (P=0.012) had decreased, and bone mineral density (BMD) (P=0.026), T-score (P=0.028), and Z-score (P=0.021) had increased in the study group. Besides, statistical difference was observed in outcome measurements of right upper extremity (P=0.013), total fat (P=0.023), and fat percentage (P=0.012) between the groups. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that progressive elastic band resistance exercise can reduce fat mass and increase BMD in elderly women with SO, and that this exercise program is feasible for this demographic. Additional studies with larger sample sizes and longer intervention periods should be conducted. Clinical Rehabilitation Impact: Twelve weeks of progressive elastic band resistance exercise program is safe and effective for SO elder women. ?

However, the association between GERD itself and the risk of pneumonia remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between GERD and long-term risk of pneumonia and to identify the major risk factors for pneumonia in GERD patients. Methods Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified patients who were newly diagnosed with GERD and treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2010. Two groups comprising 15,715 GERD cases and 15,715 non-GERD matched controls were generated using propensity score matching, thereby making the differences in basic demographics, concomitant medication use, and comorbidities between the two groups inconsiderable. Results Cumulative incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in the patients with GERD than that in the non-GERD matched controls, with an adjusted HR of 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31–1.67; P < 0.001) within 6-year follow-ups. Multivariate stratified analyses revealed similar results in many subgroups, with a highest risk in individuals younger than 40 years of age (HR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.48–3.19). Crucially, patients with GERD using PPIs longer than 4 months were at a significantly increased risk of pneumonia than those who did not use PPIs or took PPIs less than 4 months. Conclusions GERD was significantly associated with long-term risk of pneumonia, especially in GERD with PPI use longer than 4 months or in the young population. Further prospective longitudinal studies should be conducted for validation and implementing clinical practice guidelines. ? 2017 Hsu et al.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the interaction between H. pylori and hyperglycemia status on the risk of colon adenoma. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a cross-sectional, retrospective study conducted at the MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. The study included 3943 subjects aged >40 years undergoing bidirectional gastrointestinal endoscopy on the same day between July 2006 and June 2015. All subjects had a gastric biopsy specimen tested for H. pylori. Main Outcome Measure: Colon adenoma with and without H. pylori infection at different hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Results: The prevalence of colorectal adenomas in patients who were H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative was 37.3% and 27.29%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified male sex, age, body mass index, H. pylori infection, and HbA1c?6.5% as independent risk factors for adenoma; use of hypoglycemic agents decreased this risk. The prevalence of adenoma was increased with elevated HbA1c levels regardless of H. pylori status. The odds ratio (OR) for adenoma was 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20 to 1.73) if H. pylori was present or 1.68 (95% CI, 1.05 to 2.70) in patients who were H. pylori-negative but had HbA1c ?7.0%. If both conditions were present, the OR was 4.79 (95% CI, 2.92 to 7.84). A 1%increase in HbA1c was associated with an increased prevalence of adenoma by 42.4% in H. pylori-positive subjects. Conclusions: The combination of H. pylori infection and elevated HbA1c is associated with an increased risk of colon adenoma. ?

Methods for the early in situ detection of colorectal adenomatous polyps and their precursors – prior to their malignancy transformation into CRC – are urgently needed. Unfortunately at present, the primary diagnostic method, colonoscopy, can only detect polyps and carcinomas by shape/morphology; with sessile polyps more likely to go unnoticed than polypoid lesions. Here we describe our development of polyp-targeting, fluorescently-labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) that serve as targeted endoscopic contrast agents for the early detection of colorectal polyps and cancer. In vitro cell studies, ex vivo histopathological analysis, and in vivo colonoscopy and endoscopy of murine colorectal cancer models, demonstrate significant binding specificity of our nanoconstructs to pathological lesions via targeting aberrant α-L-fucose expression.

The purpose of this study is to develop biodegradable nanoparticles composed of natural polypeptides and calcium phosphate (CaP) with sequential pH-responsivity to tumor microenvironments for active targeted drug delivery. Two different amphiphilic copolymers, poly(ethylene glycol) 3400 -aconityl linkage-poly(L-glutamic acid) 15 -poly(L-histidine) 10 -poly(L-leucine) 10 and LyP1-poly(ethylene glycol) 1100 -poly(L-glutamic acid) 15 -poly(L-histidine) 10 -poly(L-leucine) 10 , were exploited to self-assemble into micelles in aqueous phase. The bio-stable nanoparticles provide three distinct functional domains: the anionic PGlu shell for CaP mineralization, the protonation of PHis segment for facilitating anticancer drug release at target site, and the hydrophobic core of PLeu for encapsulation of anticancer drugs. Furthermore, the hydrated PEG outer corona is used for prolonging circulation time, while the active targeting ligand, LyP-1, is served to bind to breast cancer cells and lymphatic endothelial cells in tumor for inhibiting metastasis. Mineralized DOX-loaded nanoparticles (M-DOX NPs) efficiently prevent the drug leakage at physiological pH value and facilitate the encapsulated drug release at acidic condition when compared to DOX-loaded nanoparticles (DOX NPs). M-DOX NPs with LyP-1 targeting ligand effectively accumulated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The inhibition effect on cell proliferation also enhances with time, illustrating the prominent anti-tumor efficacy. Moreover, the in vitro metastatic inhibition model shows the profound inhibition effect of inhibitory nanoparticles. In brief, this self-assembling peptide-based drug delivery nanocarrier with multifunctionality and programmable pH-sensitivity is of great promise and potential for anti-cancer therapy. Statement of Significance This tailored-design polypeptide-based nanoparticles with self-assembling and programmable stimulus-responsive properties enable to 1) have stable pH in physiological value with a low level of drug loss and effectively release the encapsulated drug with pH variations according to the tumor microenvironment, 2) enhance targeting ability to hard-to-treat breast cancer cells and activate endothelial cells (tumor region), 3) significantly inhibit the growth and prevent from malignant metastasis of cancer cells in consonance with promising anti-tumor efficacy, and 4) make tumors stick to localized position so that these confined solid tumors can be more accessible by different treatment modalities. This work contributes to designing a programmable pH-responsive drug delivery system based on the tailor-designed polypeptides. ? 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.",Calcium phosphate; Drug delivery; Peptide; Programmable pH responsive; Self-assembling,"aconitic acid; amphophile; calcium phosphate; copolymer; doxorubicin; leucine; ligand; macrogol; nanocarrier; nanoparticle; polyglutamic acid; polyhistidine; polypeptide; doxorubicin; drug carrier; nanoparticle; peptide; acidity; antineoplastic activity; aqueous solution; Article; biodegradability; breast cancer; cancer therapy; cell proliferation; circulation time; controlled study; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug release; human; human cell; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; lymph vessel endothelium; MDA-MB-231 cell line; metastasis inhibition; micelle; mineralization; nanoencapsulation; particle size; pH; priority journal; proton transport; tumor microenvironment; breast tumor; chemistry; delayed release formulation; drug design; metabolism; pathology; pharmacology; tumor cell line; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Delayed-Action Preparations; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers; Drug Design; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Nanoparticles; Peptides",2-s2.0-85020689264

Data Sources Studies were comprehensively searched, without language restrictions, on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane, and other databases. The reference lists of articles and reviews were cross-checked for possible studies. Study Selection Randomized controlled trials from before August 2016 were included. Study selection was conducted by 2 reviewers independently. Data Extraction The quality of studies was assessed and data extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreements were settled by consulting a third reviewer to reach a consensus. Data Synthesis Fourteen studies with 1105 participants were included in the network meta-analysis that used a random-effect model to investigate the mean difference of pooled effect sizes of the visual analog scale, Constant-Murley score, and the ratio of complete resolution of calcific deposition on native radiographs. Conclusions The present network meta-analysis demonstrates that ultrasound-guided needling (UGN), radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy (RSW), and high-energy focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (H-FSW) alleviate pain and achieve complete resolution of calcium deposition. Compared with low-energy focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and ultrasound therapy, H-FSW is the best therapy for providing functional recovery. Physicians should consider UGN, RSW, and H-FSW as alternative effective therapies for chronic calcific tendinitis of the shoulder when initial conservative treatment fails. ? 2017 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine",High energy shock waves; Interventional; Rehabilitation; Shoulder; Tendinopathy; Ultrasonography,"calcium; adverse outcome; chronic calcific tendinitis of the shoulder; comparative effectiveness; conservative treatment; Constant Murley (score); effect size; functional assessment; high energy focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy; human; interventional ultrasonography; low energy focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy; meta analysis; pain assessment; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; shock wave therapy; shoulder disease; systematic review; tendinitis; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; ultrasound guided needling; ultrasound therapy; visual analog scale; calcinosis; high-energy shock wave; needle; network meta-analysis; physiotherapy; procedures; shoulder pain; Tendinopathy; therapeutic use; Calcinosis; High-Energy Shock Waves; Humans; Needles; Network Meta-Analysis; Physical Therapy Modalities; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Shoulder Pain; Tendinopathy; Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation; Ultrasonic Therapy; Ultrasonography, Interventional",2-s2.0-85020120341

Although pain occurs mostly secondary to motor disability of PD, pain may antedate motor symptoms by years. Numerous studies have shown that PD patients manifest altered sensory and pain thresholds compared with control subjects. Although both levodopa and deep brain stimulation improve motor symptoms, there remains no direct correlation between motor improvement and altered pain sensitivity, suggesting that motor symptoms and pain do not necessarily share pathogenetic mechanisms. Whether nociceptive processing is dysfunctional in the early stages of PD, when motor symptoms are not prominent, remains uncertain. In this review, we highlight the evidence for disrupted nociceptive processing in patients with early-stage PD. Painful symptoms and aberrant pain processing in early PD are associated with both central and peripheral deafferentation. Dopamine depletion in selective striatal regions, and the development of Lewy pathology in specific non-dopaminergic subcortical areas, underlie the clinical features of pain at this early disease stage. An increased awareness of pain as an early feature of PD might provide further insights into a mechanism-based approach to sensory system dysregulation in this disease. ? 2017",Early stage; Nociceptive pathway; Pain; Parkinson's disease; Sensory,analgesic agent; dopamine; analgesia; awareness; central nervous system; clinical feature; controlled clinical trial (topic); deafferentation; depletion; depression; disease association; disease course; early stage Parkinson disease; human; Lewy body; nerve fiber degeneration; nociception; nociceptive pain; pain assessment; pain threshold; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; peripheral nervous system; Review; sensory nerve; striate cortex; subcortex; symptom; pain; pain measurement; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; Depression; Humans; Pain; Pain Measurement; Pain Perception; Parkinson Disease,2-s2.0-85019870752

The BBM axial deformation was produced by external compression with a sandbag (1.0 kg) tied onto the transducer. The BBM lateral movement was produced by manual passive elbow flexion and extension. By use of 2-D speckle tracking, captured 5-s real-time ultrasound data of BBM were processed to estimate axial strain, representing muscle stiffness, and lateral strain and tissue velocity, representing muscle dynamic motion. Axial (lateral) strain ratio was defined as BBM strain divided by subcutaneous soft tissue strain. There was no significant difference in lateral strain or tissue velocity between the left and right BBM (lateral strain ratio: 4.69 ± 0.07 vs. 4.51 ± 0.08 for extension, 4.82 ± 0.09 vs. 4.69 ± 0.11 for flexion; tissue velocity: 1.58 ± 0.32 cm/s vs. 1.78 ± 0.85 cm/s for extension, ?2.03 ± 0.63 vs. ?2.03 ± 0.59 for flexion; all p values > 0.05) or between men and women (lateral strain ratio: 4.52 ± 0.06 vs. 4.67 ± 0.1 for extension, 4.71 ± 0.11 vs. 4.83 ± 0.09 for flexion; tissue velocity, cm/s: 1.76 ± 0.76 vs. 1.66 ± 0.65 for extension, ?2.21 ± 0.65 vs. ?1.88 ± 0.52 for flexion, all p values > 0.05).

This study aimed to clarify the molecular epidemiology and risk factors of HAdV severe infections and pneumonia among Taiwanese children. Methods Patients with HAdV infections and hospitalized in a medical center between 2009 and 2013 were divided into severe or nonsevere HAdV infections based on whether or not they received intensive care. HAdV pneumonia was identified for comparison. The HAdV genotype was determined by sequencing the partial hexon and fiber genes. The nucleotide sequences were compared by phylogenetic analysis. Results The 176 patients (97 boys, 79 girls) had a median age of 3.7 years. The HAdV infections circulated year-round. HAdV B3 (54.5%) was the most common genotype, followed by HAdV C2 (21%), HAdV E4 (8%), and HAdV B7 (6.8%). Thirty-two patients needed intensive care. In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for severe HAdV infections were underlying neurologic diseases [odds ratio (OR): 164.9; p &lt; 0.001], prematurity (OR: 10.9; p = 0.042), and HAdV B7 (OR: 39.5; p = 0.011).

The epidemiology of these infections may change after the application of new infection control policies. The aims of this study are to reveal the changing epidemiology of BSIs in our NICU and inspect the effects of infection control efforts. Methods We reviewed and analyzed the clinical characteristics of culture-proven BSIs in our NICU from 2008 to 2013 and compared them with our two previously reported data (1992–2001 and 2002–2007). Results The mortality rate decreased from 16.3% in 1992–2001 to 5.6% in 2008–2013. In the recent study period, Gram-positive infections became predominant (58.0%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci remained the most commonly isolated organisms (26.0%). Group B Streptococcus (GBS) BSIs had the highest mortality rate (30.0%). Most GBS-infected infants’ mother did not perform prenatal GBS screening. There was a decrease in the total fungal infection rate after fluconazole prophylaxis for very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates, but the infections of fluconazole-resistant Malassezia pachydermatis increased. The incidence of central line-associated BSI increased to 10.6% in 2011. After restricting the catheter duration to <21 days, the incidence decreased to 4.2% in 2013. Conclusion Through the years, the overall mortality rate of BSIs in our NICU decreased. Maternal GBS screening is an important issue for avoiding early onset GBS mortality. Fungal infection rate decreased after antifungal prophylaxis policy for VLBW infants, but we should be aware of resistant strains.

Diet supplementation of low molecular weight chitosan showed greater efficiency than chitosan oligosaccharide in suppressing the increased weights in body and in liver and adipose tissues of high-fat-diet-fed rats. Supplementation of low molecular weight chitosan also showed a greater improvement than chitosan oligosaccharide in imbalance of plasma, hepatic, and fecal lipid profiles, and intestinal disaccharidase activities in high-fat-diet-fed rats. Moreover, both low molecular weight chitosan and chitosan oligosaccharide significantly decreased the fecal microflora mucinase and β-glucuronidase activities in high-fat-diet-fed rats.

Methods Between April 7, 2015 and May 27, 2016, healthy adults aged 20–60 years were enrolled sequentially in phase I (n = 40) and phase II (n = 160) from three hospitals in Taiwan and randomized to receive 2 doses of whole-virus H7N9 vaccine (15 or 30 μg hemagglutinin antigen (HA) with or without an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant) at 21-day intervals. Safety up to 180 days and changes in hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers at 21 days after each vaccination were determined. Results Of the 200 randomized subjects, 193 (96.5%) received 2 doses of the study vaccine and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis for safety, and 190 (95%) were included in the per-protocol analysis for immunogenicity. Most adverse events were mild and transient; no death or vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. Overall, higher immune responses were observed in the groups administered with 30 μg HA formulation than in the other two groups administered with 15 μg HA formulation. The highest immune response was observed in subjects who received 2 doses of the adjuvanted vaccine containing 30 μg HA with HI titer, seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate, and seroconversion factor of 36.2, 64.6%, 64.6% and 5.7, respectively. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that the H7N9 influenza vaccine containing 30 ?g HA with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was immunogenic and safe in adults aged 20–60 years.

We found that in OSCC there is a correlation between the expression of CCL20 and FOXP3 mRNA. Therefore, we hypothesized that OSCC may favor the recruitment and retention of regulatory T (Treg) cells that express the CCL20 receptor, CCR6. Interestingly, most (?60%) peripheral blood Treg cells express CCR6, and CCR6+ Treg cells exhibit an activated effector/memory phenotype. In contrast, a significant portion (&gt;30%) of CCR62 Treg cells were found to be CD45RA+ naive Treg cells. Compared to CCR62 naive or memory Treg cells, CCR6+ Treg cells exhibit stronger suppressive activity and display higher FOXP3 expression along with lower methylation at the Treg-specific demethylated region of the FOXP3 gene. This predominance of CCR6+ Treg cells was also found in the draining lymph nodes and tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes of OSCC patients with early or late clinical staging. Moreover, CCR6+ Treg cells isolated from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or draining lymph nodes maintained similar phenotypic and suppressive characteristics ex vivo as did their counterparts isolated from peripheral blood. These results suggest that CCR6 marks activated effector or memory Treg phenotypes with superior suppressive activity in humans. ? 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.",,"chemokine receptor CCR6; macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha; messenger RNA; transcription factor FOXP3; CCL20 protein, human; CD45 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR6; forkhead transcription factor; FOXP3 protein, human; macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha; Article; cancer growth; cancer staging; CCL20 gene; controlled study; DNA methylation; FOXP3 gene; gene; gene expression; genetic association; human; human cell; human tissue; mouth cancer; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; adult; cytology; deficiency; female; genetics; immunological memory; immunology; lymph node; male; methylation; middle aged; mouth tumor; pathology; physiology; regulatory T lymphocyte; squamous cell carcinoma; Adult; Antigens, CD45; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Chemokine CCL20; Female; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Humans; Immunologic Memory; Lymph Nodes; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Male; Methylation; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Receptors, CCR6; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory",2-s2.0-85023207944

Delay in diagnosis is common without newborn screening. Family history of infant death due to infection or known SCID (FH) has been associated with earlier diagnosis. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical features that affect age at diagnosis (AD) and time to the diagnosis of SCID. Methods: From 2005 to 2016, 147 SCID patients were referred to the Asian Primary Immunodeficiency Network. Patients with genetic diagnosis, age at presentation (AP), and AD were selected for study. Results: A total of 88 different SCID gene mutations were identified in 94 patients, including 49 IL2RG mutations, 12 RAG1 mutations, 8 RAG2 mutations, 7 JAK3 mutations, 4 DCLRE1C mutations, 4 IL7R mutations, 2 RFXANK mutations, and 2 ADA mutations. A total of 29 mutations were previously unreported. Eighty-three of the 94 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. Their median AD was 4 months, and the time to diagnosis was 2 months. The commonest SCID was X-linked (n = 57). A total of 29 patients had a positive FH. Candidiasis (n = 27) and bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin (BCG) vaccine infection (n = 19) were the commonest infections. The median age for candidiasis and BCG infection documented were 3 months and 4 months, respectively. The median absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 1.05 × 109/L with over 88% patients below 3 × 109/L. Positive FH was associated with earlier AP by 1 month (p = 0.002) and diagnosis by 2 months (p = 0.008), but not shorter time to diagnosis (p = 0.494). Candidiasis was associated with later AD by 2 months (p = 0.008) and longer time to diagnosis by 0.55 months (p = 0.003). BCG infections were not associated with age or time to diagnosis. Conclusion: FH was useful to aid earlier diagnosis but was overlooked by clinicians and not by parents. Similarly, typical clinical features of SCID were not recognized by clinicians to shorten the time to diagnosis. We suggest that lymphocyte subset should be performed for any infant with one or more of the following four clinical features: FH, candidiasis, BCG infections, and ALC below 3 × 109/L. ? 2017 Luk, Lee, Mao, Chan, Chen, Chen, He, Kechout, Suri, Tao, Xu, Jiang, Liew, Jirapongsananuruk, Daengsuwan, Gupta, Singh, Rawat, Abdul Latiff, Lee, Shek, Nguyen, Chin, Chien, Latiff, Le, Le, Lee, Li, Raj, Barbouche, Thong, Ang, Wang, Xu, Yu, Yu, Lee, Yau, Wong, Tu, Yang, Chong, Ho and Lau.",Absolute lymphocyte count; Candidiasis; Family history; Newborn screening; Severe combined immunodeficiency,adenosine deaminase; CD19 antigen; CD3 antigen; Janus kinase 3; RAG1 protein; RAG2 protein; adolescent; adult; age; Article; autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency; B lymphocyte; bovine tuberculosis; candidiasis; child; child death; clinical feature; early diagnosis; failure to thrive; family history; female; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genotype; human; infant; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; Mycobacterium bovis BCG; onset age; opportunistic infection; recurrent infection; severe combined immunodeficiency; time to treatment; X linked severe combined immunodeficiency,2-s2.0-85023170610

Recent studies showed that hematopoietic-specific deletion of Asxl1 or overexpression of mutant ASXL1 resulted in myelodysplasia-like disease in mice. However, actual effects of a ""physiological"" dose of mutant ASXL1 remain unexplored. Methods: We established a knock-in mouse model bearing the most frequent Asxl1 mutation and studied its pathophysiological effects on mouse hematopoietic system. Results: Heterozygotes (Asxl1 tm/+ ) marrow cells had higher in vitro proliferation capacities as shown by more colonies in cobblestone-area forming assays and by serial re-plating assays. On the other hand, donor hematopoietic cells from Asxl1 tm/+ mice declined faster in recipients during transplantation assays, suggesting compromised long-term in vivo repopulation abilities. There were no obvious blood diseases in mutant mice throughout their life-span, indicating Asxl1 mutation alone was not sufficient for leukemogenesis. However, this mutation facilitated engraftment of bone marrow cell overexpressing MN1. Analyses of global gene expression profiles of ASXL1-mutated versus wild-type human leukemia cells as well as heterozygote versus wild-type mouse marrow precursor cells, with or without MN1 overexpression, highlighted the association of in vivo Asxl1 mutation to the expression of hypoxia, multipotent progenitors, hematopoietic stem cells, KRAS, and MEK gene sets. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed global patterns of Asxl1 mutation-modulated H3K27 tri-methylation in hematopoietic precursors. Conclusions: We proposed the first Asxl1 mutation knock-in mouse model and showed mutated Asxl1 lowered the threshold of MN1-driven engraftment and exhibited distinct biological functions on physiological and malignant hematopoiesis, although it was insufficient to lead to blood malignancies. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Asxl1; Engraftment; Hematopoietic stem cell; MN1,"animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; Asxl1 gene; bone marrow cell; cell proliferation; controlled study; gene expression; gene mutation; hematopoietic cell; heterozygote; in vitro study; leukemia cell; leukemogenesis; lifespan; male; mouse; nonhuman; tumor gene; animal; C57BL mouse; disease model; gene expression regulation; gene targeting; genetics; hematopoiesis; hematopoietic stem cell; human; leukemia; metabolism; mutation; myelodysplastic syndrome; pathology; tumor cell line; Asxl1 protein, mouse; Mn1 protein, mouse; oncoprotein; repressor protein; Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knock-In Techniques; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Leukemia; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mutation; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Oncogene Proteins; Repressor Proteins",2-s2.0-85023199591

To investigate whether serum lactate level and prescription pattern of RRT are associated with mortality in patients with MALA requiring RRT. Methods: We searched PubMed/Medline and EMBASE from inception to Sep 2014 and applied predetermined exclusion criteria. Case-level data including case's demographics and clinical information related to MALA were abstracted. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used to examine the predictors of mortality. Results: A total of 253 unique cases were identified with cumulative mortality of 17.2%. Eighty-seven percent of patients had acute kidney injury. Serum lactate level was significantly higher in non-survivors (median 22.5 mmol/L) than in survivors (17.0 mmol/L, p-value <0.01) and so did the median blood metformin concentrations (58.5 vs. 43.9 mg/L, p-value = 0.05). The survival advantage was not significantly different between the modalities of RRT. The adjusted odds ratio of mortality for every one mmol/L increase in serum lactate level was 1.09 (95% CI 1.02-1.17, p-value = 0.01). The dose-response curve indicated a lactate threshold greater than 20 mmol/L was significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions: Our study suggests that predialysis level of serum lactate level is an important marker of mortality in MALA patients requiring RRT with a linear dose-response relationship. To better evaluate the optimal prescription of RRT in MALA, we recommend fostering an international consortium to support prospective research and large-scale standardized case collection. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Acute kidney injury; Lactate; Metabolic acidosis; Metformin; Renal replacement therapy,"lactic acid; metformin; antidiabetic agent; biological marker; lactic acid; metformin; acute kidney failure; Article; demography; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drug blood level; drug effect; drug safety; human; hypothermia; lactate blood level; lactic acidosis; metformin associated lactic acidosis; mortality; prediction; prognosis; renal replacement therapy; survival rate; systematic review; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; blood; case report; chemically induced; female; lactic acidosis; male; middle aged; mortality; renal replacement therapy; trends; Acidosis, Lactic; Acute Kidney Injury; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Lactic Acid; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Mortality; Renal Replacement Therapy",2-s2.0-85022210279

Methods: In total, 111 schoolchildren (aged 8–18 years) were included in the analysis from March 2015 to August 2016. Anthropometric evaluation, liver ultrasound examination and scoring for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD score = 0–6), and biochemical and plasma fatty acids analysis were performed. We compared the composition ratio of fatty acids between children with high-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 4–6), low-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 1–3), and healthy controls (NAFLD score = 0). In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated. Results: Compared with healthy controls, children with liver steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6), adrenic acid (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3) (P&lt; 0.05).

Conclusion: Our current data suggested that children with liver steatosis was highly associated with obesity, and insulin resistance. In addition, increased endogenous lipogenesis through altered desaturase activity may contribute to the progression of liver steatosis in children. ? 2017 Hua et al.

Younger patients had a lower response rate than older patients (p=0.038) and had the shortest progression-free survival compared with other predefined age categories (p=0.033). Multivariate analysis of overall survival revealed age ?50 years as a poor prognostic factor. In conclusion, fewer Asian patients aged ?50 years had EGFR mutations, but the EGFR mutation types were more uncommon. Age ?50 years is associated with poorer efficacy of EGFR-TKI treatment. ?

This study aimed to investigate differences in clinical outcomes between nonvalvular AF and AFL. Methods and Results-AF and AFL patients without any prescribed anticoagulation were enrolled from a 13-year national cohort database. Under series exclusion criteria, ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality were compared between the groups in real-world conditions and after propensity score matching. We identified 175 420 patients in the AF cohort and 6239 patients in the AFL cohort, and the prevalence of most comorbidities and frequency of medications were significantly higher in the AF group than the AFL group. In the real-world setting the AF patients had higher incidence rates of ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality than the AFL patients (all P < 0.001). After propensity score matching, the incidence rate of ischemic stroke in the AF cohort was 1.63-fold higher than in the AFL cohort (P < 0.001), the incidence rate of heart failure hospitalization in the AF cohort was 1.70-fold higher than in the AFL cohort (P < 0.001), and the incidence rate of allcause mortality in the AF cohort was 1.08-fold higher than in the AFL cohort (P=0.002). Conclusions-There were differences between AF and AFL in comorbidities and prognosis with regard to ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. ? 2017 The Authors.",Atrial fibrillation; Atrial flutter; Heart failure; Ischemic; Mortality; Stroke,"2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; amiodarone; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; biguanide derivative; calcium channel blocking agent; digoxin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; diuretic agent; dronedarone; flecainide; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; propafenone; sotalol; spironolactone; sulfonylurea; age distribution; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; brain ischemia; cardiovascular mortality; case control study; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; disease course; female; heart atrium flutter; heart failure; hospitalization; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; propensity score; sex difference; atrial fibrillation; brain ischemia; cause of death; cerebrovascular accident; chi square distribution; comparative study; epidemiology; factual database; heart atrium flutter; heart failure; middle aged; mortality; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; time factor; Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Atrial Flutter; Brain Ischemia; Cause of Death; Chi-Square Distribution; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Female; Heart Failure; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prognosis; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke; Taiwan; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85025462976

Over the past few decades, there have been systematic efforts to collect postmortem brain tissues via autopsies, leading to the establishment of dozens of human brain banks around the world. From cryopreserved human brain tissues, it is possible to isolate detached-and-resealed synaptic terminals termed synaptosomes, which remain metabolically and enzymatically active. Synaptosomes have become important model systems for studying human synaptic functions, being much more accessible than ex vivo brain slices or primary neuronal cultures. Here we review recent advances in the establishment of human brain banks, the isolation of synaptosomes, their biological activities, and various analytical techniques for investigating their biochemical and ultrastructural properties. There are unique insights to be gained by directly examining human synaptosomes, which cannot be substituted by animal models. We will also discuss how human synaptosome research has contributed to better understanding of neurological disorders, especially Alzheimer’s disease. ? 2017, The Author(s).",Brain bank; Neurochemistry; Neurodegeneration; Neuron; Subcellular fractionation; Synapse,Alzheimer disease; autopsy; brain tissue; cell isolation; electron microscopy; flow cytometry; human; immunofluorescence microscopy; metabolomics; nerve ending; neurologic disease; neuropathology; nonhuman; phosphoproteomics; priority journal; proteomics; Review; synaptosome; transcriptomics,2-s2.0-85025160027

The development of assay technologies able to diagnose early-stage AD is important. Blood tests to detect biomarkers, such as amyloid and total Tau protein, are among the most promising diagnostic methods due to their low cost, low risk, and ease of operation. However, such biomarkers in blood occur at extremely low levels and are difficult to detect precisely. In the early 2000s, a highly sensitive assay technology, immunomagnetic reduction (IMR), was developed. IMR involves the use of antibody-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous solution. The concentrations of detected molecules are converted to reductions in the ac magnetic susceptibility of this reagent due to the association between the magnetic nanoparticles and molecules. To achieve ultra-high sensitivity, a high-Tc superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) ac magnetosusceptometer was designed and applied to detect the tiny reduction in the ac magnetic susceptibility of the reagent. Currently, a 36-channeled high-Tc SQUID-based ac magnetosusceptometer is available. Using the reagent and this analyzer, extremely low concentrations of amyloid and total Tau protein in human plasma could be detected. Further, the feasibility of identifying subjects in early-stage AD via assaying plasma amyloid and total Tau protein is demonstrated. The results show a diagnostic accuracy for prodromal AD higher than 80% and reveal the possibility of screening for early-stage AD using SQUID-based IMR. ? 2017, The Author(s).",Alzheimer’s disease; Immunomagnetic reduction; Magnetic nanoparticles; Plasma biomarkers; SQUID,amyloid; magnetic nanoparticle; tau protein; Alzheimer disease; Clinical Dementia Rating; cognition; daily life activity; dementia; diagnostic imaging equipment; human; immunological procedures; immunomagnetic reduction; Lawton instrumental activities of daily living scale; magnetism; magnetosusceptometer; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; primary school; priority journal; protein blood level; Review; superconducting quantum interference device; Wechsler memory scale,2-s2.0-85025116170

Histone methyltransferase G9a has recently been shown to be abundantly expressed in HNSCC, and is required to maintain the malignant phenotype. In this study, we found that high G9a expression is significantly associated with poor chemotherapeutic response and disease-free survival in HNSCC patients. Similarly, G9a expression and enzymatic activity were elevated in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cells. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of G9a sensitized the resistant cells to cisplatin, increasing cellular apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations indicated that G9a contributes to transcriptional activation of the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), which results in upregulation of cellular glutathione (GSH) and drug resistance. In addition, we observed a significant positive correlation between G9a and GCLC expression in tumors of HNSCC patients. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that G9a protects HNSCC cells against chemotherapy by increasing the synthesis of GSH, and imply G9a as a promising target for overcoming cisplatin resistance in HNSCC. ?2017 AACR.",,"2 cyclohexyl n (1 isopropyl 4 piperidinyl) 6 methoxy 7 [3 (1 pyrrolidinyl)propoxy] 4 quinazolinamine; activating transcription factor 4; aldehyde dehydrogenase; beta actin; bleomycin; buthionine sulfoximine; caspase 3; cisplatin; doxycycline; fluorouracil; glutamate cysteine ligase; glutathione; glutathione ethyl ester; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; histone H2AX; histone H3; histone methyltransferase; ligase; oxaliplatin; protein c jun; transcription factor Nrf2; cisplatin; EHMT2 protein, human; GCLC protein, human; glutamate cysteine ligase; glutathione; histocompatibility antigen; histone lysine methyltransferase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer resistance; controlled study; disease association; disease free survival; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; genetic analysis; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; transcription initiation; treatment response; upregulation; adult; aged; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; dose response; drug effects; drug resistance; drug screening; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; head and neck tumor; male; metabolism; middle aged; mouse; pathology; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell line; Adult; Aged; Animals; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; Disease-Free Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase; Glutathione; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Histocompatibility Antigens; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Male; Mice; Middle Aged; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85023748092

In classic infantile-onset Pompe disease, ERT should start as soon as possible. Once started, regular, routine follow-up is necessary to monitor for treatment effects, disease progression, and adverse effects. Decision-making for when or if to start ERT in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is more challenging because patients typically have no measurable signs or symptoms or predictable time of symptom onset at NBS. With LOPD, adequate, ongoing follow-up and assessments for onset or progression of signs and symptoms are important to track disease state and monitor and adjust care before and after treatment is started. Because numerous tests are used to monitor patients at variable frequencies, a standardized approach across centers is lacking. Significant variability in patient assessments may result in missed opportunities for early intervention. Management of Pompe disease requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach with timely disease-specific interventions that target the underlying disease process and symptom-specific manifestations. Regardless of how identified, all patients who have signs or symptoms of the disease require coordinated medical care and follow-up tailored to individual needs throughout their lives. The Pompe Disease Newborn Screening Working Group identifies key considerations before starting and during ERT; summarizes what comprises an indication to start ERT; and provides guidance on how to determine appropriate patient management and monitoring and guide the frequency and type of follow-up assessments for all patients identified through NBS. ? 2017 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.",,"alpha glucosidase; Article; asymptomatic disease; audiology; central venous catheter; clinical feature; cost; disease severity; enzyme therapy; follow up; gastroenterology; genetic counseling; glycogen storage disease type 2; health status; heart function; human; immunological tolerance; immunomodulation; motor development; neuromuscular function; newborn; newborn screening; onset age; patient care; practice guideline; priority journal; respiratory function; symptom; treatment planning; vascular access; disease exacerbation; enzyme replacement; glycogen storage disease type 2; newborn screening; procedures; Disease Progression; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Neonatal Screening",2-s2.0-85021822034

This study aimed to evaluate the risk of all-cause mortality (stratified according to onset status, disease severity, and concomitant psoriatic arthritis) and cause-specific mortality in patients with psoriasis. Our study cohort consisted of 80,167 patients with newly diagnosed psoriasis between 2001 and 2012 in the National Health Insurance Database. Vital status and cause of death were ascertained from the National Death Registry of Taiwan. All-cause and cause-specific crude mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios were estimated.

Biomarkers to predict the progression of VC early are in urgent demand. Approach and Results - We identified circulating, cell-free microRNAs as potential biomarkers using in vitro VC models in which both rat and human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells were treated with high levels of phosphate to mimic uremic hyperphosphatemia. Using an Affymetrix microRNA array, we found that miR-125b and miR-382 expression levels declined significantly as biomineralization progressed, but this decline was only observed for miR-125b in the culture medium. A time-dependent decrease in aortic tissue and serum miR-125b levels was also found in both ex vivo and in vivo renal failure models. We examined the levels of circulating, cell-free miR-125b in sera from patients with end-stage renal diseases (n=88) and found an inverse association between the severity of VC and the circulating miR-125b level, irrespective of age or mineral-related hormones (odds ratio, 0.71; P=0.03). Furthermore, serum miR-125b levels on enrollment can predict VC progression years later (for high versus low, odds ratio, 0.14; P<0.01; for the highest versus lowest tertile and middle versus lowest tertile, odds ratio, 0.55 and 0.13; P=0.3 and <0.01, respectively). The uremic VC prediction efficacy using circulating miR-125b levels was also observed in an independent cohort (n=135).

While elevated Cer levels cause neurodegenerative diseases, the neuronal activity of its direct precursor, dhCer, remains unclear. We show that knockout of the fly dhCer desaturase gene, infertile crescent (ifc), results in larval lethality with increased dhCer and decreased Cer levels. Light stimulation leads to ROS increase and apoptotic cell death in ifc-KO photoreceptors, resulting in activity-dependent neurodegeneration. Lipid-containing Atg8/LC3-positive puncta accumulate in ifc-KO photoreceptors, suggesting lipophagy activation. Further enhancing lipophagy reduces lipid droplet accumulation and rescues ifc-KO defects, indicating that lipophagy plays a protective role. Reducing dhCer synthesis prevents photoreceptor degeneration and rescues ifc-KO lethality, while supplementing downstream sphingolipids does not. These results pinpoint that dhCer accumulation is responsible for ifc-KO defects. Human dhCer desaturase rescues ifc-KO larval lethality, and rapamycin reverses defects caused by dhCer accumulation in human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting evolutionarily conserved functions.

Thrombin is a key player in tissue repair, inflammation, and fibrosis after injury. Methods: Effects of thrombin on activated-TGF-β1 levels, Smad3 phosphorylation, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) synthesis in primary human buccal mucosal fibroblasts (BMFs) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blot analysis. Results: Thrombin and protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) agonist induced TGF-β1 activation and Smad3 phosphorylation. Pretreatment with TGF-β-neutralizing antibody completely inhibited thrombin-induced CCN2 synthesis. Neutralizing antibodies to integrin αv, β1, αvβ3, αvβ5, and Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 completely blocked thrombin-induced TGF-β1 activation, Smad3 phosphorylation, and CCN2 synthesis. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) dose-dependently inhibited thrombin-induced TGF-β1 activation.

Methods A total of 206 patients with FIGO stage IB2–IVA cervical cancer and negative para-aortic lymph nodes (PALNs) who underwent pelvic IMRT (PRT) or SRVRT between 2004 and 2013 at our institution were reviewed. SRVRT cranially extended the PRT field for PALNs up to the left renal vein level. The prescribed dose was consistent 50.4?Gy in 28 fractions. Results Overall, 110 and 96 patients underwent PRT and SRVRT, respectively. The SRVRT group had more advanced disease based on FIGO stage and positive pelvic lymph nodes (PLNs). The median follow-up time was 60?months (range, 7–143). For the total study population, the 5-year PALN recurrence-free survival (PARFS) and overall survival (OS) for PRT vs. SRVRT were 87.6% vs. 97.9% (p?=?0.03) and 74.5% vs. 87.8% (p?=?0.04), respectively. In patients with FIGO III–IVA or positive PLNs, the 5-year PARFS and OS for PRT vs. SRVRT were 80.1% vs. 96.4% (p?=?0.02) and 58.1% vs. 83.5% (p?=?0.012), respectively. However, there were no significant differences in these outcomes for patients with FIGO IB–IIB and negative PLNs. In a multivariate analysis, only SRVRT was associated with better PARFS (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.78; p?=?0.02). The SRVRT did not significantly increase severe late toxicities. Conclusion Prophylactic SRVRT using IMRT reduced PALN recurrence with tolerable toxicities, supporting the application of risk-based radiation fields for cervical cancer. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Cervical cancer; Intensity-modulated radiation therapy; Para-aortic irradiation,"cisplatin; antineoplastic agent; acute toxicity; adult; advanced cancer; aged; anemia; Article; brachytherapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer prevention; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer survival; external beam radiotherapy; female; follow up; gastrointestinal toxicity; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; kidney vein; leukopenia; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; overall survival; paraaortic lymph node; pelvis lymph node; priority journal; radiation dose; recurrence free survival; recurrence risk; retrospective study; subrenal vein radiotherapy; thrombocytopenia; urogenital tract disease; uterine cervix cancer; chemoradiotherapy; intensity modulated radiation therapy; middle aged; pathology; prevention and control; radiotherapy planning system; tumor recurrence; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Chemoradiotherapy; Cisplatin; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Retrospective Studies; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85018161258

The objective of the present study was to identify such risk factors by applying a cohort design study with a long-term follow-up period. Methods: For this cohort study, we selected cancer patients who had newly implanted TIVADs between July 2008 and December 2008. The follow-up period lasted until September 2012. Univariate analysis was performed for age, gender, cancer type, TIVAD brand, puncture site, sidedness of puncture, and catheter tip position. The hazard ratio (HR) of potential risk factors was calculated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and Kaplan–Meier curves were applied for catheter survival analysis. Results: Our study consisted of 240 people, with 5 people lost to follow-up. The cumulative premature catheter removal rate of all TIVADs was 9.8%, with the most common reason for premature removal being port-associated blood stream infection (PABSI), which proved to be highest in patients with hematology cancer (27.8%) and upper gastrointestinal cancer (19.4%). Suboptimal tip position (HR 5.13, 95% confidence interval 1.73–15.21) was also a risk factor for premature removal, and it was correlated with symptomatic TIVAD occlusion (p?=?0.0004). Conclusions: PABSI was the most common reason for premature catheter removal, with a varied incidence rate between different cancer types. Suboptimal tip position was also a risk factor. Confirming the final tip position after implantation is crucial. Infection control is important for TIVAD care, especially in high-risk cancer patients. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Catheter survival; Port-associated blood stream infection; Totally implantable venous access device,"adult; Article; cancer patient; catheter infection; catheter occlusion; catheter removal; cohort analysis; digestive system cancer; female; follow up; hazard ratio; hematologic malignancy; high risk patient; human; implantable port system; incidence; infection control; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; risk factor; survival analysis; vascular access device; central venous catheterization; indwelling catheter; long term care; middle aged; prostheses and orthoses; utilization; Catheterization, Central Venous; Catheters, Indwelling; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Middle Aged; Prostheses and Implants",2-s2.0-85011843551

The close-eye thermographic images of the eyelid were obtained noninvasively by infrared thermography. Temperatures at 8 regions of interest (ROIs) of the eyelid margin and a reference temperature at the center of the upper eyelid were measured. The temperature ratio was defined as the temperature of ROI divided by the reference temperature. Results Eyelid margin temperature measured by infrared thermography increased from temporal side (ROI 1) to the nasal side (ROI 8) of the eye in both MGD patients and control groups. The temperature ratios were significantly higher in MGD participants than in controls, especially at ROI 8. Conclusion The eyelid margin temperature measured by infrared thermography was higher in MGD participants.

However, the independent health effects of night work and rotating shift on workers' sleep and mental health risks and the potential gender differences have not been fully evaluated. Methods We used data from a nationwide survey of representative employees of Taiwan in 2013, consisting of 16 440 employees. Participants reported their work shift patterns 1 week prior to the survey, which were classified into the four following shift types: fixed day, rotating day, fixed night and rotating night shifts. Also obtained were self-reported sleep duration, presence of insomnia, burnout and mental disorder assessed by the Brief Symptom Rating Scale. Results Among all shift types, workers with fixed night shifts were found to have the shortest duration of sleep, highest level of burnout score, and highest prevalence of insomnia and minor mental disorders. Gender-stratified regression analyses with adjustment of age, education and psychosocial work conditions showed that both in male and female workers, fixed night shifts were associated with greater risks for short sleep duration (<7 hours per day) and insomnia. In female workers, fixed night shifts were also associated with increased risks for burnout and mental disorders, but after adjusting for insomnia, the associations between fixed night shifts and poor mental health were no longer significant. Conclusions The findings of this study suggested that a fixed night shift was associated with greater risks for sleep and mental health problems, and the associations might be mediated by sleep disturbance. ?

Zerovalent iron (Fe0) nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most prominent NPs applied in remediating contaminated soils and groundwater. However, there are concerns that Fe0NP application contributes to long-term environmental and human health impacts. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a surrogate in vivo model that has been successfully applied to assess the potential nanotoxicity of these nanomaterials. Here we present a TBTK/TD approach to appraise bioaccumulation and nanotoxicity of Fe0NPs in C. elegans. Built on a present C. elegans bioassay with estimated TBTK/TD parameters, we found that average bioconcentration factors in C. elegans exposed to waterborne and food-borne Fe0NPs were ~50 and ~5×10-3, respectively, whereas 10% inhibition concentrations for fertility, locomotion, and development, were 1.26 (95% CI 0.19–5.2), 3.84 (0.38–42), and 6.78 (2.58–21) μg?g-1, respectively, implicating that fertility is the most sensitive endpoint in C. elegans. Our results also showed that biomagnification effects were not observed in waterborne or food-borne Fe0NP-exposed worms. We suggest that the TBTK/TD assessment for predicting NP-induced toxicity at different concentrations and conditions in C. elegans could enable rapid selection of nanomaterials that are more likely to be nontoxic in larger animals. We conclude that the use of the TBTK/TD scheme manipulating C. elegans could be used for rapid evaluation of in vivo toxicity of NPs or for drug screening in the field of nanomedicine. ? 2017 Yang et al.",Bioaccumulation; Caenorhabditis elegans; Nanotoxicology; Toxicity-based-toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic modeling; Zerovalent iron nanoparticles,"iron nanoparticle; iron; nanoparticle; Article; bioaccumulation; bioassay; Caenorhabditis elegans; development; dose response; Escherichia coli; fertility; inhibitory concentration; locomotion; nanotoxicity; nonhuman; probability; Raoultella planticola; risk assessment; toxicity; toxicodynamic; toxicokinetics; worm; animal; Caenorhabditis elegans; chemistry; drug effects; toxicokinetics; Animals; Caenorhabditis elegans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Escherichia coli; Fertility; Iron; Nanoparticles; Toxicokinetics",2-s2.0-85021661396

This study aimed to explore treatment delay, outcomes and their predictors in this group. Methods: Adult (?20 years) patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 2004 to 2009. Treatment completion and mortality rates were noted at one year after treatment. Results: Among the 81,081 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis identified, 13,923 (17.2%) were aged ?80 years, and 26,897 (33.2%) were aged 65-79 years. The treatment completion, mortality rates and treatment delay were 54.8%, 34.7% and 61 (12-128) [median, (1st-3rd quartiles)] days in patients aged ?80 years, 68.3%, 18.5% and 53 (8-122) days in patients aged 65-79 years, and 78.9%, 6.5% and 21 (1-84) days in patients aged <65 years, respectively. The elder patients were more likely to receive second-line anti-tuberculosis agents. The treatment completion rate decreased with older age, female sex, comorbidities, low income, requiring second-line anti-tuberculosis agents, severity of pulmonary tuberculosis and longer treatment delay. Older age, female sex, comorbidities, low income, and not undergoing rapid molecular diagnostic tests were independently associated with longer treatment delays. Conclusions: Pulmonary tuberculosis in advanced age has a longer treatment delay and a higher mortality rate. Applying rapid molecular diagnostic tools may reduce treatment delay and should be integrated into the diagnostic algorithm for pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in elderly patients. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Clinical epidemiology; Clinical respiratory medicine; Infection and inflammation; Tuberculosis,"carbapenem; cephalosporin; macrolide; penicillin derivative; quinolone; tuberculostatic agent; adult; aged; aging; Article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; confounding variable; controlled study; disease severity; fatality; female; groups by age; human; independent variable; lowest income group; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; predictor variable; retrospective study; sex difference; Taiwan; therapy delay; very elderly; young adult; age; epidemiology; middle aged; mortality; treatment outcome; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antitubercular Agents; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary",2-s2.0-85021209552

In addition to 'decoy' function, recombinant DcR3.Fc is able to modulate the activation and differentiation of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages via 'non-decoy' action. DcR3-treated DCs skew T cell differentiation into Th2 phenotype, while DcR3-treated macrophages behave M2 phenotype. DcR3 is upregulated in various cancer cells and several inflammatory tissues, and is regarded as a potential biomarker to predict inflammatory disease progression and cancer metastasis. However, whether DcR3 is a pathogenic factor or a suppressor to attenuate inflammatory reactions, has not been discussed comprehensively yet. Because mouse genome does not have DcR3, it is not feasible to investigate its physiological functions by gene-knockout approach. However, DcR3-mediated effects in vitro are determined via overexpressing DcR3 or addition of recombinant DcR3.Fc fusion protein. Moreover, CD68-driven DcR3 transgenic mice are used to investigate DcR3-mediated systemic effects in vivo. Upregulation of DcR3 during inflammatory reactions exerts negative-feedback to suppress inflammation, while tumor cells hijack DcR3 to prevent apoptosis and promote tumor growth and invasion. Thus, 'switch-on' of DcR3 expression may be feasible for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and enhance tissue repairing, while 'switch-off' of DcR3 expression can enhance tumor apoptosis and suppress tumor growth in vivo. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Biomarker; Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3); M2 macrophages; TNFR6B,"biological marker; death receptor 3; decoy receptor 3; recombinant decoy receptor 3 Fc fusion protein; recombinant protein; tumor marker; unclassified drug; decoy receptor 3; immunologic factor; TNFRSF6B protein, human; apoptosis; B lymphocyte; bone marrow cell; cancer growth; cancer immunotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell differentiation; dendritic cell; disease course; disease severity; drug effect; gene expression; gene overexpression; gene silencing; gene therapy; homeostasis; human; immunomodulation; in vitro gene transfer; in vivo gene transfer; inflammation; inflammatory disease; macrophage; malignant neoplasm; metastasis; mutation; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; protein function; receptor upregulation; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; synoviocyte; tissue repair; tumor cell; upregulation; animal; apoptosis; gene expression regulation; genetics; inflammation; metabolism; mouse; neoplasm; transgenic animal; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Apoptosis; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Inflammation; Mice; Neoplasms; Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 6b",2-s2.0-85020857347

Quantitative proteomics provides the relative different protein abundance in normal and cancer patients which offers the information for molecular interactions, signaling pathways, and biomarker identification. Here we introduce both theoretical and practical applications in the use of quantitative proteomics approaches, with principles of current technologies and methodologies including gel-based, label free, stable isotope labeling as well as targeted proteomics. Predictive markers of drug resistance, candidate biomarkers for diagnosis, and prognostic markers in lung cancer have also been discovered and analyzed by quantitative proteomic analysis.

However, only a few relevant cases have been reported, and evidence sufficient to support this hypothesis is lacking. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on DNI. Methods: We used the database of the Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patients (RFCIP), a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan, to conduct a retrospective follow-up study. Between 1997 and 2013, a total of 157,340 patients in Taiwan with ESRD who received dialysis were registered in the RFCIP, whom were matched with a database consisting of 1,000,000 randomly selected patients who represented the national population, to conduct the follow-up study for investigating the incidence of DNI in the ESRD and control cohorts. Results: In the ESRD group, 280 DNIs were identified with an incidence rate of 43 per 100,000 person-years. In the comparison group, 194 DNIs were identified with an incidence rate of 20 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence rate ratio was 2.16 (p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the ESRD group had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of DNI (p < 0.001). According to Cox regression analysis, the hazard ratio of ESRD for DNI was 2.23 (p < 0.001). The therapeutic methods (non-surgery and surgery), performance of tracheostomy, duration of hospitalization did not differ significantly between the two groups, except more ESRD-DNI patients were admitted to intensive care units. The mortality rate of patients with DNI in the ESRD group was significantly higher than that in the control group (8.6% for ESRD vs 3.6% for control, p = 0.032). Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a poorer survival outcome in the ESRD group (p = 0.029). However, the individual survival outcomes following non-surgical and surgical therapies in the ESRD group did not differ significantly (p = 0.31). Conclusions: ESRD is a predisposing factor for DNI, increasing its risk by twofold. In the patients with ESRD, DNI was not associated with higher rates of surgical debridement, tracheostomy, and mediastinal complications or longer hospital stays; however, it was associated with poorer survival outcomes, regardless of the therapeutic method. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Abscess; Cellulitis; Cervical; Dialysis; ESRD; Failure; Kidney; Nephropathy; NHIRD; Predisposing,"antibiotic agent; abscess; adult; aged; Article; aspiration; autoimmune disease; cellulitis; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; controlled study; coronary artery disease; debridement; deep neck infection; demography; dialysis; end stage renal disease; female; head and neck infection; human; hypertension; incidence; income; length of stay; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; mediastinitis; population research; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; survival rate; Taiwan; tracheostomy; uremia; complication; follow up; hospitalization; infection; Kaplan Meier method; Kidney Failure, Chronic; middle aged; mortality; neck; proportional hazards model; Aged; Comorbidity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hospitalization; Humans; Infection; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Neck; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85020704985

Among these three toxin subunits, CdtB is the toxic moiety of CDT with DNase I activity, resulting in DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and, consequently, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M stage and apoptosis. Radiation therapy is an effective modality for the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PCa). However, patients often develop radioresistance. Owing to its particular biochemical properties, we previously employed CdtB as a therapeutic agent for sensitizing radioresistant PCa cells to ionizing radiation (IR). In this study, we further demonstrated that CDT suppresses the IR-induced autophagy pathway in PCa cells by attenuating c-Myc expression and therefore sensitizes PCa cells to radiation. We further showed that CDT prevents the formation of autophagosomes via decreased high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression and the inhibition of acidic vesicular organelle (AVO) formation, which are associated with enhanced radiosensitivity in PCa cells. The results of this study reveal the detailed mechanism of CDT for the treatment of radioresistant PCa. ? 2017 Lin, Liu, Lin, Kao, Chen, Chiang-Ni, Jiang, Huang, Lin, Lo, Lin, Lai, Lin, Hsieh, Chiu and Lai.",Autophagy; Campylobacter jejuni; Cell cycle; Cytolethal distending toxin; Radioresistance,"bacterial toxin; cytolethal distending toxin; high mobility group B1 protein; animal; apoptosis; autophagosome; autophagy; Campylobacter jejuni; cell cycle; cell cycle checkpoint; cell line; combination drug therapy; drug effects; human; male; metabolism; mouse; prostate; prostate tumor; radiation response; radiation tolerance; Animals; Apoptosis; Autophagosomes; Autophagy; Bacterial Toxins; Campylobacter jejuni; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line; Drug Therapy, Combination; HMGB1 Protein; Humans; Male; Mice; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiation Tolerance",2-s2.0-85027510133

The ubiquitin/proteasomal pathway is known to contribute to the regulation of CAV1 expression, but the ubiquitin ligase responsible for CAV1 protein stability remains unidentified. Here we reveal that E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF1 modulates CAV1 protein stability to regulate Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-triggered immune responses. We demonstrate that ZNRF1 physically interacts with CAV1 in response to lipopolysaccharide and mediates ubiquitination and degradation of CAV1. The ZNRF1-CAV1 axis regulates Akt-GSK3β activity upon TLR4 activation, resulting in enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Mice with deletion of ZNRF1 in their hematopoietic cells display increased resistance to endotoxic and polymicrobial septic shock due to attenuated inflammation. Our study defines ZNRF1 as a regulator of TLR4-induced inflammatory responses and reveals another mechanism for the regulation of TLR4 signalling through CAV1. ?

We previously reported the noninferiority 1 month after the last dose of 2-dose human papillomavirus 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted (AS04-HPV-16/18) vaccine schedules at months 0 and 6 (2D-M0, 6) and months 0 and 12 (2D-M0, 12) in girls aged 9-14 years compared with a 3-dose schedule at months 0, 1, and 6 (3D-M0, 1, 6) in women aged 15-25 years. Here, we report the results at study end (month 36 [M36]). Methods. Girls were randomized 1: 1 and received 2 vaccine doses either 6 months (2D-M0, 6) or 12 months apart (2D-M0, 12); women received 3 doses at months 0, 1, and 6 (3D-M0, 1, 6). Endpoints included noninferiority of HPV-16/18 antibodies for 2D- M0, 6 versus 3D-M0, 1, 6; 2D-M0, 12 versus 3D-M0, 1, 6; and 2D-M0, 12 versus 2D-M0, 6; and assessment of neutralizing antibodies, T cells, B cells, and safety. Results. At M36, the 2D-M0, 6 and 2D-M0, 12 schedules remained noninferior to the 3D-M0, 1, 6 schedule in terms of seroconversion rates and 3D/2D geometric mean titers for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18. All schedules elicited sustained immune responses up to M36. Conclusions. Both 2-dose schedules in young girls remained noninferior to the 3-dose schedule in women up to study conclusion at M36.

Monascin and ankaflavin are azaphilone compounds with similar structures that exhibit multiple beneficial effects including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-diabetes, immunomodulation, attenuation of Alzheimer's disease risk factor, and anti-tumorigenic effects. Monascin and ankaflavin not only possess pleiotropic bioactivities, but are also more potent than monacolin K in lowering lipid levels and have lower toxicity.

We aimed to assess the trends and treatment outcomes of late cART initiation in Taiwan. Methods Between June 2012 and May 2016, we retrospectively included antiretroviral-naive HIV-positive adults who initiated cART. Late initiation was defined as when cART was initiated in patients with a CD4 count ?200 cells/mm3 or having experienced AIDS-defining illnesses. The treatment outcomes were assessed up to 6 months after starting cART.Results We included 3655 HIV-positive patients, and the majority of the patients were male (95.4%) with a median age of 31 years and initiated non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-containing regimens (87.0%). The median CD4 count at cART initiation increased from 207 cells/mm3 in 2012 to 298 cells/mm3 in 2016, and the overall proportion of late cART initiation decreased from 49.1% in 2012 to 29.0% in 2016 (P for trend ?0.001). Late cART initiation mainly resulted from late presentation for HIV care and was associated with older age (per 1-year increase, adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04–1.06), HBsAg seropositivity (AOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04–1.64), HIV care in central and southern Taiwan, initiating cART in earlier year, non-intravenous drug users (AOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.33–2.86), and negative hepatitis C serostatus (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04–2.08). Compared with non-late initiators, late initiators had a higher rate of all-cause mortality (1.7% vs. 0.3%) and regimen modification due to virological failure (7.1% vs. 2.6%). The predicting factors of all-cause mortality were late cART initiation (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 5.40; 95% CI, 2.14–13.65) and older age (AHR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03–1.10). Conclusions While the proportion of late cART initiation decreased over time in Taiwan, late initiation remained in a substantial proportion of HIV-positive patients. The late initiators had higher risk for poor outcomes. The need for strategies to earlier detection of HIV infection and expediting cART initiation should be highlighted, especially among the older population. ? 2017 Lin et al.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted with diabetic nephropathy patients who initiated ACEI or ARB monotherapy. The primary outcome was a composite of end stage of renal disease and renal transplantation, and the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. The safety endpoint was hyperkalemia. Results: Three thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine ACEI users and 3,316 ARB users were identified. ARBs seemed to be inferior to ACEIs given their poorer renal outcome (HR 1.31; 95% CI, 1.15-1.50) and higher risk of hyperkalemia (HR 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.32). Among the four ACEIs compared, captopril was an inferior treatment choice given its poorer renal outcomes (HR 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05-1.93) and higher mortality rate (HR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55). Irbesartan appeared to be a poorer treatment choice among the three ARBs compared, given its inferior renal protective effect (HR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.78). Conclusions: Our findings suggest ACEIs as a relatively more renoprotective and safer treatment as compared to ARBs. Captopril and irbesartan may be inferior to the other ACEIs and ARBs respectively. ? 2017 The Author(s). Published by S.

It is believed that parent-adolescent agreement would be higher in societies with a strong culture of familism. We examined whether parent-adolescent discrepancies in the rating of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems are related to parental and family factors in Taiwan. Participants included 1,421 child-parent pairs of 7th-grade students from 12 middle schools in Northern Taiwan and their parents. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients to assess the relationship between parental (Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL) and adolescent (Youth Self Report, YSR) report of emotional/behavioral problem syndromes. Regression models were used to assess parent-adolescent differences in relation to parental psychopathology and family factors. We found that parent-adolescent agreement was moderate (r = 0.37). Adolescents reported higher symptom scores than their parents (Mean Total Problem Score: CBCL: 20.79, YSR: 33.14). Parental psychopathology was related to higher parental ratings and better informant agreement. Parents with higher socioeconomic status (SES) tended to report lower scores for adolescent problem syndromes, resulting in higher levels of disagreement. Greater maternal care was related to higher parent-adolescent agreement. Based on our study findings, we conclude that familism values do not seem to improve parent-child agreement in the assessment of adolescent problem syndromes. The finding that higher SES was related to increased discrepancies speaks to the need to explore the culture-specific mechanisms giving rise to informant discrepancies. ? 2017 Chen et al.

Design: A population-based retrospective cohort study based on data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2010. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from the NHIRD. A total of 245 (20.1%) patients with a history of stroke at the time of glaucoma diagnosis were excluded, and 1,218 patients with NTG who were 20 years of age and older were identified. Patients’ age, gender and preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and disorders of lipid metabolism, were recorded. The propensity score method with a 1: 5 matching ratio was used to minimize selection bias. Cox regression with robust variance estimation was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of developing stroke between the NTG and control groups. Results: After adjusting for patient age, gender, and pre-existing comorbidities, the HR was 6.34, indicating that the incidence of stroke was significantly higher in patients with NTG than in controls. Furthermore, a higher risk of stroke was also found in most subgroups with the above-mentioned comorbidities. Conclusion: NTG is a significant risk factor for subsequent stroke in most of the described comorbidity subgroups. Early interventions for stroke prevention should be provided to newly diagnosed patients with NTG. ? 2017 Lee et al.

We aimed to assess the association between dietary patterns (DPs) and cognitive decline in Chinese elderly. Setting: Participants were recruited from the elderly health checkup program of a teaching hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. Participants: A total of 475 elders (age ?65) were included in this prospective cohort study. Measurements: The outcome comprised the decline of global and domain-specific cognition between baseline (2011-2013) and follow-up (2013-2015). Dietary data from the previous year were collected via a food frequency questionnaire at baseline, and a factor analysis was performed to identify DPs. Multivariable linear regression and logistic regression models were used to assess associations between Chinese DPs and cognitive decline over 2 years adjusting for selected covariates. Results: Three DPs (vegetable, meat, and traditional) were identified. Moderate- or high-score “vegetable” DP significantly protected against decline of logical memory (recall I: β = 0.16–0.18, odds ratio (OR) = 0.42–0.48; recall II: β = 0.17–0.21); while high-score DP increased executive function decline (β = ?0.22). A high-score “meat” DP was related to decline of verbal fluency-total score (β = ?0.19); while moderate- or high-score “meat” DP protected against attention decline (β = 0.20–0.22). High-score “traditional” DP protected against decline of logical memory-recall I (β = 0.18). No significant association was observed for global cognition. Conclusion: These findings suggest that three DPs identified in Chinese elderly were associated with different cognitive domains. Further research is needed to explore the efficacy of dietary interventions in reducing cognitive decline in older adults. ? 2017, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation ? 2017, The American Geriatrics Society",cognitive decline; dietary pattern; elderly,aged; Article; body mass; caloric intake; Chinese; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; deterioration; diet; executive function; feeding behavior; female; fermented product; food frequency questionnaire; geriatric disorder; human; major clinical study; male; meat; memory; physical activity; poultry; prospective study; Taiwan; teaching hospital; vegetable; Asian continental ancestry group; cognition; diet; neuropsychological test; physiology; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85020847467

Phenotypic alteration in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been linked to the TKI resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. However, the mechanism underlying this resistance remains unclear. Here we report that high expression of a neuroendocrine factor termed VGF induces the transcription factor TWIST1 to facilitate TKI resistance, EMT, and cancer dissemination in a subset of lung adenocarcinoma cells. VGF silencing resensitized EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cells to TKI. Conversely, overexpression of VGF in sensitive cells conferred resistance to TKIs and induced EMT, increasing migratory and invasive behaviors. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association of VGF expression with advanced tumor grade and poor survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. In a mouse xenograft model of lung adenocarcinoma, suppressing VGF expression was sufficient to attenuate tumor growth. Overall, our findings show how VGF can confer TKI resistance and trigger EMT, suggesting its potential utility as a biomarker and therapeutic target in lung adenocarcinoma. ?2017 AACR.",,"afatinib; doxycycline; erlotinib; gefitinib; nerve growth factor; osimertinib; rociletinib; transcription factor Twist; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor; adenocarcinoma cell line; advanced cancer; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer grading; cancer survival; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer cell line; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; protein function; tumor growth; VGF gene; adenocarcinoma; animal; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; nude mouse; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Nude; Mutation; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85020838533

However, few studies have reported the long-term outcomes following VFSI. OBJECTIVE To investigate the incidence rates of symptom recurrence and secondary interventions following VFSI for benign vocal fold lesions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort studywas conducted at a tertiary referral medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The cohort included 189 patients with vocal fold lesions who had received VFSI as the primary treatment between August 2011 and September 2013. EXPOSURES All participants underwent VFSI. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Long-term surveillancewas conducted through structured telephonic interviews and by reviewing medical charts every 6 months over a 2-year period. We assessed the 10-item voice handicap index, dysphonic symptoms, and whether the patients had received any additional interventions after the initial VFSI. RESULTS The 189 participants (32 men and 157 women; mean [SD] age, 39 [10] years [range, 20-74 years] included patients who had undergone VFSI for vocal fold nodules (n = 72), polyps (n = 72), or mucus-retention cysts (n = 45). Following VFSI, 141 patients (74.6%; 23 men and 118 women; mean age, 39 years [range, 20-70 years]) showed positive response (ie, clinically significant symptom resolution without the need for additional procedures) and received long-term surveillance. The median follow-up period was 19.4 months, and 2 patients were lost to follow-up postoperatively within 1 year. The cumulative failure rates (subjective symptom recurrence plus secondary treatments) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after VFSI were 12%, 17%, 24%, and 32%, respectively. When the initial response rate to VFSI (141 of 189, 74.6%) was considered altogether, VFSI remained effective after 2 years in 50% of the initially recruited 189 patients. The highest rate of long-term effectiveness of VFSI occurred in vocal polyps (54%), followed by nodules (49%) and cysts (43%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study demonstrates that VFSI can be beneficial in managing benign vocal lesions, especially when first-line treatments are unsuitable. However, the long-term results of this study clarify that a substantial number of patients experience symptom recurrence or receive subsequent interventions within 2 years after VFSI; this should be considered in medical decision making. ? 2017 American Medical Association.

The aim for this study was evaluation of the clinical value of TG13 severity grading for AC. Method: The study was designed as an international multicenter retrospective study of AC from 2011 to 2013. Based on the data, we investigated the TG13 severity grading by analyzing the correlations between grade and prognosis, surgical procedures, histopathology, and organ dysfunction and prognosis. Results: An investigation revealed that 30-day overall mortality rate was 1.1% for Grade I, 0.8% for Grade II, 5.4% for Grade III. The mortality rate for Grade III was significantly higher than lower grades (P?<?0.001). The greater the number of organ dysfunction, the higher the mortality rate (P?<?0.001). However, the mortality rate varied depending on the number of organ dysfunction (3.1–25%). With respect to the surgical procedures, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed for Grade I patients (P?<?0.001), and the higher the grade, the more likely open surgery would be selected (P?<?0.001). Conclusion: TG13 severity grading criteria for AC are providing great benefits in actual clinical settings.

We developed a machine learning approach using support vector machines (SVM) for automatic VP placement. Methods: A total of 392 consecutive patients undergoing 99mTc-tetrofosmin stress (5 min; mean 6 SD, 350 6 54 MBq) and rest (5 min; 1,024 6 153 MBq) fast SPECT MPI attenuation corrected (AC) by CT and same-day coronary CT angiography were studied; included in the 392 patients were 48 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography and had no known coronary artery disease. The left ventricle was segmented with standard clinical software (quantitative perfusion SPECT) by 2 experts, adjusting the VP if needed. Two-class SVM models were computed from the expert placements with 10-fold cross validation to separate the patients used for training and those used for validation. SVM probability estimates were used to compute the best VP position. Automatic VP localizations on AC and non-AC images were compared with expert placement on coronary CT angiography. Stress and rest total perfusion deficits and detection of per-vessel obstructive stenosis by invasive coronary angiography were also compared. Results: Bland-Altman 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for VP localization by SVM and experts for AC stress images (bias, 1; 95% CI, 25 to 7 mm) and AC rest images (bias, 1; 95% CI, 27 to 10 mm) were narrower than interexpert 95%CIs for AC stress images (bias, 0; 95% CI, 28 to 8 mm) and AC rest images (bias, 0; 95% CI, 210 to 10 mm) (P , 0.01). Bland-Altman 95% CIs for VP localization by SVM and experts for non-AC stress images (bias, 1; 95% CI, 24 to 6 mm) and non-AC rest images (bias, 2; 95% CI, 27 to 10 mm) were similar to interexpert 95% CIs for non-AC stress images (bias, 0; 95% CI, 26 to 5 mm) and non-AC rest images (bias, 21; 95% CI, 29 to 7 mm) (P was not significant [NS]). For regional detection of obstructive stenosis, ischemic total perfusion deficit areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 2 experts (AUC, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.7-0.87]; AUC, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.73-0.89]) and the SVM (0.82 [0.74-0.9]) for AC data were the same (P 5 NS) and were higher than those for the unadjusted VP (0.63 [0.53-0.73]) (P , 0.01). Similarly, for non-AC data, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the experts (AUC, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.69-0.89]; AUC, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.72-0.88]) and the SVM (0.79 [0.71-0.87]) were the same (P 5 NS) and were higher than those for the unadjusted VP (0.65 [0.56-0.75]) (P , 0.01).

The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been observed in several types of human cancers and regulates the efficacy of many therapies. Here, we show that treatment with various concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 0, 1, 5 or 10 αM) promotes the migration ability of the human LoVo colon cancer cell line. As demonstrated by mRNA and protein expression analyses, EP2 and EP4 are the major PGE2 receptors expressed on the LoVo cell membrane. The Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt cell survival pathway was upregulated by EP2 and EP4 activation. Following the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, β-catenin translocated into the nucleus and triggered COX2 transcription via LEF-1 and TCF-4 and its subsequent translation. COX2 expression correlated with the elevation in the migration ability of LoVo cells. The experimental evidence shows a possible mechanism by which PGE2 induces cancer cell migration and further suggests PGE2 to be a potential therapeutic target in colon cancer metastasis. On inhibition of PGE2, in order to determine the downstream pathway, the levels of PI3K/Akt pathway were suppressed and the β-catenin expression was also modulated. Inhibition of EP2 and EP4 shows that PGE2 induces protein expression of COX-2 through EP2 and EP4 receptors in LoVo colon cancer cells. ? 2017 by the authors.

However, in real-life settings, few studies have reported the effect of screening and treating this pathogen in population-based programs. This is mainly because of the lack of an adequate infrastructure for delivery of systematic screening services to asymptomatic individuals, the lack of standardization to ensure that each subject receives the correct diagnostic testing and antibiotic treatment, and limited resources. We illustrate our method of implementing two population-based screen-and-treat programs in Taiwan, where the epidemiological characteristics of disease burden have changed from the traditionally Eastern pattern towards that of the Western countries. Our first example is a high-risk population that resides on an offshore island, in which a strategy of mass eradication of H.?pylori was applied. The other example is an intermediate-risk population, which is representative of the general average-risk population, in which there is integration of the screen-and-treat method with the established framework of colorectal cancer screening using the fecal-occult blood test. The information provided here may be useful for integration of gastric cancer prevention measures into the healthcare priorities of populations with different gastric cancer risks, such as those with limited resources. ? 2017 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Gastric cancer: clinical practice and treatment (including surgery); Gastric cancer: clinical research; Gastric cancer: epidemiology and surveillance; Helicobacter pylori: diagnosis; Helicobacter pylori: treatment and antimicrobial resistance,antineoplastic agent; cancer prevention; chemoprophylaxis; consensus; disease eradication; eradication therapy; experience; Helicobacter infection; human; mass screening; meta analysis (topic); priority journal; public health; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk reduction; stomach cancer; systematic review (topic); Taiwan; complication; female; gastritis; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; male; mass screening; microbiology; occult blood; risk; stomach tumor; Female; Gastritis; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Occult Blood; Risk; Stomach Neoplasms; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85019735588

We describe translational research covering vaccine design, preclinical characterization, and phase-I clinical trial with supportive outcome that advances UB-311 into an ongoing phase-II trial. Methods UB-311 is constructed with two synthetic Aβ1–14–targeting peptides (B-cell epitope), each linked to different helper T-cell peptide epitopes (UBITh?) and formulated in a Th2-biased delivery system. The hAPP751 transgenic mouse model was used to perform the proof-of-concept study. Baboons and macaques were used for preclinical safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity evaluation. Patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) were immunized by intramuscular route with 3 doses of UB-311 at weeks 0, 4, and 12, and monitored until week 48. Safety and immunogenicity were assessed per protocol, and preliminary efficacy was analyzed by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study–Clinician's Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). Results UB-311 covers a diverse genetic background and facilitates strong immune response with high responder rate. UB-311 reduced the levels of Aβ1–42 oligomers, protofibrils, and plaque load in hAPP751 transgenic mice. Safe and well-tolerated UB-311 generated considerable site-specific (Aβ1–10) antibodies across all animal species examined. In AD patients, UB-311 induced a 100% responder rate; injection site swelling and agitation were the most common adverse events (4/19 each). A slower rate of increase in ADAS-Cog from baseline to week 48 was observed in the subgroup of mild AD patients (MMSE???20) compared with the moderate AD subgroup, suggesting that UB-311 may have a potential of cognition improvement in patients with early stage of Alzheimer's dementia. Discussion The UBITh? platform can generate a high-precision molecular vaccine with high responder rate, strong on-target immunogenicity, and a potential of cognition improvement, which support UB-311 for active immunotherapy in early-to-mild AD patients currently enrolled in a phase-II trial (NCT02551809). ? 2017 United Biomedical, Inc.",Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid β vaccine; FIH clinical trial; UB-311; UBITh? platform,alanine aminotransferase; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; antibody; aspartate aminotransferase; autoantibody; oligomer; peptide vaccine; ub 311; unclassified drug; adult; aged; agitation; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; Article; breast disease; burn; cellulitis; Clinical Global Impression scale; coughing; decreased appetite; disease severity; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; epididymitis; erythrocyte; female; gastrointestinal disease; genetic background; genital system disease; helper cell; herpes zoster; human; hyperglycemia; immune response; immunogenicity; infection; infestation; injection site bleeding; injection site pain; injection site swelling; injury; intoxication; kidney disease; leukocyte count; male; mediastinum disease; mental disease; metabolic disorder; Mini Mental State Examination; mouse; nephrolithiasis; neurologic disease; neurologic disease assessment; neutrophil; neutrophil count; nonhuman; nutritional disorder; obsessive compulsive disorder; outcome assessment; phase 1 clinical trial; priority journal; rating scale; respiratory tract disease; side effect; skin disease; sleep disorder; soft tissue disease; thorax disease; tinea cruris; tooth pain; translational research; upper respiratory tract infection; urinary tract infection; urogenital tract disease; vomiting; wound,2-s2.0-85018448662

The effect of these loci in other racial/ethnic groups is less clear. Thus, we aimed to characterize the generalizability of 170 established BMI variants, or their proxies, to diverse US populations and trans-ethnically fine-map 36 BMI loci using a sample of &gt;102,000 adults of African, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, European and American Indian/Alaskan Native descent from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Study. We performed linear regression of the natural log of BMI (18.5–70?kg/m2) on the additive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at BMI loci on the MetaboChip (Illumina, Inc.), adjusting for age, sex, population stratification, study site, or relatedness. We then performed fixed-effect meta-analyses and a Bayesian trans-ethnic meta-analysis to empirically cluster by allele frequency differences. Finally, we approximated conditional and joint associations to test for the presence of secondary signals. We noted directional consistency with the previously reported risk alleles beyond what would have been expected by chance (binomial p?&lt;?0.05). Nearly, a quarter of the previously described BMI index SNPs and 29 of 36 densely-genotyped BMI loci on the MetaboChip replicated/generalized in trans-ethnic analyses. We observed multiple signals at nine loci, including the description of seven loci with novel multiple signals. This study supports the generalization of most common genetic loci to diverse ancestral populations and emphasizes the importance of dense multiethnic genomic data in refining the functional variation at genetic loci of interest and describing several loci with multiple underlying genetic variants. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"brain derived neurotrophic factor; organic cation transporter 3; potassium channel KCNQ1; transcription factor 7 like 2; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 3; adult; African; Alaska Native; American Indian; Article; Asian; ATP2A1 gene; body mass; BRE gene; CADM2 gene; CDKAL1 gene; COBLL1 gene; ethnic difference; ETV5 gene; European; female; FTO gene; gene; gene frequency; gene locus; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; genotype; GNPDA2 gene; Hispanic; human; IGF2BP2 gene; IRS1 gene; LYPLAL1 gene; major clinical study; male; MAP2K5 gene; MC4R gene; MTCH2 gene; NEGR1 gene; obesity; POC5 gene; priority journal; SEC16B gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLC39A8 gene; TFAP2B gene; TMEM18 gene; TNNI3K gene; ethnic group; genetics; obesity; population genetics; Body Mass Index; Ethnic Groups; Genetics, Population; Humans; Obesity",2-s2.0-85017161994

In Taiwan, there is a lack of consensus on management strategies for psoriasis, especially the principles of drug prescribing in psoriatic patients. Objectives The Taiwanese Dermatological Association convened Expert Panel meetings three times between 2012 and 2015 to discuss the management strategies for treatment of psoriasis in order to fill the knowledge gap and provide a reference tool for Taiwanese dermatologists. Results This paper reports the final output from the three meetings, with the aim of aiding clinical decision making in terms of principles of prescribing, including dosing strategies, efficacy profiles, and safety concerns in connection with eight categories of antipsoriatic treatment: topical agents, phototherapy, nonbiologic conventional systemic agents, licensed biologic systemic agents, newly emerging therapies, combination therapy, transitional therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine. Conclusion The Expert Panel, comprising distinguished Taiwanese dermatologists, succeeded in developing a consensus about the management of psoriasis in Taiwanese patients.

This study assessed the LC counts in oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and their correlation to clinicopathological parameters. Methods This study examined the LC counts in the epithelia and subepithelial connective tissues of 58 patients with OED (21 mild, 18 moderate, and 19 severe OED lesions) and 10 specimens of normal oral mucosa (NOM) by anti-S-100 protein immunostaining. Results We found that the mean LC counts in the epithelia or subepithelial connective tissues increased significantly from NOM samples through mild and moderate OED to severe OED samples. In addition, a significant correlation was found between higher mean LC counts in the dysplastic epithelia of OED samples and OED lesions with thicker epithelial layers (p?<?0.001) or wider inflammatory zones (p?<?0.001), and between higher mean LC counts in the subepithelial connective tissues of OED samples and OED lesions with wider inflammatory zones (p?<?0.001). Moreover, the nine OED lesions with malignant transformation had a significantly lower mean LC count than the 49 OED lesions without malignant transformation. Conclusion The significant and gradual elevation in LC count from NOM through mild and moderate OED to severe OED lesions suggests an upregulation of immunosurveillance ability in OED patients during the early oral carcinogenesis process. A low LC count in OED lesions may suggest the partial loss of immunosurveillance ability against dysplastic cells; this in turn favors the malignant transformation of an OED lesion into oral cancer. ? 2017",immunosurveillance; Langerhans cell; malignant transformation; oral carcinogenesis; oral epithelial dysplasia,"adult; aged; Article; cell count; connective tissue; controlled study; dysplasia; female; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; Langerhans cell; major clinical study; male; mouth disease; mouth mucosa; oral epithelial dysplasia; case control study; cell count; cell transformation; epithelium; Langerhans cell; middle aged; pathology; precancer; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Cell Count; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Epithelium; Female; Humans; Langerhans Cells; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Mucosa; Precancerous Conditions; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85014845133

We proposed a quantitative measurement of post-stroke spastic muscle stiffness by using shear-wave ultrasound elastography and tested its reliability. Acoustic radiation force impulse with shear wave velocity (SWV) detection was used to evaluate stiffness of the biceps brachii muscles at 90° and 0° elbow flexion. In 21 control subjects, SWV did not significantly differ between dominant and non-dominant sides at either flexion angle (0°: p?=?0.311, 90°: p?=?0.436). In 31 patients who had recent stroke, SWV was significantly greater on the paretic side than on the non-paretic side at both 90° (2.23?±?0.15?m/s vs. 1.88?±?0.08?m/s, p?=?0.036) and 0° (3.28?±?0.11?m/s vs. 2.93?±?0.06?m/s, p?=?0.002). The physical appearance of arms and forearms of our patients and controls prevented blinding of the rater to paretic or non-paretic side. At 90°, SWV on the paretic side correlated positively with modified Ashworth scale and modified Tardieu scale (spasticity severity) and negatively with Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement score (motor function impairment). The intra-class correlation coefficients of intra-rater and inter-rater reliability for SWV measurements were classified as excellent. In conclusion, high SWV was associated with high spasticity and poor function of the post-stroke upper limb, suggesting possible use as a reliable quantitative measure for disease progression and treatment follow-up. ? 2016 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology",Elastography; Muscle; Neurophysiologic; Shear wave; Spasticity; Stroke; Ultrasound,"Acoustics; Function evaluation; Medical imaging; Muscle; Shear waves; Stiffness; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonics; Wave propagation; Acoustic radiation Force Impulse; Elastography; Inter-rater reliabilities; Modified Ashworth scale; Neurophysiologic; Quantitative measurement; Spasticity; Stroke; Shear flow; adult; arm; Article; biceps brachii muscle; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; controlled study; disease course; elbow flexion; female; follow up; forearm; human; male; muscle rigidity; priority journal; quantitative analysis; shear wave elastography; spasticity; ultrasound scanner; cerebrovascular accident; complication; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; mechanical stress; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; shear strength; skeletal muscle; spasticity; Young modulus; Adult; Elastic Modulus; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Spasticity; Muscle, Skeletal; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Shear Strength; Stress, Mechanical; Stroke",2-s2.0-85014707918

We describe six patients who developed severe hepatic dysfunction following rapid weight loss or malnutrition. Rapid weight loss (18 to 91 kg) occurred after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in four patients and starvation-like dieting or hypoalbuminemia was noted in two patients. Four patients either died or received an urgent liver transplant. Pathologic findings were characterized by advanced alcoholic steatohepatitis-like features, including extensive/circumferential centrizonal pericellular fibrosis, central scar with perivenular sclerosis/veno-occlusion with superimposed hepatocellular dropout, abundant/prominent hepatocellular balloons, and numerous Mallory-Denk bodies, but there was no history of excess alcohol consumption. This study characterizes clinicopathologic features of aggressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis following rapid weight loss or malnutrition, which should be included in the differential diagnosis with alcohol when a patient is considered for liver transplantation. The mechanism of liver injury in aggressive steatohepatitis is unknown, but rapid fat mobilization in obese patients may potentially cause oxidative stress to the liver and further study is needed to determine if there is a genetic predisposition to this form of injury and if antioxidants may protect the liver during rapid weight loss/malnutrition. ? 2017 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.",,"immunoglobulin M; adult; Article; brain disease; clinical article; clinical feature; demography; Epstein Barr virus; female; flapping tremor; hepatomegaly; histopathology; human; human tissue; hypoalbuminemia; jaundice; liver biopsy; liver dysfunction; liver transplantation; low carbohydrate diet; malnutrition; medical history; middle aged; nonalcoholic fatty liver; priority journal; protein diet; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; severe hepatic impairment; starvation; tissue section; weight reduction; body weight loss; differential diagnosis; disease exacerbation; gastric bypass surgery; liver; malnutrition; mortality; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nutritional status; pathology; pathophysiology; predictive value; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; Adult; Diagnosis, Differential; Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted; Diet, High-Protein; Disease Progression; Female; Gastric Bypass; Humans; Liver; Liver Transplantation; Malnutrition; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Nutritional Status; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss",2-s2.0-85014163352

We considered it important to determine whether S-1 maintains non-inferiority after a long-term follow-up in the GEST study and to obtain a firm positive conclusion. In addition, it may be an interesting challenge to explore the efficacious profile of GS in the long-term follow-up study. Using the data from the follow-up period, background and efficacy in patients from Taiwan and Japan, as well as the rates of tumor shrinkage in locally advanced and metastatic patients (Waterfall plot) were also analyzed. Methods: The results of the primary analysis were reconfirmed, and subset analysis of overall survival and progression-free survival was performed based on the overall survival data updated by the cut-off date of 31st July in 2011. Results: The median follow-up period was 29.8 months, and 795 deaths occurred (95.6%). The median overall survival was 8.8 months for gemcitabine, 9.7 months for S-1 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 0.79–1.17), and 9.9 months for GS (HR 0.91; 97.5% CI 0.75–1.11). In patients with performance status (PS) 0, the median overall survival was 9.8 months for gemcitabine, 10.9 months for S-1, and 10.5 months for GS. In patients with PS 1, the median overall survival was 6.2 months for gemcitabine, 6.3 months for S-1, and 9.6 months for GS. Conclusion: Our survey reconfirmed the non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine and showed S-1 can be used as one of the standard treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer.

However, extant research on the visual association of designers and the differences between expert and novice designers when they engage in the visual association task are scant. Using electroencephalography (EEG), this study attempted to narrow this research gap. Sixteen healthy designers—eight experts and eight novices—were recruited, and asked to perform visual association while EEG signals were acquired, subsequently analysed using independent component analysis. The results indicated that strong connectivity was observed among the prefrontal, frontal, and cingulate cortices, and the default mode network. The experts used both hemispheres and executive functions to support their association tasks, whereas the novices mainly used their right hemisphere and memory retrieval functions. The visual association of experts appeared to be more goal-directed than that of the novices. Accordingly, designing and implementing authentic and goal-directed activities for improving the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex and default mode network are critical for design educators and creativity researchers. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",EEG; Electroencephalography; Expert designer; Novice designer; Visual association,Electrophysiology; Independent component analysis; Default-mode networks; Executive function; Expert and novices; Expert designer; Novice designers; Prefrontal cortex; Right hemispheres; Strong connectivity; Electroencephalography; adult; Article; association cortex; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; creativity; default mode network; electroencephalography; executive function; female; frontal cortex; functional connectivity; human; human experiment; independent component analysis; information retrieval; male; memory; normal human; prefrontal cortex; right hemisphere; signal detection; state dependent learning; stimulus response; task performance; visual stimulation,2-s2.0-85012273719

Recently, abundant evidence from experimental studies has clearly supported the strong correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction in adipocytes and obesity. Various physiological conditions such as excessive nutrition, genetic factors, hypoxia, and toxins disrupt mitochondrial function by impairing mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and oxidative capacity. Mitochondrial dysfunction in adipocytes could have an impact on differentiation, adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and the significant alteration in their metabolic function, which ultimately results in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Numerous dietary natural compounds are the subject of research for the prevention and treatment of obesity through reprogramming multiple metabolic pathways. Some of them have the potential against obesity by modulating insulin signaling, decreasing oxidative damage, downregulating adipokines secretion, and increasing mitochondrial DNA that improves mitochondrial function and thus maintain metabolic homeostasis. Here, we focus on and summarize and briefly discuss the currently known targets and the mitochondria-targeting effects of dietary natural compounds in the intervention of obesity. ? 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The objective of this study was to differentiate two obesity-associated cardiomyopathy miniature pig models: one with the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and one with a metabolically healthy obesity (MHO). The cellular responses during the development of obesity-induced cardiomyopathy were investigated. Methods Five-month-old Lee-Sung (MetS) and Lanyu (MHO) minipigs were made obese by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 months. Results Obese pigs exhibited a greater heart weight than control pigs. Interstitial and perivascular fibrosis developed in the myocardium of obese pigs. The HFD induced cardiac lipid accumulation and oxidative stress and also decreased the antioxidant defense in MetS pigs. This diet activated oxidative stress without changing cardiac antioxidant defense and lipid content in MHO pigs. The HFD upregulated the expression of Grp94, CHOP, caspase 12, p62, and LC3II, and increased the ratio of LC3II to LC3I in the left ventricle (LV) of MetS pigs. Compared to obese MetS pigs, less Grp94 and elevated CHOP expression was found in the obese MHO heart. The HFD did not change the ratio of LC3II to LC3I and p62 expression in obese MHO pigs. The obese MetS pigs had an extensive and greater inflammatory response in the plasma than the obese MHO pigs, which had a lesser and milder inflammation. Conclusion Oxidative stress and ER stress were involved in the progression of MHO-related cardiomyopathy. Inflammation, autophagy, ER stress, oxidative stress, and lipotoxicity participated in the pathological mechanism of MetS-related cardiomyopathy. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism",Autophagy; Cardiomyopathy; ER stress; Metabolic syndrome; Metabolically healthy obesity; Oxidative stress,"activating transcription factor 6; antioxidant; caspase 12; chemokine; collagen type 1; endoribonuclease 1alpha; Fas ligand; gamma interferon; gelatinase A; glucose regulated protein 94; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; interleukin 15; interleukin 17; lipid; lymphotactin; macrophage inflammatory protein 1gamma; microtubule associated protein; microtubule associated protein light chain 3; monocyte chemotactic protein 5; protein kinase; protein kinase RNA like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; ribonuclease; sequestosome 1; somatomedin binding protein; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; transforming growth factor beta1; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; cytokine; DDIT3 protein, human; glucose-regulated proteins; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; heat shock protein 70; membrane protein; microtubule associated protein; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autophagy; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum stress; female; heart left ventricle; heart muscle fibrosis; heart weight; inflammation; lipid diet; lipotoxicity; male; metabolic syndrome X; minipig; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; protein expression; upregulation; vascular fibrosis; animal; blood; cardiomyopathy; complication; disease model; genetics; lipid diet; metabolism; obesity; pig; Animals; Cardiomyopathies; Cytokines; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Female; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Male; Membrane Proteins; Metabolic Syndrome; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Swine; Swine, Miniature; Transcription Factor CHOP; Triglycerides",2-s2.0-85006489292

Adults receiving definitive FQ or carbapenem therapy were compared in a propensity score-matched analysis, and 30-day mortality was the primary endpoint. Results A total of 299 patients were eligible. Patients receiving a FQ (n = 24), either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, had a lower 30-day mortality rate than those with carbapenem therapy (8.3%, 2/24 vs. 23.3%, 64/275; p = 0.12).

Bundle care has been documented to reduce CLABSI rates in Western countries, however, few reports were from Asian countries and the differences in the epidemiology or outcomes of critically-ill patients with CLABSIs after implementation of bundle care remain unknown. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, microbiological characteristics, and factors associated with mortality in critically-ill patients after implementation of bundle care. Methods Prospective surveillance was performed on patients admitted to ICUs at the National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan from January 2012 to June 2013. The demographic, microbiological, and clinical data of patients who developed CLABSI according to the National Healthcare Safety Network definition were reviewed. A total of 181 episodes of CLABSI were assessed in 156 patients over 46,020 central-catheter days. Results The incidence of CLABSI was 3.93 per 1000 central-catheter days. The predominant causative microorganisms isolated from CLABSI episodes were Gram-negative bacteria (39.2%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (33.2%) and Candida spp. (27.6%). Median time from insertion of a central catheter to occurrence of CLABSI was 8 days. In multivariate analysis, the independent factors associated with mortality were higher Pitt bacteremia score [odds ratio (OR) 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18–1.68] and longer interval between onset of CLABSIs and catheter removal (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02–1.20), respectively. Conclusion In institutions with a high proportion of CLABSI caused by Gram-negative bacteria, severity of bacteremia and delay in catheter removal were significant factors associated with mortality. ? 2015",Bloodstream infection; Central line; Intensive care unit; Mortality; Risk factor,"antiinfective agent; aged; aminotransferase blood level; antibiotic sensitivity; antimicrobial therapy; antisepsis; APACHE; Article; blood culture; Candida; candidiasis; cardiovascular disease; care bundle; catheter infection; catheter removal; Charlson Comorbidity Index; critically ill patient; diabetes mellitus; Enterococcus; female; fungus; glomerulus filtration rate; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; hand washing; hepatobiliary disease; hospitalization; human; immunosuppressive treatment; in vitro study; infection control practitioner; intensive care unit; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; morbidity; mortality; neurologic disease; practice guideline; respiratory tract disease; risk assessment; Taiwan; total parenteral nutrition; bacteremia; bacterium; care bundle; catheter infection; classification; critical illness; fungemia; incidence; isolation and purification; middle aged; procedures; prospective study; survival analysis; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bacteremia; Bacteria; Catheter-Related Infections; Critical Illness; Female; Fungemia; Fungi; Humans; Incidence; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Care Bundles; Prospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84939824378

These patients were pretreated with directly acting antiviral therapy (entecavir) for 12 weeks with subsequent addition of peg-IFNλ for up to 32 weeks. In a subgroup of patients, the addition of peg-IFNλ provoked high serum levels of antiviral cytokine IL-18. We also observed the enhancement of natural killer cell polyfunctionality and the recovery of a pan-genotypic HBV-specific CD4+ T cells producing IFN-γ with maintenance of HBV-specific CD8+ T cell antiviral and cytotoxic activities. It was only in these patients that we observed strong virological control with reductions in both viral replication and HBV antigen levels. Here, we show for the first time that in vivo peg-IFNλ displays significant immunostimulatory properties with improvements in the main effectors mediating anti-HBV immunity. Interestingly, the maintenance in HBV-specific CD8+ T cells in the presence of peg-IFNλ is in contrast to previous studies showing that peg-IFNa treatment for CHB results in a detrimental effect on the functionality of this important antiviral T cell compartment. ? 2017 Phillips, Mistry, Riva, Cooksley, Hadzhiolova-Lebeau, Plavova, Katzarov, Simonova, Zeuzem, Woffendin, Chen, Peng, Chang, Lueth, De Knegt, Choi, Wedemeyer, Dao, Kim, Chu, Wind-Rotolo, Williams, Cooney and Chokshi.",Direct antiviral; Hepatitis B; Immunity; In vivo; Peg-interferon lambda,alpha1 interferon; CD16 antigen; CD56 antigen; entecavir; gamma interferon; granzyme B; hepatitis B surface antigen; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 12p70; interleukin 15; interleukin 17; interleukin 18; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; peginterferon lambda; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; adaptive immunity; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; analysis of variance; Article; cell differentiation assay; chronic hepatitis B; clinical article; controlled study; degranulation assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence activated cell sorting; human; immune response; immunosurveillance; innate immunity; male; middle aged; natural killer cell; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; signal transduction; virus replication,2-s2.0-85020018105

Experimental Design: In the phase I part, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients were dose escalated on foretinib (30-60 mg) every day using the standard 3+3 design. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined, an additional 32 patients were dosed at the MTD in the phase II expansion cohort for assessment of efficacy and safety. Exploratory analyses were conducted to assess potential biomarkers that might correlate with clinical efficacy and survival. Results: The MTD of foretinib was established as 30 mg every day. The most frequent adverse events were hypertension, decreased appetite, ascites, and pyrexia. When dosed at 30 mg every day in the first-line setting, foretinib demonstrated promising antitumor activity. According to the modified mRECIST, the objective response rate was 22.9%, the disease stabilization rate 82.9%, and the median duration of response 7.6 months. The median time to progression was 4.2 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 15.7 months. Fifteen candidate biomarkers whose levels in the circulation were significantly altered in response to foretinib treatment were elucidated. Multivariate analyses identified IL6 and IL8 as independent predictors of OS. Conclusions: Foretinib demonstrated promising antitumor activity and good tolerability in the first-line setting in Asian advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Baseline plasma levels of IL6 or IL8 might predict the response to foretinib. ?2016 AACR.",,"alanine aminotransferase; angiopoietin 2; foretinib; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; osteopontin; somatomedin binding protein 1; thrombospondin 2; tumor marker; angiopoietin receptor; anilide; axl receptor tyrosine kinase; foretinib; IL6 protein, human; IL8 protein, human; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; KDR protein, human; MET protein, human; oncoprotein; pharmacological biomarker; protein tyrosine kinase; quinoline derivative; RON protein; ROS1 protein, human; scatter factor receptor; vasculotropin receptor 2; abdominal pain; adult; advanced cancer; aged; antineoplastic activity; Article; ascites; Asian; cachexia; cancer growth; cancer survival; constipation; coughing; decreased appetite; diarrhea; disease course; dose response; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug response; drug safety; drug tolerability; dyspnea; fatigue; female; fever; hand foot syndrome; hemoptysis; hepatic encephalopathy; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hypertension; hypoalbuminemia; hypoglycemia; hyponatremia; insomnia; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; maximum tolerated dose; median survival time; monotherapy; multicenter study; overall survival; peripheral edema; pharmacodynamics; pharmacogenomics; pharmacokinetic parameters; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; protein blood level; response evaluation criteria in solid tumors; side effect; upper abdominal pain; urinary tract infection; vomiting; antagonists and inhibitors; blood; clinical trial; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; middle aged; pathology; Adult; Aged; Anilides; Biomarkers, Pharmacological; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-8; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Middle Aged; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; Quinolines; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptor, TIE-2; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2",2-s2.0-85020386314

Methods: We obtained data on risk factor exposure from nationally representative health surveys, cause-specific mortality from the National Death Registry, and relative risks from epidemiological studies and meta-analyses. We applied the comparative risk assessment framework to estimate mortality burden attributable to individual risk factors or risk factor clusters. Results: In 2009, high blood glucose accounted for 14,900 deaths (95% UI: 11,850-17,960), or 10.4% of all deaths in that year. It was followed by tobacco smoking (13,340 deaths, 95% UI: 10,330-16,450), high blood pressure (11,190 deaths, 95% UI: 8,190-14,190), ambient particulate matter pollution (8,600 deaths, 95% UI: 7,370-9,840), and dietary risks (high sodium intake and low intake of fruits and vegetables, 7,890 deaths, 95% UI: 5,970-9,810). Overweight-obesity and physical inactivity accounted for 7,620 deaths (95% UI: 6,040-9,190), and 7,400 deaths (95% UI: 6,670-8,130), respectively. The cardiometabolic risk factors of high blood pressure, high blood glucose, high cholesterol, and overweight-obesity jointly accounted for 12,120 deaths (95% UI: 11,220-13,020) from cardiovascular diseases. For domestic risk factors, infections from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were responsible for 6,300 deaths (95% UI: 5,610-6,980) and 3,170 deaths (95% UI: 1,860-4,490), respectively, and betel nut use was associated with 1,780 deaths from oral, laryngeal, and esophageal cancer (95% UI: 1,190-2,360). The leading risk factors for years of life lost were similar, but the impact of tobacco smoking and alcohol use became larger because the attributable deaths from these risk factors occurred among young adults aged less than 60 years. Conclusions: High blood glucose, tobacco smoking, and high blood pressure are the major risk factors for deaths from diseases and injuries among Taiwanese adults. A large number of years of life would be gained if the 13 modifiable risk factors could be removed or reduced to the optimal level. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Burden of disease; Comparative risk assessment; Modifiable risk factors,"cholesterol; glucose; adult; alcohol; blood; cancer; disease incidence; environmental risk; health impact; health survey; hepatitis; infectious disease; lifestyle; metabolism; mortality; particulate matter; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking; tobacco; virus; adult; adult disease; age; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; attributable risk; body mass; cerebrovascular accident; cholesterol blood level; chronic liver disease; comparative study; controlled study; environmental factor; esophagus cancer; female; glucose blood level; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; injury; ischemic heart disease; larynx cancer; lifestyle; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; metabolism; mortality; mouth cancer; obesity; particulate matter; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking; Taiwan; air pollution; Areca; cause of death; diet; environment; epidemiology; health survey; hyperglycemia; hypertension; infection; injury; metabolic disorder; metabolism; middle aged; young adult; lifestyle; register; risk; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; Nicotiana tabacum; Piper betel; Adult; Aged; Air Pollution; Areca; Blood Glucose; Cause of Death; Diet; Environment; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypertension; Infection; Life Style; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Tobacco Smoking; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult; Diet; Life Style; Models, Statistical; Mortality; Registries; Risk; Risk Assessment; Smoking",2-s2.0-85018259418

Methods: We used data on 59 389 individuals (4.0%) among 1 489 937 Taiwanese screenees age 50 to 69 years with f-Hb 20 μg hemoglobin or more per gram of feces from 2004 to 2009. They were classified into 41 995 who received colonoscopy and 10 778 who received no confirmatory examination; the latter was categorized into three risk groups according to f-Hb (20-49, 50-99, and 100+). Mortality from CRC as the primary end point was monitored until December 31, 2012. Results: A 1.64-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32 to 2.04) increased risk for CRC death for the noncolonoscopy group as opposed to the colonoscopy group adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics. A gradient relationship was noted between cumulative mortality and age- and sex-adjusted f-Hb categories with 1.31-fold (95% CI = 1.04 to 1.71), 2.21-fold (95% CI = 1.55 to 3.34), and 2.53-fold (95% CI = 1.95 to 3.43) increased risk, respectively, for the 20-49, 50-99, and 100+ risk groups in the noncolonoscopy group compared with the colonoscopy group. The noncolonoscopy group led to a statistically significant 1.75-fold increased risk (95% CI = 1.35 to 2.33) for CRC of the distal colon but a statistically nonsignificant 1.11-fold increased risk (95% CI = 0.70 to 1.75) for the proximal colon, compared with the colonoscopy group. When the comparator was limited to subjects whose colonoscopy was completed to the cecum, the statistically significantly elevated risk for CRC mortality was seen for both distal and proximal colon in the noncolonoscopy group. Conclusions: After a positive fecal immunochemical test, colonoscopy can reduce by about half the number of deaths from CRC. Among colonoscopy noncompliers, higher f-Hb is associated with an increased risk of mortality from CRC in a dose-response manner. ? 2017 The Author.",,hemoglobin; hemoglobin; adult; age; aged; Article; ascending colon; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cancer screening; clinical article; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; controlled study; descending colon; feces; female; follow up; hemoglobin determination; human; male; middle aged; patient referral; priority journal; sex difference; Taiwanese; cancer staging; chemistry; colon; Colorectal Neoplasms; feces; incidence; mortality; occult blood; pathology; patient compliance; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Aged; Colon; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Feces; Female; Hemoglobins; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Occult Blood; Patient Compliance; Risk Factors; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85021380195

The aim of this study was to investigate the cytoprotective and antioxidant effects of caffeic acid (CA) derivatives on tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. Nine CA derivatives were synthesized, including N-phenylethyl caffeamide (PECA), N-(3-florophen)methyl caffeamide (FMCA), N-(4-methoxy-phen)methyl caffeamide (MPMCA), N-heptyl caffeamide (HCA), N-octyl caffeamide (OCA), octyl caffeate (CAOE), phenpropyl caffeate (CAPPE), phenethyl caffeate (CAPE), and phenmethyl caffeate (CAPME). The results showed that CA and its derivatives significantly inhibited t-BHP-induced cell death of HepG2 cells. The rank order of potency of the CA derivatives for cytoprotection was CAOE > HCA > OCA > FMCA > CAPPE > CAPME > CAPE > PECA > MPMCA > CA. Their cytoprotective activity was associated with lipophilicity. The antioxidant effect of these compounds was supported by the reduction in the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substrates, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, in HepG2 cells. Pre-treatment of CA derivatives significantly prevented the depletion of glutathione, the most important water-soluble antioxidant in hepatocytes. Pre-treatment of CA derivatives before t-BHP exposure maintained mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and ATP content in the injured HepG2 cells. CA derivatives except OCA and HCA significantly suppressed t-BHP-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1 α) protein level. In addition, all of these CA derivatives markedly increased the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) accumulation in the nucleus, indicating that their cytoprotection may be mediated by the activation of Nrf2. Our results suggest that CA derivatives might be a hepatoprotective agent against oxidative stress. ? 2017 by the authors.",Antioxidant; Caffeic acid derivatives; Liver protection; Tert-butyl hydroperoxide,"antioxidant; caffeic acid derivative; glutathione; HIF1A protein, human; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; NFE2L2 protein, human; tert butyl hydroperoxide; transcription factor Nrf2; cell survival; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; drug effects; Hep-G2 cell line; human; lipid peroxidation; liver mitochondrion; metabolism; oxidative stress; preclinical study; Antioxidants; Caffeic Acids; Cell Survival; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Glutathione; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Lipid Peroxidation; Mitochondria, Liver; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Oxidative Stress; tert-Butylhydroperoxide",2-s2.0-85020210604

However, the cause of a fall is complicated, and several types of risk factors are involved. Therefore, a comprehensive model to predict falls with high sensitivity and specificity is needed. Methods This study was a prospective study of 112 inpatients in a rehabilitation ward with follow-up interviews in patients' homes. Evaluations were performed 1 month after stroke and included the following factors: (1) status of cognition, depression, fear of fall and limb spasticity; (2) functional assessments [walking velocity and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)]; and (3) objective, computerized gait and balance analyses. The outcome variable was the number of accidental falls during the 6-month follow-up period after baseline measurements. Results The non-faller group exhibited significantly better walking velocity and FIM scale compared to the faller group (P <.001). The faller group exhibited higher levels of spasticity in the affected limbs, asymmetry of gait parameters in single support (P <.001), double support (P =.027), and step time (P =.003), and lower stability of center of gravity in the medial-lateral direction (P =.008). Psychological assessments revealed that the faller group exhibited more severe depression and lower confidence without falling. A multivariate logistic regression model identified three independent predictors of falls with high sensitivity (82.6%) and specificity (86.5%): the asymmetry ratio of single support [adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.2, 95% CI (1.2-3.8)], the level of spasticity in the gastrocnemius [aOR = 3.2 (1.4-7.3)], and the degree of depression [aOR = 1.4 (1.2-1.8)]. Conclusions This study revealed depression, in additional to gait asymmetry and spasticity, as another independent factor for predicting falls. These results suggest that appropriate gait training,reduction of ankle spasticity, and aggressive management of depression may be critical to prevent falls in stroke patients. ? 2017 Wei et al.",,"adult; aged; ankle spasticity; Article; biological model; cerebrovascular accident; cognition; controlled study; depression; disease severity; falling; fear; female; follow up; Functional Independence Measure; gait disorder; human; independent variable; interview; major clinical study; male; mobilization; outcome assessment; predictor variable; prospective study; psychologic assessment; sensitivity and specificity; spasticity; very elderly; walking speed; ankle; biomechanics; body equilibrium; complication; depression; gait; middle aged; Muscle Spasticity; pathophysiology; physiology; prognosis; psychology; risk factor; Stroke; stroke rehabilitation; Accidental Falls; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ankle; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cognition; Depression; Fear; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gait; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Spasticity; Postural Balance; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation",2-s2.0-85019615592

Methods This prospective study enrolled 1,989 pregnant Taiwanese women. A two-step approach, including a 50-g, 1-h GCT and 100-g, 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), was employed for the diagnosis of GDM at weeks 23-32. The mid-pregnancy HbA1c level was measured at the time the OGTT was performed. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the relationship between the mid-pregnancy HbA1c level and GDM. Multiple logistic regression models were implemented to assess the relationships between the mid-pregnancy HbA1c level and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Results An ROC curve demonstrated that the optimal mid-pregnancy HbA1c cut-off point to predict GDM, as diagnosed by the Carpenter-Coustan criteria using a two-step approach, was 5.7%. The area under the ROC curve of the mid-pregnancy HbA1c level for GDM was 0.70. Compared with the levels of 4.5-4.9%, higher mid-pregnancy HbA1c levels (5.0-5.4, 5.5- 5.9, 6.0-6.4, 6.5-6.9, and >7.0%) were significantly associated with increased risks of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, preterm delivery, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, low birth weight, and macrosomia (the odds ratio [OR] ranges were 1.20-9.98, 1.31-5.16, 0.88-3.15, 0.89-4.10, and 2.22-27.86, respectively). Conclusions The mid-pregnancy HbA1c level was associated with various adverse pregnancy outcomes in high-risk Taiwanese women. However, it lacked adequate sensitivity and specificity to replace the two-step approach in the diagnosis of GDM.

Additional secondary endpoints are postprogression survival from time of symptomatic progression, duration of and response to each systemic treatment regimen and dosing of sorafenib throughout the treatment period. Asymptomatic, multikinase inhibitor-naive patients aged ?18 years with histologically/cytologically documented differentiated thyroid cancer that is radioactive iodine refractory are eligible. Patients may receive any therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer, including sorafenib or other multikinase inhibitors if indicated and decided on by the treating physician. In total, 700 patients are estimated to be enrolled from >20 countries. Final analysis will be performed once the last enrolled patient has been followed up with for 24 months. ? 2017 The authors.",Differentiated thyroid cancer; Multikinase inhibitor; Noninterventional; Observational; Radioactive iodine refractory; Sorafenib,"sorafenib; antineoplastic agent; carbanilamide derivative; lenvatinib; nicotinamide; protein kinase inhibitor; quinoline derivative; radioactive iodine; sorafenib; adult; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer survival; cohort analysis; differentiated thyroid cancer; drug safety; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; observational study; open study; overall survival; progression free survival; prospective study; unspecified side effect; young adult; aged; analogs and derivatives; carcinoma; clinical trial; drug administration; middle aged; multicenter study; pathology; salvage therapy; Thyroid Neoplasms; time factor; treatment failure; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Iodine Radioisotopes; Male; Middle Aged; Niacinamide; Phenylurea Compounds; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Quinolines; Salvage Therapy; Thyroid Neoplasms; Time Factors; Treatment Failure",2-s2.0-85019162287

We analyzed national prescription patterns and treatment outcomes of patients who received sorafenib for advanced HCC. Patients and Methods: We established a nation-wide cohort of patients who started receiving treatment with sorafenib for advanced HCC between August 2012 and July 2013 from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan and also retrieved demographic and prescription data. The databases of National Death Registry and Taiwan Cancer Registry were used for survival outcomes and cancer diagnosis information, respectively. Results: A total of 3,293 patients were enrolled. The median overall survival (OS) and time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) of all patients were 6.8 and 2.6 months, respectively. Upon the first prescription of sorafenib, 58.4% of patients received the standard dose (800 mg/day). Among them, 61.9% had subsequent dose reduction. A total of 41.6% of patients initially received lower than standard doses; 36.1% of them had subsequent dose escalation to 800 mg/day. Being male (odds ratio=1.41; p<0.001) and treatment year of 2012 (odds ratio=1.28; p=0.002) were associated with the standard initial dose. Patients who received standard initial dose of sorafenib, compared to patients who received lower initial doses, exhibited longer OS (median of 7.8 vs. 6.6 months, p<0.001) but similar TTD (median of 2.6 vs. 2.9 months, p=0.840). Conclusion: A considerable number of patients with advanced HCC received less than the standard dose of sorafenib. The treatment outcomes in the general population were consistent with those reported in clinical trials.",Database research; Dose; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Population study; Prognosis; Sorafenib,"sorafenib; antineoplastic agent; carbanilamide derivative; nicotinamide; protein kinase inhibitor; sorafenib; ablation therapy; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chemoembolization; cohort analysis; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug withdrawal; female; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; overall survival; population research; prescription; priority journal; survival rate; time to treatment; treatment outcome; adolescent; analogs and derivatives; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; clinical practice; Liver Neoplasms; middle aged; survival analysis; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Niacinamide; Phenylurea Compounds; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85019116738
