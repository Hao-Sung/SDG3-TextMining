"Sanitation, open defecation, and Diarrhea in Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, in early 2017: A cross-sectional epidemiological study",2019,"Sanitasi Total Berbasis Masyarakat (STBM), an Indonesian program adopted from Community-Led Total Sanitation, only 17.3% of urban villages in Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, are open defecation-free. Tangerang has the third highest incidence rate of diarrhea in Banten. This cross-sectional epidemiological study aims to establish a correlation among sanitation, open defecation, and diarrhea to determine the impact of the STBM program, particularly in Tangerang. We obtained open defecation and sanitation data of 104 urban villages from the STBM website of the Ministry of Health. In addition, diarrhea data from January 2017 to June 2017 were obtained from surveillance epidemiology data of the Ministry of Health. We statistically analyzed data using correlation analysis. The results revealed a significant negative correlation (P = 0.0005) between open defecation and sanitation access (r = -0.975). However, no significant correlation was established between diarrhea and sanitation access (r = -0.102) and between diarrhea and open defecation (r = 0.124), suggesting a significant correlation between open defecation and sanitation. Thus, all five pillars (i.e., no open defecation, hand washing, water safety, graywater treatment, and waste management) of the STBM should be executed simultaneously to assess the impact of health-related problems, particularly diarrhea. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"Spousal communication on family planning and contraceptive adoption in Indonesia",2019,"Background: This study assesses the degree of spousal communication on family planning associated with contraceptive adoption in Indonesia. Method: The analysis of this study was derived from the 2012 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS). This study utilizes both bivariate and logistic regressions. Results: Findings indicate that 53.3% of respondents had never communicated family planning with their spouses while 46.7% of respondents had communicated before. About 31.3% male respondents were more likely to use contraception if they had discussions on family planning with their spouses. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that spousal communication is highly associated with region of residence (OR=1.5; 95% CI=1.4-1.8), exposure of family planning message through television (OR=1.8; 95% CI=1.6-2.0), and contraceptive use (OR=1.8; 95% CI=1.5-2.0). Recommendation: Family planning discussion appears to increase mutual agreement regarding childbearing and contraceptive use among couples. In Indonesia, an intensive effort to target men is needed to both enhance the spousal communication and adopt contraception. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Autologous mesenchymal stem cell application for cartilage defect in recurrent patellar dislocation: A case report",2019,"Introduction: Recurrent patellar dislocation can lead to articular cartilage injury. We report a 21-year old male with left patella instability and articular cartilage defect. Presentation of case: A 21-year-old male presented with left patellar instability and pain. Knee range of motion (ROM) was limited when patella was dislocated (0–20°). The J-sign positive, patellar apprehension test was positive, with medial patella elasticity/patellar glide >2 quadrants. The Q angle, in the 90° flexed knee position was still normal. The plain radiograph imaging showed no abnormality. Insall-Salvati index was 1.12. The patient was diagnosed with recurrent patellar dislocation and cartilage lesion of the left knee, and was treated with combining Fulkerson osteotomy with the lateral retinacular release and percutaneous medial plication, followed by microfracture procedure and MSCs implantation. Discussion: Recurrent patellar dislocation is uncommon problem while cartilage lesions following recurrent patellar dislocations are quite common, but still no consensus on the management. Conclusion: Combination of Fulkerson osteotomy with the lateral retinacular release and percutaneous medial plication was effective in treating chronic patellar instability. The microfracture procedure and MSCs implantation was safe and could improve the cartilage regeneration in patients with articular cartilage defect due to recurrent patellar dislocation. ? 2019 The Authors","adult; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; bone marrow biopsy; cartilage; case report; cauterization; clinical article; connective tissue disease; disease duration; dissection; exercise; human; human cell; human tissue; international knee documentation committee score; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; knee pain; male; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; microfracture; osteotomy; patella dislocation; physical examination; postoperative care; priority journal; range of motion; recurrent disease; stair climbing; tibial tuberosity; young adult"
"Barriers and technologies of maternal and neonatal referral system in developing countries: A narrative review",2019,"There is a lack of studies concerning the maternal and neonatal referral system in troubled contexts, and the number of maternal and neonatal mortality deaths is considered high in developing countries. This study aims to understand the current conditions of the maternal and neonatal referral system in developing countries, in the context of barriers and technologies. We conducted a narrative literature review based on journals and conference papers in the last five years (2014–2018)from selected databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Science Direct, Scopus, Wiley Online, PMC, and ProQuest). The results of the study selection show that 40 studies identified barriers or challenges in maternal or neonatal referral systems, and eight studies discussed technology to support referral. Based on the results, barriers in maternal and neonatal referral systems can be divided into two main factors: 1. the healthcare system and 2. the patient. Some technologies are used in developing countries to support maternal and neonatal referral. However, these technologies still do not address all of the barriers described in the referral system. A study from different perspectives is needed, such as community involvement or government programs, to improve the current conditions of the maternal and neonatal referral system. ? 2019","article; Cinahl; death; developing country; female; government; health care system; human; Medline; narrative; newborn; patient referral; ScienceDirect; Scopus"
"Hypercholesterolemia as the first manifestation of metabolic abnormalities in normoglycemic young adult male with family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus",2019,"Background: Although several studies reported high number of metabolic disorder among First Degree Relatives (FDR) of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), only a few studies analyzed the impact of gender on the occurence of metabolic abnormalities. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the first manifestation of metabolic abnormalities in normoglycemic FDR of T2DM. Methods and materials: This cross-sectional study recruited 60 FDR of T2DM age of 19–39 years old in Jakarta, Indonesia. We matched 60 non-FDR as controls. All participants had neither glucose intolerance nor hypertension. Anthropometry, body composition and laboratory measurements (blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, liver and kidney function test) were assessed. Results: In males, FDR aged 30–39 years old had higher Total Cholesterol (TC) level ([233 ± 51.43 mg/dL vs. 177.83 ± 22.08 mg/dL, p = 0.036] and Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) level [173.83 ± 39.83 mg/dL vs. 125.67 ± 21.50 mg/dL, p = 0.026] than those of non-FDR significantly. FDR also had higher risk of hypercholesterolemia than non-FDR [OR 5.25 (1.09–25.21)]. There were no differences of metabolic abnormalities between female FDR and non-FDR group. Conclusion: Male FDR of T2DM showed higher level of TC and LDL-C level than those of non FDR. Male FDR also showed higher risk of dyslipidemia. ? 2019 Diabetes India","hemoglobin A1c; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; biological marker; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; lipid; adult; anthropometry; Article; body composition; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; cross-sectional study; family history; female; first-degree relative; glucose blood level; high risk population; human; hypercholesterolemia; Indonesia; kidney function test; laboratory test; liver function test; major clinical study; male; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; young adult; blood; body mass; follow up; genetic predisposition; genetics; hypercholesterolemia; incidence; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; prognosis; risk factor; Adult; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Incidence; Indonesia; Lipids; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Young Adult"
"Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis decreases tuberculosis risk among Asian patients with HIV",2019,"Introduction: Cotrimoxazole (CTX) is recommended as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, malaria and other serious bacterial infections in HIV-infected patients. Despite its in?vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the effects of CTX preventive therapy on tuberculosis (TB) remain unclear. Methods: Adults living with HIV enrolled in a regional observational cohort in Asia who had initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) were included in the analysis. Factors associated with new TB diagnoses after cohort entry and survival after cART initiation were analysed using Cox regression, stratified by site. Results: A total of 7355 patients from 12 countries enrolled into the cohort between 2003 and 2016 were included in the study. There were 368 reported cases of TB after cohort entry with an incidence rate of 0.99 per 100?person-years (/100?pys). Multivariate analyses adjusted for viral load (VL), CD4 count, body mass index (BMI) and cART duration showed that CTX reduced the hazard for new TB infection by 28% (HR 0.72, 95% CI l 0.56, 0.93). Mortality after cART initiation was 0.85/100?pys, with a median follow-up time of 4.63?years. Predictors of survival included age, female sex, hepatitis C co-infection, TB diagnosis, HIV VL, CD4 count and BMI. Conclusions: CTX was associated with a reduction in the hazard for new TB infection but did not impact survival in our Asian cohort. The potential preventive effect of CTX against TB during periods of severe immunosuppression should be further explored. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Tuberculosis detection analysis using texture features on CXRs images",2019,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most common diseases in developing countries such as Indonesia. TB disease oftenly attacks the human lungs due to its high oxygen pressure. The basic characteristics of TB-infected lungs are in the form of wounds, which change its texture and shape. The common detection method is by comparing the X-ray thoracic image with the tuberculin skin test (TST) and fast acid staining methods. This diagnosis method is often constrained by the availability of radiologists in the health facilities. To overcome such situation, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool is required to assist the doctor read the X-ray images easily. In this paper, a complementary detection method is proposed by using a chest X-ray (CXR) image to assist the diagnosis process. In current method, the image is segmented to reduce unnecessary parts prior to preprocessing step. We use a texture-based feature approach for detection purpose because most of the common examination methods for abnormality detection on CXRs is by analyzing the change of textural (content) CXR. In our texture approach, we use texture-based statistical properties on the histogram's intensity. Some features that are used in this approach including Mean, Standard Deviation, Smoothness, Entropy, Root Mean Square (RMS), Variance, Kurtosis, Skewness, and Inverse Difference Moment (IDM). As a result of simulation, it indicates that CXR images can be well segmented to localize the focus area, allowing to the features can be extracted from the CXR image for further detection process. The obtained accuracy is about 93.94% and 92.86%, respectively for Shenzhen-Chest X-ray dataset and Montgomery County-Chest X-ray dataset. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Impact of smoking on frequency and spectrum of K-RAS and EGFR mutations in treatment naive indonesian lung cancer patients",2019,"Background: Indonesia has the highest cigarette consumption in the world. We explored the clinical impact of smoking on the prevalence of EGFR and K-RAS mutations and survival in this prospective study. Methods: 143 treatment naive lung cancer patients were recruited from Persahabatan Hospital, a national tertiary hospital. DNA from cytological specimens had been extracted and genotyped for both EGFR and K-RAS mutations using a combination of PCR high resolution melting, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and direct DNA sequencing. Results: EGFR mutation frequency in never smokers (NS) and ever smokers (ES) were 75% and 56% (p = 0.0401), respectively. In this cohort, the overall K-RAS mutation rate was 7%. Neither gender nor smoking history were associated with K-RAS mutation significantly. However, K-RAS transversion mutations were more common in male ES than transition mutations. Smoking history did not affect EGFR and K-RAS mutation frequencies in women. Concurrent EGFR/K-RAS mutation rate was 2.8% (4 of 143 patients). Four out of 91 EGFR mutation positive patients (4.4%) had simultaneous K-RAS mutation. Conclusions: In region where cigarette consumption is prevalent, smoking history affected frequencies of EGFR and K-RAS mutations, mainly in males. ? 2019 Masykura et al.","epidermal growth factor receptor; K ras protein; adult; aged; Article; cancer survival; cigarette smoking; controlled study; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; EGFR gene; exon; female; gene frequency; gene mutation; human; Indonesian; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mutation rate; oncogene K ras; prevalence; restriction fragment length polymorphism; sex difference"
"Mathematical analysis of a tuberculosis transmission model with vaccination in an age structured population",2019,"This article presents a mathematical model of Tuberculosis (TB) transmission considering BCG vaccination in an age- structured population. We used several strategies to simulate the TB dynamic and evaluate the potential impact on active TB. We developed a deterministic compartmental model where the population was distributed into seven compartments, i.e., susceptible individuals that can be vaccinated (S 1 ) and can't be vaccinated (S 2 ), vaccinated (V), slow (L) and fast (E) exposed, infectious (I), and recovery (R). The mathematical model analysis was done by determining the equilibrium points, the Basic Reproduction Number (R 0 ) of the model, and analysing the stability of the equilibrium point. Some numeric interpretations were given by sensitivity vaccination parameters and percentage vaccine protection to the value of R 0 and autonomous model simulations. We find that to reach TB free condition is not enough by maximising one of the vaccination parameters for newborn, adults or percentage vaccine protection. We also find that vaccination into the adult population is more effective to suppress TB spread rather than newborn. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Family experience in facilitating adolescents during self-identity development in ex-localization in Indonesia",2019,"Background: Self-identity is a personal reflection that is consistent and covers various individual aspects, such as job/career, spirituality, relations, intellectuality, sexuality, culture, interests, personality, and physical identity. The increasing level of juvenile delinquency worldwide, including in Indonesia, is a manifestation of unsuccessful identity development in adolescents. Self-identity development is inseparable from family influence. This study aimed to explore the experiences of families in facilitating their adolescents during self-identity development while living in ex-localization. Methods: This study used a descriptive qualitative design and involved 12 participants. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: This study resulted in five themes: the identity achievement of adolescents living in ex-localization is similar to that of adolescents in general; the domination of external barriers during identity achievement; ex-localization as a stressor; families' efforts to facilitate their adolescents during identity achievement; and family expectations for the future. Conclucions: This study highlights the importance of improving family awareness of adolescents' identity achievement when living in ex-localization with the help of nursing mental health professionals. ? 2019 The Author(s).","achievement; adolescent; article; awareness; clinical article; expectation; female; human; human experiment; identity; Indonesia; interview; juvenile delinquency; male; mental health care personnel; nursing; thematic analysis"
"The role of two human milk oligosaccharides, 2'-fucosyllactose and lacto-N-neotetraose, in infant nutrition",2019,"Human breast milk contains numerous biomolecules. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are the third most abundant component of breast milk, after lactose and lipids. Amongst the synthetized HMOs, 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) are widely studied and are considered safe for infant nutrition. Several studies have reported the health benefits of HMOs, which include modulation of the intestinal microbiota, anti-adhesive effect against pathogens, modulation of the intestinal epithelial cell response, and development of the immune system. The amount and diversity of HMOs are determined by the genetic background of the mothers (HMO secretors or non-secretors). The non-secretor mothers secrete lower HMOs than secretor mothers. The breastfed infants of secretor mothers gain more health benefit than those of non-secretor mothers. In conclusion, supplementation of infant formula with 2'-FL and LNnT is a promising innovation for infant nutrition. ? 2019 by The Korean Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition.",""
"Assessment of cognitive and motor skills in Parkinson's disease by a robotic object hitting game",2019,"Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experience various symptoms including extrapyramidal motor disturbances and cognitive impairments, which cause difficulties in daily life. However, PD patients have rarely been studied under realistic task situations that require high-level interaction of cognitive and motor skills. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of cognitive and motor factors to the performance of PD patients under high cognitive and kinematic loads. Twenty-six PD patients and 14 control subjects participated in the study. The PD patients performed a task involving hitting targets and avoiding distractors in levodopa On and Off states. A robotic manipulandum device recorded the numbers of target and distractor hits and hand kinematics, including movement area and speed. Performance on standard cognitive batteries and the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores were examined. The results indicated that the PD patients hit significantly fewer targets and more distractors than did the controls (p < 0.05). In PD patients, the average hand speed was slower and the area of hand movement was smaller than those of the control subjects (p < 0.001). Levodopa significantly increased the average hand speed and movement area (p < 0.01), but levodopa had an insignificant effect on the number of correct targets hit and erroneous distractor hits. The scores of cognitive batteries predicted the performance with regard to both targets hit and distractor avoidance. Our results were indicative of a dynamic interaction between cognitive and kinematic skills while the PD patients performed a virtual reality game. Single-dose levodopa enhanced kinematic capacity, and the global intelligence level predicted game performance.

"Evaluating the acceptability of a co-produced and co-delivered mental health public engagement festival: Mental Health Matters, Jakarta, Indonesia",2019,"Background: Public engagement events are an important early strategy in developing a meaningful research agenda, which is more impactful and beneficial to the population. Evidence indicates the potential of such activities to promote mental health literacy. However, this has not yet been explored in Indonesia. Aim: This paper describes a mental health public engagement festival carried out in Indonesia in November 2018 and uses evaluation data to consider the acceptability and use of such activities in Indonesia in the future. Method: Evaluation data was collected from 324 of the 737 people who attended a six-day mental health festival comprising 18 events including public lectures, film screenings, arts activities, exercise classes and panel discussions. Attendees were asked to evaluate the festival in terms of its quality, benefits and areas for improvement. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the evaluation data. 87 service users, carers, academics and professionals also engaged in a research prioritisation exercise to collaboratively determine mental health research priorities for Indonesia. Results: Participants evaluated the festival extremely positively with a significant majority (92%) rating the quality of the festival as good or excellent. Attendees reported an increase in their understanding of mental health issues and identified intended behaviour change including an increased propensity for future engagement with mental health research. Key strengths of the festival included the central role of patients, carers and the local community in the design and delivery of the festival which promoted emotional engagement and development of shared understanding and the use of international experts which in attendees' opinion further enhanced the credibility of festival activities. Conclusion: This manuscript indicates that a co-produced mental health public engagement festival is a potentially acceptable way to increase awareness of mental health in Indonesian populations. Future festivals should be larger in scope and target men, older people and the general public to maximise benefit and incorporate rigorous evaluation of effectiveness. ? 2019 The Author(s).",""
"Modified total humeral replacement on unusual osteosarcoma of the humerus: A case report",2019,"Introduction: Osteosarcoma of the humerus is an unusual case. In order to salvage the limb, resection followed with total humeral replacement is preferred. In situations where those prostheses are not available, a technique of modified total humeral replacement could be used. Case presentation: A 20-year-old female patient came with osteosarcoma of the right humerus accompanied by pathological humeral shaft fracture, with the onset of six months. The lesion extended along the proximal to distal part of humerus. The patient underwent a neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery and a limb salvage surgery by wide excision of the humerus and reconstruction using modified total humeral replacement was performed. Modifications to the shoulder hemiarthoplasty and total elbow prostheses were made, so both prostheses could join as one unit. Discussion: After the surgery, no disturbances of hand function were seen, and functional outcome was evaluated by using Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score (MSTS)score with score of 83% (excellent). After 3 years of follow up, patient could work and resume daily activity with improved MSTS score. There were neither sign of tumor recurrence nor distant metastasis on follow up. Conclusion: Total Humeral Replacement for the treatment of humerus malignancy was feasible by using this modification. This procedure yielded good functional outcome. ? 2019 The Authors","cisplatin; doxorubicin; adult; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; case report; clinical article; daily life activity; female; follow up; functional assessment; hand function; human; humerus; humerus shaft fracture; limb salvage; multiple cycle treatment; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteosarcoma; positron emission tomography; priority journal; scoring system; surgical technique; treatment outcome; young adult"
"Doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with Poorer Five-Year Survival in patients with locally advanced breast cancer: A retrospective single-center study in Indonesia",2019,"One of the therapeutic modalities used to improve survival rate in breast cancer is neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which generally follows a doxorubicin-based regimen for patients with locally advanced breast cancer treated at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital (CMGR). Five-year survival rates with doxorubicin-based versus non-doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer are not known. To determine five-year overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer who underwent doxorubicin or non-doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy at CMGR between 2011 and 2016. Clinical data of a total of 236 patients with locally advanced breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy at CMGR during the study period were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Five-year OS rates were 37% and 48.9% in locally advanced breast cancer patients administered doxorubicin- and non-doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. The probability of death was 1.38 times greater in locally advanced breast cancer patients receiving doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.946-2.026] after controlling for lymphatic vascular invasion, clinical response, clinical stage, radiotherapy, histopathology, grade, and menopause status. Lymphatic vascular invasion had the greatest hazard ratio, at 4.74 (95% CI: 3.046-7.361). Five-year OS was higher in patients treated with non-doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"Influence of the combination of pasak bumi root and propolis extracts on parasitemia levels in mice infected with plasmodium berghei",2019,"Objective: Malaria infection remains a global concern due to increasing resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapy. This study examined the antimalarial effects of propolis extract alone and in combination with pasak bumi root extract. Methods: In the study, 30 mice were divided into six groups including two control groups, two groups of mice treated with propolis alone at concentrations of 90 and 180 mg/kg body weight (BW), and two combination groups of mice treated with 90 or 180 mg/kg BW propolis in combination with 60 or 75 mg/kg BW pasak bumi, respectively. Plasmodium berghei 2% was injected into each mouse, and blood smears were prepared after 8 days to assess parasitemia. Results: The results revealed no significant difference in parasitemia levels between the positive control and the two combination groups (p=0.136 and 0.289, respectively). However, superior growth inhibition (GI) results were observed in the combination groups (97.97% and 97.83%, respectively) than in the propolis monotherapy groups, whereas better outcomes were observed in the positive control group (98.63% GI) than in the propolis monotherapy groups (23.88% and 51.66%, respectively). Conclusion: These results illustrate that combination therapy is superior to propolis monotherapy in inhibiting parasitemia. ? 2019 The Authors.","antimalarial agent; dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine; Eurycoma longifolia extract; plant extract; propolis extract; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; antimalarial activity; Article; controlled study; erythrocyte; Eurycoma; Eurycoma longifolia; growth inhibition; malaria; monotherapy; mouse; nonhuman; parasitemia; plant root; Plasmodium berghei"
"Fear of recurrence predictors among Indonesian gynecological cancer survivors",2019,"Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is the most common psychological issue amongst gynecological cancer survivors, and yet it remains unexplored, especially in developing countries such as Indonesia. Hence, this study aimed to identify the predictive factors of FCR among gynecological cancer survivors in Indonesia. A descriptive cross-sectional design was used. Women diagnosed with gynecological cancer, who had completed primary treatment were recruited from a referral hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Data were collected using a demographic and disease-related questionnaire and the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory. Pearson's correlations test, t-test, and linear regression analysis were performed. A total of 114 women participated in this study. Age was the strongest predictor of FCR in the domains of severity, psychological distress, insights, and reassurance. Marital status and type of treatment strongly predicted the FCR domains of functional impairment and coping strategies, respectively (P < .05). The findings of this study indicate the importance of patient characteristics while addressing the issue of FCR among gynecological cancer survivors. Further studies aimed at understanding FCR among gynecological cancer survivors may provide insight into the aspects of this condition that necessitate more attention. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"Development of antibody anti-FimC-Salmonella typhi as a detection kit model of typhoid diseases by antigen capture approach",2019,"Typhoid fever is a world health problem, with 200,000 recorded death annually in developing countries. The discovery of new drug discovery and detection methods for typhoid is still continuing. In previous research, the 31 kilo Dalton (kDa)recombinant protein Fim-C-S typhi was successfully expressed. It was also reported that the recombinant protein Fim-C-S. typhi could induce the occurrence of antibodies. This study aims to further develop anti-Fim-C-S. typhi antibodies as a detection tool. The sensitivity evaluated by western immunoblotting analysis indicated that anti-Fim-C-S. typhi antibodies can significantly recognize its antigen at a minimum level of 0.125 μg. The specificity evaluation of anti-FimC-S. typhi antibodies against S. typhi bacteria extract protein showed that anti-Fim-C-S. typhi antibodies could recognize S. typhi extract protein at ± 29 KDa and ±60 kDa. In addition, anti-Fim-C-S. typhi antibody did not recognize healthy blood extract proteins. Simulation in healthy blood samples containing bacterial antigen S. typhi and recombinant antigen Fim-C-S. typhi produce bands of 29 kDa, 31 kDa and 60 kDa have been also studied. It can be concluded that anti-Fim-C-S. typhi antibodies can be used in the development of prototype detection tool. The results from this study are expected to provide a foundation to the development of a detection methods for S. typhi that are sensitive, specific, safe and simple. ? 2019",""
"A biclustering procedure using BicBin algorithm for HIV-1 human protein interaction database in NCBI",2019,"The objective of establishing the HIV-1 Human Interaction Database (HHPID) in the NCBI that is to encourage the scientists to produce more publications. The database collates two types of interactions from the published reports - protein in- teractions and replication interactions. One of the growing up data mining technique is bioinformatics is biclustering. The BicBin algorithm is one of the biclustering method to a binary matrix. We propose a systematic procedure to make biclusters to the HHPID using BicBin algorithm. First, we select the HIV-1 proteins, the human proteins, and the interaction keywords from HHPID to model the interaction as a bipartite graph. The Keywords are divided into three classes based on the direction of the interactions and then separated them into two binary matrices, i.e., positive and negative matrix. The binary matrices then become the input to the BicBin algorithm. The algorithm outputs many biclusters. The user sets the input parameter α and β to control the search area in each binary matrix. The parameter p 1 is used to control the density of the biclusters. Then, the algorithm is iterated by parameter I. We set α = 0.5, β = 0.5, p 1 = 1, and I = 600 in our procedure. ? 2019 Author(s).",""

"Adult-onset Still's Disease as a Differential Diagnosis in Prolonged Fever: Diagnosis and Treatment Experience",2019,"Adult onset Still's disease is a rare systemic disease that may involve many organs and may mimick many disease such as infection, autoimmune disease, and also malignancy. The diagnostic approach and treatment strategies have not been well established due to its rarity; however, there are some diagnostic criteria that may help. We present a case of 36-year old man who experienced high prolonged fever which firstly thought as infection. He also had unilateral wrist and knee joint pain and maculopapular rash. Laboratory examination showed high leukocytes count with elevated polymorphonuclear neutrophil count, high platelet count, high ferritin level, and negative results of many infection markers (typhoid antibody, procalcitonin, malaria test, blood culture, urine culture, IgM pneumonia, ASTO, syphilis test, antiHIV, HBsAg, antiHCV, etc). Chest X-ray, joint X-ray, ultrasonography, and echocardiography showed normal result. The patient was then diagnosed with Adult-onset Still's disease and received intravenous methylprednisolone and the fever was disappeared in 3 days. Six months later the arthralgia appeared again, methotrexate was administered and the pain was then relieved.","methylprednisolone; adult; adult onset Still disease; case report; complication; differential diagnosis; fever; human; intravenous drug administration; male; radiography; Administration, Intravenous; Adult; Diagnosis, Differential; Fever; Humans; Male; Methylprednisolone; Radiography; Still's Disease, Adult-Onset"
"Predictors of loneliness among the left-behind children of migrant workers in Indonesia",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to compare loneliness between the left-behind children of migrant workers and the non-left-behind ones, and identify the most significant predictors of loneliness among the left-behind children. Design/methodology/approach: Incidental sampling was performed to select 629 participants aged 11–16 from 5 schools in the rural areas of Karawang and Lombok in Indonesia. They filled in paper-and-pencil self-report inventories. Findings: Left-behind children were significantly lonelier than their counterparts were. Emotional loneliness was more affected by parental absence compared to social loneliness. Left-behind children would be more susceptible to experience loneliness if they had more access to entertainment gadgets, experienced less support and intimacy from friends, had been left by their migrant parents more than once, were female, had low self-esteem, experienced emotional difficulties and rarely communicated with their parents. Research limitations/implications: Qualitative research was needed to provide more elaborative explanation about the findings. Practical implications: Parents needed to consider the psychological cost and benefit of working abroad to their children. Governments could intervene by limiting the duration and frequency of work among the migrant workers. Social implications: Some beneficial implications to prevent and reduce loneliness among left-behind children were provided, such as by maintaining the frequency and quality of communication with the children, motivating and guiding the children to interact with their peers and spend less time on entertainment gadgets, as well as encouraging the children to engage in several positive activities to enhance their self-esteem. Originality/value: This study enriched the understanding about complex relationship between parental presence and adolescents’ mental health despite the fact that adolescents seemed to be more interested in relationships with peers. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","adolescent; article; child; controlled study; female; friend; government; human; human experiment; human tissue; Indonesia; intimacy; loneliness; major clinical study; migrant worker; qualitative research; rural area; sampling; school child; self esteem; self report"
"Client and Provider Perspectives on Antiretroviral Treatment Uptake and Adherence Among People Who Inject Drugs in Indonesia, Ukraine and Vietnam: HPTN 074",2019,"HIV-infected people who inject drugs (PWID) have low uptake of HIV services, increasing the risk of transmission to uninfected injection or sexual partners and the likelihood of AIDS-related deaths. HPTN 074 is a vanguard study assessing the feasibility of an integrated intervention to facilitate treatment as prevention to PWID in Indonesia, Ukraine, and Vietnam. We describe barriers to and facilitators of ART uptake and adherence among PWID. We conducted in-depth interviews with 62 participants, including 25 providers and 37 PWID at baseline across all sites. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated into English and coded in NVivo for analysis. Matrices were developed to identify emergent themes and patterns. Overall, differences between provider and PWID perspectives were greater than differences in cross-site perspectives. Providers and PWID recognized clinic access, financial barriers, side effects, and lack of information about HIV testing and ART enrollment as barriers to ART. However, providers tended to emphasize individual level barriers to ART, such as lack of motivation due to drug use, whereas PWID highlighted health systems barriers, such as clinic hours and financial burden, fears, and side effects. Providers did not mention stigma as a barrier though their language reflected stereotypes about drug users. The differences between provider and PWID perspectives suggest a gap in providers’ understanding of PWID. This misunderstanding has implications for patient-provider interactions that may affect PWID willingness to access care or adhere to ART. Lessons learned from this study will be important as countries with a significant HIV burden among PWID design and implement programs to engage HIV-infected PWID in care and treatment. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","antiretrovirus agent; adult; complication; drug use; epidemiology; ethnology; feasibility study; female; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Indonesia; interview; male; medication compliance; middle aged; motivation; psychology; sexuality; social stigma; substance abuse; Ukraine; Viet Nam; Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Attitude of Health Personnel; Drug Users; Feasibility Studies; Female; Health Personnel; HIV Infections; Humans; Indonesia; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Motivation; Sexual Partners; Social Stigma; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Ukraine; Vietnam"
"Polymorphisms in CAMKK2 associate with susceptibility to sensory neuropathy in HIV patients treated without stavudine",2019,"HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is a debilitating neurological complication of HIV infection potentiated by the antiretroviral drug stavudine. While stavudine is no longer used, HIV-SN now affects around 15% of HIV+ Indonesians. Here, we investigate whether polymorphisms within the P2X-block (P2X4R, P2X7R, CAMKK2) and/or ANAPC5 mark susceptibility to HIV-SN in this setting. As polymorphisms in these genes associated with HIV-SN in African HIV patients receiving stavudine, the comparison can identify mechanisms independent of stavudine. HIV patients who had never used stavudine (n = 202) attending clinics in Jakarta were screened for neuropathy using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen. Open-array technology was used to type 48 polymorphisms spanning the four genes. Haplotypes were derived for each gene using fastPHASE. Haplogroups were constructed with median-joining methods. Multivariable models optimally predicting HIV-SN were based on factors achieving p &lt; 0.2 in bivariate analyses. Minor alleles of three co-inherited polymorphisms in CAMKK2 (rs7975295*C, rs1560568*A, rs1132780*T) associated with a reduced prevalence of HIV-SN individually and after adjusting for lower CD4 T cell count and viremia (p = 0.0002, pseudo R2 = 0.11). The optimal model for haplotypes linked HIV-SN with viremia and lower current CD4 T cell count, plus CAMKK2 haplotypes 6 and 11 and P2X7R haplotypes 2 and 12 (p = 0.0002; pseudo R2 = 0.11). CAMKK2 haplogroup A (includes 16 haplotypes and all instances of rs7975295*C, rs1560568*A, rs1132780*T) associated with reduced rates of HIV-SN (p = 0.02, OR = 0.43 CI = 0.21–0.88). These findings support a protective role for these three alleles, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-SN that is independent of stavudine. ? 2019, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.","anaphase promoting complex subunit 5; calcium calmodulin kinase kinase 2; genomic DNA; protein kinase; purinergic P2X4 receptor; purinergic P2X7 receptor; stavudine; unclassified drug; virus RNA; adult; allele; antiretroviral therapy; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; cohort analysis; disease predisposition; DNA polymorphism; genetic susceptibility; genotype; haplogroup; haplotype; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; risk reduction; sensory neuropathy; single nucleotide polymorphism"
"Mobile Phone-Based Intervention in Hypertension Management",2019,"Hypertension is known as the major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Antihypertensive agents are directed to prevent many of the harmful effects of elevated blood pressure, yet medication nonadherence hinders the effectiveness of these therapies. Nowadays the use of mobile phone has vastly spread among communities. The rapid adoption of smartphone technology creates a promising and interesting platform to overcome medication nonadherence. This review aimed to critically appraise whether mobile phone-based interventions are effective in increasing adherence in hypertensive patients. Literature searching was done in 3 databases: PubMed, Cochrane, and ProQuest. Findings were narrowed down using selection criteria. Relevant studies were to be critically appraised based on the guideline from Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford University. We found that the reduction of blood pressure in participants who were given reminder through mobile phones was greater in comparison to control: systolic (94.4% vs 41.2%, p 0.003), diastolic (94.4% vs 76.5%, p0.04). Patients who were nonadherent at baseline benefit more from mobile phone-based intervention in comparison to adherent patients at baseline: RR 2.3 (95% CI: 1.4-4.4, p<0.001) vs RR 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.6, p<0.05). In conclusion, mobile phone-based interventions were effective in increasing medication adherence in hypertensive patients. Clinical practice guidelines should consider this nonpharmacological method for a better blood pressure regulation. ? 2019 Nobian Andre et al.","antihypertensive agent; adult; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure regulation; cardiovascular mortality; case report; clinical article; consciousness disorder; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; drug efficacy; elevated blood pressure; evidence based medicine; female; human; hypertension; hypertensive patient; morbidity; nausea; patient compliance; physical examination; practice guideline; Review; risk factor; slurred speech; systolic blood pressure; visual analog scale; visual disorder; vomiting"
"Tree Risk Assessment using VTA at Universitas Indonesia",2019,"Universitas Indonesia's urban forest is a part of Universitas Indonesia's campus area, which covered 192 hectares from total 320 hectares campus area. Universitas Indonesia as a green campus has many green open spaces that distributed throughout campus and consists of several tree species. The age of the most vegetation in both urban forest and green open space has been 30 years old. This condition required routine management to evaluate tree health and risk. Some routine management has been conducted which consist of pruning and eliminating dead trees followed by replanting of new trees. This management aims to reduce the risk posed by trees related to community safety and for keeping environmental sustainability. The method that we used to assess the tree risk were visual tree risk assessment (VTA) based on biological characteristics of the risked tree. The result showed that there are four major species that need more routine management and had a higher percentage of managed trees during 2018. Those species were Acacia mangium, Hevea brasiliensis, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Delonix regia. ? 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Barium compounds; Health risks; Iodine compounds; Risk assessment; Sulfur compounds; Sustainable development; Acacia mangium; Biological characteristic; Community safety; Environmental sustainability; Green campus; Hevea brasiliensis; Tree species; Urban forests; Forestry"
"Evaluation of work posture with quick exposure check (Qec) at workstations for toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and azodicarbonamide reactions in the chemical processing industry",2019,"Poor work posture is a major cause of work-related skeletal muscle disorders and is often found in the chemical industry. The highest risk for skeletal muscle disorders due to work is in the upper arm and wrist. This study aims to evaluate ergonomics as a reference for assessing factors that affect skeletal muscle disorders due to work, one of which is work posture. The study uses qualitative analysis with descriptive observations of work posture in workers using Quick Exposure Check. The study was conducted at two work stations: The toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and azodicarbonamide reactions in the chemical processing industry. The two stations were chosen because they involved transport activities and presented similarities in the characteristics of the work. The results of the exposure score calculations show that the value for the shoulder/arm and back were at a very high level, with a very high risk of injury. Exposure levels at both work stations were in the range of 81–94%. This shows that further research is needed to investigate and determine immediate changes. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Catch handling evaluation of longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol) by sensory evaluation and gap assessment in Pekalongan Archipelagic Fishing Port",2019,"As perishable food, fish require a proper handling from on-boarding, unloading, marketing and processing. This handling is closely related to the effect of fish product consumption on public health, such as seafood allergy by consuming degraded longtail tuna. This species is one of the dominant catches that landed at Pekalongan Archipelagic Fishing Port. This research aimed to evaluate longtail tuna handling to ensure the standard of quality assurance and safety of fisheries products. The fish quality was scored by scale of 1 - 9. Data were collected by sensory evaluation of fish quality during unloading process. The gap was assessed by comparing the actual process and the regulation in Minister of Marine Affairs Fisheries Decision - KEPMEN KP No. 52A/2013. The result showed that the quality of longtail tuna landed in Pekalongan AFP was acceptable by 7.85. The suitability to the handling standard was poor by 64.30%. The conclusion from sensory evaluation, the quality of longtail tuna landed at Pekalongan AFP is still in compliance with the quality of Indonesian National Standard (SNI) 2729:2013, but the level of suitability of handling longtail tuna has not complied with the regulation in Decision of Minister Marine Affairs Fisheries (MMAF) - KEPMEN KP No. 52A/2013. ?

"Cardiovascular disease-related mortality and factors associated with cardiovascular events in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD)",2019,"Objectives: With aging of the HIV-positive population, cardiovascular disease (CVD) increasingly contributes to morbidity and mortality. We investigated CVD-related and other causes of death (CODs) and factors associated with CVD in a multi-country Asian HIV-positive cohort. Methods: Patient data from 2003–2017 were obtained from the Therapeutics, Research, Education and AIDS Training in Asia (TREAT Asia) HIV Observational Database (TAHOD). We included patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with > 1 day of follow-up. Cumulative incidences were plotted for CVD-related, AIDS-related, non-AIDS-related, and unknown CODs, and any CVD (i.e. fatal and nonfatal). Competing risk regression was used to assess risk factors of any CVD. Results: Of 8069 patients with a median follow-up of 7.3 years [interquartile range (IQR) 4.4–10.7 years], 378 patients died [incidence rate (IR) 6.2 per 1000 person-years (PY)], and this total included 22 CVD-related deaths (IR 0.36 per 1000 PY). Factors significantly associated with any CVD event (IR 2.2 per 1000 PY) were older age [sub-hazard ratio (sHR) 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36–3.58 for age 41–50 years; sHR 5.52; 95% CI 3.43–8.91 for ? 51 years, compared with < 40 years], high blood pressure (sHR 1.62; 95% CI 1.04–2.52), high total cholesterol (sHR 1.89; 95% CI 1.27–2.82), high triglycerides (sHR 1.55; 95% CI 1.02–2.37) and high body mass index (BMI) (sHR 1.66; 95% CI 1.12–2.46). CVD crude IRs were lower in the later ART initiation period and in lower middle- and upper middle-income countries. Conclusions: The development of fatal and nonfatal CVD events in our cohort was associated with older age, and treatable risk factors such as high blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol and BMI. Lower CVD event rates in middle-income countries may indicate under-diagnosis of CVD in Asian-Pacific resource-limited settings. ? 2019 British HIV Association","antiretrovirus agent; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; accident; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; aging; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Asian; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cause of death; CD4 lymphocyte count; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; drug overdose; female; follow up; groups by age; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypertension; incidence; infection; liver disease; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle income country; obesity; outcome assessment; priority journal; risk assessment; suicide; violence; virus load"

"Feasibility of Qualitative Testing of BCR-ABL and JAK2 V617F in Suspected Myeloproliperative Neoplasm (MPN) Using RT-PCR Reversed Dot Blot Hybridization (RT-PCR RDB)",2019,"Background: Defining the presence of BCR-ABL transcript in suspected myeloproliferative neoplasm is essential in establishing chronic myeloid leukemia. In the absence of BCR-ABL, the conventional diagnostic algorithm recommends JAK2 V617F mutation testing to support diagnosis of other MPN diseases such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. In certain cases of thrombocythemia, simultaneous upfront testing of both BCR-ABL and JAK2 may be desirable. We wanted to test the feasibility of multiplex detection of BCR-ABL transcript variants and JAK2 V617F mutation simultaneously using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based reverse dot-blot hybridization (RDB) method. Material and Methods: Separate biotinylated RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify specific BCR-ABL transcripts and JAK2 V617F mutant alleles. Specific hybridization of RT-PCR products with arrays of membrane-bound probes followed by colorimetric development would allow simultaneous visualization of BCR-ABL and/or JAK2 mutant transcripts in a given specimen. To validate the RDB method, we used cDNA specimens previously referred to our laboratory for routine clinical testing of BCR-ABL and/or JAK2. Results: The limit of detection or analytical sensitivity of the RDB method using cDNA specimens was 0.5% and 6.25% in detecting BCR-ABL and JAK2 mutant transcripts, respectively. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity to detect BCR-ABL and JAK2 were 100% and 92.3% (N = 38); and 100% and 100% (N = 27), respectively. RDB also detected BCR-ABL transcripts in 22% of JAK2 V617F mutation-positive samples (N = 14). Conclusions: RT-PCR RDB is a promising qualitative multiplex method to detect BCR-ABL and JAK2 mutant transcripts simultaneously. In this study, we described the feasibility of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reverse dot-blot hybridization for BCR-ABL and JAK2 co-testing in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. We have demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR reverse dot-blot hybridization method are similar to routine methods. This method is suitable for laboratories in developing countries. We are hopeful that our results would contribute to simplify the diagnostic workup of suspected myeloproliferative neoplasms, especially in the developing countries with limited access to real time RT-PCR-based tests. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","BCR ABL protein; complementary DNA; Janus kinase 2; Article; cancer diagnosis; chronic myeloid leukemia; colorimetry; controlled study; developing country; dot hybridization; feasibility study; HL-60 cell line; human; K-562 cell line; limit of detection; myelofibrosis; myeloid metaplasia; myeloproliferative neoplasm; oligonucleotide probe; polycythemia vera; predictive value; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; thrombocythemia"
"The effects of soursop supplementation on blood pressure, serum uric acid, and kidney function in a prehypertensive population in accordance with the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline",2019,"Soursop consumption is beneficial to health, but there have been few clinical studies observing its benefit in human subjects. We investigated the effects of soursop supplementation on blood pressure (BP), serum uric acid (SUA), and kidney function. A total of 143 subjects were included in this randomized controlled trial. Subjects were selected from a prehypertension population dataset (n = 4190) in the “Mlati Study Database” in 2007 (using the Joint National Committee (JNC) 7 guideline). After 10 years, 143 samples showed essential prehypertension combined with high-normal SUA levels. Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups, i.e., the treatment and control group. For a 3-month period, the treatment group was given 2 × 100 g soursop fruit juice per day and the control group was not treated. Using the JNC 7 guideline, the treatment group showed a significantly lower mean systolic BP after being adjusted by three times of examinations (baseline, week 6 and 12) compared with the control group. Furthermore, the control group was more likely to have prehypertension, hypertension, and high-normal and high SUA levels after 6 weeks, as well as after 12 weeks, compared with the treatment group. An additional analysis using the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline for subjects with stage 1 hypertension showed results similar to that using the JNC 7 guideline. Moreover, it indicated that mean of both systolic and diastolic BP of the treatment group was significantly lower compared with the control group after 12 weeks of treatment. We conclude that soursop supplementation can lower BP and SUA levels. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",""
"Maternal height as an determinant factors of children not to be stunting until age 59 months",2019,"Background: Early growth disorders influence the occurrence of stunting, which in turn is at higher risk of obesity at later ages. Maternal height, birth weight and length birth might affect the child growth not to be stunting. Objective: We examined the proportion and hazard risk the resilience not to be stunting of children since birth to 59 months of age according to birth weight, length birth and maternal height controlled with other factors. Method: We have performed Life table and Cox regression on 859 children 59 months age from Bogor child growth and development cohort study. Child growth and covariates data were collected every month since infant birth until the age of 59 months. Results: Maternal height is a significant risk for children stunting until age 59 months after adjusting by sex, exclusive breastfeeding, immunisation, birth weight, length birth, gestation age, maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy weight. The proportion of children who survive did not become stunting of the mother with height 150 cm or above (49 per cent) more significant than children of the mother with a height below 150 cm (28 per cent). The proportion of children which are not stunting at 23 months of age was no different than at 59 months of age for all risk factors. Conclusion: Pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal height, birth weight and length birth is a determinant factors child who survives not to be stunted from birth to 59 months. Suggestion: Nutrition intervention for children with the mother’s height less than 150 cm should be done since fetus until the age of child 59 months especially for thousand days. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer in the Asia Pacific region: ‘real-world’ consideration of results from the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2017",2019,"Objective: The Asia Pacific Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APAC APCCC 2018) brought together 20 experts from 15 APAC countries to discuss the real-world application of consensus statements from the second APCCC held in St Gallen in 2017 (APCCC 2017). Findings: Differences in genetics, environment, lifestyle, diet and culture are all likely to influence the management of advanced prostate cancer in the APAC region when compared with the rest of the world. When considering the strong APCCC 2017 recommendation for the use of upfront docetaxel in metastatic castration-na?ve prostate cancer, the panel noted possible increased toxicity in Asian men receiving docetaxel, which would affect this recommendation in the APAC region. Although androgen receptor-targeting agents appear to be well tolerated in Asian men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, access to these drugs is very limited for financial reasons across the region. The meeting highlighted that cost and access to contemporary treatments and technologies are key factors influencing therapeutic decision-making in the APAC region. Whilst lower cost/older treatments and technologies may be an option, issues of culture and patient or physician preference mean, these may not always be acceptable. Although generic products can reduce cost in some countries, costs may still be prohibitive for lower-income patients or communities. The panellists noted the opportunity for a coordinated approach across the APAC region to address issues of access and cost. Developments in technologies and treatments are presenting new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Differences in genetics and epidemiology affect the side-effect profiles of some drugs and influence prescribing. Conclusions: As the field continues to evolve, collaboration across the APAC region will be important to facilitate relevant research and collection and appraisal of data relevant to APAC populations. In the meantime, the APAC APCCC 2018 meeting highlighted the critical importance of a multidisciplinary team-based approach to treatment planning and care, delivery of best-practice care by clinicians with appropriate expertise, and the importance of patient information and support for informed patient choice. ? 2018 The Authors BJU International ? 2018 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","abiraterone; androgen receptor; docetaxel; enzalutamide; generic drug; platinum complex; prednisone; prescription drug; abiraterone; androstane derivative; antiandrogen; antineoplastic agent; docetaxel; advanced cancer; Asia; Asia Pacific region; cancer radiotherapy; cancer research; cancer therapy; castration resistant prostate cancer; clinical practice; consensus; cultural anthropology; diet; drug targeting; environment; financial deficit; genetics; health care access; health care cost; health care delivery; health care quality; human; lifestyle; medical decision making; medical expert; metastasis; patient information; patient preference; physician attitude; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; Review; treatment planning; consensus development; developing country; economics; Far East; lymph node dissection; male; metastasis; multimodality cancer therapy; Pacific islands; pathology; prostate tumor; radiotherapy; risk factor; Southeast Asia; supply and distribution; Androgen Antagonists; Androstenes; Antineoplastic Agents; Asia, Southeastern; Combined Modality Therapy; Consensus; Developing Countries; Docetaxel; Far East; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Male; Neoplasm Metastasis; Oceania; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiotherapy; Risk Factors"

"Body length prediction using ulnar length for children aged 0–23 months in East Jakarta",2019,"The body length measurement is important for monitoring the growth and development of children; however, the length is frequently measured incorrectly in children under 24 months old. Errors of 60–70% can be caused by child-related factors, especially their movement. Therefore, surrogate anthropometric measurements are required when the actual body length measurement is unobtainable and/or unreliable. This cross-sectional study was designed to develop a body length prediction model for children based on the ulna length by using liner regression. From May through June of 2018, eighty-eight boys and ninety-two girls aged 0–23 months old from several integrated children’s health centres in East Jakarta, Indonesia were recruited for this study. The study results showed that there were very strong correlations between the right ulna length and the body length (boys r=0.917, p?0.005; girls r=0.951, p?0.005) and the left ulna length and the body length (boys r=0.914, p?0.005; girls r=0.952, p?0.005). The equations containing the left ulna length and the age had the lowest standard error of the estimate (SEE) values, and they provided the most reliable length estimations for the boys and the girls (SEE ±1.222 cm and ±1.245 cm, respectively). Further studies with greater sample sizes that better represent each age category are needed in order to produce equations with smaller SEE values. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Carotid intima-media thickness among normoglycemia and normotension first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetes mellitus",2019,"Introduction: Theoretically, first-degree relatives (FDRs) of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are predisposed to have earlier and more severe atherosclerosis than non-FDR due to hereditary insulin resistance. A previous study reported that atherosclerotic plaques were found in 45.2% of young adults FDR of T2DM, but the study did not include non-FDR as control group. The aim of this study was to compare subclinical atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness, CIMT) between FDR of T2DM and non-FDR. Method: This was a cross-sectional study involving 16 FDR subjects and 16 age-sex matched non-FDR subjects, aged 19-40 years, with normal glucose tolerance and no hypertension. Collected data included demographic characteristic, anthropometric measurement (BMI and waist circumference), laboratory analysis (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile), and CIMT examination (using B-mode ultrasound). Results: The mean of CIMTin the FDR group was higher than that in the non-FDR group (0.44 mm vs 0.38 mm, p=0.005). After adjusting for waist circumference, BMI, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride, CIMTmaintained significant difference between FDR and non-FDR subjects. BMI and waist circumference showed moderate correlation with CIMT. Conclusion: CIMT in young adult FDR of T2DM is thicker than that in age-and sexmatched non-FDR population. ? 2019 Purnamasari et al.","glucose; hemoglobin A1c; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; biological marker; adult; age; arterial wall thickness; Article; B scan; body mass; carotid artery; carotid atherosclerosis; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; female; first-degree relative; gender; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; human; hypertension; Indonesia; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; triacylglycerol blood level; waist circumference; young adult; analysis; asymptomatic disease; atherosclerotic plaque; blood; blood pressure; carotid artery; carotid artery disease; case control study; diagnostic imaging; genetic predisposition; genetics; heredity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathology; pathophysiology; pedigree; phenotype; predictive value; risk factor; Adult; Asymptomatic Diseases; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Artery Diseases; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Heredity; Humans; Male; Pedigree; Phenotype; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Young Adult"
"Ischaemia reperfusion injury: mechanisms of progression to chronic graft dysfunction",2019,"The increasing use of extended criteria organs to meet the demand for kidney transplantation raises an important question of how the severity of early ischaemic injury influences long-term outcomes. Significant acute ischaemic kidney injury is associated with delayed graft function, increased immune-associated events and, ultimately, earlier deterioration of graft function. A comprehensive understanding of immediate molecular events that ensue post-ischaemia and their potential long-term consequences are key to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Acute ischaemic injury primarily affects tubular structure and function. Depending on the severity and persistence of the insult, this may resolve completely, leading to restoration of normal function, or be sustained, resulting in persistent renal impairment and progressive functional loss. Long-term effects of acute renal ischaemia are mediated by several mechanisms including hypoxia, HIF-1 activation, endothelial dysfunction leading to vascular rarefaction, sustained pro-inflammatory stimuli involving innate and adaptive immune responses, failure of tubular cells to recover and epigenetic changes. This review describes the biological relevance and interaction of these mechanisms based on currently available evidence. ? 2018, The Author(s).","cobalt chloride; hypoxia inducible factor; transforming growth factor beta; capillary rarefaction; cell activation; delayed graft function; dendritic cell; disease association; disease course; disease severity; endothelium injury; epigenetics; fibrogenesis; gene expression; genetic transcription; human; immune response; kidney fibrosis; killer cell; lymphocyte; macrophage; neutrophil; nonhuman; priority journal; renal graft dysfunction; reperfusion injury; Review; systematic review; ureter obstruction"
"Six-month follow up of a randomized clinical trial-phase I study in Indonesian adults and children: Safety and immunogenicity of Salmonella typhi polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid (VI-DT) conjugate vaccine",2019,"Introduction There is a high global incidence of typhoid fever, with an annual mortality rate of 200,000 deaths. Typhoid fever also affects younger children, particularly in resource-limited settings in endemic countries. Typhoid vaccination is an important prevention tool against typhoid fever. However, the available polysaccharide typhoid vaccines are not recommended for children under 2 years of age. A new typhoid conjugate Vi-diphtheria toxoid (Vi-DT) vaccine has been developed for infant immunization. We aimed to define the safety and immunogenicity of the Vi-DT vaccine among adults and children in Indonesia. Methods An observational, blinded, comparative, randomized, phase I safety study in two age deescalating cohorts was conducted in East Jakarta, Indonesia, from April 2017 to February 2018. We enrolled 100 healthy subjects in 2 age groups: adults and children (18-40 and 2-5 years old). These groups were randomized into study groups (Vi-DT vaccine), and comparator groups (Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-PS) vaccine and another additional vaccine) which was administered in 4 weeks apart. Subjects were followed up to six months. Result One hundred healthy adults and children subjects completed the study. The Vi-DT and Vi-PS vaccines showed no difference in terms of intensity of any immediate local and systemic events within 30 minutes post-vaccination. Overall, pain was the most common local reaction, and muscle pain was the most common systemic reaction in the first 72 hours. No serious adverse events were deemed related to vaccine administration. The first and second doses of the Vi-DT vaccine induced seroconversion and higher geometric mean titers (GMT) in all subjects compared to that of baseline. However, in terms of GMT, the second dose of Vi-DT did not induce a booster response. Conclusion The Vi-DT vaccine is safe and immunogenic in adults and children older than two years. A single dose of the vaccine is able to produce seroconversion and high GMT in all individuals. ? 2019 Medise et al.

"Periodontal status differences between chronic periodontitis patient with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus",2019,"National Basic Health Research of Indonesia in 2013 stated there were 6.9% proportion of Indonesian population or about 12 million people suffered from diabetic mellitus. Periodontitis is the most related oral disease with diabetic mellitus, but there are still lack of studies about this relationship especially in Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to understand the comparison of periodontal status among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and non-diabetics with chronic periodontitis. The periodontal status of interest includes periodontal pockets, gingival recession, and attachment loss. A cross-sectional study method is used using 97 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 97 subjects without type 2 diabetes mellitus, sourced from medical record status in Periodontics Clinic, Dental Hospital, Faculty of Dentistry, Universitas Indonesia during 2007-2016. It was statistically analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. The results showed that there were statistically significant differences in the mean values of pocket depth, gingival recession, and attachment lost on subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with subjects without type 2 diabetes mellitus (p value < 0,05). In conclusion, there are periodontal status differences between chronic periodontitis patient with and without T2DM, with findings on deeper pocket depth, bigger gingival recession, and greater attachment lost on subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with subjects without type 2 diabetes mellitus. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"Nurse’s competence in supporting the spiritual-religious needs of patients in Indonesia",2019,"Introduction: The fulfilment of religious ritual needs is a form of spiritual nursing intervention. The main Islamic ritual is the fardhu prayer, which should not be abandoned despite illness and hospitalisation. The purpose of this study was to find out the nurse’s constraints relating to help to meet the need of conducting fardhu prayers for hospitalised patients from their experience of providing nursing care to patients. Method: This study was a qualitative, using the phenomenology approach, focusing on 8 associate nurses, 3 nurse managers and 1 participant, who was the Head of the Spiritual Counselling division. Data collection was done through a Focus Group Discussion and the data analysis used the Colaizzi method. Results: The results of the study yielded four main themes: the competence of nursing services for fardhu prayer, the availability of facilities, the perception of constraint on the patient, and limited support. Discussions: The nurses’ competency at fulfilling the spiritual needs of patients in Indonesia should be developed and fostered in order to accommodate the health needs of Indonesian society as a whole. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Public awareness of oral cancer among adults in Jakarta, Indonesia",2019,"AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the awareness of oral cancer among adults in Jakarta, Indonesia, and explore the factors influencing it. METHODS: A previously-tested questionnaire on 1000 adults in Jakarta was used in the present study. The data included sociodemographic factors and answers to assess the awareness of oral cancer, early signs and symptoms, risks factors, lifestyles, and history of dental visits. RESULTS: Only 53.2% of participants were aware of oral cancer. The level of awareness significantly differed by level of education, occupation, and experience of dental visits. Only 30% of patients had been asked about their tobacco and alcohol habits, and had been informed about the hazards of these by their dentists. All of the smokers knew that tobacco increased the risk for oral cancer. However, only a few participants considered alcohol, betel quid chewing, UV light exposure, poor diet, and genetics to play role in the development of oral cancer. Health warnings were the main source of information about oral cancer; the role of health professionals is still quite low and needs to be emphasized. CONCLUSION: Oral cancer awareness is still low among adults in Jakarta; this finding was consistent with other studies conducted in Asia. Educational material suited to particular communities is warranted. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","adolescent; adult; aged; Areca; attitude to health; awareness; cross-sectional study; drinking behavior; education; female; habit; health; human; Indonesia; lifestyle; male; middle aged; mouth tumor; occupation; questionnaire; risk factor; risk management; smokeless tobacco; smoking; tobacco; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Areca; Awareness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education; Female; Habits; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Indonesia; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Occupations; Oral Health; Risk Factors; Risk Management; Smoking; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tobacco; Tobacco, Smokeless; Young Adult"
"Effectiveness of propolis with artemisinin combination therapy in treating mice infected with plasmodium berghei",2019,"Objective: This study aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of combination treatment with propolis and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in avoiding further resistance to ACT. Methods: A total of 35 mice were injected with Plasmodium berghei and divided into six equal groups: No treatment (negative control), ACT alone (positive control), 75-mg propolis/kg body weight (BW), 150-mg propolis/kg BW, ACT with 75-mg propolis/kg BW, and ACT with 150-mg propolis/ kg BW. After 7 days of therapy, parasite density was calculated using a thin blood smear. Results: Parasite density significantly declined after combination treatment with ACT and 150-mg propolis/kg BW. Conclusion: Therapy with propolis alone showed no inhibitory effect on parasites, although its 150-mg/kg-BW dose was effective as an ACT adjuvant malaria therapy in mice. ? 2019 The Authors.","artemisinin; propolis; animal experiment; animal model; Article; blood sampling; blood smear; controlled study; drug efficacy; Giemsa stain; growth inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; parasite load; parasitemia; Plasmodium berghei; Plasmodium berghei infection"
"Effectiveness of dienogest in improving quality of life in Asian women with endometriosis (ENVISIOeN): Interim results from a prospective cohort study under real-life clinical practice",2019,"Background: Dienogest has been shown to substantially improve endometriosis-associated symptoms such as debilitating chronic pelvic pain, and in turn, health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To date, there is no data on patient-reported outcomes reflecting the real-world practice in Asia where endometriosis is a relevant health, social and economic burden. This non-interventional, multi-center, prospective study aims to investigate the influence of dienogest on HRQoL. Methods: Asian women received dienogest (2 mg/daily) and were followed for 24 months. The effectiveness of dienogest to improve HRQoL and endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP) was assessed by patient-reported outcomes. HRQoL, especially the ""pain"" domain as primary endpoint, was evaluated with the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30) questionnaire. The numeric rating scale served to determine changes in the severity of EAPP. Within the presented interim analysis (data cut-off: 2017-11-27), the mean changes in EHP-30 and EAPP scores from baseline to 6 months upon availability of the data were evaluated. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and bleeding profiles were documented. Results: Dienogest therapy decreased EHP-30 scores in all assessed domains (score 0-100, lower scores indicate better HRQoL). Primarily, the ""pain"" domain was improved in 78.4% of patients. EAPP was reduced (score 0-10, lower scores reflect less pain), highlighted by a mean reduction of the pain score by - 4.5 points. Patients with a higher EAPP score at baseline had an increased response to dienogest (- 6.2 points mean change) compared to patients with low baseline EAPP severity (- 1.4 points mean change). Both surgically and clinically diagnosed patients described comparable pain reduction, as well as women with or without prior treatment. Drug-related TEAEs were documented for 31.5% of patients, with amenorrhoea (5.9%) and metrorrhagia (5.1%) being the most common events. The bleeding pattern was changed upon dienogest, characterized by decreased normal bleeding (84.2 to 28.8%) and increased amenorrhea (3.2 to 42.9%) at 6 months. Conclusion: The data indicate an amelioration of HRQoL and EAPP upon dienogest therapy. No new safety signals were observed. Therefore, its use as first-line therapy for long-term management of debilitating and chronic endometriosis-associated pain represents an interesting option that remains to be further investigated.

"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in Asia",2019,"Background: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a global public health problem. Unfortunately, little is known about HFpEF across Asia. Methods and results: We prospectively studied clinical characteristics, echocardiographic parameters and outcomes in 1204 patients with HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ?50%) from 11 Asian regions, grouped as Northeast Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, n = 543), South Asia (India, n = 252), and Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, n = 409). Mean age was 68 ±12 years (37% were < 65 years) and 50% were women. Seventy per cent of patients had ?2 co-morbidities, most commonly hypertension (71%), followed by anaemia (57%), chronic kidney disease (50%), diabetes (45%), coronary artery disease (29%), atrial fibrillation (29%) and obesity (26%). Southeast Asian patients had the highest prevalence of all co-morbidities except atrial fibrillation, South Asians had the lowest prevalence of all co-morbidities except anaemia and obesity, and Northeast Asians had more atrial fibrillation. Left ventricular hypertrophy and concentric remodelling were most prominent among Southeast and South Asians, respectively (P < 0.001). Overall, 12.1% of patients died or were hospitalized for heart failure within 1 year. Southeast Asians were at higher risk for adverse outcomes, independent of co-morbidity burden and cardiac geometry. Conclusion: These first prospective multinational data from Asia show that HFpEF affects relatively young patients with a high burden of co-morbidities. Regional differences in types of co-morbidities, cardiac remodelling and outcomes of HFpEF across Asia have important implications for public health measures and global HFpEF trial design. ? 2018 The Authors.

"A novel diagnosis scoring model to predict invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in the intensive care unit",2019,"Objectives: To improve the quality of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) management for intensive care unit (ICU) patients using a practical diagnostic scoring model. Methods: This nested case-control study aimed to determine the incidence of IPA in 405 ICU patients, between July 2012 and June 2014, at 6 hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. Phenotypic identifications and galactomannan (GM) tests of sera and lung excreta were performed in mycology laboratory, Parasitology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia in Jakarta, Indonesia. Results: The incidence of IPA in the ICUs was 7.7% (31 of 405 patients). A scoring model used for IPA diagnosis showed 4 variables as the most potential risk factors: Lung excreta GM index (score 2), solid organ malignancy (score 2), pulmonary tuberculosis (score 2), and systemic corticosteroids (score 1). Patients were included in a high-risk group if their score was >2, and in a low-risk group if their score was <2. Conclusion: This study provides a novel diagnosis scoring model to predict IPA in ICU patients. Using this model, a more rapid diagnosis and treatment of IPA may be possible. The application of the diagnosis scoring should be preceded by specified pre-requisites. ? 2019, Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital.

"Validity and reliability of brief international cognitive assessment for multiple sclerosis (BICAMS) in Indonesia and the correlation with quality of life",2019,"Introduction. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can affect cognitive function that might interfere with quality of life. Processing speed and memory are the most common area of cognitive impairment. Cognitive evaluation in daily practice is often difficult to be performed since it needs neuropsychological expert and is time-consuming. Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) is valid and practical for cognitive evaluation. This study aims to validate BICAMS in Indonesian MS patients and healthy controls (HC) and to analyse the effect of cognitive impairment on quality of life. Methods. BICAMS, which composes Symbol Digits Modalities Test (SDMT), California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II), and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), was translated and cross-culturally adapted to Indonesian from the original BICAMS and then administered to 40 Indonesian MS patients and 66 HC matched by sex, age, and education. Test-retest reliability was performed on 16-MS patients and 42 HC. Quality of life was measured using Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL-54) instrument. Results. The SDMT, CVLT-II, and BVMT-R score in MS patients were significantly lower than those in HC (effect size, r: 0.61, 0.36, and 0.47, respectively). Test-retest reliability for all tests was satisfactory with correlation coefficient for SDMT, CVLT-II, and BVMT-R in MS subjects 0.86, 0.81, and 0.83, respectively. Using 5th percentile of HC score as cut-off, 15% MS subjects had impairment in one test, 27.5% in two tests, and 40% in three tests. BICAMS was moderately correlated with EDSS but was not correlated with disease duration and relapse rate. SDMT score correlated with physical function and physical and mental role limitation. Conclusion. BICAMS is valid and reliable for assessing cognitive function of Indonesia MS patients. ? 2019 Riwanti Estiasari et al.","azathioprine; beta interferon; fingolimod; adult; age; Article; brief international cognitive assessment for multiple sclerosis; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; disease duration; educational status; Expanded Disability Status Scale; female; human; Indonesia; male; multiple sclerosis; neurologic disease assessment; physical disability; physical performance; quality of life; reliability; sex difference; test retest reliability; validity"
"Alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of stingless bee honey from Tetragonula biroi and Tetragonula laeviceps",2019,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia in the presence of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism disorder. Diabetes mellitus can be treated by inhibiting the activity of the alpha-glucosidase enzyme that serves to break down carbohydrates into glucose. Honey is known to have many health benefits. This study aims to determine the alpha-glucosidase enzyme inhibitory activity of stingless bee honey from Tetragonula biroi and Tetragonula laeviceps. Stingless bee honey from T. biroi and T. laeviceps with various concentrations (50-1000ppm) were tested to obtain the IC 50 value. Acarbose was used as a positive control. This study was performed by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture (phosphate buffer, 4-nitrophenyl α-D-glucopyranoside, α-glucosidase, and sample) using a microplate reader at 410nm. The results obtained that stingless bee honey from T. biroi and T. laeviceps has a potency to inhibit the activity of the α-glucosidase enzyme. However, the methanol extract of T. laeviceps honey has the highest ability to inhibit the activity of the α-glucosidase enzyme with IC 50 values of around 2394.69ppm. Therefore, some animal testing or more research were needed to investigate the potential of stingless bee honey from T. biroi and T. laeviceps for diabetic treatment. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"The relationship between human leukocyte antigen-cw6 allele and psoriasis vulgaris",2019,"Psoriasis vulgaris is chronic skin disease that is linked to genetics and immune system. The most important predisposing genetic factor is human leukocyte antigen (HLA). This study was performed to determine the relationship between HLA-Cw6 allele and psoriasis vulgaris and the changes of nucleotide base squences, using observation method with a cross sectional comparative study. Samples were selected using consecutive sampling of 30 patients with psoriasis vulgaris attending the Dermatology and STD polyclinic at DR. M. Djamil Hospital. 30 healthy volunteers were selected as controls. The subjects' medical history was recorded followed by a dermatological examination, collection of samples, DNA isolation, then primers were designed for HLA-Cw6 allele, genes were sequencing and finally analyzed using PCR-SSP. The results were 20% of patients with psoriasis vulgaris carried HLA-Cw6 allele, while it was absent in the control group. This difference is statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.024). We found the changes of nucleotide base formations of HLA-Cw6. In conclusion, based on these observations, presence of the HLA-Cw6 allele is an important genetic risk factor for developing psoriasis vulgaris. ? Copyright S.L.

"The relationship between concordance behaviour with treatment compliance and quality of life of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in medan",2019,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia is the country with the second highest number of tuberculosis in the world. Patient compliance with tuberculosis treatment is still very low. Thus the success rate of treatment is also unsatisfactory. Concordance behaviour is a model of the doctor-patient relationship that combines aspects of the partnership, sharing decision making and trust. It is considered better than adherence to improve compliance and quality of life in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. AIM: This study aims to assess the relationship between concordance and the level of adherence to pulmonary tuberculosis treatment along with the quality of life in Medan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 259 tuberculosis patients from several clinics and hospitals in Medan from 2015 to 2017, by asking patients to fill out questionnaires that had been tested for validity and reliability first. The concordance behaviour questionnaire contains 56 questions covering aspects of knowledge, partnership, sharing decision making, trust, and support. While compliance was measured by 14 questions covering attitude and behaviour. Statistical analysis was performed by Chi-Square test in SPSS v20. RESULTS: This study shows that most TB patients (75.7%) have a good concordance, in which the aspect of knowledge, partnership, sharing and support were all good. However, the component of trust in the most patient (75.7%) was still low. Based on the level of compliance, 84.2% of patients had good compliance. However, the level of behaviour in 55.2% of patients was still low. Statistical analysis showed that there was a significant relationship between concordance and compliance (p = 0.009), in which patient with good concordance had 2.6 higher probability for good compliance. However, there was no significant association between concordance and quality of life (p = 0.63). CONCLUSION: Concordance behaviour is a good concept to be applied to improve treatment compliance of pulmonary TB patients. ? 2019 Pandiaman Pandia, Tamsil Syafiuddin, Adang Bachtiar, Kintoko Rochadi.","adult; aged; Article; attitude to health; behavior; child; cross-sectional study; decision making; doctor patient relationship; female; government; health care; human; knowledge; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; middle aged; patient compliance; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; validity"
"Optimum concentration of platelet-rich fibrin lysate for human dental pulp stem cells culture medium",2019,"Platelet Rich Fibrin Lysate (L-PRF) contains platelets, leukocytes and growth factors, all of which contribute to proliferation and healing processes. This allogeneic and autologous material can be used for cell culture supplementation. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were isolated from the impacted third molars of 10 healthy donors, and then cultured in 3 different supplemented media cultures (10%, 20% and 25% L-PRF). Cell proliferation was analyzed using flow citometry and MTT-Assay. Compared to cells without supplementation (control group), the L-PRF group showed significant hDPSC proliferation on day 1 (p < 0.05), with the highest proliferation rate observed in the 25% L-PRF group. Significant proliferation was also observed between day 1 and 3 and between day 1 and 5 (p < 0.05) in the groups with 10%, 20% and 25% L-PRF supplementation. There is no significant proliferation observed between day 1, 3 and 5 in the control group (p > 0.05). The 10%, 20% and 25% L-PRF groups can serve as supplemental culture media for hDPSCs proliferation, with the highest proliferative potential observed in the 25% L-PRF group. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"The conformity of anthropometric measurements of bathroom and bedroom designs for independent elderly at panti sosial tresna werdha (PSTW)* Budi mulia i Jakarta in 2018",2019,"Nowadays, most of the facilities that are available for the elderly are no different from those available for most adults, although they already have different levels of capacity and limitation. In average, the elderly go through 1 cm anthropometric size decrease per decade. This study is a descriptive study with quantitative approach conducted in elderly care owned by local government, which is aimed to find out the conformity between the anthropometric size and the dimension of the facilities available in bathrooms and bedrooms. This research focuses on Catelya House for women and Edelweiss House for men. It is found that the beds, wardrobes, and toilet facilities are still not in conformity with the anthropometric of elderly. The heights of 3 different bed designs in 2 houses are not proportional. Most of the wardrobes shelves are not proportional with the elbow height of elderly, as they are either too high or too low for the elderly. But the bathrooms design in Catelya and Edelweiss is quite proportional. Only the handrails in Edelweiss house are too far for elderly, which requires it to be redesigned in order to minimize the safety and health risks to the elderly. ? 2019, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

"Surveillance and characterisation of influenza viruses among patients with influenza-like illness in Bali, Indonesia, July 2010-June 2014",2019,"Background: Although Indonesia has high fatality rate of human A/H5N1 cases, epidemiological and clinical data on influenza virus circulation among humans has been limited. Within Indonesia, Bali province is of interest due to high population densities of humans, pigs and poultry. This study aims to characterize and compare the epidemiological and clinical patterns of influenza viruses in humans through surveillance among patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) in Bali, Indonesia. Methods: ILI patients were recruited at 21 sentinel health facilities across all nine regencies in Bali, from July 2010 to June 2014. PCR-based assays were used for detection and subtyping of influenza viruses. Demographic, behavioural and clinical data were tested for associations with influenza using chi-squared tests and logistic regression. Results: Of 2077 ILI patients, 291 (14.0%) tested positive for influenza A, 152 (7.3%) for influenza B, and 16 (0.77%) for both influenza A and B. Of the influenza A isolates, the majority 61.2% were A/H3N2, followed by A/H1N1-pdm09 (80; 26.1%). Two A/H5N1 were identified. Influenza positive rates were significantly higher during wet season months (28.3%), compared with the dry season (13.8%; χ 2 = 61.1; df = 1; p &lt; 0.0001). Clinical predictors for infection varied by virus type, with measured fever (?38 °C) more strongly associated with influenza B (AOR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.39). Conclusion: Influenza circulates year-round among humans in Bali with higher activity during the wet season. High contact rates with poultry and pigs, along with influenza virus detection that could not be subtyped through conventional assays, highlight the need for molecular studies to characterize epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza in this setting. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; disease surveillance; female; human; Indonesia; influenza; influenza A; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); influenza B; Influenza B virus; Influenza virus; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; seasonal variation; virus characterization; virus detection; virus isolation; virus strain; genetics; infant; influenza; Influenza A virus; Influenzavirus B; isolation and purification; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; risk factor; season; statistical model; very elderly; virology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Influenza A virus; Influenza, Human; Influenzavirus B; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Seasons; Young Adult"
"Intimate partner violence and receptive syringe sharing among women who inject drugs in Indonesia: A respondent-driven sampling study",2019,"Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV are overlapping public health problems that disproportionately affect women who inject drugs. Little is known about the relationship between IPV and HIV-related unsafe injecting practices among women in low- and middle-income settings. This study investigated whether IPV victimisation was associated with receptive syringe sharing among women who inject drugs in Indonesia. Methods: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was used to recruit 731 women aged 18+ years, injecting drugs in the preceding 12 months, and residing in Greater Jakarta or Bandung, West Java. Population estimates were derived using the RDS-II estimator. Multivariate logistic regressions assessed relationships between different forms of past-year IPV (i.e. psychological abuse, physical and/or injurious assault, forced sex) and receptive syringe sharing, controlling for city differences and sociodemographic cofactors. Results: Overall, 21.1% of participants reported engaging in past-month receptive syringe sharing. In multivariate analyses controlling for all forms of IPV, receptive syringe sharing was significantly positively associated with experiencing psychological abuse (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.06,3.24; p = 0.030), physical and/or injurious assault (OR = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.04,2.89; p = 0.034), and several covariates: injecting pharmaceuticals only (versus heroin only) (OR = 3.58; 95% CI = 1.66,7.69; p = 0.001), experiencing unstable housing and/or homelessness (OR = 2.89; 95% CI = 1.41,5.95; p = 0.004), and residing in Bandung, West Java (versus Greater Jakarta) (OR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.40,3.90; p = 0.001). Conclusion: IPV is a significant risk factor for HIV-related injecting risk among women who inject drugs in Indonesia. These findings indicate the urgent need to scale up harm reduction interventions and align existing programs with IPV prevention and support services, with specific efforts targeting the needs of female injectors. ? 2018","adult; Article; assault; emotional abuse; female; heroin dependence; homelessness; housing; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Indonesia; injection drug user; major clinical study; needle sharing; partner violence; physical abuse; priority journal; receptive syringe sharing; residential area; respondent driven sampling; risk factor; sampling; adolescent; city; high risk behavior; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; middle aged; needle sharing; partner violence; prevalence; psychology; questionnaire; sexuality; statistical model; substance abuse; Adolescent; Adult; Cities; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Indonesia; Intimate Partner Violence; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Needle Sharing; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Risk-Taking; Sampling Studies; Sexual Partners; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Surveys and Questionnaires; Women"
"Developing a global occupational health and safety management system model for Japanese companies",2020,"Objectives: To develop and validate a global occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS) model for Japanese companies. Methods: In cooperation with a Japanese company, we established a research team and gathered information on occupational health and safety (OHS) practices in nine countries where the target company operated manufacturing sites. We then developed a model hypothesis via research team meeting. The model hypothesis was introduced to local factories in Indonesia and Thailand as trial sites. We evaluated the roles of the company headquarters, the implementation process, and any improvements in OHS practices at the sites. Based on the results, a global OHSMS model was formalized for global introduction. Results: The model consisted of both headquarters and site roles. These roles were well-functioning, and OHS at the sites improved. Two issues concerning the functioning of the headquarters were identified: the need to establish a reporting system to the headquarters and the need to support the improvement of specialized human resources. By improving the model hypothesis to address these issues, the model was formalized for global introduction. Conclusions: The global OHSMS model was based on the use of methods and specialized human resources relevant to each region and their common objectives, as well as evaluation indicators based on the minimum requirements of the company headquarters. To verify the effectiveness of this model, the experiment should be extended to other countries. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Module development and its effectiveness for improving the competencies of voluntary health workers in communicating safe complementary feeding to caregivers in Indonesia",2019,"Introduction: In Indonesia, most training modules for health paraprofessionals have been adapted from existing foreign modules without assessment. In addition, there have been few studies on training development for this group. We aimed to develop, using a systematic tool, implement and evaluate a training module to improve the competencies of voluntary health workers (cadres) in communicating safe complementary feeding practice to caregivers of young children in Indonesia. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. A qualitative study employing in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, mini-workshops, documentary reviews and expert validation was used to develop the training module, following a systematic approach. The module's effectiveness for improving the health workers' competencies was evaluated using a quantitative study with a non-equivalent pre-test and post-test control group design that included 70 (intervention group) and 68 (comparison group) voluntary health workers from a peri-urban district. Changes in the workers' cognitive, affective and psychomotor competencies were tested before and after attending a 3-day training module (intervention group) or a half-day event (comparison group). Results: A 24-hour learning session module on communicating safe complementary feeding was developed and used to train voluntary health workers. After the training, a significantly higher proportion of workers in the intervention group than in the comparison group were assessed as competent in the psychomotor and composite domains (psychomotor: 67.1% vs. 20.6%; composite: 74.3% vs. 36.8%; p < 0.001). Conclusion: This systematically developed module was effective in improving the competencies of voluntary health workers regarding communicating safe complementary feeding practice to caregivers in Indonesia. ? 2019 Malaysian Journal of Nutrition.","article; caregiver; child; complementary feeding; controlled study; female; health care personnel; human; human experiment; Indonesia; interview; learning; male; pretest posttest design; qualitative research; quantitative analysis"
"Dynamic transmission of dengue hemorraghic fever and climate variability patterns in Jakarta",2019,"Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) has become an endemic in major cities in Indonesia. Climate change, and poor level of awareness and knowledge of the community in Indonesia causes the case of DHF to continue to exist and it tends to increase. In the extraordinary events in 2015 the morbidity rate reached 50.75. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prediction in 1996 stated that the incidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Indonesia will increase threefold from 2070, if the environment and community conditions do not change. This study aims to produce a system dynamics model with ecological analysis to determine the dynamics of the DHF incidence with climate variability patterns in the Special Capital Region of Jakarta. The design of this study is ecologic study with hypothesis test, modeling, simulation, and intervention. Interviews with respondents include the level of knowledge, attitudes, and behavior (PSP) of the community. Measurement of climate factor includes rainfall, temperature, humidity, and CO2 level in the ambient environment. The results of DHF system dynamics model simulation show the program intervention scenario that has the most significant effect on the decline of Breeding Places and the decrease of DHF cases by increasing the participation of the community to actively control water places that are potential for mosquito breeding places. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Role of cancer stem cell, apoptotic factor, DNA repair, and telomerase toward radiation therapy response in stage IIIB cervical cancer",2019,"Objectives: Cancer stem cells are involved in radioresistant cancers. Transcription factors Sry-related HMG box (SOX2) and octamer binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) can confer pluripotent cell characteristics and self-renewal ability and are involved in carcinogenesis, metastasis, tumor recurrence, and resistance to therapy. Apoptosis, DNA repair, and telomerase factors also contribute to radioresistance. We sought to identify the role of SOX2 and OCT4 as cancer stem cell markers and their effects on apoptosis (via caspase 3), DNA repair (Chk1) and telomerase (hTERT) in conferring resistance to radiotherapy. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of 40 patients with stage IIIB cervical squamous cell carcinoma who completed radiation therapy at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. The patients were classified according to their treatment response as having exhibited a complete or incomplete response. Clinical follow-up and Pap smears were performed between six and 12 months after therapy for those with a good initial response to determine the final response to therapy. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze SOX2, OCT4, caspase-3, Chk1, and hTERT expression in paraffin sections of the initial biopsy. Results: Strong expression of SOX2 (p = 0.011, p = 0.001) and OCT4 (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) was significantly associated with both an incomplete initial and final therapy response, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that SOX2 and OCT4 expression levels were the strongest markers of an incomplete response to radiotherapy (odds ratio (OR) = 5.12, p = 0.034, and OR = 17.03, p = 0.004, respectively). Conclusions: Strong expression of SOX2 and OCT4 may be a good indicator of incomplete radiotherapy outcome in patients with stage IIIB cervical cancer. ? 2019, Oman Medical Specialty Board.

"The Effect of Vitamin E Supplementation on Lipid Profiles and Adiponectin Levels in Obese Adolescents: A Randomized Controlled Trial",2019,"BACKGROUND: low-grade chronic inflammation in obese individuals contributes to the development of lipid abnormality and insulin resistance. Vitamin E has antioxidant and insulin-sensitizing properties, mediated by adiponectin. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin E supplementation on lipid profiles and adiponectin levels in obese adolescents. METHODS: this was a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Obese adolescents aged 14-18 years, with no history of taking anti-obesity or antioxidant drugs, were recruited and randomized into two groups: vitamin E and placebo. The dose of vitamin E was 400 IU/day. Intervention was administered for two months. Lipid profiles and adiponectin levels were measured at baseline and after intervention. Primary outcomes were analyzed using the per-protocol analysis principle. Statistical analysis was performed using the independent t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: a total of 66 subjects completed the intervention study, 34 in the vitamin E group and 32 in the placebo group. Lipid profiles and adiponectin levels at 2 months after intervention did not differ significantly between the two groups. Changes from the baseline level were also not significantly different between the two groups and were inconsistent from one subject to another. CONCLUSION: in obese adolescents, vitamin E supplementation of 400 IU/day for 2 months does not significantly affect lipid profiles and adiponectin levels.","adiponectin; alpha tocopherol; lipid; adolescent; blood; body mass; childhood obesity; controlled study; dietary supplement; double blind procedure; female; human; Indonesia; male; randomized controlled trial; Adiponectin; Adolescent; Body Mass Index; Dietary Supplements; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Lipids; Male; Pediatric Obesity; Vitamin E"
"The effect of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) on carbon nanotubes solubility as drug delivery material for cancer with covalent functionalization",2019,"Currently, the development of carbon nanotubes (CNT) as drug delivery for targeted cancer cells with high efficiency and specificity without causing side effects has become one of the main topics in the nanomedicine. The solubility of CNT has limitations in meeting the standards of the Drug Delivery System (DDS). This study investigated the effect of the addition of H 2 O 2 (hydrogen peroxide) on the solubility of functionalized CNT (f-CNT). The f-CNT was treated covalently using a mixture of acids (HNO 3 , H 2 SO 4 , and HCl). The variations were performed at sonication temperatures of 20, 40, and 60 °C. The best sonication temperature was in the f-CNT which had a high degree of suspension stability and did not damage the morphology of CNT. The f-CNT characterization was performed using Fourier infrared transformation spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA), UV-Vis spectroscopy and dispersion tests. The f-CNT sonicated at a temperature of 40 °C with the addition of H 2 O 2 (CS5) produced a purity level of 100%, less-damaged morphology and high suspension stability with an absorbance value of 0.661. The CS5 produced the longest dispersion time, more than 21 days with the highest degree of functionalization, 35.53%. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Liver and kidney function analysis on mice given ethyl acetate fraction of Garcinia mangostana as potential colorectal cancer therapeutic agent",2019,"The incidence of colorectal cancer in Indonesia reaches 12.8 per 100,000 adult populations with mortality rate reaching 9.5% of all cancer cases. Current chemotherapy widely used has not been satisfactory, quite expensive, and may produce untoward side effect. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective and safety alternative agent from herbs to eradicate colorectal cancer. Previous studies has shown that α-mangostin contained in mangosteen peel extracts and fraction (Garcinia mangostana) has high antioxidant content and activities as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antivirus. To get a higher level of α-mangostin content, the fraction used in this study is acquired by ethyl acetate fraction, and so the fraction yields 25% α-mangostin. The preliminary study done by our research team showed that the fraction has high cytotoxicity based on brine shrimp lethality test and high antioxidant activity. These results indicate the potential of ethyl acetate mangosteen fraction as an anticancer agent. In this study, we investigate acute toxicity of ethyl acetate mangosteen fraction on liver and kidney function of mice. Twenty of female BALB/c mice are divided into 4 groups. Three groups are given intra gastric administration of a single dose of 2, 4, and 6g/kg body weight (BW) of ethyl acetate mangosteen fraction and another group as a control. The findings show that the functional marker of kidney - blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine serum, and liver - serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), do not differ from those of the control at a single dose of 2g/kg BW of ethyl acetate fraction. However, an increase of serum creatinine occurs at the administration of dose 6g/kg BW compared with the control. The results of this study indicate that a single dose of 2 and 4g/kg BW of ethyl acetate fraction of Garcinia mangostana do not cause toxicity on liver and kidney function of mice. To ensure the safety level of the fraction, further histopathological examination is needed. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Antiviral Activity of Isobutyl Gallate to Dengue Virus Serotype 2 in Vitro",2019,"Dengue is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne diseases in Indonesia that lead to a spectrum of disease, ranging from a flu-like illness to a life-threatening dengue shock syndrome. Despite its high incidence and mortality rate, there is currently no antiviral drug available against dengue virus (DENV). Therefore, research regarding the development of anti-viral to DENV is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of isobutyl gallate, a gallic acid derivative, against DENV in vitro. Various concentration of isobutyl gallate was added to DENV-2 strain New Guinea C (NGC) and infected to Vero cell line. Inhibition of DENV replication as aligned with half inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was determined by focus assay. Furthermore, the toxicity of isobutyl gallate that corresponds with cytotoxic concentration (CC50) value was determined by MTT assay. Selectivity index (SI) value was defined as the ratio of CC50 to IC50. Isobutyl gallate showed no cytotoxic effects against Huh 7 it-1 cells with CC50 values of 167.19 μg/mL and exhibited strong antiviral activity with IC50 of 4.45 μg/mL, hence a significant SI value of 25.69.

"Peribiliary Glands Are Key in Regeneration of the Human Biliary Epithelium After Severe Bile Duct Injury",2019,"Peribiliary glands (PBG) are a source of stem/progenitor cells organized in a cellular network encircling large bile ducts. Severe cholangiopathy with loss of luminal biliary epithelium has been proposed to activate PBG, resulting in cell proliferation and differentiation to restore biliary epithelial integrity. However, formal evidence for this concept in human livers is lacking. We therefore developed an ex vivo model using precision-cut slices of extrahepatic human bile ducts obtained from discarded donor livers, providing an intact anatomical organization of cell structures, to study spatiotemporal differentiation and migration of PBG cells after severe biliary injury. Postischemic bile duct slices were incubated in oxygenated culture medium for up to a week. At baseline, severe tissue injury was evident with loss of luminal epithelial lining and mural stroma necrosis. In contrast, PBG remained relatively well preserved and different reactions of PBG were noted, including PBG dilatation, cell proliferation, and maturation. Proliferation of PBG cells increased after 24 hours of oxygenated incubation, reaching a peak after 72 hours. Proliferation of PBG cells was paralleled by a reduction in PBG apoptosis and differentiation from a primitive and pluripotent (homeobox protein Nanog+/ sex-determining region Y-box 9+) to a mature (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator+/secretin receptor+) and activated phenotype (increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, glucose transporter 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor A). Migration of proliferating PBG cells in our ex vivo model was unorganized, but resulted in generation of epithelial monolayers at stromal surfaces. Conclusion: Human PBG contain biliary progenitor cells and are able to respond to bile duct epithelial loss with proliferation, differentiation, and maturation to restore epithelial integrity. The ex vivo spatiotemporal behavior of human PBG cells provides evidence for a pivotal role of PBG in biliary regeneration after severe injury. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Basic medical research: Upregulation of FGFR3 and HIF-1α expression in muscle invasive bladder cancer",2019,"BACKGROUND The major risks in patients diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) are recurrence, progression of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), and metastasis. Biological markers such as fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) are related to muscle invasiveness of bladder cancer. This study was aimed to analyze the expression of FGFR3 and HIF-1α to predict muscle invasiveness in bladder cancer patients. METHODS This was an observational study with a case-control design. Sixty patients with bladder cancer, who underwent histopathology examinations at the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara/H. Adam Malik Hospital from January 2012 to December 2015, were included in this study. Samples were then classified into 30 NMIBC and 30 MIBC groups. All samples were analyzed with an immunohistochemistry assay for FGFR3 and HIF-1α. H-scores were used to determine the relationships between each group. RESULTS FGFR3 was expressed in 29 (96.7%) patients of the NMIBC group, and 23 (76.7%) patients of the MIBC group (p=0.026, OR=8.8; 95% CI=1.01-76.96). HIF-1α was expressed in only 1 (3.33%) patient of the NMIBC group, and 15 (50%) patients of the MIBC group (p&lt;0.001, OR=29; 95% CI=3.49-241.13).

"Virtual screening of natural products as an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase 1 enzyme for breast cancer disease",2019,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in woman worldwide. It has the highest number of new cases which amounted to 40 per 100,000 cases per year, 12.9% of which leads to death. Epigenetic alteration plays a vital role in the process of cancer cell formation and propagation. DNA methylation is one of the most common types of epigenetic alteration which generally leads to breast cancer. The DNA Methylation, a transfer of methyl group from S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) to cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide, is catalysed by a DNA Methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) enzyme. In the present study, we performed a virtual screening of natural product compounds as an inhibitor of the DNMT1 enzyme. Virtual screening was conducted on 26,731 natural products obtained from the NCBI PubChem database. Three steps of rigid and one step of flexible molecular docking simulations were performed using MOE 2014.09. Through the simulations, 10 best ligands based on the Gibbs free binding energies ΔGbinding) and the ligand-enzyme complex interactions were identified. The pharmacological test was conducted to observe the physicochemical, toxicity, carcinogenicity-mutagenicity, and bioactivity properties by employing DataWarrior 4.7.2., Toxtree, Molinspiration, admetSAR, and SWISSADME software. The results revealed that three best ligands from the phenolic group were selected due to their exceptional pharmacological characteristics as the drug candidate for breast cancer therapy. ? 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Alkylation; Amino acids; Binding energy; Cellular manufacturing; Diagnosis; DNA; Enzymes; Ligands; Methylation; Molecular modeling; Physicochemical properties; Software testing; Breast Cancer; DNA methyltransferases; Epigenetic alterations; Epigenetic regulation; Molecular docking; Molecular docking simulations; Natural products; S-adenosyl methionines; Diseases"
"Evaluation of drug management information system to improve quality and users satisfaction: Case study at a primary health center",2019,"Drug and supplies management plays an important role in health systems. A web-based drug management information system, Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Obat (SIPO) was developed to support interaction and communication among the internal entities of a district health office (DHO), including primary health centers (PHC). Using a qualitative approach, the objective of this descriptive study is to assess SIPO’s performance in terms of success in addressing problems related to drug and medical supplies management. The results indicate that SIPO has a positive impact for both PHCs and the DHO. The result found that the users are satisfied with the system. One element that needs to be improved is integration ability; currently, SIPO cannot connect to other health-related information systems.

"Effectiveness of using spirulina in conjunction with artemisinin combination therapy as an antimalarial treatment",2019,"Objective: This study investigated whether the herbal plant Spirulina could be used in crude form as an alternative therapy to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) for the treatment of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Methods: Mice infected by Plasmodium berghei were treated orally with a single dose of Spirulina (200 or 400 mg/kg body weight [BW]), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine as a type of ACT, or a combination of the two. The level of parasitemia was then compared between the groups during the 4-day post-infection period. Results: There was a significant difference in the change in the level of parasitemia from day 0 to day 4 between groups (Kruskal–Wallis test, P < 0.05). Mice that were treated with both doses of Spirulina alone had a significantly higher parasitemia density than those treated with ACT alone. However, the combination of Spirulina and ACT had a synergistic effect, with 200 mg/kg BW Spirulina + ACT giving significantly better results than ACT alone. Conclusion: These findings indicate that treatment with Spirulina alone cannot be used as antimalarial medication, but its combination with ACT can lead to enhanced antimalarial activity. ? 2019 The Authors.","antimalarial agent; dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine; herbaceous agent; animal experiment; animal model; antimalarial activity; Article; blood smear; body growth; body weight; combination drug therapy; controlled study; drug efficacy; growth inhibition; male; mouse; nonhuman; parasitemia; Plasmodium; Plasmodium berghei infection; Plasmodium falciparum; Spirulina; synergistic effect"
"Eating behaviour of young female workers with low socioeconomic status in Malang City, East Java: A qualitative study",2019,"Introduction: Eating behaviour is one of the important factors affecting nutritional status that has been widely investigated. However, there are few studies on the eating behaviour of young female workers in Indonesia. This study aimed at investigating the factors affecting eating behaviour of young female workers of low socioeconomic status in Malang, East Java province, Indonesia. Methods: Participants were recruited using purposive sampling from low-income families living in Malang City. The eligibility criteria were based on demographic information, including monthly household income and expenses. The participants recruited comprised 21 women aged 18-22 years who were employed outside their homes, unmarried and living with their parents. A qualitative methodology was used to understand the meaning and context of the eating behaviour of these women. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were used as the primary data collection methods. Results: Two primary themes emerged as the main influences of the participants' eating behaviour: individual attributes (food preferences, healthy eating knowledge and self-efficacy), and socio-environmental factors (peer influence, mother's role and food availability). In general, the participants had some knowledge about healthy eating behaviour; however, they lacked self-efficacy to practise such behaviour. Conclusion: Individual motivations and socio-environmental factors were found to mediate the eating behaviour of young working women from poor households. These factors should be considered when designing nutrition programmes for achieving healthier eating behaviour among young working women. ? 2019 Malaysian Journal of Nutrition.","adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; environmental factor; feeding behavior; female; female worker; food availability; food preference; household income; human; human experiment; human tissue; Indonesia; interview; lowest income group; motivation; peer pressure; qualitative research; self concept; single (marital status); young adult"
"Correlation between sleep quality with diabetes self-care management on diabetes mellitus type 2 patients",2019,"Decreased sleep quality in patients with type 2 diabetes can interfere their daytime functions, alterations in emotions and decrease their quality of life. Relationship between sleep quality and self-care management among diabetes type 2 patients were examined. We used cross-sectional methods following with questionnaire of patient characteristic, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, perceived stress scale, diabetes self-management questionnaire and family support. This research has been conducted in 152 diabetes type 2 patients who were divided into 79 respondents without diabetic foot ulcers and 73 respondents with diabetic foot ulcers. Result of this study showed that 63.2% of respondents had poor sleep quality, 59.2% mild stress, 57.2% poor family support and 56.6% good diabetes self-management behavior. There was a significant relationship between sleep quality, duration of diabetes mellitus, and stress with diabetes self-care management (p: 0.013; p: 0.009; p: 0.007). There was no significant relationship between age, sex, education level, family support and diabetic ulcers with diabetes self-management care. In order to increase diabetes self-care management among diabetic patients, sleep quality need to be improved. Improvement can be made by controlling their blood glucose and providing better environment of sleep. ? 2019 Author(s).",""

"Comparison of the impact of annual and semiannual mass drug administration on lymphatic filariasis prevalence in flores island, Indonesia",2019,"We compared the impact of annual and semiannual mass drug administration (MDA) on the prevalence of Brugia timori and Wuchereria bancrofti in Flores Island. Two villages (Paga, B. timori only; Lewomada, co-endemic) received annual MDA with diethylcarbamazine/albendazole and a larger village (Pruda, co-endemic) received semiannual MDA. Infection parameters (microfilariae [Mf], antibodies to recombinant filarial antigen BmR1 [Brugia Rapid (BR)], and a test for W. bancrofti antigenemia [immunochromatographic test (ICT)]) were assessed before and after treatment. The crude Mf prevalence in Pruda decreased after five semiannual treatments from 14.2%to 1.2%, whereas the Mf prevalence in the other two villages decreased after three annual treatments from 3.9%to0%and from5%to 0.3%, respectively. ICT positivity prevalence in Pruda and Lewomada decreased from 22.9% and 6.5% to 7% and 0.8%, respectively, whereas BR antibody prevalence in Pruda, Lewomada, and Paga decreased from 28.9%, 31.7%, and 12.5% to 3.6%, 4.1%, and 1.8%,respectively. Logistic regression analysis indicated that that Mf,BR, and ICT prevalence decreased significantly over time and that for the Mf and ICT outcomes the semiannual treatment had higher odds of positivity. Model-adjusted prevalence estimates revealed that apparent differences in treatment effectiveness were driven by differences in baseline prevalence and that adjusted prevalence declinedmore rapidly in the semiannual treatment group.Weconclude that in this setting, annual MDA was sufficient to reduce Mf prevalence to less than 1% in areas with low to moderate baseline prevalence. Semiannual MDA was useful for rapidly reducing Mf prevalence in an area with higher baseline endemicity. ? 2019 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","albendazole; diethylcarbamazine; albendazole; antifilarial agent; diethylcarbamazine; helminth antibody; parasite antigen; adolescent; adult; Article; Brugia timori; child; comparative study; controlled study; endemic disease; female; human; Indonesia; lymphatic filariasis; male; mass drug administration; microfilaria (nematode larva); prevalence; Wuchereria bancrofti; aged; animal; blood; Brugia; drug administration; drug combination; drug effect; growth, development and aging; island (geological); lymphatic filariasis; mass drug administration; middle aged; parasitology; pathogenicity; preschool child; prevalence; procedures; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Albendazole; Animals; Antibodies, Helminth; Antigens, Helminth; Brugia; Child; Child, Preschool; Diethylcarbamazine; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Combinations; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Female; Filaricides; Humans; Indonesia; Islands; Male; Mass Drug Administration; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Wuchereria bancrofti"
"Clinical practice guidelines in complicated intra-abdominal infection 2018: An Indonesian perspective",2019,"Background: The occurrence of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) remains high despite system improvement in accordance with Joint Commission International because of heterogeneity of management. However, published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were not feasible to be implemented because these guidelines were not specific to Indonesian characteristics. Thus, a national CPG should be developed to minimize heterogeneity in the management of cIAI in Indonesia. Methods: We developed a CPG on cIAI through the adaptation of published CPGs. The process proceeded in steps recommended by ADAPTE. Published CPGs were critically appraised using Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II critical appraisal tools. For a specific updated CPG, the analysis was performed using Checklist for the Reporting of Updated Guidelines (CheckUp). Appropriate statements and recommendations in selected CPGs were adapted into our CPG with consideration of Indonesian characteristics. The recommendations were established by the hierarchy of evidence on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The approval of the recommendation draft was performed using the Delphi method. Results: Sixty-eight full-text guidelines were downloaded from several sites. Thirty-three CPGs were related to intra-abdominal infection and 18 others were specific on CPG on intra-abdominal infection and cIAI. On review of these 18 CPGs, 13 were strongly recommended, three were recommended, and two were not recommended. On review updated CPGs, five updated CPGs were found, all with the same score. Two of the strongly recommended updated CPGs had been published in 2016 and 2017, i.e. recommendations by the World Society of Emergency Surgery 2016 consensus conference and revised CPG of the Surgical Site Infection Society. There were a total of 84 statements and recommendations developed and approved by the task force through using the Delphi method. Conclusions: This guideline summarizes the definition, classification, pathophysiology, etiology, risk factors, assessments, and management of cIAI. Evidence-based recommendations have been developed with consideration of Indonesian-specific characteristics. ? 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","cilastatin plus imipenem; doripenem; echinocandin; ertapenem; fluconazole; meropenem; voriconazole; abdominal infection; anaerobic infection; antibiotic sensitivity; antibiotic therapy; clinical examination; consensus; Delphi study; disease classification; disease severity; evidence based medicine; high risk patient; human; Indonesia; laboratory test; low risk patient; nonhuman; pathophysiology; patient care; peritonitis; practice guideline; priority journal; prognosis; radiodiagnosis; Review; risk factor; scoring system; treatment failure; treatment indication; abdominal infection; disease management; practice guideline; Disease Management; Humans; Indonesia; Intraabdominal Infections"
"Role of Quantitative Computed Tomographic Scan Analysis in Lung Volume Reduction for Emphysema",2019,"Recent advances in bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) offer new therapeutic alternatives for patients with emphysema and hyperinflation. Endobronchial valves and coils are 2 potential BLVR techniques which have been shown to improve pulmonary function and the quality of life in patients with emphysema. Current patient selection for LVR procedures relies on 3 main inclusion criteria: low attenuation area (in %), also known as emphysema score, heterogeneity score, and fissure integrity score. Volumetric analysis in combination with densitometric analysis of the affected lung lobe or segment with quantitative CT to determine emphysema severity play an important role in treatment planning and post-operative assessment. Due to the variations in lung anatomy, manual corrections are often required to ensure successful and accurate lobe segmentation for pathological and post-treatment CT scan analysis. The advanced development and utilisation of quantitative CT do not simply represent regional changes in pulmonary function but aids in analysis for better patient selection with severe emphysema who are most likely to benefit from BLVR. ? 2019 S.

"Use and Outcomes of Antiretroviral Monotherapy and Treatment Interruption in Adolescents With Perinatal HIV Infection in Asia",2019,"Purpose: Antiretroviral monotherapy and treatment interruption are potential strategies for perinatally HIV-infected adolescents (PHIVA) who face challenges maintaining effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assessed the use and outcomes for adolescents receiving monotherapy or undergoing treatment interruption in a regional Asian cohort. Methods: Regional Asian data (2001–2016) were analyzed to describe PHIVA who experienced ?2 weeks of lamivudine or emtricitabine monotherapy or treatment interruption and trends in CD4 count and HIV viral load during and after episodes. Survival analyses were used for World Health Organization (WHO) stage III/IV clinical and immunologic event-free survival during monotherapy or treatment interruption, and a Poisson regression to determine factors associated with monotherapy or treatment interruption. Results: Of 3,448 PHIVA, 84 (2.4%) experienced 94 monotherapy episodes, and 147 (4.3%) experienced 174 treatment interruptions. Monotherapy was associated with older age, HIV RNA >400 copies/mL, younger age at ART initiation, and exposure to ?2 combination ART regimens. Treatment interruption was associated with CD4 count <350 cells/μL, HIV RNA ?1,000 copies/mL, ART adverse event, and commencing ART age ?10 years compared with age <3 years. WHO clinical stage III/IV 1-year event-free survival was 96% and 85% for monotherapy and treatment interruption cohorts, respectively. WHO immunologic stage III/IV 1-year event-free survival was 52% for both cohorts. Those who experienced monotherapy or treatment interruption for more than 6 months had worse immunologic and virologic outcomes. Conclusions: Until challenges of treatment adherence, engagement in care, and combination ART durability/tolerability are met, monotherapy and treatment interruption will lead to poor long-term outcomes. ? 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","emtricitabine; lamivudine; virus RNA; adolescent; adult; adverse drug reaction; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Asia; CD4 lymphocyte count; child; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug exposure; event free survival; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immune response; major clinical study; maternal disease; monotherapy; outcome assessment; perinatal care; personal experience; priority journal; survival rate; treatment interruption; virology; virus load; World Health Organization"
"Developing an indonesian fertility preservation questionnaire for health care providers treating patients with cancer: A preliminary pilot study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]",2019,"Background: Early detection and advanced treatment increases the five-year survival rate of patients with cancer. However, long-term cancer therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can have negative effects, such as infertility. This study aimed to develop a standardized Indonesian questionnaire, which would be used to assess the quality of health care providers’ knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding fertility preservation in patients with cancer. Methods: A pilot study was performed in January and February 2018 at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. An existing questionnaire was translated from English to Indonesian using forward translation, back translation, expert panel, pretesting, and cognitive interviewing. Ten subspecialists in the following departments made up an expert panel, who were involved in pretesting and cognitive interviewing: pediatric hematology-oncology, hematology-oncology/internal medicine, gynecologic oncology, gynecologic immune-endocrinology, radiology-oncology, and surgical oncology. Results: The questionnaire was successfully translated. The ten respondents stated that the maximum age for women’s fertility preservation is 40 years of age (60%), 45 years of age (30%), or had no maximum age (10%). Additionally, the respondents stated that the maximum age for men’s fertility preservation is 40 years of age (30%), 50 years of age (20%), or had no maximum age (50%). The respondents’ knowledge stated that > 50% of them were aware but do not know enough about fertility preservation. The respondents stated that more than 50% of them give feedback agreeing to fertility preservation, and they always give advice about fertility preservation to their patients. Conclusion: The translation of the questionnaire followed translation steps from the World Health Organization and was adjusted based on the expert panel’s comments concerning fertility preservation. This validated questionnaire tool in Indonesian can be used for research purposes and clinical evaluation of fertility preservation among health care providers in Indonesia. ? 2019 Harzif AK et al.","adult; age; Article; attitude to health; cancer patient; clinical evaluation; female; fertility preservation; Health Assessment Questionnaire; health care personnel; health care quality; human; Indonesian; male; physician attitude; pilot study; professional practice; Indonesia; middle aged; questionnaire; Adult; Female; Fertility Preservation; Health Personnel; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"In silico identification of potent inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) from Indonesian natural product compounds as a novel approach to treat ebola virus disease",2019,"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a 90-kDa molecular chaperone that has various biological functions, varying from cell cycle progression to the protein folding, that is crucial for the cancer cell development. Furthermore, the activity of Hsp90 is also essential for the replication of negative-stranded viruses as the host factor, including Ebola virus (EBOV), a virus from Filoviridae family which is responsible for causing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Africa in 2014. Thus, the inhibition of Hsp90 can be considered as the novel approach to combat EVD. In this research, we deployed an Indonesian natural products database to perform in silico ADME-Tox screening test and a series of molecular docking simulations against the Hsp90. A total of 3,429 ligands that have been docked, about thirteen ligands have outstanding pharmacological properties, and higher binding affinity in the binding site of Hsp90 than four referred standard ligands. In the end, we conclude that 1-O-galloyl-6-O-luteoyl-a-D-glucose, euphorbianin and scutellarein 7-neohesperidoside as the best Indonesian natural product compound to inhibit Hsp90, suggesting a potential candidate to treat EVD effectively. ? 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Binding energy; Binding sites; Diagnosis; Ligands; Molecular modeling; Proteins; Viruses; ADME-Tox; Ebola virus; Heat shock protein; Molecular docking simulations; Natural products; Diseases"
"Learning the seasonality of disease incidences from empirical data",2019,"Investigating the seasonality of disease incidences is very important in disease surveillance in regions with periodical climatic patterns. In lieu of the paradigm about disease incidences varying seasonally in line with meteorology, this work seeks to determine how well simple epidemic models can capture such seasonality for better forecasts and optimal futuristic interventions. Once incidence data are assimilated by a periodic model, asymptotic analysis in relation to the long-term behavior of the disease occurrences can be performed using the classical Floquet theory, which explains the stability of the existing periodic solutions. For an illustrative case, we employed infected-recovered models with an infection rate of a single period and that of commensurate periods to assimilate weekly dengue incidence data from the city of Jakarta, Indonesia, which we present in their raw and moving-average-filtered version. To estimate the infection rate of a single period, eight optimization schemes were assigned returning magnitudes of the rate that vary insignificantly across schemes. Three schemes were assigned to estimate the infection rate of commensurate periods based on three different sets of periods used. Each scheme involving commensurate periods gives better fitting than that involving only a single period. The computation results combined with the analytical results indicate that if the disease surveillance in the city does not improve, then the incidence will raise to a certain positive orbit and remain cyclical. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",""

"Robustness of clonogenic assays as a biomarker for cancer cell radiosensitivity",2019,"Photon radiation therapy is a major curative treatment for cancer. However, the lack of robust predictive biomarkers for radiosensitivity precludes personalized radiation therapy. Clonogenic assays are the gold standard method for measuring the radiosensitivity of cancer cells. Although a large number of publications describe the use of clonogenic assays to measure cancer cell radiosensitivity, the robustness of results from different studies is unclear. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive detailed literature search of 256 common cancer cell lines and identified the eight cell lines most-frequently examined for photon sensitivity using clonogenic assays. Survival endpoints and experimental parameters from all 620 relevant experiments were compiled and analyzed. We found that the coefficients of variation for SF2 (surviving fraction after 2 Gy irradiation) and for D10 (dose that yields a surviving fraction of 10%) were below 30% for all cell lines, indicating that SF2 and D10 have acceptable inter-assay precision. These data support further analysis of published data on clonogenic assays using SF2 and D10 as survival endpoints, which facilitates robust identification of biological profiles representative of cancer cell sensitivity to photons. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The effect of data acquisition configuration on simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique algorithm for microwave imaging system",2019,"Early detection system is extensively investigated to diagnose the condition of human body earlier. Currently, our research is focusing on the development of a non-invasive tomographic imaging system by utilizing a microwave imaging system to early detect tumor or cancer. It shows some advantages in comparison to the other tomography technologies, such as low health risk (non-ionization), low cost in implementation and operation, and ease of use. In the previous works, we have been developing a microwave imaging system. To evaluate the imaging system, simple numerical and physical phantoms are used to represent normal and abnormal tissue structure. Two dipole antennas are used for transmitting and receiving microwaves signals at 3 GHz. The data acquisition system uses translational and rotational method. From the scattering S21 parameters, are then used as the acquired data to generate a reconstructed image. In this paper, we investigate the effect of antenna position when the transmitting antenna is fixed at certain position to acquire the data prior to image reconstruction process by using simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) algorithm. The results show that there is no significant degradation on the reconstructed images when the imaging system is applied in different acquisition system configuration. ? 2018 IEICE","Algebra; Data acquisition; Dipole antennas; Health risks; Imaging systems; Microwave antennas; Microwaves; Tomography; Data acquisition system; Early detection system; Microwave imaging; Microwave imaging systems; Reconstruction process; SART; Simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique; Transmitting antenna; Image reconstruction"

Methods: The effects of a mouthwash containing IgY anti-ComD S. mutans with and without chitosan on biofilm-forming isolates of S. mutans were investigated. Subjects were assigned to rinsing twice daily for 6 days with 15–20 ml mouthwash solution for 30 s. Biofilm formation of S mutans isolated from the patiens was measured using a crystal violet method to determine the optical density at 490 nm. Results: The results indicated that mouthwash containing IgY anti-ComD S. mutans and chitosan significantly enhanced the biofilm formation of S. mutans. In mouthwash containing IgY anti-ComD S. mutans without chitosan, a reduction in biofilm formation was observed; however, this was not statistically significant. Conclusions: The mouthwash combination of IgY anti-ComD S. mutans and chitosan enhanced the biofilm formation ability of S. mutans isolated from caries and caries-free subjects. Further, research is needed to determine the appropriate concentrations of IgY anti-ComD S. mutans and chitosan required to effectively inhibit dental caries. ? 2019 The Authors.","bacterial protein; bacterium antibody; chitosan; ComD protein; crystal violet; immunoglobulin Y; mouthwash; unclassified drug; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; biofilm; dental caries; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; mouth hygiene; nonhuman; protein quality; quorum sensing; risk factor; Streptococcus mutans; Western blotting"

"Tuberculosis of the wrist mimicking rheumatoid arthritis – A rare case",2019,"Introduction: Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes infection in approximately one-third of the world's population. Arthritis due to Mycobacteriurn tuberculosis usually presents as a chronic, slowly progressive, monoarticular infection that predominantly involves the weight-bearing joints and the spine. The hand and wrist are rare sites for tuberculosis (TB) and comprises of < 1% of all skeletal TB. Even though it is rare, TB of the wrist is a cause of great morbidity. We presented a case of wrist TB treated with debridement and synovectomy. Presentation of Case: A 35 years old woman came with the chief complaint of pain and swelling on the right wrist since 1 year ago and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis of the wrist. Patient then was given methylprednisolone 4 mg twice a day and methotrexate 175 mg once a week. However, the pain and swelling of her right wrist became worse. Subsequently patient was admitted to hospital and laboratory findings suggested a tuberculous arthritis of the wrist. Debridement, synovectomy, and biopsy, in addition to antituberculosis therapy, were then performed. Discussion: Tuberculous arthritis is generally a monoarticular disease that typically involves the spine or large and medium-sized joints. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and tuberculous arthritis may have similar clinical characteristics, which consists of a chronic course with periarticular soft-tissue swelling. Conclusion: Tuberculous arthritis and RA can have similar characteristic but laboratory examination can help in establishing diagnosis. ? 2019 The Authors","C reactive protein; ethambutol plus isoniazid plus pyrazinamide plus rifampicin; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; rheumatoid factor; adult; antibiotic therapy; Article; bone biopsy; case report; clinical article; debridement; diagnostic error; disease duration; Doppler flowmetry; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; follow up; hospital admission; human; human tissue; intensive care; laboratory test; medical history; morbidity; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; range of motion; rheumatoid arthritis; synovectomy; synovial fluid; treatment duration; tuberculous arthritis; visual analog scale; weight bearing; wrist disease; X ray"
"Possibilistics C-Means (PCM) Algorithm for the Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Classification",2019,"Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor that attacks the liver and can cause death. Although there have been advances in technology for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, the number of liver cancer patients is still increasing. The liver can still function normally even if some of its parts are not in good condition. Therefore, the symptoms of liver cancer at an early stage are difficult to detect. Early diagnosis of this disease will increase the chances of recovery. One method to diagnose Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is to check the level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood which is alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a cancer index. If the liver cancer cells continue to grow, the level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) will be very high. This paper presents a Possibilistic C-Means (PCM) algorithm, which used to classify the results of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) blood tests to determine whether patients diagnosed with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) or normal patients. This method will help to get an accuracy of about 92%. ?

"The influence of age-associated comorbidities on responses to combination antiretroviral therapy in older people living with HIV",2019,"Introduction: Multiple comorbidities among HIV-positive individuals may increase the potential for polypharmacy causing drug-to-drug interactions and older individuals with comorbidities, particularly those with cognitive impairment, may have difficulty in adhering to complex medications. However, the effects of age-associated comorbidities on the treatment outcomes of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are not well known. In this study, we investigated the effects of age-associated comorbidities on therapeutic outcomes of cART in HIV-positive adults in Asian countries. Methods: Patients enrolled in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database cohort and on cART for more than six months were analysed. Comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and impaired renal function. Treatment outcomes of patients ?50?years of age with comorbidities were compared with those <50?years and those ?50?years without comorbidities. We analysed 5411 patients with virological failure and 5621 with immunologic failure. Our failure outcomes were defined to be in-line with the World Health Organization 2016 guidelines. Cox regression analysis was used to analyse time to first virological and immunological failure. Results: The incidence of virologic failure was 7.72/100 person-years. Virological failure was less likely in patients with better adherence and higher CD4 count at cART initiation. Those acquiring HIV through intravenous drug use were more likely to have virological failure compared to those infected through heterosexual contact. On univariate analysis, patients aged <50?years without comorbidities were more likely to experience virological failure than those aged ?50?years with comorbidities (hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 2.33, p?<?0.001). However, the multivariate model showed that age-related comorbidities were not significant factors for virological failure (hazard ratio 1.31, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.74, p?=?0.07). There were 391 immunological failures, with an incidence of 2.75/100 person-years. On multivariate analysis, those aged <50?years without comorbidities (p?=?0.025) and age <50?years with comorbidities (p?=?0.001) were less likely to develop immunological failure compared to those aged ?50?years with comorbidities. Conclusions: In our Asia regional cohort, age-associated comorbidities did not affect virologic outcomes of cART. Among those with comorbidities, patients <50?years old showed a better CD4 response. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Genotyping analysis of the Pax9 Gene in patients with maxillary canine impaction",2019,"Background: Paired-box gene 9 (PAX9) mutation is potentially associated with impaction in some patient populations. Here, we analyzed the relationship between PAX 9 polymorphism and the occurrence of maxillary canine impaction. Methods: Patients with and without maxillary canine impaction were selected based on specific inclusion criteria, and samples of genomic DNA were obtained from a buccal mucosa swab. DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced for further bioinformatics analysis to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. Genotype and allele counting was performed in both case and control groups prior to conducting statistical analysis. Results: Four SNPs were identified in patients with maxillary canine impaction, with relative confidence determined based on chromatogram-peak assessment. All SNPs were located in exon 3 of PAX 9 and in the region sequenced by the primer pair ?197Fex3 and +28Rex3. Three of the SNPs (rs375436662, rs12881240, and rs4904210) were reported previously and are annotated in NCBI (dbSNP version 150), whereas another SNP mapped to chromosome 14 has not been reported. Patients with a CC genotype at SNP 3 [odds ratio (OR): 2.61 vs. TT; 1.28 vs. CT] and a CC genotype at SNP 4 [OR: 0.71 vs. GG; 0.79 vs. CG] were more likely to have maxillary canine impaction. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that the presence of SNPs 3 and 4 is associated with increased likelihood of suffering from maxillary canine impaction. ? 2019 Vitria EE et al.","genomic DNA; transcription factor PAX9; Article; buccal mucosa; controlled study; DNA sequence; exon; female; gene amplification; genetic association; genotype; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; maxillary canine; Pax9 gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; tooth disease"
"""jakarta Reproduksi Sehat"" (JAKPROS) mobile application for healthy Jakarta",2019,"Indonesia still has a high maternal mortality rate. There were 305 mothers mortality of 100.000 live births in 2015. The rate was far below MDG's target. One of the strategies to reduce the rate is to ensure mothers could gain access to excellent health services and reliable health information about pregnancy, delivery, and reproductive health. Digital communication and smartphones could be utilized to provide access to health information and digital publication through an application are one of the options that modern-day women could use. Therefore, we developed smartphone based reproductive health application named Jakarta Reproduksi Sehat (JAKPROS) which provide three sections, including prenatal care, cervical cancer prevention, and reproductive health. This application contains educational materials, question and answer forums, a hotline with health services center, and important information about reproductive health. In short, this application has everything that is important for pregnant mothers and women in general. We acknowledge that many diseases main risk factor was lack of education, therefore increasing the mothers and women knowledge could decrease high - risk pregnancy, and for long-term purpose could decrease the maternal mortality rate. Obstetricians also could monitor their patients through this application with JAKPROS record health information, from the patient weight, blood pressure, estimated date of delivery, fetal heart rate, fundal height, and contractions. So that obstetricians could manage high-risk pregnancy and immediately intervene when needed. We previewed this application into several sub-district general hospitals in Jakarta testing its features, implementing the app into daily clinical practice.

The behavioral pattern of excessive internet usage has similarities to substance addiction, such as tolerance, withdrawal, repeated failure to reduce or quit, and impairment in daily life. Yet, there is no consistent physiological change that accompanies excessive use of the internet, as there is in excessive substance use. Neurological and neuroimaging studies of excessive internet users show biological changes in the prefrontal cortex that are similar to those found in other addictive syndromes. Brain structure changes also occur in the temporal cortex and ventral striatum, compromising executive function in planning and reasoning and increasing impulsive risk, resulting in loss of control over internet use.

"Quality of life among drug users in Jakarta, Indonesia",2019,"Methadone maintenance therapy can improve the quality of life of drug users. In this study, we aimed to determine the correlation between individual-level factors and quality of life among drug users in Jakarta, Indonesia. Using a cross-sectional methodology, we assessed the quality of life of 100 respondents undergoing methadone maintenance therapy (retrospectively registered) at the Drug Dependence Hospital, Jakarta, (34 respondents) and the TanjungPriok Public Health Center (66 respondents) in June 2017. The instruments used to measure quality of life were the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale, and General Self-Efficacy Scale. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors for poor quality of life. The mean age of the respondents was 35.8 years, and 94% of the respondents were male. The mean quality of life score was 65.8. The lowest mean score (59.4) was in the social relationship domain, and the highest mean score (74.2) was in the psychological domain. Multivariate logistic regression analysis results revealed quality of life to be significantly associated with age, monthly income, physical activity, sleepiness, and self-efficacy. Drug users aged ?34 years [odds ratio (OR) =4.3], with higher incomes (OR= 3.4), who participated in moderate/high physical activity (OR= 9.5), who were normal sleepers (OR= 4.4), and who had good self-efficacy (OR= 2.9) hada higher quality of life than their counterparts. We recommend that drug users undergoing maintenance therapy should be physically active and address any sleep problems to maintain a good quality of life. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"The presence and response to Zn of ZnT family mRNAs in human dental pulp",2019,"Zinc (Zn) is distributed throughout the body and within cells by saturable processes mediated by the transport proteins of the ZnT (SLC30) and ZIP (SLC39) families. The two families function in opposite directions. ZnT transporters mediate cellular zinc efflux or intracellular sequestration. Zn is found in human tooth enamel and dentine at levels that have been related to environmental exposures, such as pollution, disease, and dietary intake. The mechanism by which Zn in the odontoblast is deposited in the hard tissue of the tooth, however, is unknown but is important in determining the physical properties, and hence resilience, of enamel and in the context of the use of tooth zinc level as a biomarker of exposure. We hypothesised that zinc efflux mediated by members of the ZnT family of 10 transporters is a key step in this process and is regulated by zinc availability through effects on mRNA levels. Thus, we determined the profile of ZnT transporter mRNA in a human active-secretory odontoblast-like cell model under conditions of high- and low-extracellular Zn concentration and determined if the same transporter mRNAs were present in human dental pulp. ZnT1, ZnT5 and ZnT9 mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR in both the secretory odontoblast cells and human dental pulp. ZnT2, ZnT3 and ZnT10 mRNAs were not detected, and ZnT4 mRNA was detected in secretory odontoblasts only, which may be indicative of a specialised zinc efflux function during the active secretory phase of tooth development. ZnT1 mRNA was significantly increased in response to extracellular Zn exposure (60 μM) after 24 h. The presence of Zn transporter mRNAs in secretory odontoblasts and dental pulp indicates that the corresponding transport proteins function to deposit zinc in the dental hard tissues. The responsiveness of ZnT1 in odontoblasts to zinc availability is concordant with this being a process that is regulated to maintain cellular Zn homeostasis and that is a mediator of the relationship between environmental Zn exposure and dental Zn deposition. These findings have likely relevance to human dental health through effects of Zn transporter expression level on the hard tissue properties. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Enamels; Proteins; Tissue; Tooth enamel; Dental hard tissues; Dietary intakes; Environmental exposure; Extracellular; Human tooth enamels; Transport proteins; Transporter expression; Zn deposition; Zinc; carrier protein; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; zinc; zinc ion; zinc transporter; zinc transporter 1; zinc transporter 2; zinc transporter 5; zinc transporter 9; Article; Caco-2 cell line; cell differentiation; controlled study; dental health; dental pulp stem cell; dentin; enamel; environmental exposure; gene expression; human; human cell; odontoblast; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tooth development; tooth pulp"
"Risk factors of dental caries: Consumption of sugary snacks among indonesian adolescents",2019,"Objective: To determine the risk factors of caries among adolescents in Padang City, by assessing the frequency of sugary snack consumption. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 150 randomly selected junior high school students using a selfadministered questionnaire along with oral examinations. The questionnaire consisted of questions on socio-demographic characteristics, oral health behavior, and frequency of consumption of sugary foods. Data were analyzed using the Chi-square tests and multivariate analysis. Results: Dental caries was found in 61% of the total students and was more prevalent in males when compared with females. The mean DMFT score was 1.3±1.4. Sugary snack consumption, attitude, and protective factors were significantly related to the occurrence of caries (p<0.001).

"Rising rural body-mass index is the main driver of the global obesity epidemic in adults",2019,"Body-mass index (BMI) has increased steadily in most countries in parallel with a rise in the proportion of the population who live in cities1,2. This has led to a widely reported view that urbanization is one of the most important drivers of the global rise in obesity3–6. Here we use 2,009?population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight in more than 112?million adults, to report national, regional and global trends in mean?BMI segregated by place of residence (a rural or urban area) from 1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017—and more than 80% in?some low- and middle-income regions—was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities?in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing—and in some countries reversal—of the gap in BMI between urban and rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition that enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid replacing the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries with a more general malnutrition disadvantage that entails excessive consumption of low-quality calories. ? 2019, The Author(s).","adult; Africa south of the Sahara; aged; body height; body mass; body weight; controlled study; developed country; epidemic; female; health care access; high income country; human; Letter; low income country; male; middle income country; nutrition education; obesity; prevalence; priority journal; rural area; urban area; adolescent; age; developing country; geographic mapping; middle aged; nutritional status; obesity; rural health; rural population; sex factor; urban health; urban population; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Diet, Healthy; Female; Geographic Mapping; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Rural Health; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Urban Health; Urban Population; Young Adult"
"Risk factors of mortality in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: A multicenter study in Indonesia",2020,"Background and Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered a significant burden, and its associated rate of mortality is increasing. Therefore, a population-based cancer registry is considered an essential element in the baseline and comprehensive analysis of the risk factors associated with HCC. We present a multicenter analysis of HCC registry from 2 hospitals in Indonesia. Methods: We performed a follow-up on patients with HCC who were admitted between January 2015 and November 2017 in Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital and Dharmais Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Patient's death was considered the primary outcome of the study. A multivariate analysis was conducted using logistic regression, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: A total of 282 patients with HCC included. At the last follow-up, 136 (48.2%) patients had died. Mortality rate was not significantly affected by sex, age, etiology, the presence of cirrhosis, nor surveillance of HCC. Based on the Child-Pugh (CP) classification, the OR increased progressively in CP C patients (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.08-3.53; P = 0.026). The progressive increase was also found in patients with a higher Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, and the OR for CP C and D patients were 3.50 (95% CI 1.18-10.38; P = 0.024) and 3.41 (95% CI 1.02-11.41; P = 0.047), respectively. Supportive treatment was the most common treatment modality with an OR of 2.17 (95% CI 1.14-4.16; P = 0.019), and it was associated with the mortality rate of HCC. Conclusions: The CP classification, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, and treatment modality might predict mortality in patients with HCC. Moreover, other parameters must be further evaluated. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","sorafenib; adult; age; Article; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cell differentiation; chemoembolization; Child Pugh score; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; disease association; female; follow up; hepatitis C; human; Indonesia; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; population; radiofrequency ablation; risk factor"
"Early and Late Virologic Failure after Virologic Suppression in HIV-Infected Asian Children and Adolescents",2019,"Background:Virologic failure is a major threat to maintaining effective combination antiretroviral therapy, especially for children in need of lifelong treatment. With efforts to expand access to HIV viral load testing, our understanding of pediatric virologic failure is evolving.Setting:An Asian cohort in 16 pediatric HIV services across 6 countries.Methods:From 2005 to 2014, patients younger than 20 years who achieved virologic suppression and had subsequent viral load testing were included. Early virologic failure was defined as a HIV RNA ?1000 copies per milliliter within 12 months of virologic suppression, and late virologic as a HIV RNA ?1000 copies per milliliter after 12 months following virologic suppression. Characteristics at combination antiretroviral therapy initiation and virologic suppression were described, and a competing risk time-to-event analysis was used to determine cumulative incidence of virologic failure and factors at virologic suppression associated with early and late virologic failure.Results:Of 1105 included in the analysis, 182 (17.9%) experienced virologic failure. The median age at virologic suppression was 6.9 years, and the median time to virologic failure was 24.6 months after virologic suppression. The incidence rate for a first virologic failure event was 3.3 per 100 person-years. Factors at virologic suppression associated with late virologic failure included older age, mostly rural clinic setting, tuberculosis, protease inhibitor-based regimens, and early virologic failure. No risk factors were identified for early virologic failure.Conclusions:Around 1 in 5 experienced virologic failure in our cohort after achieving virologic suppression. Targeted interventions to manage complex treatment scenarios, including adolescents, tuberculosis coinfection, and those with poor virologic control are required. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","abacavir; efavirenz; lamivudine; nevirapine; stavudine; tenofovir; zidovudine; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adolescent; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Cambodia; child; cohort analysis; comparative study; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; India; Indonesia; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; observational study; priority journal; risk factor; Thailand; Viet Nam; viral load testing; virus load; Asian continental ancestry group; clinical trial; drug effect; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; multicenter study; treatment failure; virology; Adolescent; Anti-HIV Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Child; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Treatment Failure; Viral Load"
"Comparison of tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assay in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection among Indonesian health-care workers",2019,"Background: Health-care workers are groups that are close contact with tuberculosis (TB) patients. As an alternative to the tuberculin skin test (TST), there is interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for the diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI). The objective of this study is to compare TST and IGRA in the diagnosis of LTBI among Indonesian health-care workers. Methods: This study design was a cross-sectional study. TST results are consistent for LTBI if there is induration ?10 mm in individuals without previous TST, or ?15 mm in participants with a history of previous TST. Medical history interview, physical examination, chest X-ray, and sputum smear examination were performed to exclude active TB infection. Results: Among 84 healthcare workers, the prevalence of LTBI was 51.2% by IGRA and 29.8% by TST with sufficient agreement (κ = 0.34). Age and low education were significantly correlated with the positive results of IGRA (P < 0.05); meanwhile smoking status was correlated with TST (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of LTBI is higher with IGRA as compared to TST, with sufficient agreement and there is significant correlation between age and low education with the results of IGRA and in smoking status with TST. ? 2019 Medknow Publications.

"Pink teeth as post mortem indicator: A literature review",2019,"Pink teeth in post mortem condition still become a controversion due to identification process of human body. Pink teeth could happen not only in post mortem condition, but can also found in human alive. Pink teeth is the coloring of the tooth part to pink without involving the structure of the email. Pink teeth in post mortem conditions have varying degrees of agility ranging from pink to dark red. Postmortem pink teeth are rarely found in conditions of death less than 4 weeks so that post mortem pink teeth condition usually perform on the body from exhumation process. Postmortem pink teeth can occur after physical trauma, accident, poisoning barbiturates and carbon monoxide, asphyxia, systemic disease, a result of external staining due to the decomposition process, and idiopathic. Those etiology lead damage to erythrocyte wall including hemoglobin and its derivative products such as porphyrins and hemosiderin that enter tubulus dentinalis. The pink colorization occure mostly in area of cemento enamel junction. From this a literature review, authors try to analyze pathology of post mortem pink teeth condition and its correlation with postmortem interval (time of death) and cause of death. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Progesterone increases the progressive motility of human sperm",2019,"Sperm are transcriptionally inactive. Transformation from immature to mature sperm capable of fertilizing an egg depends on altering the proteome. For example, proteomic studies identified receptors not predicted to be expressed on the sperm surface, notably the progesterone receptor. This discovery raises the question of whether progesterone exerts nongenomic effects on human spermatozoa. Here we aimed to answer this question. Sperm from a normal individual were subjected to Percoll gradient centrifugation and treated with different concentrations of progesterone for 2 h at 37°C. Sperm motilities were determined using a Neubauer chamber according to the World Health Organization's standards. We measured the percentage changes in motility variables as follows: fast and straight progressive motility, slow progressive motility, nonprogressive motility, and nonmotility. Progesterone (250 ng/ml) increased sperm motility by 55.96% compared with the control without added progesterone (22.6%). Significant concentration-dependent increases in fast and progressive motility reached 29.55% compared with the control (10.1%). Progesterone (250 mg/ml) reduced the percentage of nonmotile cells to 44% compared with the control (77.4%). Progesterone increased the motility and progressive motility of human sperm in a concentration-dependent manner. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""

"Rodent is potential reservoir of zoonoses fungi in Jakarta, Indonesia",2019,"Some potentially human pathogenic fungi are known to be zoonoses. Rodent is one of potential reservoir of fungi. To date, little is known about the role of rodent in transmitting fungal disease in Indonesia. Therefore, purpose of this study was to find evidence of potential fungal zoonoses in rodent. We caught two house rats, one rat was from the house of patient suffering from talaromycosis and the other one was from a healthy person house. These rats internal organs (lung, liver, and spleen) were inoculated onto sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and SDA with additional of chloramphenicol. Fungi grown in the medium were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) continued by sequence-based approach. In addition PCR was also conducted using primers developed from beta tubulin gene. Amplified regions were sequenced and compared to database that contains reference sequences. We found three fungal species. Talaromyces atroroseus was isolated from the rat that caught from the house of patient with talaromycosis, while Purpureocillium lilacinum and Penicillium citrinum were isolated from the other rat caught in the house of healthy individual. Although naturally could be found in the environment, these species had been reported to cause fatal systemic mycosis in human. In conclusion Talaromyces atroroseus, Purpureocillium lilacinum and P. citrinum could be found in rat. This result indicates that rat could be a reservoir for these fungi. ? 2019 Author(s).",""

"Glucose and lipid profiles in adolescents with thalassemia major and its association with iron overload in specific organs",2019,"BACKGROUND: Organ damage due to iron toxicity is one factor that increases the risk of getting cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in thalassemia patient. This study aims to determine glucose and lipid profiles in adolescents with thalassemia major and its association with iron overload in pancreas and liver. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study. Subjects were thalassemia major adolescents without any confounding factors that may affect glucose and lipid levels. Blood samples were collected to measure the glucose level, lipid profiles, ferritin level and transferrin saturation. T2- Magnetic Resonance Imaging was used to evaluate the iron overload in organs. RESULTS: From a total of 60 subjects, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 1 subject and impaired fasting glucose was diagnosed in 3 subjects. All subjects had high triglycerides/ high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, 59 subjects (98%) had low HDL-C, 18 subjects (30%) had hypertriglyceridemia, and none had abnormal high level of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). The majority of subjects had ferritin ?2,500 ng/mL (70%), mild pancreatic iron overload (56.6%), and moderate hepatic iron overload (43.8%). Degree of hyperferritinemia was not associated with glucose and lipid profiles. Blood glucose profiles were not associated with various degree of pancreatic iron overload. Similar result was also observed between lipid profiles and hepatic iron overload. CONCLUSION: Abnormal glucose and lipid profiles in thalassemia major can be found in adolescence. Normal blood glucose level isn't necessarily associated with normal pancreatic iron deposition.

"Association of High Blood Homocysteine and Risk of Increased Severity of Ischemic Stroke Events",2019,"Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability in the world as well as in Indonesia. Initial stroke severity is an important factor that affects short- and long-term stroke outcomes. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital from July 2017 to January 2018 to investigate the factors that affect stroke severity. A total of 77 acute ischemic stroke patients were divided into three groups, which include low blood homocysteine levels (< 9 μmol/L), moderate blood homocysteine levels (9-15 μmol/L), and high blood homocysteine levels (> 15 μmol/L). The acquired data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test and a significant difference of initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and blood homocysteine levels (H = 13.328, p = 0.001) were seen, with a mean rank of 25.86 for low blood homocysteine levels, 33.69 for moderate blood homocysteine levels, and 48.94 for high blood homocysteine levels. The patients were then divided into two groups based on the NIHSS (?5 and > 5) to calculate the risk correlation of blood homocysteine levels and NIHSS by using regression. We found that patients with high blood homocysteine levels had 14.4 times higher risk of having NIHSS > 5 compared with those with low blood homocysteine levels (p = 0.002, 95% confidence interval [CI] [2.714-76.407]), and 3.9 times higher risk compared with those with moderate blood homocysteine levels (p = 0.011, 95% CI [1.371-11.246]). We concluded that homocysteine is a risk factor for a higher stroke severity. Future studies to evaluate the usefulness of homocysteine-lowering therapy in stroke patients are recommended. ?

"Classification of Breast Cancer using Fast Fuzzy Clustering based on Kernel",2019,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women in the world. The classification is the initial process of executing patient treatment, which is important as it increases life expectancy as well as quality. In this paper, a new method is proposed based on kernel, which is modified from KC-Means: it combines K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means algorithm, and kernel function. The C-Means algorithm is applied on the centers of a fixed number of groups founded by K-Means, and the kernel function is expected to improve the accuracy of classification with its ability to separate data which cannot be separated linearly. We applied the proposed method on a dataset of 201 breast cancer and 85 non-breast cancer samples from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Results concluded that fast fuzzy clustering has an accuracy of 85.26%, but fast fuzzy clustering based on kernel is 89.74%, with a better running time on average than 90.95% with the same method. ?

"Efficient validated method of UPLC-MS/MS to determine curcumin in rat plasma and ovarium",2019,"Curcumin, a lipophilic polyphenol derived from the roots of Curcuma longa. Recently, it has been widely investigated as a therapeutic agent for cancer. Thus, there is a growing interest in measuring curcumin concentrations in the plasma and other target tissues in relevant animal models. We developed and validated a simple, fast, and reliable method for quantifying curcumin in biological matrices by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC)-Mass Spectrometry (MS)/MS. The liquid chromatography system is using rapid separation on Acquity UPLC?BEH C18 with gradient mobile phase contained formic acid and acetonitrile. Prior to detection, curcumin and internal standard (IS) were ionized using electrospray ionization positive source and the ions were monitored at m/z 369 → 177 and 260 → 183 for curcumin and IS, respectively. The calibration curve was linear (r ? 0.99) over the concentration range of 1-50 ng/ml and 1-30 ng/ml for rat plasma and for ovary homogenate, respectively. The lower limit of quantification was 1 ng/ml. The mean accuracy ranged from 98.9% to 103.2% and 98% to 108.9%, while the coefficient of variation (CV) values of precision in rat plasma were below 11.92% and 10.47% for within and between run, respectively. In rat ovary homogenate, the mean concentration and CV of within run accuracy and precision were 95.53%-109.78% and 3.34%-9.14%, respectively. The developed method was used to quantify curcumin in rat plasma and ovary after an oral gavage. In conclusion, the developed and validated method should be useful for quantification of curcumin accurately and precisely in plasma and target organs from relevant animal models of human diseases. ? 2019 W.

"The estimated healthcare cost of diabetic retinopathy in Indonesia and its projection for 2025",2019,"Purpose: To estimate the total healthcare cost associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR) in type 2 diabetes in Indonesia and its projection for 2025. Methods: A prevalence-based cost-of-illness model was constructed from previous population-based DR study. Projection for 2025 was derived from estimated diabetes population in 2025. Direct treatment costs of DR were estimated from the perspective of healthcare. Patient perspective costs were obtained from thorough interview including only transportation cost and lost of working days related to treatment. We developed four cost-of-illness models according to DR severity level, DR without necessary treatment, needing laser treatment, laser +intravitreal (IVT) injection and laser + IVT +vitrectomy. All costs were estimated in 2017 US$. Results: The healthcare costs of DR in Indonesia were estimated to be $2.4 billion in 2017 and $8.9 billion in 2025. The total cost in 2017 consisted of the cost for no DR and mild-moderate non-proliferative DR (NPDR) requiring eye screening ($25.9 million), severe NPDR or proliferative DR (PDR) requiring laser treatment ($0.25 billion), severe NPDR or PDR requiring both laser and IVT injection ($1.75 billion) and advance level of PDR requiring vitrectomy ($0.44 billion). Conclusions: The estimated healthcare cost of DR in Indonesia in 2017 was considerably high, nearly 2% of the 2017 national state budget, and projected to increase significantly to more than threefold in 2025. The highest cost may incur for DR requiring both laser and IVT injection. Therefore, public health intervention to delay or prevent severe DR may substantially reduce the healthcare cost of DR in Indonesia. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

"Collaborative stakeholders approach in combating substandard and falsified medical products in Indonesia: A qualitative study",2019,"The presence of substandard and falsified (SF) medical product at a significant level has become one of the threat to public health in Indonesia. BPOM as National Regulatory Authority in Indonesia has developed and implemented a policies to prevent, detect and act towards SF medical product. Nevertheless, these policies implementation has not effective to eliminate the threat. This study aimed to explore the gap exists in the policy implementation and develop a strategy using collaborative stakeholder approach among government institution and non-government organization. The study analyzes fact and data gathered by using in-depth interviews qualitatively involving 7 participants from two different categories. As a result, there are two main factors: 1) A different perception amongst the participants and 2) An obstacles to the policy implementation. Participants from non-government organization agreed that to eradicate SF required stakeholder collaboration to overcome the challenges. Furthermore, this study proposed an SF task force nationally model to empower the stakeholder's capacity, especially civil society, by implementing the science-technology-society concept. Through this model, the task force can mobilize resources response to every SF medical problems. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Analysis of occupational and non-occupational fatigue risk factors among commercial pilots in PT XYZ, Jakarta",2019,"Potential accidents and health problems related to fatigue remain a tremendous problem in commercial flight. This study was conducted to investigate fatigue risk factors among pilots in PT XYZ. There were 196 participants in the study. In order to gather more information, a questionnaire was administered, and a systematic in-depth interview was performed on each pilot individually. The Samn-Perelli Subjective Scale, designed specifically to measure fatigue, was used, and the measurements were analysed using regression and correlation analysis. Of the participants, 60.5% frequently experienced post-flight fatigue. Measurement of fatigue levels showed that 26 participants (13%) experienced physical fatigue, 61 participants (30.5%) experienced mental fatigue and 47 participants (23.5%) experienced emotional fatigue. Occupational and non-occupational factors played a substantial role in the occurrence of fatigue. Of the various risk factors (such as quality of sleep, quantity of sleep and working hours), the number of flight sectors showed a positive correlation with fatigue. In contrast, smoking habits, exercise, caffeine consumption, flight duration and napping showed negative correlations with fatigue. To reduce the occurrence of fatigue, the current established programmes at PT XYZ (which include limitations on flight time and working hours, and provision of resting time) should be continued. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Evaluation of encapsulated microparticles of Garcinia mangostana L. extracts on marker SGOT, SGPT, BUN and creatinine serum of BALB/c mice",2019,"Garcinia mangostana L. (mangosteen) pericarp containing α-mangostin is predicted to have potential as an anticancer because it can induce apoptosis and has high antioxidant content. Moreover, the preliminary study showed that this extract has high antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity based on the brine shrimp lethality test. This indicates that mangosteen has potential as chemotherapeutic agents or additional therapy in cancers such as colorectal cancer, which the available management is not as effective. To improve its efficacy and bioavailability in the colon as a targeted area, ethyl acetate fraction of mangosteen extract was then formulated into a controlled release encapsulated microparticles by chitosan-alginate material. It is intended that the active ingredient to be released after reaching the colon. In this study, toxicity of mangosteen was investigated because there is still no toxicity data of encapsulated microparticles of the ethyl acetate fraction of mangosteen extract on function of mice's kidneys (BUN/serum creatinine) and liver (SGOT/SGPT). Twenty female BALB/c mice were divided into 4 groups. Three groups were given a single dose of 2, 3, and 5g/kg body weight (BW) mangosteen via intragastric feeding tube and one control group without mangosteen. The findings show that marker of BUN, serum creatinine, SGPT, and SGOT are not significantly different from those of the control in the administration of microparticles ethyl acetate fraction of mangosteen extract at a single dose of 2 and 3g/kgBW, however, significant increases of BUN and SGOT levels were found in single dose of 5g/kgBW. The results indicate that administration encapsulated of microparticles ethyl acetate fraction of G. mangostana L. extract at single dose of 2 and 3g/kgBW cause no toxicity on liver and kidneys function, but the single dose of 5g/kgBW. cause toxicity to the liver and kidneys.

Albendazole is an effective and widely used anthelmintic agent to treat STH; however, it is not effective towards T. trichiura and its effectiveness varies between populations. Hence, we conducted a study to determine the effectiveness of triple dose albendazole in children of Perobatang village, Southwest Sumba, Indonesia. A pre-post study was carried out in Perobatang village on July 2016. Children aged 1-15 years old were enrolled in the study and asked to collect stool samples which were then examined using Kato-Katz method. The children infected with STH were given albendazole 400 mg for three consecutive days. From 246 subjects examined, 192 (78%) were positive for any STH consisting of T. trichiura (64%), A. lumbricoides (60%), and hookworms (10%). After treatment, the prevalence of STH decreased significantly (McNemar test, p<0.001) to 27%, T. trichiura 25%, A. lumbricoides 2%, and hookworm 0%. Cure rate for T. trichiura, A. lumbricoides, and hookworms was 61%, 97%, and 100%, respectively. Significant decrease of eggs per gram of feces was found in all STH (Wilcoxon test, p value <0.001 for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, p value = 0.027 for hookworms); egg reduction rate for T. trichiura was 91%, A. lumbricoides was 100%, and hookworms was 100%.

"Obesity risk and preference for high dietary fat intake are determined by FTO rs9939609 gene polymorphism in selected Indonesian adults",2019,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Data suggest that genetic factors are associated with BMI. The fat mass and obesity- associated (FTO) gene modulates adipogenesis through alternative splicing and m6A demethylation. Individuals with FTO rs9939609 gene polymorphism have a preference for energy-dense foods. This study investigates the relationship between FTO rs9939609 and obesity and preference for dietary fat intake among selected Indonesian adults. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A total of 40 non-obese and 40 obese participants aged 19-59 living in Jakarta were recruited. Body composition measurements included body weight, height, BMI, waist circumference, and body fat mass. Dietary intake was assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and food recall over 2 × 24-h periods. Genetic variation was determined using amplification-refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the FTO gene (rs9939609) was at Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium (p=1) with minor allele frequency=0.19. Individuals with AT/AA genotypes had 3.72 times higher risk of obesity (p=0.009) and 5.98 times higher dietary fat intake (p=0.02) than those with TT genotype. Obese participants with the AT/AA genotypes had 1.40 times higher dietary fat intake than those with the TT genotype (p=0.016).

May Measurement Month (MMM) is a global initiative aimed at raising awareness of high BP and to act as a temporary solution to the lack of screening programmes worldwide. An opportunistic cross-sectional survey of volunteers aged ?18 was carried out in May 2017. Blood pressure measurement, the definition of hypertension and statistical analysis followed the standard MMM protocol. We recruited 292 sites in all 34 provinces in Indonesia, and screened in public areas and offices as well as health centres. A total of 69 307 individuals were screened. After multiple imputation, 23 892 (34.5%) had hypertension. Of individuals not receiving antihypertensive medication, 20.0% were hypertensive. Among individuals receiving antihypertensive medication, 7885 (62.8%) had uncontrolled BP. MMM17 was the largest standardized screening campaign for BP measurement in our country. The proportion of individuals identified with hypertension and the percentage of those with uncontrolled BP on medication provide evidence of the substantial challenges in managing hypertension in the community.

A total of 377 respondents aged 18-49 years from Jakarta participated, comprising 221 normal weight (NW) and 156 OW/OB based on World Health Organization (WHO) cut-offs. Additional 16 informants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were recruited for indepth interviews to gather further insights on causes of obesity. Logistic regression was conducted to assess the likelihood of socioeconomic factors in predicting ""agreement on the likely causes of obesity"". Results: The online survey showed that the NW and OW/OB respondents provided quite similar rating response to each of the likely causes of obesity. Unmarried and middle socioeconomic status (SES) respondents were significantly more likely to agree on the perceived causes of obesity, compared to married and high SES. In-depth interviews revealed OW/ OB informants attributed obesity to environmental factors, compared to individual factors attributed by NW informants. Conclusion: Use of mixed methods approach provided insights for the development of obesity-reduction interventions among Indonesian adult women. ? 2019 Malaysian Journal of Nutrition.",""
"Shift work and the risk of cancer–a systematic review",2019,"In 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified shift work involving circadian disruption as “probably carcinogenic to humans”. A few epidemiological studies have sought to assess the association between shift work and the risk of cancer, although the results have been inconsistent. Thus, we aimed to conduct a systematic review of prospective cohort studies to summarize the epidemiological evidence of an association between shift work and the risk of cancer. The database used in this review was Medline/PubMed and search terms “shiftwork”, “shift work”, and “night work”. The limitations included text availability (free full text), language (English), search fields (title), and publication between January 2008 and January 2018. The search strategy resulted in twelve articles that met the selection criteria. Three studies presented results related to prostate cancer, two studies were related to lung cancer, four studies to breast cancer, and three studies related to other cancers. In conclusion, there is limited evidence of a causal association between night shift work and breast cancer, while there is insufficient evidence in respect to lung cancer, prostate cancer, and other cancers. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Association of Diabetes Mellitus on Cardiac Remodeling, Quality of Life, and Clinical Outcomes in Heart Failure With Reduced and Preserved Ejection Fraction",2019,"Background Diabetes mellitus frequently coexists with heart failure (HF), but few studies have compared the associations between diabetes mellitus and cardiac remodeling, quality of life, and clinical outcomes, according to HF phenotype. Methods and Results We compared echocardiographic parameters, quality of life (assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), and outcomes (1-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and HF hospitalization) between HF patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus in the prospective ASIAN-HF (Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure) Registry, as well as community-based controls without HF. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of diabetes mellitus with clinical outcomes. Among 5028 patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; EF <40%) and 1139 patients with HF and preserved EF (HFpEF; EF ?50%), the prevalences of type 2 diabetes mellitus were 40.2% and 45.0%, respectively (P=0.003). In both HFrEF and HFpEF cohorts, diabetes mellitus (versus no diabetes mellitus) was associated with smaller indexed left ventricular diastolic volumes and higher mitral E/e' ratio. There was a predominance of eccentric hypertrophy in HFrEF and concentric hypertrophy in HFpEF. Patients with diabetes mellitus had lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores in both HFpEF and HFrEF, with more prominent differences in HFpEF (Pinteraction<0.05). In both HFpEF and HFrEF, patients with diabetes mellitus had more HF rehospitalizations (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05-1.54; P=0.014) and higher 1-year rates of the composite of all-cause mortality/HF hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.41; P=0.011), with no differences between HF phenotypes (Pinteraction>0.05). Conclusions In HFpEF and HFrEF, type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with smaller left ventricular volumes, higher mitral E/e' ratio, poorer quality of life, and worse outcomes, with several differences noted between HF phenotypes.

"Determinants of adolescent reproductive health service utilization by senior high school students in Makassar, Indonesia",2019,"Background: Adolescents face many problems due to risky behavior. As a result, they require special consideration through the administration of health education and reproductive health services. However the utilization of adolescent reproductive health service programs in Makassar is still relatively low. The purpose of this study, then, was to identify the rates at which adolescent reproductive health services are utilized and to analyze the determinants affecting such utilization. Method: This research was a quantitative project with a cross-sectional design, and it was conducted in March to May of 2018 in Makassar City. Data were collected via the independent completion of questionnaires by 383 senior high school students randomly selected from a total of six schools. Data were analyzed using chi-square testing and multiple logistic regression using SPSS. Results: This study found that only 24.3% of the students took advantage of adolescent reproductive health services. The results of the analysis proved that knowledge of reproductive health and available services (OR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.040-2.911) are related to the utilization of those services. It was found that students with high levels of knowledge are nearly twice as likely to utilize adolescent reproductive health services as those with low levels of knowledge after the results were controlled for the variables of family and peer support. Conclusion: It is necessary to promote socialization between students and parents on a regular basis, disseminate information through online media/social networking, administer peer educator training, and establish school organizations in the field of reproductive health to increase awareness and utilization of adolescent reproductive health services. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; article; awareness; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data analysis software; female; health care utilization; high school student; human; human experiment; Indonesia; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; peer group; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; reproductive health; social network; socialization; attitude to health; child health care; health care delivery; health care survey; health service; Indonesia; patient attitude; psychology; reproductive health; school; statistics and numerical data; student; Adolescent; Adolescent Health Services; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Reproductive Health; Reproductive Health Services; Schools; Students"
"Validation of the Indonesian version of multiple sclerosis quality of life-54 (MSQOL-54 INA) questionnaire",2019,"Background: Quality of life assessment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is not routinely performed in Indonesia due to the unavailability of the validated Indonesian version of a specific instrument. The objective of this study was to transculturally adapt and validate the Indonesian version of the MSQOL-54 (MSQOL-54 INA) questionnaire. Methods: The transcultural adaptation was conducted by performing a standardized forward-backward method. Psychometric analysis was performed by assessing the reliability (Cronbach α), internal validation (item internal consistency and item discriminant validity), and external validation by measuring the correlation with a clinical factor such as EDSS and other demographic factors. Results: Reliability test with Cronbach α showed good internal consistency (> 0.7) at each component, except for health perception (0.665) and social function (0.433). Construct validity using computation of correlation coefficient showed internal consistency in accordance with the original MSQOL-54 standard dimension, except for energy and role limitation due to emotional problems components. External validation with EDSS showed negative correlation on almost all components, except for sexual function, but both composite scores were statistically significant. Conclusion: MSQOL-54 INA questionnaire has good internal reliability and is proven to be valid and well-accepted by Indonesian MS patients. Therefore, it can be used by Indonesian clinicians for more comprehensive MS management. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; Article; attitude to health; clinical article; correlational study; cross-sectional study; demography; emotional disorder; Expanded Disability Status Scale; female; human; Indonesian; male; multiple sclerosis; multiple sclerosis quality of life 54 questionnaire; psychometry; questionnaire; scoring system; sexual function; social status; Indonesia; middle aged; psychology; publication; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; standards; validation study; Adult; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translations"

"Child and adolescent psychiatry in the Far East: A 5-year follow up on the Consortium on Academic Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Far East (CACAP-FE) study",2019,"Aim: Data pertaining to child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) training systems are limited as extant research has mostly been derived from one-time data collection. This 5-year follow-up survey collects updated information on CAP training systems in the Far East, allowing for the tracking of system changes over the past 5 years. Methods: Data were obtained from 18 countries, or functionally self-governing areas, in the Far East, 17 of which were also included in the original study. An online questionnaire was completed by leading CAP professionals in each country. Questions were expanded in the present study to capture the contents of CAP training. Results: When compared to data from the original study, there has been progress in CAP training systems in the last 5 years. Specifically, there has been an increase in the number of countries with CAP training programs and national guidelines for the training. In addition, the number of CAP departments/divisions affiliated with academic institutions/universities has increased. Findings from 12 of 18 countries in the present study provide data on clinical contents. All informants of the present study reported the need for more child and adolescent psychiatrists and allied professionals. Conclusion: Despite progress in CAP training systems over the last 5 years, the need for more professionals in child and adolescent mental health care in all the relevant areas in this region have yet to be adequately addressed. Continued national efforts and international collaborations are imperative to developing and sustaining new CAP training systems while facilitating improvements in existing programs. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Syndemic and Synergistic Effects of Intimate Partner Violence, Crystal Methamphetamine, and Depression on HIV Sexual Risk Behaviors among Women Who Inject Drugs in Indonesia",2019,"Women who inject drugs are disproportionately affected by co-occurring intimate partner violence (IPV), poor mental health, and substance use. Less is known about the potentially synergistic effects of these factors on women’s HIV risk behavior, and no known studies in Asia examine these relationships. This study assessed the additive and interactive effects of exposure to syndemic IPV, depressive symptoms and non-injection crystal methamphetamine (crystal meth) on HIV sexual risk behaviors in the largest cross-sectional sample of women who inject drugs in Indonesia. Seven hundred thirty-one women aged ? 18?years, injecting drugs in the preceding 12?months, and residing in Greater Jakarta or Bandung, West Java, were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Twenty-six percent of women experienced concurrent IPV, crystal meth use and depressive symptoms. In multivariate logistic regressions controlling for sociodemographic confounders, all three factors were significantly positively associated with sexual risk outcomes. In adjusted marginal effects models, concurrent experience of IPV, crystal meth use and depressive symptoms was associated with increases in the prevalence of HIV risk outcomes: STI symptomatology (from 12% to 60%), inconsistent condom use (from 3% to 22%), and engagement in survival sex work (from 6% to 25%). Statistically significant interaction was detected on both multiplicative and additive scales. Specifically, an interaction was observed on the multiplicative scale between depressive symptoms and crystal meth on STI symptomatology (OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.24, 5.48; p = 0.011). There was also evidence of additive interaction, with most observed joint effects being greater than additive. Specifically, significant positive interaction was observed between IPV and crystal meth on inconsistent condom use (AP = 0.38, p < 0.05); depressive symptoms and crystal meth on STI symptomatology (RERI = 2.04, p < 0.001; AP = 0.61, p < 0.001) and survival sex (RERI = 1.20, p < 0.01; AP = 0.53, p < 0.01); and IPV and depressive symptoms on STI symptomatology (RERI = 3.01, p < 0.01; AP = 0.52, p < 0.001; S = 2.70, p < 0.01) and survival sex (RERI = 1.21, p < 0.05; AP = 0.40, p < 0.05). This study provides new empirical evidence showing that the syndemic conditions of IPV, depressive symptoms and crystal meth consumption interact synergistically to increase women’s HIV risk. Interventions that consider the full scope of syndemic vulnerabilities, rather than addressing individual conditions separately, may be essential. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Kidney protective effect of acalypha indica linn. root extract in high-fructose and high-cholesterol diet-fed rats",2019,"Diet high in fructose and cholesterol may lead to the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). One of the first drugs of choice in DN treatment is captopril. Prolonged use of this drug may lead to some adverse effects and the treatment can be optimized through using other therapy options. Acalypha indica Linn. (AI) may be an alternative herbal therapy for DN. The objective of this research is to investigate the renoprotective effect of AI on DN. For seven weeks, thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into groups receiving normal diet and high-fructose and high-cholesterol diet (HFCD). Then, the HFCD-fed rats were divided into four groups receiving different treatment: negative control, AI root extract (250 mg/kgBW), captopril (2.5 mg/kgBW), and combination of captopril and AI. Normal diet group was divided into AI and no treatment. After four weeks of treatment, the rats were terminated and serum urea and creatinine levels were measured. In the normal group, AI therapy decreased serum urea and creatinine levels. In the HFCD groups, AI and captopril monotherapy groups had increased serum urea levels, but lower compared to negative control. Meanwhile, serum creatinine levels decreased in both groups. However, these findings are not statistically significant. We found that combination therapy group had the highest increase in serum urea level, which was significantly different with captopril group (p=0.01). Serum creatinine level was also increased in this group. Our present study showed that AI tend to reduce serum urea and creatinine levels in normal diet group and inhibit the increase of serum urea and creatinine levels in rats fed with HFCD diet. Antagonistic interaction between captopril and AI might be present. ? 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Body fluids; Cholesterol; Controlled drug delivery; Fructose; Metabolism; Rats; Urea; Antagonistic interactions; Combination therapy; Diabetic nephropathy; Different treatments; High cholesterols; Negative control; Protective effects; Sprague-Dawley rats; Chemical contamination"
"Difference of acidic adding effect in ethanol extraction of white mulberry stem bark (Morus alba) and DPP-4 inhibiting activity screening for identifying its antidiabetic potential",2019,"Objective: Murberry (Morus alba) is one of the plants that can be used to treat diabetes and bioactive compounds that play a role are apigenin. Apigenin compounds have been reported to have an antidiabetic effect and are found in the form of glycosides. To separate apigenin from its glycosides, it takes the process of hydrolysis using acid. This study aims to look at the differences between ethanol extracts without hydrolysis with acids and ethanol extracts which are hydrolyzed by acid and determine their activity as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in vitro. Methods: Morus alba stem bark dry powder was extracted MAE using 96% ethanol with acid hydrolysis using HCl 2 N and extracted without acid hydrolysis then apigenin levels can be measured by each extraction process using HPLC. DPP-4 activity was evaluated using glycyl-prolyl-7-amino-4-methyl coumarin (Gly-Pro-AMC) substrate then the inhibitory effect of extracts was determined based on the number of free AMCs by measuring fluorescence at excitation wavelengths of 350-360 nm and emission wavelengths of 450-465 nm using micro-plate readers. Sitagliptin is used as a positive control of DPP-4 inhibition in this test. Result: The ethanol extraction method with acid hydrolysis can attract more apigenin compounds than the ethanol extraction method without acid hydrolysis. The level of apigenin in the sample of ethanol extract with acid hydrolysis was 0.16%, and in the ethanol extract without acid hydrolysis was 0.04%.The amount of inhibitory activity of DPP-4 Morus alba stem bark extract was 23%, which is 0.33 times the inhibition of sitagliptin activity. Conclusion: Extraction methods with acid hydrolysis are more effective in attracting apigenin compounds than without acid hydrolysis. Morus alba stem bark extract has an anti-diabetic effect through the mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibitors can be used as a reference for therapy of diabetes mellitus from natural ingredients. ? 2019 Phcogj.","alcohol; apigenin; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; hydrochloric acid; mulberry extract; sitagliptin; antidiabetic activity; Article; bark; controlled study; drug determination; drug isolation; dry powder; enzyme inhibition; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrolysis; in vitro study; Morus alba; thin layer chromatography"
"Blood Glucose and Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Level Comparison in Obese Versus Non-Obese Patients",2019,"Obesity, a major health concern worldwide, has a pathophysiology related to energy imbalance in the body. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), secreted by L cells of the intestine, acts as a signal for energy balance. GLP-1 is a satiation signal that can promote satiety and reduce food intake. Its secretion is thought to be impaired in obese individuals, causing reduced satiety and hyperphagia. This study was conducted as a clinical trial to determine the effect of breakfast with a balanced macronutrient composition (68.2% carbohydrates, 22.6% lipids, and 12.4% protein) on GLP-1 levels in 22 obese versus 21 non-obese subjects. Blood glucose levels were also evaluated Subjects were provided breakfast, followed by measurement of blood glucose and GLP-1 levels at 0, 15, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after intervention. We found that there are no significant differences between blood glucose levels in obese versus non-obese subjects before or after having breakfast with a balanced macronutrient composition (p > 0.05). There was a significant difference between GLP-1 levels in obese and non-obese subjects at 15 and 60 minutes following intervention (p = 0.042 and p = 0.037, respectively). This finding suggests that there is impairment in postprandial GLP-1 secretion in obese subjects. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"Antiretroviral activity of Pterois volitans (red lionfish) venom in the early development of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome antiretroviral alternative source",2019,"Aim: This study aimed to investigate the antiviral activity of Pterois volitans phospholipase A2 (PV-PLA2) from Indonesia to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Materials and Methods: Fresh venomous fin parts of wild PV specimens were collected from Java Sea waters. Then, it washed using phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and immersed in phosphate buffer pH 7.0 0.01 m containing CaCl2 0.001 m for 24 h. The immersed fin then allowed for extraction process by sonicating for 2×8 min with 80% pulse and 20 kHz output with temperature controlling to avoid denaturation. The crude venom (CV) extracted from the fin is allowed for purification by 80% ethanol (ET) precipitation and ammonium sulfate fractionation method. The purified PV-PLA2 then analyzed using Lowry's method, Marinette's method, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. After determining the purest and safest sample of six samples analyzed, the chosen sample then tested into simian retrovirus-2 (SRV2)-A549 culture (48×104 cells/mL at 1-4 ppm), and compared to the CV sample (1-4 ppm) and lamivudine (100 ppm). The culture then is analyzed using a quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction to find out the copy number of SRV-2 virus in each culture. Results: The protein's activity, concentration, and purity analysis revealed that the PV-PLA2 purified using ammonium sulfate fractionation has the highest activity (1.81 times higher than the CV at 80% fractionation) and has higher purity than the sample from ET fractionation. The testing of the sample purified using ammonium sulfate fractionation at 80% saturation level shown that it has a 97.78% inhibition level toward SRV2-A549 culture at 4 ppm. However, in comparison to lamivudine which has 99.55% inhibition level at 100 ppm, it needs much lower concentration to achieve the same result. Conclusion: The significant inhibition of SRV2-A549 culture shown that the PV-PLA2 extracted from PV venom has the potential to become anti-HIV substances. It would be worthwhile to further evaluate the antiretroviral activity of PV-PLA2 in the in vivo studies. ?

This condition is initiated early in childhood and progressive in nature. CVD risk factors includes hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity play a role in the development of atherosclerosis and? components in insulin resistance syndrome.One of many risk factors for insulin resistance in healthy individuals is a first-degree relative (FDR) of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. This group shows a higher risk of insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cells disruption even in adolescence, although they often remains asymptomatic. Clinical manifestations of metabolic disorders and atherosclerosis will appear earlier in the FDR T2DM group who have sedentary lifestyles and obesity, when compared to the non-FDR group. Several studies have attempted to detect metabolic disorders and subclinical atherosclerosis that might occur; therefore an early prevention can be carried out in these high-risk groups.?

"Biclustering protein interactions between HIV-1 proteins and humans proteins using LCM-MBC algorithm",2019,"Some of the protein interactions are still unidentified. Thus, many research about protein interactions had been held. HIV-1 is a dangerous virus that has no medicine yet. The research about HIV-1 proteins and human proteins interactions leads to the insight of drug target prediction. Biclustering technique is the beginning step before the prediction step. Biclustering is the process to cluster the dataset through two perspectives. The result of biclustering can be applied to predict unidentified protein interactions. Currently, this technique is more efficiently and effectively than the experimental method. The LCM-MBC is one of the biclustering algorithms to find biclusters from protein interactions dataset. This algorithm uses graph theory as the basic to obtain the maximal biclique. The algorithm can represent as enumeration tree. Every subtree result from the bicliques which are the biclusters. This algorithm performs quickly and efficiently in the term of memory consumptions. In this research, we apply the LCM-MBC algorithm for 16215 types of interactions between HIV-1 proteins and human proteins. We find 852 biclusters which the maximal bicluster has a size of 4 rows and 204 columns. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Community violence exposure and determinants of adolescent mental health: A school-based study of a post-conflict area in Indonesia",2019,"Introduction: Studies have shown the adverse impact of exposure to community violence on adolescent health. However, most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries. This study aimed at assessing the community violence exposure and the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents in Ambon, a post-conflict area in Indonesia. Material and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, school-based study involving 511 of 10th-graders from six randomly selected high schools in Kotamadya Ambon. Our participants were assessed using a set of questionnaires including the Strength Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to measure mental health problems, and the child version of the Screen for Adolescent Violence Exposure (KID-SAVE) to measure community violence exposure. The hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore the determinants of mental health problems. Results: In this study, boys reported more exposure to community violence (both in frequency and severity) than girls. Meanwhile, the girls reported higher emotional problems than boys. The hierarchical regression analyses revealed that in the total sample and among boys, the community violence exposure was associated with mental health problems. However, it was the perceived impact of community violence exposure which showed an association with mental health problems among girls. Conclusions: This study revealed the high community violence exposure among adolescents living in a post-conflict setting in Indonesia. The study also found gender differences in the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents who were exposed to CVE. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adolescent; Article; community; conflict; cross-sectional study; exposure; female; high school; human; Indonesia; male; mental health; priority journal; questionnaire; regression analysis; school; Screen for Adolescent Violence Exposure; screening; Strength Difficulties Questionnaire; violence; demography; exposure to violence; family; mental disease; sex factor; social support; statistics and numerical data; war; Adolescent; Armed Conflicts; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exposure to Violence; Family; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Mental Disorders; Residence Characteristics; Schools; Sex Factors; Social Support"
"Assessing the impact of the twin track socio-economic intervention on reducing leprosy-related stigma in Cirebon District, Indonesia",2019,"The consequences of leprosy go beyond the physical, social and psychological, as leprosy can drive persons affected and their families into poverty, stigmatization and disability. This paper describes the impact of a socio-economic development (SED) intervention that uses a twin-track approach (two micro-credit models) to reduce leprosy-related stigma in Cirebon District, Indonesia. A randomized-controlled mixed-methods study design was used to test the effectiveness of the SED intervention. Three scales were used to measure stigma and participation restrictions among 30 SED clients and 57 controls, 20 in-depth interviews with SED clients and seven Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with key persons were held and 65 profiles of the clients were written up and analysed. The qualitative data shows the socio-economic status of 44 out of 65 SED clients (67%) improved. The median family income increased by 25%, more clients reported higher self-esteem, better interaction with neighbours and less stigma than before, although disclosure concerns remained an issue. The scales indicate a positive effect of the intervention on reducing stigma (e.g., Stigma Assessment and Reduction of Impact (SARI) stigma scale mean difference total score of pre and post assessment for SED clients versus the control group was 8.5 versus 5.6). A twin track socio-economic intervention, if embedded and integrated, can increase participation, and be constructive in reducing leprosy-related stigma. ? 2019 by the authors.

In order to discover the new alternative HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs), we conducted a computer-aided drug discovery and development (CADDD) based on de novo approach. The compound library is based on 4-[(2-oxo-1,3-thiazolidin-3-yl)carbonyl] aniline. Screening of the best drug leads was evaluated from several parameters, such as docking and interaction analysis, pharmacology, in silico preclinical trial and molecular dynamics analysis. The inhibitory activity of these new designed ligands against Homo sapiens class II HDAC was determined by molecular docking simulation. Docking analysis yielded eight best ligands which have better binding affinity than the standards. Therefore, interaction analysis indicated that all best ligands performed coordination with Zn2+ cofactor in HDAC charge-relay system which are essential for HDAC inhibitory activities of these inhibitors. Pharmacology analysis and preclinical trials of these compounds including pharmacology properties, bioactivity, mutagenicity–carcinogenicity, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties were done through in silico methods. Through this analysis, the best ligands meet Lipinski's rule of five, have a better drug score than standards, and show good bioactivities, oral bioavailability and ADMET properties. All best ligands also have good synthetic accessibility and were proved to be new compounds that have never been synthesized before. Stability of HDAC–ligand complexes was also calculated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Based on this simulation, complex of the best ligands with corresponding HDAC has a good stability based on RMSD (root mean square deviation) and interaction analysis. The study thus reveals eight best ligands (F, Ib14, O38, Kb17, Gd40, Aa50, Gc42 and Bb38) which have better binding affinity against human class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) through molecular docking, dynamics and interaction analysis. The best ligands were also found to have good bioactivities, oral bioavailability and ADMET properties through in silico pharmacology analysis and preclinical trial. These compounds were found to have a good synthetic accessibility; therefore they could be synthesized for further biological and clinical test. ? 2015 The Authors","Binding energy; Bioactivity; Carbonyl compounds; Complexation; Corrosion inhibitors; Developing countries; Diseases; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; 2-Oxo-1,3-thiazolidine; CADDD; Cervical cancers; Computer-aided drug discovery; HDAC; Molecular docking simulations; Molecular dynamics simulations; Root mean square deviations; Ligands"
"APASL clinical practice recommendation: how to treat HCV-infected patients with renal impairment?",2019,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those on hemodialysis due to nosocomial infections and past blood transfusions. While a majority of HCV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease are asymptomatic, some may ultimately experience decompensated liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. Administration of a combination of elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12?weeks leads to high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in patients with HCV genotypes (GTs) 1a, 1b or 4 and stage 4 or 5 CKD. Furthermore, a combination of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8–16?weeks also results in high SVR rates in patients with all HCV GTs and stage 4 or 5 CKD. However, these regimens are contraindicated in the presence of advanced decompensated cirrhosis. Although sofosbuvir and/or ribavirin are not generally recommended for HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment, sofosbuvir-based regimens may be appropriate for those with mild renal impairment. To eliminate HCV worldwide, HCV-infected patients with renal impairment should be treated with interferon-free therapies. ? 2018, The Author(s).","asunaprevir; beclabuvir; boceprevir; daclatasvir; elbasvir; elbasvir plus grazoprevir; glecaprevir; glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir; grazoprevir; ledipasvir; ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir; ombitasvir; ombitasvir plus paritaprevir plus ritonavir; paritaprevir; pibrentasvir; ribavirin; simeprevir; sofosbuvir; telaprevir; velpatasvir; voxilaprevir; ABT-493; antivirus agent; benzimidazole derivative; benzofuran derivative; elbasvir-grazoprevir drug combination; imidazole derivative; pibrentasvir; quinoxaline derivative; sofosbuvir; sulfonamide; Article; clinical practice; disease classification; drug efficacy; drug safety; hemodialysis; hepatitis C; human; kidney failure; kidney graft; priority journal; sustained virologic response; chronic hepatitis C; chronic kidney failure; complication; drug combination; drug contraindication; genetics; genotype; Hepacivirus; practice guideline; Antiviral Agents; Benzimidazoles; Benzofurans; Contraindications, Drug; Drug Combinations; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Imidazoles; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Quinoxalines; Sofosbuvir; Sulfonamides; Sustained Virologic Response"
"Analysis of occupational safety and health risk perception of elementary school employees in Depok City, Indonesia",2019,"Risk perception is a subjective assessment of the likelihood of an accident and how aware a person is of its consequences. Perception is also an important factor that acts as a precursor to a behavior or a basis for risk prevention. School employees are in direct contact with children, who often have accidents. Therefore, risk perception studies involving school employees are required to develop any necessary accident prevention programs. Ten health and safety risks were chosen, which were being pinched, hit or pricked; falling down the stairs; being hit by a motorized vehicle; fire; natural disasters; noise; food contamination; hazardous chemicals; eye strain; and stress due to workload. Nine psychometric paradigms, namely: Voluntariness of risk, the immediacy of effect, known to those exposed to of risk, known to science, controllability, newness, chronic-catastrophic, common-dread, and severity of consequences, were used to evaluate the perception. The population of this study was all teachers and administrative staff at 14 primary schools at Depok City. The total number of respondents was 199 people. This study shows that, of the ten risks studied, a risk that can be accepted voluntarily is eye strain; risks that cannot be accepted voluntarily are fire and contaminated food; a risk that has a delayed effect is stress due to workload; a long-standing risk which has an immediate effect is being pinched, hit or pricked; a risk that is known to science and is often experienced but can be controlled is eye strain; while a risk which has many effects, may be fatal, and is feared and uncontrollable is a natural disaster. It was shown that natural disaster has been perceived as unacceptable risk among ten risks under study. The perception of natural disasters was that they are catastrophic, dreaded, certainly fatal, and sometimes uncontrollable. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Maternal contributors to intergenerational nutrition, health, and well-being: revisiting the Tanjungsari Cohort Study for effective policy and action in Indonesia",2019,"Perinatal and maternal mortalities in Java became of concern in the 1980s. Since some 90% of births took place at home, the Tanjungsari (TS) district of West Java was identfied as a locality where community-based risk management strategy might reduce this health burden. In 1987, traditional birth attendants (TBA) were trained to identify risk factors for unfavourable birth outcomes. From January 1st 1988 to December 1989, some 4,000 pregnant women in TS were followed and assigned either a trained or untrained TBA. In the first year, early neonatal, and maternal mortality rates (MMR) (32.9 per 1000 and 170 per 100,000 deliveries respectively) were reduced, but not sustained in the second year. Nationally, MMR was 446 in 2009 and 126 in 2015. Although possible to improve health worker performance, and community engagement, the most likely explanation for benefit attrition is that people and material resources 'downstream' of the TBA services were inadequate. Three decades later, Indonesian neonatal and maternal mortality rates of 14 per 1000 and 126 per 100,000 live births in 2015 (globally 16.2 in 2009 and 216 in 2015) according to UNICEF, still demanded improvement, despite more hospital-based births. The original 1988 cohort of women, their children and grandchildren, can now be interrogated for medium to long term health outcomes of nutritional, such as birth weight and growth, and other risk factors. The evolving TS cohort health and nutrition intermediates and endpoints are instructive. Maternal and early life factors predict adult energy metabolism and cognitive function.","adolescent; adult; child; cohort analysis; education; female; health care policy; human; Indonesia; infant; low birth weight; male; maternal welfare; midwife; newborn; pregnancy; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Indonesia; Infant; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Health; Midwifery; Pregnancy; Young Adult"
"Disease- and Treatment-related Morbidity in Adolescents with Perinatal HIV Infection in Asia",2019,"Background: Perinatally HIV-infected adolescents (PHIVA) are exposed to a chronic systemic infection and long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART), leaving them susceptible to morbidities associated with inflammation, immunodeficiency and drug toxicity. Methods: Data collected 2001 to 2016 from PHIVA 10-19 years of age within a regional Asian cohort were analyzed using competing risk time-to-event and Poisson regression analyses to describe the nature and incidence of morbidity events and hospitalizations and identify factors associated with disease-related, treatment-related and overall morbidity. Morbidity was defined according to World Health Organization clinical staging criteria and U.S. National Institutes of Health Division of AIDS criteria. Results: A total 3,448 PHIVA contributed 17,778 person-years. Median age at HIV diagnosis was 5.5 years, and ART initiation was 6.9 years. There were 2,562 morbidity events and 307 hospitalizations. Cumulative incidence for any morbidity was 51.7%, and hospitalization was 10.0%. Early adolescence was dominated by disease-related infectious morbidity, with a trend toward noninfectious and treatment-related morbidity in later adolescence. Higher overall morbidity rates were associated with a CD4 count <350 cells/μL, HIV viral load ?10,000 copies/mL and experiencing prior morbidity at age <10 years. Lower overall morbidity rates were found for those 15-19 years of age compared with 10-14 years and those who initiated ART at age 5-9 years compared with <5 or ?10 years. Conclusions: Half of our PHIVA cohort experienced a morbidity event, with a trend from disease-related infectious events to treatment-related and noninfectious events as PHIVA age. ART initiation to prevent immune system damage, optimize virologic control and minimize childhood morbidity are key to limiting adolescent morbidity. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"In silico and in vitro identification of candidate SIRT1 activators from Indonesian medicinal plants compounds database",2019,"Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a class III family of protein histone deacetylases involved in NAD+-dependent deacetylation reactions. It has been suggested that SIRT1 activators may have a protective role against type 2 diabetes, the aging process, and inflammation. This study aimed to explore and identify medicinal plant compounds from Indonesian Herbal Database (HerbalDB) that might potentially become a candidate for SIRT1 activators through a combination of in silico and in vitro methods. Two pharmacophore models were developed using co-crystalized ligands that allosterically bind with SIRT1 similar to the putative ligands used by SIRT1 activators. Then, these were used for the virtual screening of HerbalDB. The identified compounds were subjected to molecular docking and 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation. Molecular dynamics simulation was analyzed using MM-GB(PB)SA methods. The compounds identified by these methods were tested in an in vitro study using a SIRT-Glo? luminescence assay. Virtual screening using structure-based pharmacophores predicted that mulberrin as the best candidate SIRT1 activator. Virtual screening using ligand-based pharmacophores predicted that gartanin, quinidine, and quinine to be the best candidates as SIRT1 activators. The molecular docking studies showed the important residues involved were Ile223 and Ile227 at the allosteric region. The MM-GB(PB)SA calculations confirmed that mulberrin, gartanin, quinidine, quinine showed activity at allosteric region and their EC50 in vitro values are 2.10; 1.79; 1.71; 1.14 μM, respectively. Based on in silico and in vitro study results, mulberin, gartanin, quinidine, and quinine had good activity as SIRT1 activators. ? 2019 The Authors","Acetylation; Database systems; Ligands; Molecular modeling; Pharmacodynamics; Plants (botany); Reaction kinetics; Medicinal plants; Molecular dynamics simulations; Pharmacophores; SIRT1 activator; Virtual Screening; Molecular dynamics; SIRT1 protein, human; sirtuin 1; chemistry; factual database; human; Indonesia; medicinal plant; metabolism; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; Databases, Factual; Humans; Indonesia; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Plants, Medicinal; Sirtuin 1"
"Diagnosis and treatment of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis with bone lesion in pediatric patient: A case report",2019,"Background: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare group of disorders without a well understood etiology. Known formerly as histiocytosis X, the disease has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including eosinophilic granuloma (solitary bone lesion), diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos. Many of these patients initially present to orthopaedic surgeons, and misdiagnosis is frequent. Methods: We deliver a case of a 10-month-old boy who consulted to our department. Previously misdiagnosed as a Kawasaki syndrome, TORCH, and osteomyelitis. He had undergone several examinations and had been discussed in clinocipathological conference (CPC) to narrow down the diagnosis. Result: After serial examinations, the diagnosis of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis was confirmed and chemotherapy was initiated. And after 6 cycles of chemotherapy, with 1-week interval of each therapy, the clinical appearance of this patient significantly improved. Conclusion: Despite major advances in our understanding and management of LCH, it remains one of the most challenging diagnoses for the orthopedic surgeon. By doing a comprehensive examination, it is possible to narrowing down the diagnosis and planning the accurate treatment. ? 2019 The Author(s)","etoposide; vinblastine; Article; bone lesion; bone radiography; case report; clinical article; cortical bone; echography; femur; fever; hemoptysis; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; infant; Langerhans cell histiocytosis; lymphadenopathy; male; multiple cycle treatment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pediatric patient; rectum hemorrhage; soft tissue; thigh; throat irritation"
"The antiviral effect of indonesian medicinal plant extracts against dengue virus in vitro and in silico",2019,"Dengue infections are still a worldwide burden, especially in Indonesia. There is no specific medication against the dengue virus. Recently, many types of research have been conducted to discover a new drug for dengue virus using natural resource extracts. Indonesia, as a tropical country, has a wide biodiversity. There are several medicinal plants in Indonesia that are believed to possess anti-dengue activity, such as Myristica fatua, Cymbopogon citratus, and Acorus calamus plants. We conducted an in vitro laboratory experiment of several extracts from Indonesian herbs combined with in silico analysis. The extracts were evaluated for safety and antiviral activity in Huh7it-1 cell lines, using a single dose of 20 ?g/mL and dose-dependent (5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 ?g/mL) of plant extracts against dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) NGC strain. The DMSO 0.1% was used as a negative control. The cytotoxic aspect was assessed by counting the cell viability, while the antiviral activity was calculated by counting the average inhibition. The selectivity index (SI) of plant extracts were performed from a ratio of CC50/EC50 value. In silico analysis was conducted to determine the free energy of binding between NS5 of dengue virus with bioactive compounds contained in Myristica fatua, Cymbopogon citratus and Acorus calamus extract plants. We determined that all extracts were not toxic against Huh7it-1 cell lines. The methanolic extracts of A. calamus, C. citratus, and M. fatua showed inhibition of DENV-2 at a dose of 20 ?g/mL to 96.5%, 98.9%, and 122.7%, respectively. The dose-dependent effects showed that M. fatua has the best inhibition activity towards DENV-2. Molecular docking result showed that artesunic acid within M. fatua has the best free energy of binding (?7.2 kcal/mol), followed by homoegonol (?7.1 kcal/mol) which was slightly different from artesunic acid among others. The methanolic extracts of A. calamus, C. citratus, and M. fatua showed prospective anti-dengue activities both in vitro and in silico. Future research should be conducted to find the pure extracts of all useful herbs as a new candidate of antiviral drug. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Random-Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation for Analysis of Gene Expression Data in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)",2019,"The application of mathematics in the field of bioinformatics has been widely developed. For example Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are state of the art for classification of cancer in many applications. One of them is Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). CKD is one of the kidney diseases that sufferers are increasing and have symptoms that are difficult to detect at first. Later, microarrays in gene expression are important tools for this approach. Microarrays gene expression provides an overview of all transcription activities in biological samples. The purpose of this research is a hybrid model combining Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) can be used to classify gene expression data. RF can highly accurate, generelize better and are interpretable and SVM (called RF-SVM) to effectively predict gene expression data with very high dimensions. In addition, from the simulation results on data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, it is shown that the proposed RF-SVM is a more accurate algorithm on CKD data than RFE-SVM. ?

"Association between food marketing exposure and consumption of confectioneries among pre-school children in Jakarta",2019,"Introduction: Prevalence of obesity among pre-school children in Indonesia is increasing. Since food advertisements reach all age groups, this study was conducted to assess the association between food marketing exposure and children's consumption of confectioneries at home. Methods: Two hundred and forty caregivers of children aged 3-5 years attending 25 early childhood education centres in Central Jakarta, were interviewed in this cross-sectional study. A structured food frequency questionnaire was used to determine food marketing exposure and child dietary consumption. Chi-square tests compared consumption of confectioneries with different levels of marketing exposure. Results: Out of a total 240 caregivers, most were mothers of the study children (79.2%) and other family members (19.2%). The majority of the caregivers did not work (81.7%), and < 15.0% had graduated from university, while 42.0% lived with extended family members. The top ten confectioneries consumed by the children included chocolate wafer crisp, chocolate stick and soft candy. Among the most common food marketing practices were as advertisements on public transport, print and electronic media. The significant associations between four food marketing practices and consumption of eight types of confectioneries were key findings of this study. Receiving food promotion through short message service (SMS) was not significantly associated with consumption of the top ten confectioneries. Conclusion: A positive association was found between food marketing practices and consumption of confectioneries by pre-school children in Central Jakarta. An appropriate policy on food advertisements that targets children combined with parental food education is recommended for improving food consumption habits of young children. ? 2019 Malaysian Journal of Nutrition.",""
"Database development of carboxymethyl lysine content in foods consumed by Indonesian women in two selected provinces",2019,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in foods are increased by heat processing, and high consumption of these compounds could contribute to the pathogenesis of non-communicable disease. Yet, the information on carboxymethyl lysine (CML) content, as a part of AGEs, in dietary intakes with predominantly traditional foods with diverse food processing is lacking. We developed a database of Indonesian foods to facilitate studies involving the assessment of dietary and plasma CML concentration by liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass spectrometry. We estimated dietary CML values of 206 food items from 2-repeated 24-h recalls of 235 Indonesian women with the mean age of 36±8 years old in a cross-sectional study. All foods were listed and grouped according to the Indonesian food composition table, completed for cooking methods, amount of consumptions, and ingredients. CML values were obtained from published databases, analyzed with similar methods or calculated using other criteria. We searched and reviewed papers published between 2000 and 2017 using the keywords: ""advanced glycation end products"", ""carboxymethyl lysine"", ""diet"", and ""food"". The highest CML content per 100g of Indonesian foods were from instant noodles, chocolate, and cereal drinks, being 3.3mg, 2.9mg, and 2.6mg, respectively. While median CML content among food groups ranged between 0.1 to 0.8 mg. The major contribution of dietary CML were from steamed white rice, instant noodle, and plain rice rolls, boiled. This database can be used for estimating dietary CML in Indonesian people and should be updated by uploading new foods, revising the CML values, or conducting direct analyses. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"Impact of diabetes and sex in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients from the ASIAN-HF registry",2019,"Aims: To examine sex differences in clinical characteristics, echocardiographic features, quality of life and 1-year death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization outcomes in patients with/without diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods and results: Utilizing the Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in HF (ASIAN-HF) registry, 5255 patients (mean age 59.6 ± 13.1, 78% men) with symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were stratified by DM status to address the research aims. Despite similar prevalence of DM between Asian men (43%) and women (42%), the odds of DM increased at lower body mass index in women vs. men (? 23 vs. ? 27.5 kg/m2, Pinteraction = 0.014). DM was more strongly related to chronic kidney disease in women vs. men [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33–2.57 vs. OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11–1.56, Pinteraction = 0.009]. Sex also modified the relationship between DM and left ventricular geometry (Pinteraction = 0.003), whereby DM was associated with a more concentric left ventricular geometry in women than men. Women had lower quality of life than men (P &lt; 0.001), in both DM and non-DM groups. DM was associated with worse composite outcomes at 1 year in women vs. men [hazard ratio (HR) 1.79, 95% CI 1.24–2.60 vs. HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12–1.56; Pinteraction = 0.005). Conclusions: Asian women with HFrEF were more likely to have DM despite a lean body mass index, a greater burden of chronic kidney disease and more concentric left ventricular geometry, compared to men. Furthermore, DM confers worse quality of life, irrespective of sex, and a greater risk of adverse outcomes in women than men. These data underscore the need for sex-specific approaches to diabetes in patients with HF. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Does ethnic identity buffer or intensify the stress of discrimination among the foreign born and U.S. born? Evidence from the Miami-Dade Health Survey",2019,"This study examines the extent to which ethnic identity is a protective factor and buffers the stress of discrimination among the foreign born compared to the U.S. born in Miami-Dade County. Data were drawn from the 2011 Miami-Dade Health Survey (N?=?444), which is a countywide probability sample of adults in South Florida. Two interaction effects were observed: (a) a stronger ethnic identity was associated with less distress among the foreign born than the U.S. born; and (b) a stronger ethnic identity exacerbated the relationship between everyday discrimination and distress among the U.S. born. Ethnic identity, which involves ethnic pride, participation in cultural practices, and cultural commitment or sense of belonging, was associated with better psychological well-being among the foreign born than the U.S. born. Ethnic identity, however, was not a protective factor for the U.S. born, but rather it intensified the distressing effect of discrimination. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",""

"Step cut “V” osteotomy for acute correction in Blount's disease treatment: A case series",2019,"Introduction: Severe Blount's disease results in progressive multiplanar deformity of the lower limb. There are varus, procurvatum, and internal tibia rotational deformity. Treatment varies for each patient, depending on age, magnitude of deformity, discrepancy, psychosocial factor, and surgeon's experience. The aim of treatment is to acutely correct deformity and realign the mechanical axis. We proposed a technique of step cut “V” Osteotomy which could achieve the aim of treatment safely and effectively. Methods: Twenty-seven legs from eighteen patients were underwent Step Cut “V” Osteotomy technique in our institution from 2015 to 2017 to produce overvalgus correction. Eleven patients had bilateral deformities, and seven patients had unilateral deformity. All patients had mechanical axis deviation (MAD) away medially to the center of the knee, increase of tibiofemoral angle, and Drennan angle. Outcomes were recorded postoperatively such as infection, compartment syndrome, nerve palsy, range of motion, stability of knee ligaments, union time, early weight bearing and recurrence. Results: From this Step Cut “V” Osteotomy, we can accurately measure the angle of correction we want to achieve preoperatively. Drennan angle and Tibiofemoral angle (TFA) of the patients improved with subsequent correction of interbal tibia rotation and procurvatum. No complication of compartment syndrome and nerve palsy were found. Patient could perform early mobilization, and weight bearing on second month after surgery because of strong fixation and good ligament stability. No significant postoperative infection occurred. Union time achieved in two to three months, but four legs from patients over 4 years old who underwent surgery experienced a recurrence. Conclusion: Step Cut “V” Osteotomy is a simple, safe and effective technique for acute correction of severe Blount's disease. And can produce an accurate correction, high union rate and early weight bearing with no complication as a result that would be achieved at the end of treatment. ? 2019 The Authors","adolescent; Article; Blount disease; body mass; child; clinical article; compartment syndrome; cross-sectional study; deformity; disease classification; female; follow up; human; Indonesia; intraoperative period; knee; knee ligament; male; mechanics; mobilization; nerve paralysis; obesity; osteosynthesis; osteotomy; patella; patient compliance; postoperative infection; priority journal; range of motion; recurrence risk; surgical technique; tibia osteotomy; tibia torsion; valgus deformity; weight bearing"

"Experience of domestic violence survivor women in searching their life purpose and self-resilience",2019,"Victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) often experience several psychological disorders, such as anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression, driving them to a point where they lose their life purpose. Resilience implies the ability of victimized women to adapt to their stressful situations or recover by regaining the balance among their physiological, psychological, and social aspects of life. Those who attain self-resilience are called survivors-a phenomenon that has been scarcely investigated regarding the discovery of life purpose and self-resilience of women who are survivors of IPV in Central Java. Thus, this study aims to gain insight into the experience of IPV survivors in discovering their life purpose and self-resilience. We conducted qualitative research on six IPV survivors and determined four themes-self-reliance and bravery marking the beginning of life recovery, support from the closest person who provides strength, coping strategies used for the survival, and learning from experience to reinforce future goals. This study recommends mental health nurses to act as counselors for IPV survivors to support them in their recovery phase to enhance the mental health of patients. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""

"The effectiveness of trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and releasable suture in posner-schlossman syndrome with secondary glaucoma: A case series",2019,"The aim of this study is to describe the effectiveness of trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and releasable suture in Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS) with secondary glaucoma. Early treatment is the key to successful management of PSS with secondary glaucoma. However, unremitting exposure of high intraocular pressure (IOP) because of the high recurrence rate of PSS may cause further optic nerve damage and visual field defect. It is assumed that trabeculectomy may become the surgical treatment of choice in order to prevent further damage to the optic nerve despite recurring attack of PSS. Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and releasable suture was performed in 5 patients (3 females and 2 males) with recurring attacks of PSS and secondary glaucoma after acute attack had subsided. Before surgery, these patients had already suffered more than 3 acute attacks which were alleviated with antiglaucoma and anti-inflammatory medications; however, optic nerve damage and visual field defect had already developed. After trabeculectomy, 4 patients experienced no recurrent attacks during the follow-up period. One patient only suffered another episode of acute attack; however, an abrupt increase in IOP of more than 22 mmHg did not occur. In all cases, blebs were well formed, and no further optic nerve damage or visual field defects were observed up until final follow-up. In PSS with secondary glaucoma, medication may alleviate the IOP increase and inflammation; however, there is still a chance of damage occurring to the optic nerve each time an attack recurs. Trabeculectomy may be considered a safe and effective surgical treatment modality in PSS with secondary glaucoma in order to prevent further optic nerve damage due to the extreme IOP spike in each recurrent attack.","alkylating agent; eye drops; mitomycin; adult; case report; female; glaucoma; human; intraocular pressure; male; middle aged; optic nerve disease; pathophysiology; postoperative complication; procedures; sclera; suture technique; trabeculectomy; treatment outcome; Adult; Alkylating Agents; Female; Glaucoma; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Mitomycin; Ophthalmic Solutions; Optic Nerve Diseases; Postoperative Complications; Sclera; Suture Techniques; Trabeculectomy; Treatment Outcome"
"Protein intake, prognostic nutritional index and quality of life in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy",2019,"BACKGROUND: It has not been well understood whether the quality and quantity of protein intake could affect the quality of life. Quality of life is associated with nutritional status, but the usage of prognostic nutritional index (PNI) to reflect quality of life of head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy also still has not been widely studied. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed in 61 head and neck cancer patient undergoing radiotherapy. The quantity and quality of protein intake were obtained using semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) which was analized by analyzed using Nutrisurvey 2007, PNI was obtained using a calculation of Onodera's formula based on laboratory data of serum albumin and total lymphocyte count (TLC), and domains of quality of life were obtained from the interview of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and EORTC Quality of Life Head and Neck module (QLQ-H & N35) and then calculated to get each domain's score on quality of life. RESULTS: Patient's median of total protein intake was 1.42 (0.26-4.11) g/kg/day. The median of PNI was 45.9 (29.4- 54.2). Quantity of protein intake was significantly correlated with several symptoms domain of quality of life. PNI was also significantly correlated with one functional domain and two symptom domains of quality of life. This study did not show a significant correlation between quantity and quality of protein intake with PNI. CONCLUSION: PNI has the potential to reflect quality of life of head and neck cancer patients. Future studies might be beneficial to show the usage of PNI to reflect quality of life, especially involving the progressivity of quality of life. ? 2019 Prodia Education and Research Institute.",""
"Dashboarding the maternal and child health profiles for health supporting system",2019,"Various types of health data are routinely collected and published as national health profiles. However, these vast amounts of data are not always used effectively since they are presented in raw tabular data sets, fragmented, and are not well-equipped with the statistical data inferences and the trend of changes which are essential to explore some unknown previous information. In this paper, we propose how to manage the national open health data sets as a dashboard application to support the decision making for maternal and child health-care services in Indonesia. The research was conducted in four steps. First, we described what maternal and child health parameters are involved in relation to the availability of open and accessible data set. Second, we designed the dashboard application based on Kimball's four step dimensional modelling. Third, we implemented the schema modelling as data warehouse by executing ETL (extract, transform and load) and OLAP (On Line Analytical Processing) cubes. Fourth, we analyzed the results with the business intelligence approach. We explored the open data sets in four consecutive years (2014-2017) and determined seven types of business process, i.e. analysis of health profile on neonates, infants, and children, analysis of maternal health profile before, during and after pregnancy period, and analysis of health supporting factors. By applying data warehouse and business intelligence, our proposed system has the ability to integrate and extract a number of tabular and fragmented data sets into an easy and quickly inferred information about the current situation of maternal and children health care services. ? 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

"Gut Microbiota Profiles in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Its Possible Impact on Disease Progression Evaluated with Transient Elastography: Lesson Learnt from 60 Cases",2019,"Background: Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been considered to have a role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression. However, there is still lack of studies regarding this phenomenon. Aim: To find the difference in the proportion of gut microbiota in NAFLD patients based on the stages of liver fibrosis. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, which is the largest tertiary referral center. Human fecal samples from NAFLD patients who came to the outpatient clinic were collected consecutively. The stool sample examination was performed using an isolation DNA kit (Tiangen) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Fast 7500). Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. The stage of fibrosis was diagnosed based on transient elastography (FibroScan? 502 Touch; Echosens, France). Results: Of 60 NAFLD human fecal samples, 35 patients had nonsignificant fibrosis and 25 patients had significant fibrosis (46.7% male and 53.3% female; median age 56 years). Most patients had diabetes (85%), dyslipidemia (58.3%), obesity (58.3%), and central obesity (90%). The proportion of Bacteroides was higher when compared to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. Of these 3 microbiota, the proportion of Bacteroides was significantly higher in the significant fibrosis group when compared to the nonsignificant fibrosis group. Conclusion: There is a change in the composition of gut microbiota in NAFLD patients. The proportion of Bacteroides is significantly higher in significant liver fibrosis, which may play a role in NAFLD progression. ? 2019 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.",""
"DiabCare Asia 2012: Diabetes management, control, and complications in patients with type 2 diabetes in Indonesia",2019,"BACKGROUND Indonesia was a part of the most recent edition of DiabCare Asia held in 2008. DiabCare Asia 2012 is modeled after a similar project to provide the latest information to facilitate healthcare policymaking in this area. METHODS This was an observational, non-interventional, cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from primary, secondary, and tertiary care centers in Indonesia. Patient data collected included demography, medical history complications, eye and foot examinations, diabetes management, and most recent laboratory investigations. Blood samples were collected from all patients for the analysis of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). RESULTS A total of 1,967 patients participated in the study, with a mean (SD) age of 58.4 (9.5) years and a median (range) duration of diabetes 6.0 (0.1-47.0) years. The percentage of patients with HbA1c <7.0% was 30.8% and the mean (SD) HbA1c level was 8.3 (2.2%). The proportion of patients using insulin was 34.7% with a mean (SD) total daily dose of 37.9 (24.1) IU. The most common diabetes-related complications were peripheral neuropathy (59.1%), erectile dysfunction (32.4%), and eye complications (29.1%).

"A multicentre randomized controlled trial of food supplement intervention for wasting children in Indonesia-study protocol",2019,"Background: After the first six months of exclusive breastfeeding, children are introduced to liquids and semi-solid food, known as the complementary feeding phase. This phase is critical because it is often accompanied by improper feeding in children, which may lead to wasting and other nutrition problems. Fortified biscuits have been provided for wasting children as a nationwide programme. However, the ability of children to accept food supplementation remains questionable. This paper describes the protocol of a study investigating the efficacy of food supplementation (PMT biscuit) and nutrition education to improve the nutritional status of wasting children in Indonesia. Method: The efficacy of a government food supplementation programme will be examined using a randomized control trial design. Parents with wasting children aged 6-17 months will be recruited to participate in the study. After obtaining informed consent and pre-intervention measures, participants will be assigned into three arms of intervention with PMT biscuits and/or nutrition education only. The two primary outcomes for this study are the nutritional status of wasting children and PMT biscuit compliance. Characteristics of all subjects in each arm will be analysed and compared with each other to assess their comparability at the beginning. The data will be collected at pre-intervention, at 3 months of intervention, post-intervention, and at the 6- to 9-month follow up. Discussion: This paper aims to describe the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of different PMT biscuit portion and nutrition education in two arms and nutrition education only in another arm. This study is important because it will provide evidence for the Indonesian government regarding the efficacy of food supplementation and/or food-based recommendations to improve the nutritional status of wasting children aged 6-23 months in Indonesia.

"The effect of reinfection with the same serotype on dengue transmission dynamics",2019,"Dengue is worldwide problem with around 390 million cases annually. Dengue is caused by four dengue serotypes: DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, DEN4. Individuals obtain lifelong immunity to the serotype they are infected with. This becomes the main underlying assumptions of most modeling work on dengue. However, data from West Java, Indonesia, showed that there is a possibility for individuals to be reinfected by the same strain, which may result in significantly different dengue transmission dynamics. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-strain dengue model taking into account the reinfection with the same dengue serotype. We examine the effects of reinfection with the same serotype, study symmetric epidemiological characteristics and investigate the effects of antibody-dependent enhancement on dengue transmission dynamics by using a mathematical model. We analyse the stability of the model and perform global sensitivity analysis to determine the most influential parameters. We found that the model has four equilibrium points: disease-free, two partially endemic and coexistence equilibria. We also presented two Basic Reproductive Ratio Ri associated with the first and the second strain of the viruses. The stability of the model is determined by the condition of basic reproductive ratio. We found that when the degree of immunity to the same strain, κ, is between zero and one, the existence of endemic equilibrium is determined by κ?i, where ?i is the basic reproductive ratio. Furthermore, we found that reinfection with the same serotype contributes an increase in the number of primary and secondary dengue cases. The results suggest that it is likely that reinfection with the same serotype may be one of the underlying factors causing an increase in the number of secondary infection. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Antibodies; Convergence of numerical methods; Dynamics; Viruses; Antibody-dependent enhancements; Basic reproduction ratios; Basic reproductive ratio; Dengue haemorrhagic fevers; Endemic equilibrium; Global sensitivity analysis; Transmission dynamics; Transmission model; Sensitivity analysis"

"A predictive policy model to forecast outcomes of drug development in developing countries",2019,"Purpose: The World Health Organization has pointed out that the majority of developing countries currently rely on imported drugs, in spite of the fact that there is potential for them to produce their own drugs. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework as an innovation policy model that can strategically predict the outcome of drug development investment in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: In order to explore a model relevant to the policy-making process, the literature was systematically reviewed with a focus on the impact of policy changes on drug development in developing countries. Findings: An innovation policy model consists of the relational influences of contextual variables of pharma capabilities, innovation incentives and political factors affecting drug development in developing countries, derived from a dissenting policy-making perspective. This was built to test two hypotheses of a positive relationship between the above variables; and a perspectives gap between the pharmaceutical companies and the policymakers. These hypotheses address issues related to the lack of drug development in developing countries. Research limitations/implications: This paper presents a conceptual framework for the evaluation and provides examples of its use, but it is currently at a relatively early stage of research. Further work is currently underway and will later be presented to the same journal. Social implications: Domestic drug development in developing countries needs to be feasible in order to ensure drug security. This predictive policy model provides a comprehensive approach to health policy reforms to examine innovation strategies. Originality/value: This model includes measures to explore whether pharma capabilities, innovation incentives and/or political factors have an effect on domestic drug development in developing countries. It bridges the policy implementation’s operational process between pharmaceutical companies and policymakers. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article; conceptual framework; developing country; drug bioavailability; drug cost; drug development; drug efficacy; drug industry; drug manufacture; drug quality; drug safety; economic development; financial management; government; health care policy; investment; management; methodology; outcome assessment; personnel management; political system; prediction; prescription; priority journal; protocol compliance; public health; structural equation modeling"
"Analysis of tuberculosis treatment suitability and the drug supervisor’s role in a community health center in pademangan subdistrict, north jakarta",2019,"Objective: Appropriate tuberculosis (TB) treatment guidelines are one of the many factors that influence the success of TB treatment. The patient’s drug supervisor is a functional role that is part of the directly observed treatment short course, a program to support the success of TB treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze the TB treatment suitability in a community health center and the benefit of treatment compliance supervision by the patient’s designated drug supervisor. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Community Health Center of Pademangan subdistrict, North Jakarta, involving 205 subjects to analyze appropriate fixed-dose combination (FDC) anti-TB drug administration and an experimental study involving 23 control group TB patients and 23 intervention group TB patients to assess the benefit of supervision by each patient’s drug supervisor. Results: The association of FDC anti-TB drug side effects with the success of TB treatment was not statistically significant (p=0.173). There was an increase in drug supervisor knowledge of 8.6% in the intervention group and 13% in the control group. There was no statistically significant association between the knowledge of the drug supervisor and the 2nd month (p=0.575) and the 6th month of sputum treatment. Conclusion: Minor side effects of FDC anti-TB drug did not affect the success of TB treatment; therefore, treatment was continued if these adverse events occurred. There were no correlations between the drug supervisor knowledge level with medication compliance or with sputum conversion (months 2 and 6). ? 2019 The Authors.","tuberculostatic agent; adolescent; adult; Article; clinical supervision; controlled study; counseling; cross-sectional study; female; health center; human; interview; major clinical study; male; medical record; medication compliance; patient compliance; prevalence; questionnaire; radiodiagnosis; short course therapy; sputum smear; training; tuberculosis"
"Why don’t couples use the contraceptive that’s best for them? Social determinants of long acting and permanent contraceptive method use in Indonesia",2019,"Objectives: To examine social determinants of long acting and permanent contraceptive method (LAPM) use among currently married Indonesian women aged 15 to 49 years. Method. Data were derived from a cross-sectional study in Tuban, Kediri, and Lumajang District (East Java Province) and Lombok Barat, Lombok Timur, and Sumbawa District (West Nusa Tenggara Province). Information was obtained from 5,930 respondents using a structure questionnaire. We estimated adjusted odds ratios to evaluate for social determinant factors associated with LAPMs use using multivariate logistic regressions. Results. The prevalence of LAPMs use was 19%. The odds of LAPMs use among women who paid transport cost were higher than that among women who paid none. Similarly, LAPMs use were positively associated with LAPMs availability, encouragement to use LAPMs, perceived distance, knowledge about LAPMs, desire to have no more children, and contraceptive decisions jointly with husbands. Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate the relatively low level of LAPMs use among currently married Indonesian women, and highlight social determinants that influence women to choose LAPMs. Further studies are warranted to include health provider perspective as well as collecting qualitative data in order to adequately assess behaviors of women associated with LAPMs use. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"CD133, CD44, and ALDH1A1 as cancer stem cell markers and prognostic factors in epithelial ovarian cancer",2019,"BACKGROUND Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Epithelial ovarian cancer type II is characterized by rapid tumor growth and is genetically more labile than type I. This study was aimed to demonstrate the prognostic value of CSC by using the markers CD133, CD44, and ALDH1A1 in EOC. METHODS Clinicopathological and demographic data were collected from medical records. The markers CD133, CD44, and ALDH1A1 were examined with flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression in patients with ovarian cancer types I and II were related to chemotherapy and survival. In multivariate analysis, the prognosis model was tested for ten months. RESULTS The largest demographic consisted of patients aged ?45 years, with stage I, poor differentiation, and type II, of which there were 40 samples (72.7%), 23 samples (41.8%), 30 samples (54.5%), and 16 samples (29.1%), respectively. There is a high correlation between the 10-month chemotherapy response and the 4 variables, i.e., age ?45 years, type II, stage III-IV, and CD44, with an ROC of 80.75% and a post-test probability of 82.5%. Using the ROC curve, the highest chemoresistance score was 0.841, based on the combination of CSCs markers and clinicopathological factors, that is stage III-IV, age ?45 years, poor differentiation, type II, negative CD133, high CD44, and high ALDH1A1.

"Promoter hypermethylation in progesterone receptor-A (PGR-A) and PGR-B gene decreased its mRNA expression in ovarian endometriosis",2019,"The pathophysiology of endometriosis is not fully understood. It is believed that Progesterone Receptors (PGRs) play an important rule in the development of the disease. PGRs are expressed in human endometrial stromal. Reduction level of PGRs is related to the molecular basis of progesterone resistance in endometriosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between methylation level of PGR-A and PGR-B gene and its mRNA expression in ovarian endometriosis. We used endometriotic tissues from 20 patients, aged 20-35 years, compared to endometrial tissues obtained from 20 normal women, age-matched to endometriosis group, who underwent micro-curettage to evaluate methylation status and mRNA expression of PGR-A and PGR-B gene. Methylation status of both PGRs was analyzed using MSP, and mRNA expression was investigated using qPCR. Methylation level of PGR-A (10,84%) and PGR-B (98,72%) in ovarian endometriosis were significantly different compared to control. The mRNA expression of PGR-A and PGR-B in ovarian endometriotic tissues significantly decreased by 2.35 and 6.37 folds compared to the normal endometrial tissues. Hypermethylation of PGR-B gene was correlated to mRNA expression, while methylation level of PGR-A had no correlation to mRNA expression. Promoter regions of PGR-A and -B genes in ovarian endometriosis are hypermethylated compared to controls. These hypermethylationmay reduce their expressions, hence might contribute to pathogenesis of endometriosis. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"Investigation of each society for fertility preservation in Asia",2019,"Fertility preservation (FP) remains a future direction for reproductive medicine. FP development is needed to keep up with advancements in other areas of medicine, such as cancer research that has successfully prolonged patients' survival. The demand for optimum FP is sought by both patients and practitioners alike. The American Society of Clinical Oncology has published and updated several FP guidelines. However, these guidelines need to be optimized for each country due to the nature of FP that interacts with the local policy, social decorum, and economic factors. Furthermore, the availability and success rate for each procedure might differ since there is a requirement for advanced and innovative technologies involved in FP. These guidelines should ideally be supported by the FP society to overcome unique barriers that may arise in each country. Here we try to illustrate the most recent update on the condition of FP practice in several countries in Asia. This hopefully will encourage future FP development and might become a useful reference for other countries, especially in Asia. Copyright ? 2019 Harzif, Santawi, Maidarti and Wiweko.

"Comparison between blood and non-blood cardioplegia in tetralogy of Fallot",2019,"Background: Cardioplegia is an integral part of myocardial protection. The superiority of blood cardioplegia in adult patients has been reported. However, this is yet to be studied in cyanotic pediatric patients. Methods: A randomized open-label trial was conducted in 70 patients with tetralogy of Fallot. They were divided into two groups: 35 patients had crystalloid cardioplegia (controls), and 35 had blood cardioplegia. Lactate and coronary oxygen extraction in arterial blood and the coronary sinus were measured immediately after cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass, 15 and 30 min later. Postoperative mortality, major adverse cardiac events, mechanical ventilation time, inotrope administration, arrhythmias, right ventricular function, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were observed. Results: There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes or lactate levels. There was a significant difference in coronary oxygen extraction immediately and 15 min after cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass (p = 0.038, p = 0.015). Conclusion: Blood cardioplegia gave a better postoperative oxygen extraction value but there were no differences in myocardial damage or clinical outcome between the two groups. ?

"Physical activity: Mine workers’ behavior related with metabolic syndrome",2019,"Metabolic syndrome is a term for risk factors for heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Workers have different lifestyle behaviors and work patterns that can cause metabolic syndrome. Based on medical check-up data in 2016, there were found several cases of dyslipidemia (97.5%), visual impairment (47.8%), BMI> 25 (45.2%), abnormal audiometry (17%), liver enzyme disorder (1.7%), and hypertension (10 %). Among those cases, there are 3 problems which are identified as the components of the metabolic syndrome. This study was conducted to explain the factors related to metabolic syndrome in mine workers to make control and prevention programs. A cross-sectional design was used to obtain workers lifestyle data by analyzing lifestyle questionnaire results and medical check-up data which includes central obesity, triglycerides, HDL, blood pressure and fasting blood sugar. There were significant relationships between physical activities with metabolic syndrome. No significant relationship was found between diet pattern, sleep duration, and knowledge of metabolic syndrome. Promotion and preventive controls are needed to prevent the metabolic syndrome in population, and screening of metabolic syndrome in all workers need to perform by the company to find out the magnitude of the problems. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Challenges to mothering while incarcerated: preliminary study of two women’s prisons in Java, Indonesia",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the characteristics of incarcerated women in two prisons in Java, Indonesia and discuss the specific problems and needs incarcerated women with children face with regard to mothering. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey using a semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 399 incarcerated women in two prisons. Focus group discussions provided additional information on mother’s experiences in prison. Findings: This research finds that children’s welfare was an important concern for mothers while in prison and that they faced various problems in maintaining family ties during their incarceration, including distance, costs and time for family to visit (49.3 percent), and challenges to being able to communicate with family and children (26.6 percent). Originality/value: This study contributes to the limited research on incarcerated women in Indonesia, broadly, and on mothering and incarceration, in particular, and suggests that women’s needs as mothers have not been taken into consideration by prisons and the criminal justice system. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","article; child; criminal justice; female; human; human experiment; Indonesia; major clinical study; mother; prison; prisoner; structured questionnaire; welfare; adult; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; economics; family relation; Indonesia; interpersonal communication; mother; organization and management; prison; prisoner; psychology; qualitative research; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; travel; women's health; young adult; Adult; Communication; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Mothers; Parenting; Prisoners; Prisons; Qualitative Research; Socioeconomic Factors; Travel; Women's Health; Young Adult"
"Experimental analysis of iterative-scaling fuzzy additive spectral clustering (is-FADDIS) for cancer subtypess identification",2019,"Identification of cancer subtypes based on gene expression data plays an important role to develope an appropriate therapy for the patient. However, the analysis of gene expression data related to cancer subtypes identification have many difficulties such as, high dimensional attributes, missing values and sparse data problem. To solve this problem, Iterative Scalling Fuzzy Additive Spectral Clustering (is-FADDIS) will be introduced. This research aims to compare the performance of is-FADDIS to other popular clustering techniques including Gaussian Mixture Clustering and Auto K-Means on the basis of Subtypess Cancer Identification in Human Colorectal Carcinoma and B-Cell Lymphoma dataset.

"Pathological fracture due to prolonged steroid use in a child with transverse myelitis",2019,"Introduction: Transverse myelitis (TM), a rare inflammatory disease of the spinal cord, is treated with corticosteroids that could result in other complications. Case report: We present the case of a 4-year-old boy with a closed left femoral fracture after he hit the floor. He was diagnosed with TM 1 year ago and was treated with oral methylprednisolone for 8 months. Discussion: In children, the prolonged use of corticosteroid enhances the osteoclast activity but reduces the osteoblast activity; this imbalance bone turnover causes osteoporosis that increases the fracture risk, which depends on the corticosteroid dose and treatment duration. Of note, the risk of fracture might last for years. Conclusion: The increased risk of fracture because of the prolonged use of corticosteroids might not impede the corticosteroid treatment if indicated. Hence, bone health status and nutritional monitoring must be performed at the beginning of treatment in children who need corticosteroid therapy with a cumulative dose >1 g/year. ? 2019 The Authors","methylprednisolone; Article; bone turnover; case report; child; clinical article; corticosteroid therapy; femur fracture; human; limb swelling; male; myelitis; osteoblast; osteoclast activity; osteoporosis; pain assessment; pathologic fracture; physical examination; physiotherapy; preschool child; prescription; priority journal; speech delay; speech rehabilitation; treatment duration; X ray"
"Gluteal region spindle cell variant embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in infant treated with buttockectomy",2019,"Introduction: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a soft tissue tumor developed from immature mesenchymal cells and accounts for about one-half of soft tissue sarcomas in children. However, it is very rare in infants and so, little is known about. Spindle cell variant of embryonal RMS is a rare and a better differentiated variant of embryonal RMS, having a better prognosis compared to other types of rhabdomyosarcomas. So, it needs to be distinguished from classical forms of the neoplasm. Its morphological resemblance to spindle cell neoplasms like leiomyosarcomas and fibrosarcomas may pose diagnostic difficulties for the pathologist. Gluteal region is a rare site for RMS. We report an infant with embryonal spindle cell variant RMS in the gluteal region. Case report: A one-year-old infant appeared with a history of a two-month lump on the right buttock. Her mother started to notice asymmetry on her child's buttock when she was bathing him. She noticed a lump with the size of a ping-pong ball. The patient could still crawl as usual and walk with aid. Two months later, the lump grew to the size of a tennis ball. In spite of this condition, there was no complaint of fever, weight loss or signs of pain. On the MRI, the mass appeared hypo-intense at muscle on T1-weighted images and hyper-intense on T2-weighted images. Following the administration of dimeglumine-gadopentetate contrast, T1-weighted fat-saturated scans showed intense enhancement with interspersed non-enhancing areas. We decided to do a buttockectomy followed by an adjuvant chemotherapy. Results and discussion: Initially, the incision was performed from the posterior iliac crest curving distally following the gluteus maximus muscle until the 2 cm distal of greater trochanter. The incision was curved slightly posterior back to the medial aspect of the thigh to the gluteal fold to form a large posterior skin flap. Sciatic nerve had been identified and preserved. The entire gluteus maximus muscle with the mass has been removed. After 6 months of follow-up treatments, the patient is able to walk in normal gait and accordance with his mileage. Conclusion: The spindle cell embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas is a rare variant of embryonal subtype of RMS, occurring more commonly in children and adolescents. Its less aggressive sarcoma and better prognosis in children or adolescents, establish the correct diagnosis crucial using combination of clinical finding, histopathology and Immunohistochemistry. ? 2018 The Authors","dactinomycin; desmin; gadolinium pentetate meglumine; myogenin; vincristine; adjuvant chemotherapy; Article; buttockectomy; cancer staging; embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma; exercise; follow up; gait; gluteus muscle; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; incision; infant; lesion volume; needle biopsy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical examination; priority journal; spindle cell sarcoma; tumor volume; wound healing"
"Original article effect of exposure to 2.5 ?m indoor particulate matter on adult lung function in Jakarta",2019,"Objectives: Lung function impairment due to exposure to indoor air pollution of particulate matter size 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) is not well documented in Jakarta. Methods: To assess whether there is an association between indoor PM2.5 concentration and lung function impairment among the adult population, a cross-sectional design was implemented. There were 109 adults selected aged between 20 years and 65 years from the Pulo Gadung industrial area, East Jakarta. Association and logistic regression analysis were implemented for statistical analysis of the data. Results: The average exposure to indoor PM2.5 was 308 ?g/m3. There were 38.5% of participants that had lung function impairment. PM2.5 concentration was found to be associated with lung function impairment among the adult population living in Pulo Gadung industrial area after controlling for gender, duration of exposure, ventilation, smoking status, and humidity. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that PM2.5 concentrations in the Pulo Gadung industrial area may be the main contributor to the impairment of lung function for adults living in the surrounding residential area. ? 2019 Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","adult; aged; article; artificial ventilation; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease course; female; gender; human; human experiment; humidity; indoor air pollution; industrial area; lung function test; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; residential area; smoking"
"The Role of Fragmented QRS (fQRS) As A Predictor of Major Adverse Cardiac Event within 30 days in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study",2019,"BACKGROUND: some studies show fragmanted QRS (fQRS) as a marker of myocardial scar, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular remodelling and worse coronary collaterals flow, which can increase the incidence of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) after infarction. This study aimed to identify the role of fQRS as one of the risk factors for MACE (cardiac death and reinfarction) in acute coronary syndrome patients within 30 days observation. METHODS: a cohort retrospective study was conducted using secondary data of acute coronary syndrome patients at Intensive Cardiac Care Unit Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital from July 2015 to October 2017. Multivariate analysis were done by using logistic regression with GRACE score (moderate and high risk), low eGFR (< 60 ml/min), low LVEF (< 40%), diabetes mellitus, age more than 45 years and hypertension as confounding factors. RESULTS: three hundred and fifty three (353) subjects were included. Fragmented QRS was found in 60,9 % subjects. It was more frequent in inferior leads (48.8% ) with mean onset of 34 hours. Major adverse cardiac events were higher in fQRS vs. non-fQRS group (15.8% vs. 5.8 %). Bivariate analysis showed higher probability of 30 days MACE in fQRS group (RR 2.72; 95%CI 1.3 -5.71p=0.08). Multivariate analysis revealed adjusted RR of 2.79 (95% CI: 1.29 - 4.43, p<0.05). Low eGFR was a potential confounder in this study. CONCLUSION: persistent fQRS developed in ACS during hospitalization is an independent predictor of 30 days MACE cardiac death and re-infarction.","biological marker; acute coronary syndrome; aged; complication; electrocardiography; female; glomerulus filtration rate; heart arrhythmia; human; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; statistical model; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Aged; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Biomarkers; Electrocardiography; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors"
"The role of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients evaluated using Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) Transient Elastography (TE): A tertiary referral center experience",2019,"Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging disease, where it can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been hypothesized to play an important role in NAFLD development and progression, however, there is still conflicting data about this phenomenon. Transient Elastography (TE) examination using controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) has been validated for liver disease progression assessment in NAFLD. It is non-invasive method and easy to perform in clinical practice. Therefore, we would like to know the role of SIBO in NAFLD and its possible impact on disease progression. Methods: A cross-sectional design study performed at outpatient's Hepatobiliary clinic at tertiary referral university hospital in Jakarta. All recruited study subjects based on inclusions criteria underwent laboratory examination, transabdominal ultrasound examination, CAP-TE 502 (by Echosens, France), and glucose hydrogen breath test (GHBT) using portable hydrogen breath test apparatus (Gastro+? Gastrolyzer by Bedfont Scientific Ltd). Stool sample examination was performed using RT-PCR. Results: This study recruited 160 subjects with median age of 58 (22-78) years and 108 (67.5%) of them are female. SIBO (65,5%), DM (70.8%), dyslipidemia (75.2%), obesity (76.6%), and metabolic syndrome (73%) were more prevalent in NAFLD than non-NAFLD population. Bivariate analysis showed no significant association between SIBO and NAFLD development (p = 0.191; PR 0.871; CI 95% [0.306-1.269]). SIBO was also not associated with significant hepatic steatosis (p = 0.951; PR = 0.951; CI 95% [0.452-2.239]) and fibrosis (p = 0.371; PR = 1.369; CI 95% [0.608-3.772]). However, the presence of central obesity has significantly associated with the presence of SIBO (p = 0.001; PR = 0.378; CI 95% [0.021-0.478]). Based on stool sample analysis from 60 NAFLD patients, there is a significant correlation using Spearmen test between the presence of Bacteroides and the stage of fibrosis (p.037). Further analysis between obese NAFLD patients and non-obese NAFLD patients showing that there is a significant decrease of Bifidobacteria (p.047) and Lactobacillus (p.038) in obese NAFLD patients and a tendency of increase Bacteroides in obese NAFLD patients (p.572). Conclusions: SIBO is not associated with NAFLD development and progression. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; Article; bacterial overgrowth; Bacteroides; cohort analysis; controlled attenuation parameter; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease course; dyslipidemia; fatty liver; feces analysis; female; human; hydrogen breath test; Indonesia; intestine flora; Lactobacillus; liver fibrosis; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; outpatient department; tertiary care center; transient elastography; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; elastography; liver cirrhosis; microbiology; middle aged; nonalcoholic fatty liver; pathology; procedures; small intestine; young adult; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Indonesia; Intestine, Small; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Tertiary Care Centers; Young Adult"
"Trauma Stabilisation as a Sole Treatment Intervention for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Southeast Asia",2019,"Southeast Asia contains high numbers of traumatised populations arising from either natural disasters or interpersonal violence. Consequently, the need for empirically based trauma treatments, compromised by insufficiency in appropriately trained clinicians and mental health workers, makes the situation more challenging in addressing traumatic sequelae in local populations. In response, the humanitarian/ trauma capacity building organisation, Trauma Aid Germany, trained 37 therapists in psycho-traumatology, based on EMDR Therapy, which included trauma stabilisation techniques. This research analyses the impact of Trauma Stabilisation as a sole treatment intervention for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in adults. Each client was screened for PTSD utilising the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire - pre- and post-treatment. Analysis of the data considered only those interventions focussed on trauma stabilisation, including psychoeducation. Participants receiving trauma confrontation interventions were excluded from the data. Trauma stabilisation - as a sole treatment intervention, was highly effective in alleviating PTSD diagnoses. Results demonstrate PTSD symptoms were reduced in both clinical and sub-clinical trauma groups. The data set suggests trauma stabilisation, as a sole treatment intervention, was safe, effective, efficient and sufficient treatment intervention for PTSD. Furthermore, trauma stabilisation interventions have the advantage of being safe, flexible, and adaptable to the cultural and spiritual context in which they were are applied. The research findings also have implications regarding teaching and learning and the potential utilisation of paraprofessionals, and other allied health professionals in addressing the global burden of psychological trauma. ? 2018, The Author(s).","adult; Article; comparative study; controlled study; DSM-5; female; human; ICD-11; male; mental health service; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychoeducation; psychometry; psychotrauma; remission; Southeast Asia; trauma stabilisation; Cambodia; ethnology; Indonesia; middle aged; posttraumatic stress disorder; procedures; psychotherapy; psychotrauma; standards; Thailand; transcultural care; treatment outcome; Adult; Cambodia; Culturally Competent Care; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care); Psychological Trauma; Psychotherapy; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Thailand"
"Neonatal nurse skills and Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) training: One year post-training evaluation",2019,"Perinasia's Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) training could improve the competence of health officers' knowledge and skills. Both trying the module and evaluating its results are important. Aim: This study aimed to assess the skills of neonatal nurses one year after KMC training in the Pasar Rebo District General Hospital. Method: A qualitative approach that included in-depth interviews, group discussions, and observations of the neonatal nurses’ skills in KMC was implemented. Thematic analysis was performed. Results: A year after follow-up, there was neither KMC training nor a clear policy. It was mentioned that there was a standard operating procedure (SOP) of KMC and routine transfer of health personnel. However, there were no KMC IEC materials or free KMC gowns to support the training. Conclusion: The development of KMC services in the hospital not only provided training for health personnel but also required continuation, a clear policy, a SOP, and education support materials. ? 2019","article; education; female; follow up; general hospital; human; human experiment; interview; kangaroo care; neonatal nurse; newborn; skill; thematic analysis"
"The effect of Acalypha indica Linn. extract on insulin resistance in Sprague-Dawley rats after induction of high cholesterol-high fructose diet",2019,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, inadequate insulin secretion, and excessive glucagon secretion. Metformin is the first-line medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prolonged use of metformin can cause mild and serious side effects. One of the alternative herbal remedies used to treat Type 2 diabetes mellitus is Acalypha indica Linn (AI). The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of ethanol extract AI to insulin resistance. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats are divided into six group, four groups (negative control, metformin 100mg/kgBW/day, AI extract 250mg/kgBW/day, combination metformin and AI extract) are induced with high fructose and high cholesterol diet; while two other groups (normal and normal treated with AI extract) are given normal diet. After four weeks of treatment, rats were terminated and laboratory test was performed to see plasma insulin level using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that AI extract significantly reduced plasma insulin level (p=0,018), similar to metformin (p=0,009), compare with negative control. In addition, we also calculate insulin resistance index using the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) based on plasma insulin level and blood glucose level. The combination of metformin and AI extract significantly decreased the insulin resistance index compared with the negative control (p=0,034). Therefore, AI extract can be used as a complementary to metformin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus and also as a prevention therapy of insulin resistance on normal individual. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Encapsulation of human hematopoietic stem cells with a biocompatible polymer",2019,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the progenitor for all blood types including leukocytes, erythrocytes and platelets. Normally, the human body is programmed to maintain sufficient level of hematopoietic stem cells or derivatives. However, in certain conditions, including repeated chemotherapy, leukemic cancer, or genetic mutation, bone marrow disorders; the HSC transplantation becomes necessary. HSC transplantation deals with two major obstacles: human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching and high cell dose. Non-match HSC transplantation activates immune reaction and induces graft versus host diseases, which can be fatal to the recipient. Hydrogel encapsulation technology offers a promising method to solve these problems. In this study, we introduced a feasible HSC encapsulation technique with a biocompatible polymer. The cells were isolated from umbilical cord blood with a density gradient method and continued by a magnetic bead separation based on CD34 expression. HSCs, identified as CD34 + cells, were encapsulated with collagen type 1 by a hanging drop method. The encapsulated cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in a fully humidified incubator. On day three, the capsule was degraded with collagenase treatment and the cells were analyzed to evaluate the effect of encapsulation on cell viability and stemness. It was found that the cell viability remained high on encapsulated cells. However, the ratio of CD34 + cells was slightly decreased on encapsulated cells than non-encapsulated cells. As a conclusion, the employed method is suitable to encapsulate HSCs without compromising its viability and the modification of coating material is needed to maintain the stemness of HSCs. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Comparison of IL-6 and CRP concentration between quadratus lumborum and epidural blockade among living kidney donors: A randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: An adequate anesthesia technique generates appropriate postoperative analgesic properties and decreases the patient’s stress response. This will lead to decreased morbidity and mortality associated with immunology disturbances, such as infection, prolonged wound healing, and sepsis. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, as the markers of the stress response, between continuous epidural and quadratus lumborum (QL) block as postoperative analgesia techniques among living kidney donors. Methods: Sixty-two patients were randomly divided into two equal groups: continuous epidural and QL block. A group received bilateral QL block with 20mLof bupivacaine 0.25% and the other received 6 mL/hour of bupivacaine 0.25% continuously via an epidural catheter. Prior to extubation, the QL block group received bilateral QL block with the same dose and the continuous epidural group was administered with 6 mL/hour of bupivacaine 0.125%. Blood samples were drawn to compare IL-6 and CRP concentrations after intubation (preoperatively), directly after surgery, 24 hours postoperatively, and 48 hours postoperatively. Postoperative pain was measured with the numerical rating scale (NRS). Morphine requirement and duration of catheter usage were also measured postoperatively. Side effects within 24 hours postoperatively were noted. Data were analyzed with independent t-test or Mann- Whitney test. Results: No difference was observed between the groups in the plasma concentration of IL-6 either after surgery or 24 hours postoperatively (P = 0.785 and P = 0.361, respectively) although the mean IL-6 concentration 24 hours postoperatively was lower in the QL block group than in the continuous epidural group. CRP concentration was not significantly different between the groups either after surgery or 48 hours postoperatively (P = 0.805 and P = 0.636, respectively). Conclusions: There was no significant difference in IL-6 and CRP concentrations between continuous epidural and QL block among living kidney donors. Both continuous epidural and QL block techniques showed comparable postoperative analgesic properties among living kidney donors undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy. ? 2019, Author(s).","bupivacaine; C reactive protein; epinephrine; interleukin 6; morphine; sevoflurane; adult; aged; Article; blood sampling; Bromage scale; comparative study; controlled study; endotracheal intubation; epidural anesthesia; female; heart rate; human; hypotension; kidney donor; laparoscopic surgery; male; nephrectomy; nerve block; numeric rating scale; operation duration; patient controlled analgesia; postoperative analgesia; quadratus lumborum anesthesia; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; spinal anesthesia; ultrasound; visual analog scale; young adult"

"Prediction of optimal right internal jugular vein catheter depth: Comparison between peres’ formula and intracavitary ECG",2019,"Background: Incorrect central venous catheter (CVC) placement can lead to serious complications. In order to prevent complications, CVC insertion depth can be predicted using Peres’ formula or intracavitary electrocardiography (ECG). The accurate prediction of optimal CVC depth using Peres’ formula and intracavitary ECG on Malay race is unknown. Objective: To compare the accuracy of Peres’ formula and intracavitary ECG in predicting the optimal depth of right internal jugular venous catheter on adult Malay race. Methods: This was a comparative analytic observational study with cross sectional design conducted at Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital Jakarta from May to July 2017. After obtaining approval from the local ethical committee, right internal jugular venous catheter insertion was attempted on 111 patients, but 7 subjects were excluded from the study. Statistical analysis was performed on 104 . samples to determine the accuracy of CVC depth prediction based on Peres’ formula and intracavitary ECG using McNemar’s test. The CVC depth prediction formula in adult Malay subject was calculated using linear regression based on its correlation with age, height, and body weight. Results: The accuracy of intracavitary ECG and Peres’ formula to predict the optimal depth of right internal jugular venous catheter was 75% and 11.5%, respectively. The difference between the accuracy of these two methods was statistically significant (p=0.001). Correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between height and the optimal depth of right internal jugular vein catheter. The CVC depth prediction formula obtained in this study was 4.143 + (0.058 x height in cm). Conclusion: Prediction of right internal jugular venous catheter depth using intracavitary ECG is more accurate than the Peres’ formula. ? 2019, The Indonesian Foundation of Critical Care Medicine.

"Use of Antiretroviral Drug Testing to Assess the Accuracy of Self-reported Data from HIV-Infected People Who Inject Drugs",2019,"We used antiretroviral (ARV) drug testing to evaluate the accuracy of self-reported data for HIV status and antiretroviral treatment (ART) among people who inject drugs enrolled in an HIV prevention trial. ARV drugs were detected in enrollment samples from 72/482 = 14.9% HIV-infected participants (39/52 = 75.0% who reported being on ART; 33/430 = 7.7% who reported not being on ART). Overall, 213/482 = 44.2% participants indicated that they were not aware of their HIV-positive status prior to study entry; of those, 30 had ARV drugs detected at enrollment, including 15 who also had ARV drugs detected at the screening visit. These participants were likely aware of their HIV-positive status at study entry but did not report this to study staff.

Indeed, in a recent study in Jakarta,1 54% of patients with a CNS infection were HIV-infected, vs 25% in a similar study conducted in Bandung, the second largest city on Java.2 Establishing the etiology of CNS infections is important for clinical management and outcome, but anecdotal evidence suggests that there are major gaps in clinical management, including a failure to recognize CNS infections, perform appropriate diagnostics, or initiate necessary drug treatment. In this study, we address some of these barriers by interviewing a group of Indonesian neurologists. ? 2018 American Academy of Neurology.","aciclovir; amphotericin B; fluconazole; valaciclovir; brain hernia; central nervous system infection; cryptococcal meningitis; disease burden; drug effect; epidemic; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Indonesia; intracranial pressure; low income country; papilledema; priority journal; Review; sex ratio; treatment planning; virus encephalitis; adult; central nervous system infection; disease management; female; health care delivery; male; mass screening; Adult; Central Nervous System Infections; Disease Management; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Mass Screening"

"The readiness of resources the implementation of maternal health services indicators for the minimum services standards in Depok West Java Indonesia",2019,"The Maternal health services indicators on the Minimun Services Standard (MSS) states that pregnant women should deliver in standard health service facilities. One of the efforts made for the acceleration of maternal and infant mortality rate is the optimization of handling of emergency neonatal obstetrics/ complications of basic service level through Basic Emergency Obstetric Neonatal Care (BEONC). BEONC is one of the health service facilities that provides maternal health services according to MSS. Therefore the reinforcement of BEONC of both service management and support resources must be continuously optimized. This study aims to determine the resources needed to the implementation of MSS maternal health services indicators. Qualitative research was carried out at seven BEONC in Depok City from December 2017 to January 2018. The informants were 38 policy makers at the Health Service level, the head of BEONC, coordinator of BEONC and health officers. To obtain valid results, researchers conducted data triangulation with indept interview and focus group discussion techniques and document review related to the implementation at BEONC. The results showed that human resources had not been prepared with sufficient quantity or quality, standard operational procedures, adequate facilities and operational budget. The conclusion is that the resources were not optimal. Not all the health officers were involved in BEONC, quality control team and the stakeholders not support the implementation. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Acute lung rejection: An important factor for long term survival in lung transplantation",2019,"Pulmonary transplantation has been used as treatment of choice in patients with advanced disease. Since the introduction of immunosuppressive and new advancement in postoperative management, the survival rate of lung transplantation has improved. However in the long run, survival rate decreases years after lung transplantation. According to ISHLTH 32 nd report, survival rate decreased to 54% after 5 years, and decreased to 31% after 10 years. Leading cause of mortality was found to be graft failure, which may be caused by acute rejection or chronic rejection. Based on the mechanism of action, acute rejection can be classified into acute cellular rejection (ACR), and antibody mediated rejection (AMR). Due to unspecific signs and symptoms in acute rejection, diagnostic procedures must be conducted to help diagnosis. Various modalities are available, but lung biopsy is still considered as the gold standard. Treatment for acute rejection varies in different centers. There are no published guidelines discussing treatment for lung rejection due to lack of published evidence. Further studies evaluating the pathogenesis, diagnosis modalities, and treatment of choice for acute rejection are needed to improve patients’ survival rate. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Comparison of human platelet lysate and fetal bovine serum in culture media for human dental pulp stem cell proliferation",2019,"Objective: Ex vivo and in vitro cell cultures require a basal medium with added supplements containing growth factors, proteins, and enzymes to support attachment, growth, and proliferation. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is used to supplement cell culture media. However, human platelet lysate (hPL) represents an attractive alternative as it is nonxenogeneic. Methods: Human third molars were collected from six healthy donors (19–35 years old) with no history of regular alcohol consumption or smoking. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) at the second passage were divided into two culture media groups, 10% FBS and 5% hPL, as well as a control group after 24 h of serum starvation. A flow cytometry analysis was conducted to measure CD90, CD105, CD73, CD34, CD45, and Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR isotype (HLA-DR). Cellular proliferation was evaluated on days 1, 3, and 5. Results: The flow cytometry analysis revealed that the majority of the cells expressed positive mesenchymal stem cell surface markers, including CD73 (98.5%), CD90 (98.3%), and CD105 (71.0%), and lacked CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR. There were significant differences among the 5% hPL, 10% FBS, and control groups on days 1, 3, and 5. Conclusion: For a nonxenogeneic culture, 5% hPL can be used as an alternative in culture media for hDPSC proliferation. ? 2019 The Authors.","5' nucleotidase; CD34 antigen; CD45RA antigen; cell surface marker; endoglin; growth factor; HLA DR antigen; receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase C; Thy 1 membrane glycoprotein; adult; Article; cell adhesion; cell growth; cell isolation; cell lysate; cell proliferation; cementoenamel junction; comparative study; controlled study; dental pulp stem cell; fetal bovine serum; flow cytometry; human; human cell; human tissue; mesenchymal stem cell; MTT assay; starvation; thrombocyte"

"Emotional and behavioral problems among left-behind children in Indonesia",2019,"Background: The number of migrant workers in Indonesia has been increasing over the years. Most of the migrant workers are females with children, creating a huge number of left-behind children (LBC). The issue of LBC has become important to discuss because LBC tends to experience more emotional and behavioral problems than non-LBC. The aim of this study was to assess and compare emotional and behavioral problems between LBC and non-LBC in Indonesia. This paper analyzes data from a project by the Community Mental Health Research Group from the Faculty of Psychology, Universitas Indonesia, held in 2015 - 2016. Materials and Methods: Participants were 629 adolescents: 359 LBC and 270 non-LBC. The data were acquired in a cross-sectional study conducted in rural Indonesia. Data on emotional and behavioral problems were assessed with Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, while data related to risk factor variables were collected using multidimensional scale of perceived social support, the 6-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, and Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems in LBC was 28.4% compared to 21% among non-LBC. Peer attachment, communication, social support, and loneliness were identified as factors that impact the emotional and behavioral problems among LBC. Conclusions: LBC has more emotional and behavioral problems than non-LBC. Comprehensive understanding of various protective and risk factors is needed to provide impactful interventions for LBC. ? 2019 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch | Published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow.",""
"Eating behaviour of adolescent schoolgirls in Malang, East Java: A qualitative study",2019,"Introduction: Poor eating behaviour is known to lead to nutritional deficiency among adolescents. At the same time, poor eating behaviour characterised by dietary excesses could lead to overweight and obesity. The present study aimed to explore the eating behaviour of adolescent schoolgirls in Malang, East Java Province, Indonesia, and to determine the factors that influenced their eating behaviour. Methods: This was a qualitative study, guided by the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), which focused on individual and environmental influences to better understand health-related behaviours, such as eating behaviour. Triangulation was applied to the study subjects (adolescent girls, their mothers, and school staff). The methods used included individual in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Qualitative data analyses were performed using Atlas.ti 7. Results: Most participants showed poor eating behaviour that was characterised by skipping breakfast, frequent consumption of fast foods and the consumption of local food with low nutrient content. Their eating behaviour was influenced by individual factors including personal preferences, the price of the food, and by environmental factors, such as the family, school and neighbourhood. Conclusion: Our findings showed that adolescent girls in Malang appeared to be aware of healthy eating but they showed unsatisfactory eating practices. Interventions are suggested to improve the poor eating behaviour of the adolescents toward avoiding malnutrition consequences. ? 2019 Malaysian Journal of Nutrition.",""
"Determinants of the stunting of children under two years old in Indonesia: A multilevel analysis of the 2013 Indonesia basic health survey",2019,"Indonesia is ranked fifth among countries with the highest burden of stunting in children under five. This study aims to examine the determinants of stunting in children aged 0–2 years in Indonesia using data derived from the 2013 Indonesia Basic Health Survey. Twenty potential predictors of stunting, categorized into household and housing characteristics; maternal and paternal characteristics; antenatal care services and child characteristics were analyzed. Multilevel analyses were performed to examine the role of cluster/district/provincial differences, as well as individual/household level characteristics and stunting status. Of 24,657 children analyzed, 33.7% (95%CI: 32.8%–34.7%) were stunted. The odds of stunting increased significantly among children living in households with three or more children under five-years-old (aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.03–1.72), households with five to seven household members (aOR =1.11; 95%CI: 1.03–1.20), children whose mothers during pregnancy attended less than four antenatal care services (aOR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.08–1.39), boys (aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.22–1.45), children aged 12–23 months (aOR = 1.89; 95%CI: 1.54–2.32), and children who weighed <2500 g at birth (aOR = 2.55; 95%CI: 2.05–3.15). The odds also increased significantly with the reduction of household wealth index. Integrated interventions to address environment, an individual level associated with stunting in Indonesia, from the environment-to individual-level factors are important. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The implementation of k-means partitioning algorithm in HOPACH clustering method",2019,"Hierarchical Ordered Partitioning And Collapsing Hybrid (HOPACH) is one of the powerful clustering methods which combine the strengths of partitioning and agglomerative clustering methods. Several partition clustering methods such as PAM, K-Means, SOM, or other partitioning algorithms can be used in the partitioning process. This process is followed by the ordering steps, then continued with the agglomerative process. The number of main clusters is determined by MSS (Mean Split Silhouette) value. MSS is used to measure the heterogeneity of the clustering result. The lower the MSS value, the more homogenous each cluster members. We select the number of clusters from the clustering results with minimum MSS. In this implementation of HOPACH, we incorporate k-Means partitioning algorithm in this HOPACH clustering method, to cluster and analyze 136 DNA sequences of Ebola viruses. The clustering process is started with collecting DNA sequences of Ebola viruses from GenBank, then followed by performing features extraction of these DNA sequences using N-Mers frequency. The extraction results are compiled to be a features matrix and normalized using the min-max normalization with the interval [0, 1] as an input data to generate genetic distance matrix using Euclidian distance. The genetic distance matrix is used in partitioning process by the K-Means algorithm in HOPACH clustering. As the results, we obtained 8 clusters with minimum MSS (Mean Split Silhouette) 0.50266.

"Pharmacophore-based virtual screening and molecular docking simulation of terpenoid compounds as the inhibitor of sonic hedgehog protein for colorectal cancer therapy",2019,"Colorectal cancer remains as the global health burden, which accounts for roughly 1 - 2 million new cases and 600,000 deaths per year. Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway has an imperative role in the mechanism and formation of colorectal cancer. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein is the most studied Hh protein because it is expressed by several tissues and experiments with Shh protein are generally applicable to other Hh homologs. In the present study, about 56,336 terpenoid compounds were screened through various computational methods using pharmacophore-based virtual screening and molecular docking simulation to determine their inhibitory potency against Shh protein. From molecular docking simulation results, about ten ligands have been selected according to their Gibbs free binding energies ΔGbinding) and the molecular interactions that formed during the formation of the terpenoid compound-Shh complex. Three terpenoid compounds, namely arganine J, asiaticoside A, and clinoposide A, shown a very high binding affinity toward Shh protein due to their lower ΔGbinding than robotnikinin, the standard ligand. Moreover, ADME-Tox, bioactivity, bioavailability, and pharmacology test results revealed that these compounds have better biological and pharmacological activity than the other terpenoid compounds. For further research, these terpenoid compounds can be used as a drug candidate for colorectal cancer therapy. ? 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Binding energy; Biochemistry; Ligands; Lipids; Molecular modeling; Oncology; Pharmacodynamics; Proteins; Colorectal cancer; Hedgehog signaling pathways; Molecular docking; Sonic hedgehogs; Terpenoids; Diseases"

Potentially relevant electronic or on-line article from Google Scholar, Science Direct, and PUBMED was screened. Full-text or articles written in English up to November 2017 were collected. Keywords or phrases were used: (Non-human primate OR monkey OR macaca) AND (periodontal defect). Non-human primate animal was reported prone to have systemic infectious disease such as tuberculosis. However, the use of non-human primate in experiment is ethically restricted; it should be performed on the highest beneficial reason. Combination of acute-chronic defect model in non-human primate is the best way to imitate a periodontitis condition in human. A notch in the base is made as a mark to measure the gain of periodontal ligament, new bone and cementum formations. Due to its limited number of animals used in a study, a good and reliable experimental design is needed. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"Satisfaction of elderly patients participating in health insurance and seeking health services at the Sukmajaya Community Health Center in Depok - Expectations and realities: Pilot study",2019,"The integration of local health insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Daerah, Jamkesda) into national health insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, JKN) has led to various changes, but the subsequent increase in number of patients needing consultation has undermined the impact of the service. Herein, we investigated the participant satisfaction and service expectations among elderly patients at the JKN Elderly' Clinic at Sukmajaya Community Health Center (Puskesmas) in Depok, West Java, Indonesia. Qualitative assessments were made using Brown's eight-dimension theory of quality assurance (access, technical competence, security, effectiveness, efficiency, interpersonal relationships, amenities, and sustainability of service). Few participants over a short time research were chosen using purposive sampling from the Elderly' Clinic age (? 65 years old, 2 male and 5 female) and health staff from Puskesmas Sukmajaya and the Public Health Office (> 45 years old, 1 male and 2 female) were also selected. Few sample size taken also due to same answer from the participants, which meant that the study has reached saturation point. Among the 8 dimensions of quality assurance, the participants were most dissatisfied with the facilities, which led to a lack of privacy in patient examinations. Our assessments indicate the necessity of service evaluations and the need for additional human resource to improve the friendliness of the service, facilities, and privacy in health examinations. These improvements will maintain the dignity of older patients and will help to meet their expectations of service. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""

"Stewardship of health security: The challenges of applying the One Health approach",2019,"Experience with the control of epidemics, notably the 2004 outbreaks of avian influenza, has demonstrated that a “One Health approach,” that recognizes that human, animal, and environmental health are interdependent, is the most effective way of dealing with threats from emerging infectious diseases (EID). However, introducing and applying a One Health approach is challenging for many countries. One of the key challenges relates to stewardship. The evolution of the strategies and policies used to introduce and adopt the One Health approach in the detection and response to EID over the period 2005 to 2017 is described at global level and in country case studies of Thailand and Indonesia. Both countries experienced significant outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza from 2004 and have sought to adopt the One Health approach in their response strategies. The challenges for stewardship of health systems in introducing a One Health approach are described, and key lessons identified in regard to national level agency coordination, engagement of the broader civil society outside government, and developing a reliable, credible, and impartial decision-making process. The concept of stewardship provides valuable insights for policymakers on how to incorporate a One Health approach into their EID response systems.

"Impact of Car-Free Day on air pollution and its multifarious advantages in Sudirman-Thamrin Street, Jakarta",2019,"Jakarta is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The Jakarta Government led the Car-Free Day (CFD) with aims to reduce the pollution and uses of public transportation. Based on the high participation of citizen, CFD can be a potential initiative to engage in car-free life and become a solution to reduce pollution. The evaluation of CFD impact will be done by knowing the effect through environment and participant. To know the impact on the environment, we focus on the air condition. The data from The Environmental Agency of Jakarta was used and the manual measurement that contains PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2 level was performed. The deeper understanding of the problem gets by observing the CFD Sudirman-Thamrin and doing an in-depth interview with participants. Analysis pattern of participant behavior will help to know how to change their perception about CFD without side effect such as a decreasing amount of participant. Understanding three main issues of CFD can be lead into improvement at planning and policy implementation, there are an environmental effect, transportation choices, and the multifarious effect such as CFD as the recreational area and the profitable area in the sight of participants. The result shows that CFD is not optimal in terms of the environment effect, but it is very good to maintain the program because it can be as a good health campaign tools, familiarize a healthy lifestyle and as a public space. However, the implementation must be improved from spatial planning and waste management. ? Int. J. of GEOMATE.",""
"Brief Report: Malignancies in Adults Living with HIV in Asia",2019,"Background:Hematological malignancies have continued to be highly prevalent among people living with HIV (PLHIV). This study assessed the occurrence of, risk factors for, and outcomes of hematological and nonhematological malignancies in PLHIV in Asia.Methods:Incidence of malignancy after cohort enrollment was evaluated. Factors associated with development of hematological and nonhematological malignancy were analyzed using competing risk regression and survival time using Kaplan-Meier.Results:Of 7455 patients, 107 patients (1%) developed a malignancy: 34 (0.5%) hematological [0.08 per 100 person-years (/100PY)] and 73 (1%) nonhematological (0.17/100PY). Of the hematological malignancies, non-Hodgkin lymphoma was predominant (n = 26, 76%): immunoblastic (n = 6, 18%), Burkitt (n = 5, 15%), diffuse large B-cell (n = 5, 15%), and unspecified (n = 10, 30%). Others include central nervous system lymphoma (n = 7, 21%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1, 3%). Nonhematological malignancies were mostly Kaposi sarcoma (n = 12, 16%) and cervical cancer (n = 10, 14%). Risk factors for hematological malignancy included age >50 vs. ?30 years [subhazard ratio (SHR) = 6.48, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.79 to 23.43] and being from a high-income vs. a lower-middle-income country (SHR = 3.97, 95% CI: 1.45 to 10.84). Risk was reduced with CD4 351-500 cells/μL (SHR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.74) and CD4 >500 cells/μL (SHR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.78), compared to CD4 ?200 cells/μL. Similar risk factors were seen for nonhematological malignancy, with prior AIDS diagnosis showing a weak association. Patients diagnosed with a hematological malignancy had shorter survival time compared to patients diagnosed with a nonhematological malignancy.Conclusions:Nonhematological malignancies were common but non-Hodgkin lymphoma was more predominant in our cohort. PLHIV from high-income countries were more likely to be diagnosed, indicating a potential underdiagnosis of cancer in low-income settings. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; Article; Asia; Burkitt lymphoma; cancer incidence; CD4 lymphocyte count; cohort analysis; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; female; follow up; hematologic malignancy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunoblastic lymphoma; Kaposi sarcoma; major clinical study; male; myelodysplastic syndrome; nonhodgkin lymphoma; priority journal; risk factor; survival time; uterine cervix cancer; complication; factual database; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; multivariate analysis; neoplasm; survival analysis; Adult; Asia; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; HIV Infections; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis"
"Prenatal tobacco exposure and neonate birth weight",2019,"Background: Smoking is a global problem and serious threat to the health of pregnant women and fetus. Nicotine contained in cigarette smoke stimulates vasoconstriction of blood vessels, reduces the flow of nutrients and oxygen to the fetus, hence it inhibits the fetal growth. The aim of study was to assess the effects of exposure to cigarette smoke in pregnant women toward birth weight.Method: Prospective study was carried out on the third-trimester pregnant women who were non-smokers, pregnant with a single fetus, did not suffer from chronic diseases and followed until delivery. Assessment of smoking exposure referred to nicotine levels of umbilical cord blood ?1ng/ml. Mean difference test analysis was used to determine the difference in birth weight between groups. Linear regression analysis was to find out the effects of passive smoking on birth weight by paying attention to confounding variables.Result: The results of study found that birth weight of infants from passive smoker mothers were lower than those mothers who were not passive smokers. Passive smoking significantly reduces the infant’s weight by 195.9 grams after controlled by weight before pregnancy.Conclusions: Exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can reduce birth weight. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"The Relationships between Risky Sexual Practices and Spiritual Intelligence of Adolescents in Indonesia",2019,"Adolescents’ health problems are closely related to risky practices, one of which is risky sexual practice. Among others, a factor that is important to prevent risky sexual practices is spiritual intelligence of the adolescents. The study aims to analyze the association between spiritual intelligence and risky sexual practice in adolescents in a junior high school at Curug city of Depok, Indonesia. A quantitative observational analysis with cross-sectional approach was applied. The instrument used to measure the variables of spiritual intelligence was the spiritual intelligence self-report inventory. The variable sexual risky practices was measured with the instrument Sexual Risk Survey (SRS). The study involved 302 adolescents who came from three junior high schools (SMP) selected by stratified random sampling. Pearson test analysis showed a significant negative correlation between spiritual intelligence with sexual risky practices (p =.019; r = ?.135). A multivariate analysis using multiple linear regression showed that sex is the most influential variable on sexual risky practices. Based on the findings of the research, there is a need to continuously monitor the stage of adolescent growth especially by improving the spiritual intelligence status, so that spiritually intelligent adolescents can suppress the incidence of sexual risky practices. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.","adolescent; article; controlled study; female; high school; human; incidence; Indonesia; intelligence; major clinical study; male; multiple linear regression analysis; quantitative analysis; sampling; self report; sexual practice; adolescent behavior; child; cross-sectional study; devices; high risk behavior; Indonesia; procedures; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; religion; sexual behavior; statistical model; student; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Linear Models; Male; Psychometrics; Risk-Taking; Sexual Behavior; Spirituality; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"The Relationship between Activity Level and Fatigue in Indonesian Children with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia in the Home Setting",2019,"Previous studies have examined physical exercise as a way to lower the fatigue of children with cancer in a hospital setting, but there have been no such studies in a home setting. Therefore, this study identifies the relationship between physical activity and fatigue in children undergoing chemotherapy at home. The design of this study is a cross-sectional correlation analysis. Forty-five children aged 3–16?years with acute lymphocytic leukemia residing in the greater Jakarta area in Indonesia were recruited using consecutive and snowball sampling methods. The relationship between physical activity and level of fatigue was assessed using the Spearman test. A statistically significant relationship was found between physical activity and fatigue in the children studied (p?<?0.001). The active children had lower fatigue than the less active children. This study finds that higher physical activity is associated with lower fatigue in children with leukemia in a home setting. Nurses should educate children and their parents to promote physical activities at home in-between chemotherapy cycles. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.","acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; child; complication; cross-sectional study; drug therapy; exercise; fatigue; female; health education; home care; human; Indonesia; male; physiology; preschool child; procedures; psychology; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Therapy; Exercise; Fatigue; Female; Health Education; Home Care Services; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma"
"Cervical canal stenosis due to cervical spondylotic myelopathy C4-C5: A case report",2019,"Introduction: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a complex disease that presents with various signs and symptoms of cervical spinal cord impairment that may lead to significant clinical morbidity. Presentation of case: We present the case of a 50-year old man who was diagnosed with CSM. The patient underwent decompression and posterior stabilisation with open-door laminoplasty. At the 2-month follow-up, the pain subsided, function improved significantly, and weakness disappeared. The patient was also able to defecate and urinate normally. Discussion: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a complex disease that may lead to significant clinical morbidity. The management requires an extensive knowledge of the anatomy, biomechanics, and surgical options. The variable clinical findings, radiological evidence and scoring system, such as JOA, are important for preoperative evaluation and individualising surgical planning. The choice of the most appropriate technique is affected by patient's clinical condition and radiologic findings as well as surgeon's experience. It is demonstrated that the Kurokawa-type laminoplasty that involves splitting the spinous processes in the midline offers the advantage of reduced bleeding as the lateral epidural venous plexus is not disturbed in comparison to that with the former Hirabayashi's expansive open-door laminoplasty. Moreover, the body symmetry is preserved; therefore, this procedure may be considered more anatomical and physiological. However, differences in the outcomes between the two approaches remain unknown. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the decompression and posterior stabilisation method may help achieve good patient outcomes. ? 2019 The Authors","achilles reflex; adult; Article; Babinski reflex; case report; cervical spine radiography; cervical spondylotic myelopathy; clinical article; clonus; feces incontinence; fifth cervical vertebra; finger escape test; follow up; fourth cervical vertebra; general anesthesia; general condition; grip and release test; Hoffmann reflex; human; Japanese Orthopaedic Association score; L hermitte test; laminoplasty; leukocytosis; limb weakness; lower limb; male; middle aged; motor function test; motor performance; neck; neck pain; nerve compression; neurosurgeon; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; open door laminoplasty; osteophyte; osteotomy; paresthesia; physical activity; physical examination; physiotherapy; priority journal; radiodiagnosis; shoulder; spinal cord compression; spinal cord decompression; spine stabilization; urine retention; vertebral canal stenosis"
"A Preliminary Study on “PRISMA” Education in Improving Self-Management and Level of Compliance in Children with Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus",2019,"Children with Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus (TIDM) need long-term care that requires supervision. Without good management, there will be an increase in blood glucose, which can cause complications in organs and tissues. One way to improve self-management and level of compliance in blood glucose control is by providing education. This study aimed to determine the effect of PRISMA education on self-management and level of compliance in children with T1DM. This study used a quasi-experimental design with no control group. PRISMA education using animated videos was given to the respondents who filled out the questionnaire about self-management and level of compliance (pre-test) and were evaluated on the eighth day (post-test). The sample of this study consisted of 31 children in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, and Tangerang. The results of this study indicate that PRISMA education had significant effects on self-management (p < 0.05) and level of compliance (p < 0.05). The delivery of self-management education in the form of animated videos could improve self-management and children’s compliance in the management of diet, physical act, treatment, stress management and blood glucose control. Thus, this educational tool could be useful if it is integrated into nursing interventions, especially in the field of pediatric nursing. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.","adolescent; attitude to health; child; education; female; health education; human; Indonesia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; patient compliance; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; self care; Adolescent; Child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Patient Compliance; Self-Management; Surveys and Questionnaires"

"Factors associated with pasung (physical restraint and confinement) of schizophrenia patients in Bogor regency, West Java Province, Indonesia 2017",2019,"Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder affecting more than 21 million worldwide. In Indonesia, 14.3% of households have a patient with a mental disorder, and the majority of these are in rural areas. Family members in Indonesia use repressive social measures like pasung (physical restraint and confinement) for these patients. A study was conducted with the objective to determine the factors associated with pasung among patients with schizophrenia in Bogor Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia 2017. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in Bogor Regency from May-June 2017. A case subject was defined as a patient with schizophrenia who was ever subjected to pasung and a control subject was defined as a patient with schizophrenia residing in the same geographical area and never subjected to pasung. Multi-stage sampling was used to select case and control subjects from the registered reports of the Health Service of Bogor Regency (2012-16) in 34 sub districts and 59 health centers. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with pasung. Attributable and population attributable risks (AR, PAR) for pasung were calculated. Results: A total of 114 case and 136 control subjects were studied. Patient's aggressive or violent behavior (AdjOR: 4.49, 95%CI: 2.52-8.0), unemployment (AdjOR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.09-6.9) and informal employment (AdjOR: 2.5, 95%CI: 1.1-5.84) in the family and negative attitude of the family towards the patient (AdjOR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.43-4.43) were associated with pasung. Patient's aggressive or violent behavior (PAR = 44.3%) and unemployment in the family (PAR = 49.3%) were the predominant factors of pasung. Conclusions: Patient's aggressive or violent behavior, negative attitude of the family towards the patient and unemployment in the family were associated with pasung. We recommend health education and encouraging family members to shift patients with schizophrenia exhibiting aggressive or violent behavior to a mental health facility. Strengthening of basic mental health services and involving family members while treating patients with schizophrenia to develop positive attitudes could be considered. Creating employment opportunities and a social support system for treated patients with schizophrenia and family members could further avert pasung. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aggressiveness; Article; attributable risk; case control study; controlled study; employment status; family attitude; female; health care facility; health education; hospital admission; human; immobilization; Indonesia; major clinical study; male; mental health care; physical restraint; physical violence; sampling; schizophrenia; social support; unemployment"
"Community HIV screening among MSM in three Indonesian cities",2019,"Background: Indonesia lags behind its peers with regard to ART coverage of PLHIV. Insufficient HIV testing among MSM and other key affected populations remains a barrier to increasing ART coverage. Objective: This report presents the results of the first government-endorsed implementation research study of a community screening approach to increasing the rate of HIV testing among MSM in three cities. Methods: All new MSM outreach contacts meeting eligibility criteria during March-June 2017 were included in the study. HIV testing at a government health facility, which is required to qualify for government-supported ART, was advised for all new contacts. Men refusing formal testing were offered an HIV screening test in a community setting using a saliva-based rapid test and advised to get a confirmatory test at a health facility. All outreach contacts and testing activities were recorded on individual client records. Results: Of 1,149 eligible MSM, 27% were willing to be referred to receive HIV testing at a health facility, among which 83% were confirmed to have been tested. Of the 838 study subjects refusing health facility testing, 38% accepted community screening. The screening positivity rate was 14.8%. Only 38% of men with reactive screening tests received a confirmatory test at a health facility, along with 8% of those with non-reactive tests. Conclusion: While community screening resulted in more MSM knowing their HIV status, reluctance to avail government health facility-based services, or indeed to be tested at all, must be addressed if community screening is to accelerate progress in getting HIV-positive MSM onto treatment. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; geographic distribution; health care facility; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Indonesian; laboratory diagnosis; mass screening; men who have sex with men; saliva analysis; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; stigma; case report; city; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Indonesia; male; male homosexuality; mass screening; middle aged; organization and management; patient attitude; procedures; young adult; Adult; Cities; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Young Adult"
"Antenatal exposure to second hand smoke of non-smoking mothers and growth rate of their infants",2019,"Objectives There is limited evidence on the effect of exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) in nonsmoking pregnant mothers and infant health. We assessed the effects of maternal antenatal exposure to SHS on infant growth rate, and secondarily, on birth weight, birth length and head circumference at birth. Methods In this prospective cohort, 305 mother-infant pairs were studied. Mothers filled out questionnaires about exposure to SHS in pregnancy at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Infant anthro-pometry was performed at birth, day 7, and months 1, 2, 4, and 6, postnatally. Linear mixed modeling and linear regression were used to calculate growth rates over the first 6 months. The association between SHS-exposure with growth rate and birth sizes was assessed using multivariate linear regression adjusted for confounders, with SHS as both number of cigarettes and as groups (no exposure, SHS &lt; 23 cigarettes, SHS 23 cigarettes). Results Seventy-three mothers were not exposed and 232 were exposed. SHS exposure (per cigarette) was not related to gain in weight, length, head circumference, and weight for length. However, infants born to mothers exposed to 23 cigarettes/d had lower head circumference gain (-0.32 mm/m, 95% CI -0.60, -0.03) than those born to non-exposed mothers. SHS exposure (per cigarette) was not related to birth weight, length, and head circumference, but exposure to 23 cigarettes was related to lower head circumference at birth (-11.09 mm, -20.03, -2.16). Conclusions Heavy antenatal exposure to SHS in non-smoking mothers results in reduced neonatal head circumference at birth and head circumference gain over the first 6 months of life. Our findings show no clear relations between exposure to SHS during pregnancy and other markers of neonatal growth and birth size. ? 2019 Soesanti et al.

"An update of Male contraception: A review of cellular perspective",2019,"Introduction: Similar to the world, Indonesia also undergoes a population explosion. One solution to overcome this population problem is to conduct contraception. Although woman contraception is widely used, still the role of man is needed. There are a few methods in male contraception, but all is still not proven optimally. Therefore, it is intend to understand more about the cellular mechanism of male contraception. Methods: A computerized finding process of database in Pub med which related to the key words was performed for obtaining data. After that, the most update and relevant articles were reviewed and selected. Results: The results are mainly revealing the regimens that are administered in male hormonal contraception and substances that are used in immunocontraception. Furthermore, this reviews also reveales the cellular mechanism of both types of male contraception. In male hormonal contraception, the mechanism was depends on negative feedback in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by regimens to impair the spermatogenesis into severe-oligozoospermia or azoospermia. In addition, immunocontraception was based on ‘vaccination’ concept in which antibodies recognize proteins in the spermatozoa as ""non-self” thus spermatozoa may be destroyed. Conclusion: It is necessary to understand the cellular mechanism, thus the development of male contraception increases. Further researches should be conducted to confirm the cellular mechanisms. ?2009-2019, JGPT.

"Na?ve Bayes Classifier Models for Predicting the Colon Cancer",2019,"Cancer has been known as a disease consisting of several different types. Cancer is a life threatening disease in the world today. There are so many types of cancer in the world, one of which is colon cancer. Colon cancer is one of the number one killers in the world. However, because there isn't any obvious symptom of colon cancer at an early stage, people do not realize that they suffer from it. Even though cancer formation is different for each type of cancer, it is still a big challenge to make cancer classification with good accuracy. Many machine learning has been applied to the data of human's genes in order to get the most relevant genes in the classification of cancer. The author proposes the Na?ve Bayes Classifier model as a classification method to show that the model has good accuracy, good precision, good recall, good f 1 - score in classifying the data of patients suffering from colon cancer or not. In this proposed model, Na?ve Bayes Classifier is a technique prediction based on simple probabilistic and on the application of the Bayes theorem (or Bayes rule) with a strong independence assumption. Therefore, this model is able to make higher classification accuracy with less complexity. In particular, it achieves up to 95.24% classification accuracy, thus this model can be an efficient analysis tool. ?

"The role of placental growth factor, soluble endoglin, and uterine artery diastolic notch to predict the early onset of preeclampsia",2019,"BACKGROUND: Reducing maternal mortality is one of the targets in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In a systematic review, 4.6 per cent (95% CI 2.7-8.2) of pregnancies were complicated by preeclampsia worldwide. Preeclampsia occurs in around 10% of pregnancies in the world whereas developing countries contribute more than developed countries. In developing countries, there are 13 cases of preeclampsia in every 1,000 births, whereas in developed countries only 2-3 cases of preeclampsia are found in every 10,000 deliveries. Variations in prevalence among countries reflect, at least in part, differences in the distribution of maternal age and the proportion of nulliparous pregnant women in the population. AIM: We aimed to investigate the role of placental growth factor, soluble endoglin, and uterine artery diastolic notch to predict the early onset of preeclampsia. METHODS: This study used an analytical study with a nested case-control design. The study was conducted at Bunda Thamrin Hospital, Tanjung Mulia Mitra Medika Hospital, Sundari Hospital and a private clinic, from March to November 2018 with a total sample of 70 research subjects. RESULTS: Uterine artery diastolic notch was not found in 50% of subjects. A total of 27 subjects (38.6%) had a unilateral diastolic notch, and 8 subjects (11.4%) had a bilateral diastolic notch. Cut-off point PIGF levels was 441 pg/ml, and Area Under Curve (AUC) 82.5% (95% CI 61.5%-100%), with sensitivity 80% and specificity 87.7%. The levels sEng in this study could not predict the incidence of early-onset preeclampsia (p = 0.113). Combined PlGF and pulsatile index of uterine arteries may predict early onset preeclampsia with sensitivity 40% and specificity 90.77%. From these results, pregnant women o 22-24 weeks of pregnancy, the levels of PlGF and the uterine artery pulsatility index can be a predictor of early-onset preeclampsia. Examination of PlGF levels alone is sufficient as a predictor of early-onset preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: notches in uteriindex of uterine levels alone is s. ? 2019 Muara Panusunan Lubis, Herman Hariman, Sarma N.

"Meeting Report: The Role of Beliefs and Perception on Body Size. Proceedings of the 26th Aschauer Soiree, Held at Aschauhof, Altenhof, Germany, May 26th, 2018",2019,"Thirty-one scientists met at Aschauhof, Germany to discuss the role of beliefs and self-perception on body size. In view of apparent growth stimulatory effects of dominance within the social group that is observed in social mammals, they discussed various aspects of competitive growth strategies and growth adjustments. Presentations included new data from Indonesia, a cohort-based prospective study from Merida, Yucatan, and evidence from recent meta-analyses and patterns of growth in the socially deprived. The effects of stress experienced during pregnancy and adverse childhood events were discussed, as well as obesity in school children, with emphasis on problems when using z-scores in extremely obese children. Aspects were presented on body image in African-American women, and body perception and the disappointments of menopause in view of feelings of attractiveness in different populations. Secular trends in height were presented, including short views on so called 'racial types' vs bio-plasticity, and historic data on early-life nutritional status and later-life socioeconomic outcomes during the Dutch potato famine. New tools for describing body proportions in patients with variable degrees of phocomelia were presented along with electronic growth charts. Bio-statisticians discussed the influence of randomness, community and network structures, and presented novel tools and methods for analyzing social network data.

"Description of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Candida albicans biofilms after exposure to propolis dentifrice by using OpenCFU method",2020,"Context: Dental caries is a major and chronic dental public health problem, which can usually be prevented by regular oral hygiene. The most common oral hygiene practice is brushing teeth with a dentifrice. Propolis has emerged as a promising anti-cariogenic agent, which is considered to be a good oral antiseptic for prevention of caries. Several studies have shown that the use of C has an influence in the growth of oral biofilms. There are several standard methods used to count bacterial colonies, such as crystal violet and CFU Count assays. OpenCFU method is a technique that can be used to calculate biofilm colonies more faster, precisely, and accurately. Aim: To compare several methods for evaluating the number of biofilm colonies formed with exposure to a standard dentifrice and propolis. Methods and materials: Biofilm assays were carried out on 96-well microplates. Reference strains of oral Streptococcus species (S. mutans ATCC 25175T and S. sanguinis ATCC 10566T) and yeast (Candida albicans ATCC 10231T) were inoculated into wells, and 200 ?L of standard and propolis dentifrice solution were added to each well and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. Bacteria and yeast were then sub-cultured on respective media and the colony-forming units (CFU) were counted manually. The other wells were stained by crystal violet and incubated for 15 min, followed by observation using an inverted microscope and evaluated using crystal violet analysis and the OpenCFU automated method. Results: The numbers of CFUs determined for all strains were similar in the standard-dentifrice group and propolis-dentifrice group, and were similar among the three methods: crystal violet staining, manual CFU count, and OpenCFU analysis. Conclusion: OpenCFU analysis can be reliably used as a rapid and a more practical method to analyse the growth of oral microorganism biofilms. However, high digital image quality is required to provide an accurate analysis for colony counting. ? 2019 The Authors","crystal violet; propolis; saliva substitute; toothpaste; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium colony; bacterium culture; biofilm; Candida albicans; CFU counting; colony forming unit; comparative study; controlled study; fungal strain; fungus culture; fungus growth; mouth flora; nonhuman; staining; Streptococcus mutans; Streptococcus sanguinis"
"The Effects of the COMMASH-E Intervention on the Fatigue, Sleep Quality and Functional Status of Children with Cancer in Indonesia",2019,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of the combined music and sleep hygiene education (COMMASH-E) intervention on the fatigue, sleep quality and functional status of children with cancer residing in temporary lodges in Indonesia. The design of this study was a quasi-experimental pre-post test with a control group. We recruited children with cancer aged 7–18?years (n?=?58) using a consecutive sampling method and assigned them to intervention and control groups (n?=?29 in each group). The intervention group had the COMMASH-E intervention while the control group received routine care. Fatigue, sleep quality and functional status were measured on days 1 and 4 using Allen’s Fatigue in Childhood Cancer Scale, the Sleep Problem in Children Scale and the Barthel Index, respectively. T-dependent and independent tests and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) tests were performed for the data analysis. There were significant differences in fatigue, sleep quality and functional status between the intervention and control groups after the COMMASH-E intervention. Nonetheless, chemotherapy drugs contributed to the children’s sleep quality. COMMASH-E was found to be more effective than routine care in the reducing fatigue and increasing the sleep quality and functional status of children with cancer. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.","adolescent; analysis of variance; child; cognition; complication; devices; drug therapy; fatigue; female; human; Indonesia; male; music therapy; neoplasm; physiology; procedures; psychology; psychometry; sleep disorder; sleep hygiene; Adolescent; Analysis of Variance; Child; Cognition; Drug Therapy; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Music Therapy; Neoplasms; Psychometrics; Sleep Hygiene; Sleep Wake Disorders"
"Correlation analysis of sleep duration, dietary habits, physical activity and knowledge with blood pressure on engineering workers, procurement, and construction (EPC)",2019,"Background: There have been five cases of hypertension to EPC workers in the last five years (2012-2017). To minimize the risk of hypertension in workers and to prevent greater losses in terms of productivity and medical costs arised from the disease, it is necessary to acknowledge the distribution of blood pressure in EPC workers and analyze any factors related to blood pressure, as a screening of hypertension occurred related to worker health promotion program. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze the risk factors associated with blood pressure (systolic, diastolic) on workers of EPC. Method: A quantitative approach in a cross-sectional design which comprised the subjects of the study as samples are 97 workers of EPC Result: The systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is higher among workers with abnormal sleep duration (SBP: 125,15±8,57, DBP: 84,71±6,02), frequently dietary habits in fast food consumption (SBP: 140,00±0,00, DBP: 90,00±0,00), lack of physical activity (SBP: 122,75±9,20) and lack of knowledge about hypertension. There were significant differences in the mean systolic (R 2 = 0,049) and diastolic blood pressure (R 2 = 0,061) in workers in the form of sleep duration. Conclusion: The majority of worker’s blood pressure is categorized prehypertension based on blood pressure category by JNC-7. Results indicate that abnormal sleep duration, the frequency of protein consumption, physical activity that does not fit with the recommendation and lack of knowledge about hypertension contribute to higher of worker’s blood pressure. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Assessing the quality of child investigative interviewing in the Netherlands",2019,"Using evidence-based guidelines to interview children is an important means to obtain complete and accurate accounts. In the current study, we examined the quality of child investigative interviewing in the Netherlands. To examine this, we compared the Dutch Scenario Model with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Protocol and interviews from countries that did not follow a specific protocol. Our principal result was that Dutch child interviewers rarely asked recommended open prompts that are known to elicit detailed and accurate testimonies from children. Furthermore, we found that the scenario model contained the highest number of directive questions compared with interviews from other countries. Our findings show that the Dutch Scenario Model is not well aligned with current research-based recommendations for interviewing children. ? 2019 The Authors Applied Cognitive Psychology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","article; child; controlled study; Dutchman; human; interview; memory; national health organization; Netherlands; witness"

"Effect of high speed homogenizer speed on particle size of polylactic acid",2019,"Polylactic acid (PLA) nanoparticles could provide extended release of drugs, reducing the frequency of injection and increasing the compliance diabetic retinopathy patients. This requires nanoparticles with a mean diameter of approximately 200 nm to facilitate penetration of small and narrow blood vessels in the retina. Mean diameter of PLA particles prepared using the emulsification-evaporation method was found to depend linearly on the speed of the high speed homogenizer, based on the data taken in the range of 1,000-10,000 rpm. PLA nanoparticles with a mean particle diameter of 190 nm with a spherical morphology could be obtained using a homogenizer speed of 10,000 rpm, allowing the use of PLA nanoparticles for extended release of drugs in the retina. ? 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Blood vessels; Controlled drug delivery; Emulsification; Eye protection; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Polyesters; Targeted drug delivery; Diabetic retinopathy; Evaporation method; Extended release; Homogenizers; Mean diameter; Mean particle diameter; Poly lactic acid; Spherical morphologies; Speed"
"Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy Among Incarcerated Persons with HIV: Associations with Methadone and Perceived Safety",2019,"With adequate support, people with HIV (PWH) may achieve high levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) during incarceration. We examined factors associated with ART utilization and adherence among incarcerated PWH (N = 150) in Indonesia. ART utilization was positively associated with HIV status disclosure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.5, 95% CI 1.2–24.1, p = 0.023), drug dependency (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.2–12.6, p = 0.022), health service satisfaction (aOR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.7–6.2, p < 0.001), and perceived need for medical treatment (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, p = 0.011), and negatively associated with chance locus of control (aOR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.7, p = 0.013). Most participants utilizing ART (74.5%) reported less than “perfect” ART adherence. ART adherence was independently associated with perceived personal safety (β = 0.21, 95% CI 0.01–0.40, p = 0.032) and methadone utilization (β = 0.84, 95% CI 0.10–1.67, p = 0.047). PWH receiving methadone had a sixfold higher adjusted odds of being highly-adherent to ART (aOR = 6.3, 95% CI 1.1–35.7, p = 0.036).

"Online dynamic risk calculator for early detection of stroke",2019,"Stroke is one of the most common killers worldwide. The death of the most stroke patients is caused by late treatment. In order to prevent the late treatment, an online dynamic stroke risk calculator has been developed. The predictor considers three risk factor groups which are biomolecule related factors, life style related factors and physiological measure related factors. Age, gender, family history and own disease history are factors related to biomolecule structure. Food, water, and air intakes as well as environment, physical and mental activities are the main components of life style. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose, body mass index, blood lipid are done to provide information on physiological measure related factors. In order to improve the accuracy of risk calculator, clinical assessment is recommended to be conducted if the risk factor is above human average risk at specific age. This includes to assess sign, symptom, stroke biomarker, as well as stroke related anatomy and pathophysiology imaging. All factors and their levels are stored in the cloud database. Online application to enter data and visualize results is connected to the cloud database. Rule-based algorithm and machine learning are applied to calculate the risk of getting stroke. More than 12,000 retrospective global data are stored in the database. The database and rule are dynamically updated by the new online data input to improve accuracy of prediction through learning process. The risk calculation (rule-based algorithm) has been compared with other algorithms on machine learning to prove the system model. The system has been also validated using 120 healthy data and 25 stroke patient data. Test result shows that the system produces more than 95% accuracy and can be a better dynamic stroke risk predictor that can be applied to machine learning.

"Body image, social support, effects of chemotherapy, and sexual desire in breast cancer patients",2019,"The number of patients with breast cancer in the world, including Indonesia, is high. Breast cancer survivors experience numerous physical, psychological, and social changes, which affect their sexual desire. Sexual desire is intimately linked with body image, social support, and side effects of chemotherapy. This study aimed to investigate the correlations of body image, social support, and side effects of chemotherapy with sexual desire. This cross-sectional study included 110 consecutive patients undergoing chemotherapy at public and private hospitals in Semarang and in a public hospital in Jakarta. The results demonstrated significant correlations between sexual desire and body image (P=.000), social support (P=.000), and side effects of chemotherapy (P=.003). The results of multivariate analysis showed that among the factors investigated, body image had the greatest effect on sexual desire. To address issues related to this decrease in sexual desire among patients with breast cancer, nurses should evaluate body image, social support, and side effects of chemotherapy soon after patients with breast cancer have undergone chemotherapy. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",""
"The Expression of Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 and Interleukin-6 on Human Prostate: Prostate Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer",2019,"BACKGROUND: Prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer are two of the most common pathological condition of the prostate to be found on male. Both of these diseases share common pathogenesis involving inflammation of prostatic tissues. Chronic inflammation will induce the release of cytokines, followed by cells injury and tissues damage. One of the cytokines that play a role in prostate pathology is IL-6. The inflammation will also induce the releases of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGFβ-1. AIM: This study aims to analyse the expression of IL-6 and TGFβ-1, in prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an observational study, using paraffin-embedded tissue samples of prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Samples were obtained from the laboratory of Pathological Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Andalas University, Padang, Indonesia. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the cytokine expression, and a semiqunatitaves measurement according to Immunoreactive score (IRS) was performed for evaluation. For the TGFβ-1, the stromal expression was also analysed by measurement of the stromal stained area. The correlation of cytokine expression to Gleason index score was also analysed in prostate cancer. RESULTS: The result showed that this study found that TGFβ-1 was detected both in the stromal component as well as epithelial. With the stromal being the dominant site of expression. The stromal TGFβ-1 expression was of significantly higher in prostate hyperplasia compares to prostate cancer (p > 0.05), while the epithelial expression of TGFβ-1 was not found to be significantly different. IL-6 was mostly expressed intracytoplasmic in epithelia. The IL-6 expression was significantly higher in prostate cancer compared to hyperplasia. However, there was no significant correlation to found between IL-6 expression to the Gleason Score among prostate cancers. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that there were differences in expression of both TGFβ-1 and IL-6 between prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry. ? 2019 Afdal Afdal, Eryati Darwin, Yanwirasti Yanwirasti, Rizal Hamid.","interleukin 6; transforming growth factor beta1; Article; cancer tissue; cytokine production; Gleason score; histology; human; human tissue; immune response; immunohistochemistry; Immunoreactive score; male; observational study; prostate cancer; prostate hypertrophy; protein expression; scoring system"

A cross sectional study at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital Jakarta tested 197 HIV patients treated for &gt;12 months without stavudine. HIV-SN was defined using the AIDS Clinical Trial Group Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screening Test (ACTG-BPNST). A validated Indonesia translation of Douleur Neuropathique en 4 (DN4) questionnaire was used to assess lower limb neuropathic pain. Nerve conduction studies assessed large nerve fiber function and Stimulated Skin Wrinkle (SSW) tests were performed to assess small nerve fibers. The prevalence of neuropathic pain was 6.6%. BPNST+HIV-SN was diagnosed in 14.2% of the cohort and 38.5% of patients with pain. Use of protease inhibitors and ART duration &lt;2 years associated with neuropathic pain in univariate (p =.036, p =.002, resp.) and multivariable analyses (model p &lt;.001). SSW tests were abnormal in 53.8% of subjects with neuropathic pain and only 25.5% without pain (p =.05). Patients with pain without BPNST+HIV-SN had begun ART more recently than those with both diagnoses. Overall this preliminary study showed that neuropathic pain associated with protease inhibitors and a shorter duration of ART in Indonesian HIV patients, and may be an early symptom of small fiber neuropathy in this context. ? 2018","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; efavirenz; emtricitabine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nevirapine; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; proteinase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; tenofovir; zidovudine; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; neuropathic pain; peripheral neuropathy; priority journal; questionnaire; sensory neuropathy; treatment duration; wrinkle"
"Central obesity as a risk factor for hypertension in women: In Bogor district",2019,"Hypertension in women is increased by 30.9% and 26.6% of central obesity in Indonesia.

"Diabetes mellitus burden among people living with HIV from the Asia-Pacific region",2019,"Introduction: Comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (DM) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) are of increasing clinical concerns in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era. We aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors of new-onset DM among PLHIV in Asian settings. Methods: PLHIV from a regional observational cohort without DM prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation were included in the analysis. DM was defined as having a fasting blood glucose ?126?mg/dL, glycated haemoglobin ?6.5%, a two-hour plasma glucose ?200?mg/dL, or a random plasma glucose ?200?mg/dL. A Cox regression model, stratified by site, was used to identify risk factors associated with DM. Results and discussion: Of the 1927 participants included, 127 were diagnosed with DM after ART initiation. Median follow-up time from ART initiation to DM diagnosis was 5.9?years (interquartile range (IQR): 2.8 to 8.9?years). The crude incidence rate of DM was 1.08 per 100 person-years (100?PYS), 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.9 to 1.3). In the multivariate analysis, later years of follow-up (2011 to 2013: HR?=?2.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.79, p?=?0.02; and 2014 to 2017: HR?=?7.20, 95% CI 3.27 to 15.87, p?&lt;?0.001) compared to &lt;2010, older age (41 to 50?years: HR?=?2.46, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.36, p =?0.002; and &gt;50?years: HR?=?4.19, 95% CI 2.12 to 8.28, p?&lt;?0.001) compared to &lt;30?years, body mass index (BMI) &gt;30?kg/m 2 (HR?=?4.3, 95% CI 1.53 to 12.09, p?=?0.006) compared to BMI &lt;18.5?kg/m 2 , and high blood pressure (HR?=?2.05, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.63, p?=?0.013) compared to those without high blood pressure, were associated with developing DM. The hazard was reduced for females (HR?=?0.47, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.80, p?=?0.006). Conclusions: Type 2 DM in HIV-infected Asians was associated with later years of follow-up, high blood pressure, obesity and older age. This highlights the importance of monitoring and routine screening for non-communicable diseases including DM as PLHIV age. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Effect of macrolide prophylactic therapy on AIDS-Defining conditions and HIV-Associated mortality",2019,"Background:Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis is recommended for patients with advanced HIV infection. With the decrease in incidence of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection and the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the benefits of macrolide prophylaxis were investigated. This study examined the impact of macrolide prophylaxis on AIDS-defining conditions and HIV-associated mortality in a cohort of HIV-infected patients on ART.Methods:Patients from TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (September 2015 data transfer) aged 18 years and older with a CD4 count &lt;50 cells/mm3 at ART initiation were included. The effect of macrolide prophylaxis on HIV-associated mortality or AIDS-defining conditions (as a combined outcome) and HIV-associated mortality alone were evaluated using competing risk regression. Sensitivity analysis was conducted in patients with a CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 at ART initiation.Results:Of 1345 eligible patients, 10.6% received macrolide prophylaxis. The rate of the combined outcome was 7.35 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.04 to 8.95] per 100 patient-years, whereas the rate of HIV-associated mortality was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.35 to 4.19) per 100 patient-years. Macrolide use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HIV-associated mortality (hazard ratio 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.80, P = 0.031) but not with the combined outcome (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI: 0.32 to 2.229, P = 0.764). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent results among patients with a CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 at ART initiation.Conclusions:Macrolide prophylaxis is associated with improved survival among Asian HIV-infected patients with low CD4 cell counts and on ART. This study suggests the increased usage and coverage of macrolide prophylaxis among people living with HIV in Asia. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Assesment of zakat distribution: A case study on zakat community development in Bringinsari village, Sukorejo district, Kendal",2019,"Purpose: This study aims to assess the feasibility of zakat distribution conducted by zakat community development program, one of the BAZNAS programs in Bringinsari village, Sukorejo subdistrict, Kendal Regency, Central Java using the zakat village index (IDZ). Design/methodology/approach: IDZ has five components in measuring the effectiveness of charity for the welfare of the community is the economic dimension, the dimension of education, dimension of health, social dimension of humanity and dimensions of da’wah. The economic dimension consists of four variables, namely, the presence of productive economic activities, trade centers and access to transportation and logistics services and the presence of access to financial institutions. Findings: Based on IDZ measurement in Bringinsari village, it is found that IDZ of this village is 0.47. It showed that the condition of the village is good enough. As the result of this calculation, Bringinsari village is under consideration to receive zakat funding. Research limitations/implications: This research will be done in Bringinsari village Sukorejo district, Kendal regency from April 1, 2018 until July 2, 2018. Practical implications: Based on the result of IDZ result done in Bringinsari Sukorejo district, Kendal regency, it is gained index calculation result for about 0.47. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that the village deserves to get zakat funding. Economic dimension is still low, 0.32. Therefore, in this case, a motivation to help villagers is needed. The exact program in improving the people in Bringinsari based on priority is economic, health, education program in accordance with IDZ calculation. Social implications: The welfare measurement of zakat receiver or mustahiq adopts welfare index (CIBEST). CIBEST model combines material and spiritual fulfillment of human needs quadrants. This index is split into four categories, namely, welfare, material poverty, spiritual poverty and absolute poverty (Puskas BAZNAS, 2016). Originality/value: Based on measurement result that has been obtained, the authors can recommend some program activities to help improving their welfare. There are three dimensions, which IDZ prioritized or considered to be assisted, such as economic dimension, activity program for housewives. If Bringinsari has got an indicator as a good village and the impact is good as well, therefore, it can try to move zakat fund distribution to other villages. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",""

"An environmental health risk assessment of workers’ ambient exposure to particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less at a concrete batching plant",2019,"Background. Workers in the concrete industry can be negatively affected by exposure to particulate matter. Particulate matter that is 2.5 microns in width or less (PM 2.5 ) is one of the most dangerous air pollutants because it can be inhaled into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Objective. This research analyzed workers’ health risks due to inhalation exposure to PM 2.5 in at a concrete batching plant. Materials &amp; Method. The risk was calculated using an environmental health risk assessment method to determine the value of the risk quotient (RQ). The RQ was obtained by dividing the body exposure intake by the reference concentration. If the value of RQ&gt;1, then risk management is necessary. This study calculated the risk of PM 2.5 exposure for 59 workers. Samples were collected at 4 points in the plant for 1 hour using a high-volume air sampler; each point was sampled 2 times, once during the day and once at night. Results. The average concentration of PM 2.5 was 120 mg/m 3 that means the concentration was above the quality standard. The calculation shows that PM 2.5 is risky to workers in life time duration (25 years) with the average yield at least for the next 9 years because reach RQ=1,096. Thus, risk management is required for the next 25 years by reducing PM 2.5 concentration. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"Profiles of peptide YY and ghrelin, levels of hunger and satiety, and ad libitum intake in obese and non-obese Indonesian women",2019,"INTRODUCTION: The current study aimed to assess profiles of peptide YY and ghrelin, visual analog scales (VAS) for hunger and satiety, and ad libitum intake in obese and non-obese women. METHODS: This open-label non-randomized interventional study involved obese (BMI ? 25-35 kg/m2) and non-obese (BMI 18.5-23.0 kg/m2) women subjects. Levels of peptide YY and ghrelin were determined by radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively, while the degrees of hunger and satiety were measured using visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires. The results were compared in fasting condition and in 15, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after breakfast with balance composition formulation. This study also compared the ad libitum intake within 4 hours after breakfast. RESULTS: As compared to the non-obese group, the obese group have significantly lower levels of peptide YY in fasting, and in 15, 60, 120, and 180 minutes post-prandial, and smaller AUC (Area Under the Curve) of fasting peptide YY. Furthermore, the obese group showed significantly higher ad libitum intake. The obese group also have lower levels of ghrelin and lower VAS for hunger and higher in VAS for satiety as compared to the non-obese group. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in peptide YY level, 4 hours after breakfast ad libitum intake, ghrelin level, and VAS for hunger and satiety, between obese group and non-obese one.","ghrelin; peptide YY; adult; area under the curve; blood; female; human; hunger; Indonesia; insulin resistance; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; satiety; visual analog scale; Adult; Area Under Curve; Female; Ghrelin; Humans; Hunger; Indonesia; Insulin Resistance; Obesity; Peptide YY; Satiation; Visual Analog Scale"
"Cox maze IV versus left atrial reduction for atrial contraction restoration",2019,"Background: The Cox maze procedure is the gold-standard concomitant surgical procedure to restore sinus rhythm in rheumatic mitral valve disease with atrial fibrillation. Left atrial reduction surgery was found to be beneficial for rhythm conversion, but no study has investigated its efficacy compared to the Cox maze procedure for atrial contractility restoration. We aimed to compare the early success rate of left atrial contractility restoration with the Cox maze procedure and left atrial reduction in rheumatic subjects. Methods: Preoperative and within one-month postoperative electrocardiograms and echocardiograms of patients who underwent a Cox maze IV procedure or left atrial reduction with mitral valve surgery were compared. Effective atrial contraction was defined as A wave peak velocity ?10 cm·s?1 or atrial filling fraction ?20%. Results: Ninety patients (mean age 40.6 ± 10.2 years, 66.7% female) were divided equally into group A (Cox maze IV) and group B (left atrial reduction). The early sinus rhythm conversion rate was 64.4% versus 24.4% (p &lt; 0.001) in groups A and B, respectively. In patients with restored sinus rhythm, contractility was restored in 41.4% and 36.4% (p = 1.000). Postoperative left atrial volume index ?76 mL·m?2 was an independent variable associated with early atrial contractility restoration in both groups (prevalence rate 0.97, p = 0.007). Conclusions: In rheumatic subjects, the early sinus rhythm conversion rate was significantly higher after Cox maze IV compared to left atrial reduction, but for restoring left atrial contractility, left atrial reduction was not inferior to Cox maze IV. ?

"Parenteral Provision of Micronutrients to Adult Patients: An Expert Consensus Paper",2019,"Background: Micronutrients, an umbrella term used to collectively describe vitamins and trace elements, are essential components of nutrition. Those requiring alternative forms of nutrition support are dependent on the prescribed nutrition regimen for their micronutrient provision. The purpose of this paper is to assist clinicians to bridge the gap between the available guidelines’ recommendations and their practical application in the provision of micronutrients via the parenteral route to adult patients. Methods: Based on the available evidenced-based literature and existing guidelines, a panel of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals with significant experience in the provision of parenteral nutrition (PN) and intravenous micronutrients developed this international consensus paper. Results: The paper addresses 14 clinically relevant questions regarding the importance and use of micronutrients in various clinical conditions. Practical orientation on how micronutrients should be prescribed, administered, and monitored is provided. Conclusion: Micronutrients are a critical component to nutrition provision and PN provided without them pose a considerable risk to nutrition status. Obstacles to their daily provision—including voluntary omission, partial provision, and supply issues—must be overcome to allow safe and responsible nutrition practice. ? 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition","alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; copper; iron; pyridoxine; retinol; selenium; thiamine; trace element; vitamin D; zinc; adult; Article; consensus; critically ill patient; diet supplementation; human; parenteral nutrition; practice guideline; priority journal"

Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association of sociodemographic factors, health variables, and cognitive functioning. Results. The overall mean cognition score was 14.7 (SD=4.3) (range 0-34). In adjusted linear regression analysis, older age, having hypertension, and being underweight were negatively associated with better cognitive functioning and higher education was positively associated with better cognitive functioning. Conclusion. Several sociodemographic and health risk factors for poor cognitive functioning were identified which can guide intervention strategies in Indonesia. ? 2019 Supa Pengpid et al.",""
"Food purchasing behaviour among urban slum women in East Jakarta: A qualitative study",2019,"Introduction: Urbanisation in Indonesia has been associated with a transition in nutrition which has been, in part, marked by an increased purchasing of readyto- eat, energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods. Women are responsible for purchasing and preparing food for the family. Their purchasing behaviours differ in various environments and population groups. This qualitative study was undertaken to explore the food environmental factors that influenced food purchasing behaviour of women who were the household food gatekeepers. Methods: The study was conducted in a slum area in East Jakarta. Eighteen overweight-obese and nonobese women who fulfilled the study's inclusion criteria were recruited for interviews that used a semi-structured questionnaire. Emic observations were conducted in order to identify typical food purchasing activities. The data were coded and categorised using qualitative data analysis and research software (Atlas.ti 7 for Windows). Results: Most of the women purchased ready-to-eat foods rather than cook at home, either for the family or their own consumption. Several food environmental factors influenced women's purchasing behaviour, including time and cost efficiency, food availability, family, exposure to ready-to-eat foods and food store marketing strategies. These factors led to the consumption of unhealthy foods that were high in fat, carbohydrate, sugar and salt that some of which may cause obesity. Conclusion: Purchasing unhealthy food was observed to be strongly linked with food-related environmental factors. This study provides an understanding of women's food purchasing behaviour and highlight potential ways to foster healthier purchasing behaviour among urban slum dwellers. ? 2019 Malaysian Journal of Nutrition.",""
"The risk analysis of environmental health due to exposure of benzo[a]pyrene in fish smoking process (Benzo[a] pyrene effect study on smoked fish industry workers in bandarharjo, semarang)",2019,"Smoked fish is one of popular fish processed products in Indonesia. While smoke is one of problems in smoked fish industry. Benzo[a]pyrene is resulted by incomplete combustion. IARC stipulates benzo[a] pyrene as 2A category which means cancer cause in animals and probably also in humans. Analysis of health risk in smoked fish industry workers is needed in order to minimize the health risk. The aim of this research is to predict the health risk due to exposure of benzo[a]pyrene through inhalation on smoked fish industry workers. The research design uses environmental health risk analysis. The concentration value of benzo[a] pyrene in the air on 5 spots is &lt;0.002 ppm or &lt;0.02 mg/m3. The non-carcinogenic intake value (CDI) is 5.322 x 10-4 – 4.103 x 10-3 (mg/kg/day). The carcinogenic intake value (LADD) is 2.281 x 10-4 – 1.758 x 10-3 (mg kg/day). The non-carcinogenic risk value level is (RQ) 9.712 x 102 – 6.669 x 103. The carcinogenic health risk level is 7.070 x 10-4 – 5.451 x 10-3. The conclusion of this research is carcinogenic risk level (ECR) is &gt;10-4 and non-carcinogenic health risk value level is &gt; 1, so the value of RQ and ECR is categorized as risky.

"Optic neuropathy in breast malignancy",2019,"Purpose: To report a case in which a woman developed an optic disc abnormality that was related to breast malignancy. Case Presentation: A 35-year-old woman presented with a complaint of sudden blurred vision in her right eye（RE）. She had a history of Sj?gren syndrome and recurrent dyspnea. Visual acuity in her RE was only slightly reduced, but the visual field defect was prominent. Funduscopy was significant for a blunted optic nerve head margin with surrounding whitish lesion. Autoimmune optic neuropathy was initially suspected due to her history of Sj?gren syndrome; therefore, an oral steroid was administered. During subsequent follow-up, the fundus abnormality became more visible and expanded to the retinal background, accompanied by a worsening visual field. Systemic evaluation revealed a breast malignancy, and the patient was diagnosed with malignancy-related optic neuropathy. Conclusion: Optic nerve abnormality due to malignancy remains among the most challenging diseases in diagnosis. In this case, the patient presented with a history of autoimmune disease and no known oncologic history. Evaluation of such patients should include a comprehensive systemic survey in order to find clues for the etiology, including the possibility of malignancy and metastatic disease. ? 2019 Neuro-Ophthalmology Society of Japan.

"A situational analysis of a healthy school canteen development program: Lessons learned from a selected group of primary schools in Jakarta, Indonesia",2019,"The study aimed to describe the condition of school canteens and understand the challenges in implementing a healthy school canteen development program in a group of primary schools in Jakarta, Indonesia. We used a rapid appraisal approach employing structured observation and semi-structured qualitative interviews methods in 11 public primary schools in Senen subdistrict, Central Jakarta. This study determined that none of the schools fulfilled the requirements for a healthy school canteen. They lacked commitment and human resource development. Most schools used a semi-permanent building and food handlers in all schools had never had formal training on food hygiene and sanitation. The central weakness of school commitment indicates its association with other low performing indicators of a healthy school canteen. Schools in this study require further assistance to get started with a written policy and establish a committee for a healthy school canteen. ? 2019, SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All rights reserved.",""

"A multifaceted hand hygiene improvement program on the intensive care units of the National Referral Hospital of Indonesia in Jakarta",2019,"Background: Hand hygiene (HH) is considered to be the single most effective measure in preventing healthcare-associated infections. However, HH compliance rates among nurses and doctors in hospitals are often very low. Few studies have addressed HH compliance in Indonesia, performed interventions to increase HH compliance, and none have had long-term follow-up. We, therefore, addressed this issue by performing long-term follow-up after a multifaceted intervention in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Methods: This was an observational, prospective, before-and-after intervention study (May-September 2014, February-April 2017). We measured HH knowledge and HH compliance before (at baseline) and directly after a multifaceted improvement program (post-intervention) and performed a re-evaluation three years later. The multifaceted improvement program included education, feedback, reminders, interviews and the use of role models. The study involved nurses and physicians working in two ICUs of the Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta. Results: A total of 97 at baseline, and 72 at post-intervention HH knowledge questionnaires were completed. There was a statistically significant improvement in the median overall HH knowledge score at post-intervention (from 15 to 22, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two ICUs. The overall HH compliance was 27% at baseline and significantly improved to 77% post-intervention (p < 0.001). For all five HH moments, the compliance of nurses and physicians separately improved significantly from the baseline phase to the post-intervention phase (p < 0.001), except for 'moment 3' (after body fluid exposure), for which baseline rates were already high. Most of the compliance rates were significantly lower in both groups of healthcare workers upon follow-up three years later. Overall, the HH compliance of the nurses was significantly better than the physicians' compliance (p = 0.005). Conclusions: Our multifaceted improvement program, for nurses and physicians of the ICUs in the largest hospital of Indonesia, resulted in a significant improvement of the HH knowledge and HH compliance, but HH compliance levels waned over time after the intervention, indicating a need for continued monitoring and repeated interventions. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; follow up; hand washing; health education; health program; human; Indonesia; intensive care unit; intervention study; nurse; observational study; physician; priority journal; professional knowledge; prospective study; protocol compliance; trend study"
"N-Terminal-pro-b-Type natriuretic peptide levels and cardiac hemosiderosis in adolescent β-Thalassemia major patients",2019,"Background: Iron-induced cardiomyopathy remains the leading cause of mortality in patients with β-Thalassemia major. Iron overload cardiomyopathy, which may be reversible through iron chelation, is characterized by early diastolic dysfunction. Amino-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a sensitive biomarker of diastolic dysfunction. Aim: The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of NT-proBNP as a surrogate marker of iron overload examined with magnetic resonance imaging T2-star (MRI T2?). Methods: Sixty-eight β-Thalassemia major patients (10-18 years) with no signs of heart failure underwent NT-proBNP measurement before routine transfusion. All participants prospectively underwent cardiac MRI T2? examination within 3 months (median 19 days). Patients were divided as cardiac hemosiderosis (cardiac MRI T2? <20 ms) and nonhemosiderosis (cardiac MRI T2? >20 ms). Results: Of 68 patients, the male-To-female ratio was 1:1.1 and the median age was 14.1 years (range: 10-17.8 years). NT-proBNP levels were not different between hemosiderosis and nonhemosiderosis patients (P = 0.233). Further receiver operating characteristic analysis resulted in no significant correlation of NT-proBNP and MRI T2? (area under the curve 0.393, P = 0.233). Conclusion: Measurement of NT-proBNP levels cannot be used for early detection of cardiac iron overload in adolescent with β-Thalassemia major. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

"Renal intra-arterial heparin flushing for blood pressure control in refractory hypertension: A new method to salvage the unsalvageable renal artery stenosis",2019,"Refractory hypertension is a type of hypertension that requires special attention. Secondary causes of hypertension should be considered when uncontrolled blood pressure is present, especially in younger patients (<30 years). In this case, the presence of bilateral renal artery stenosis resulted in refractory hypertension and end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis. The main challenges will be discussed in this case is to deliver the most beneficial therapy considering the very limited option for revascularization therapy because of the late presentation of patient's condition. Intra-arterial heparin flushing was chosen for this patient to consider the advantages over the risks arising from the actions taken. ? 2019 Indian Journal of Nephrology | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","bisoprolol; candesartan; clonidine; nifedipine; terazosin; adult; Article; auscultation; blood pressure; blood pressure regulation; case report; clinical article; craniotomy; digital subtraction angiography; end stage renal disease; headache; hematoma; hemodialysis; human; hypertension; kidney angiography; kidney artery; kidney artery stenosis; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical examination; renal replacement therapy"

"Diagnosis and management of latent tuberculosis infection in Asia: Review of current status and challenges",2019,"Asia has the highest burden of tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection (LTBI) in the world. Optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of LTBI is one of the key strategies for achieving the WHO ‘End TB’ targets. We report the discussions from the Asia Latent TubERculosis (ALTER) expert panel meeting held in 2018 in Singapore. In this meeting, a group of 13 TB experts from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam convened to review the literature, discuss the barriers and propose strategies to improve the management of LTBI in Asia. Strategies for the optimization of risk group prioritization, diagnosis, treatment, and research of LTBI are reported. The perspectives presented herein, may help national programs and professional societies of the respective countries enhance the adoption of the WHO guidelines, scale-up the implementation of national guidelines based on the regional needs, and provide optimal guidance to clinicians for the programmatic management of LTBI. ? 2019","tuberculostatic agent; Asia; attitude to health; Bangladesh; Cambodia; clinician; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test; disease burden; drug efficacy; drug safety; health care access; health care need; health care personnel; high risk population; Hong Kong; household; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; India; Indonesia; latent tuberculosis; Malaysia; Myanmar; Philippines; practice guideline; prescription; prisoner; Review; scale up; short course therapy; Singapore; Taiwan; Thailand; Viet Nam; World Health Organization; Asia; latent tuberculosis; Antitubercular Agents; Asia; Humans; Latent Tuberculosis"
"Course of transforming growth factor ?1 in the systemic and cavernous blood of healthy males through different penile conditions",2019,"Studies on erectile dysfunction (ED) have revealed a relationship between smooth muscle atrophy and the accumulation of collagen in the corpus cavernosum (CC). Transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF ?1) is a cytokine which has been proposed to be involved in the fibrotic process in the CC. We aimed to evaluate the course of TGF ?1 in the systemic and cavernous blood of 17 healthy males through different phases of the sexual arousal response (exemplified by the penile conditions flaccidity, tumescence, rigidity and detumescence). An enzyme-linked immunoassay was used to measure the concentration of TGF ?1 (ng/ml) in both the systemic and cavernous blood at the stages of flaccidity, tumescence and detumescence. TGF levels were significantly higher in the cavernous compartment than in the systemic blood. A linear decrease was evident in the cavernous blood when the flaccid penis became tumescent (24.3?±?14.5 to 13.9?±?6.5) and rigid (to 8.7?±?3.1). At detumescence, TGF increased to 18.3?±?10.4. In contrast, the levels in the systemic circulation remained unchanged. The results are in support of the hypothesis that the concentration of TGF ?1 in the CC is regulated by adequate blood flow and oxygenation. ? 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","transforming growth factor beta1; transforming growth factor beta1; adult; Article; blood; blood flow; corpus cavernosum; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; human experiment; male; normal human; oxygenation; penis; sexual arousal; sexual behavior; systemic circulation; erectile dysfunction; penis erection; physiology; reference value; vascularization; young adult; Adult; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Penile Erection; Penis; Reference Values; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Young Adult"
"Unfinished first-line tuberculosis treatment in primary care in indonesia",2019,"Background. Unfinished tuberculosis (TB) treatment has slowly but surely become an unexpected event in the disease’s development into drug-resistant TB. Developing countries, mostly comprised of Asian and Eastern European countries, including Indonesia, have been overwhelmed in preventing drug-resistant TB outcomes and have also failed to avoid the development of this disease. Objectives. This review discusses the current issue of an unfinished first-line TB treatment strategy in primary care in Indonesia, presenting some relevant strategies in developing countries. Material and methods. A narrative review approach conducted on all existing evidence in selected scientific bibliographic sources. The researchers defined the keywords based on the research question as a search strategy. Results. Scarce resources and limited access, alongside national policy on TB control and management, contribute in different ways to impede first-line TB treatment in Indonesia. Empowerment of TB patients and their families are considered the best ways to increase awareness on TB medication in a low- to middle-income setting. The role of the hospital and private practitioner networks in the treatment and management of TB patients is essential for developing active-case-finding-approach programs for TB suspects in primary care in an Indonesian setting. Contrarily, the potential misunderstandings in TB treatment have led to peculiar events affected by poor surveillance systems for TB investigation contacts to prevent TB incidences in large populations. Conclusions. This study addressed the barrier of all stakeholders, particularly primary care, to achieve the Indonesian government’s goals of TB elimination by 2030 and zero TB findings by 2050. ? 2019 by Wydawnictwo Continuo.","amikacin; ciprofloxacin; cycloserine; ethionamide; kanamycin; protionamide; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; quinolone; awareness; drug sensitivity; government; health care facility; health care personnel; health care policy; health service; incidence; Indonesia; medical record; middle income group; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; outcome assessment; patient; physician; primary medical care; quality control; Review; treatment failure; tuberculosis"
"Triglycerides, independent of ferriman gallwey score, is a main determinant of free testosterone index in PCOS [version 1; referees: 2 approved]",2019,"Background: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, affecting 5-20% of women worldwide. Hyperandrogenism, as the primary characteristic of PCOS, is not always present in every patient. The hyperandrogenic phenotype of PCOS patients is influenced by both hormonal and metabolic dysfunctions. Therefore, this study aims to determine the correlation between hormone profile, lipid profile, and clinical profile with free testosterone index in subjects with PCOS. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital between July 2014 and December 2016. The study involved 76 women with PCOS, who were classified into 2 subgroups: 39 subjects in the hyperandrogenism group and 37 subjects in the non-hyperandrogenism group. Each subject underwent physical examination, blood sample collection, and USG examination. Bivariate analysis was done using independent t-tests and Mann Whitney U-tests, while multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression. Results: Triglyceride and testosterone level showed weak (r = 0.232, p = 0.044) and moderate (r = 0.460, p ? 0.001) positive correlation with FTI, while SHBG level showed moderate negative correlation (r =-0.483, p ? 0.001). Triglyceride was also found to be determinant of hyperandrogenism condition in PCOS patient (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00–0.04, p = 0.013). However, there was no significant difference observed between FGS and hyperandrogenism (p = 0.43). Conclusions: Triglycerides, testosterone, and SHBG were associated with hyperandrogenism in PCOS patients, while FGS showed no such association. ? 2019 Hestiantoro A et al.","follitropin; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; luteinizing hormone; prolactin; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; thyrotropin; triacylglycerol; adult; analytical parameters; Article; blood sampling; body mass; body weight; clinical assessment; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; Ferriman Gallwey Score; follitropin blood level; free testosterone index; glucose blood level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; homeostasis model assessment; human; hyperandrogenism; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; luteinizing hormone blood level; major clinical study; ovary polycystic disease; pathophysiology; physical examination; prolactin blood level; prospective study; social determinants of health; testosterone blood level; thyrotropin blood level; triacylglycerol blood level; waist circumference"
"Determination of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel in human plasma with prednisone as internal standard using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry",2019,"Objective: Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel as a combination of oral contraceptive drugs have very low dosage levels; hence, a highly sensitive and selective method of using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) is needed. Materials and Methods: This method was developed using prednisone as an internal standard, thus the purpose of this research was to get the optimum condition. The analytical method had been fully validated according to the European Medicines Agency guidelines, 2011.

Results: The validated method was accurate, precise, and sensitive with a lower limit of quantification at 5 and 100 pg/mL for ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, respectively. ? 2019 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences.","acetonitrile; ethinylestradiol; formic acid; levonorgestrel; prednisone; Article; controlled study; density gradient; drug determination; European Medicines Agency; flow rate; human; limit of quantitation; liquid liquid extraction; matrix effect; multiple reaction monitoring; practice guideline; priority journal; quantitative analysis; retention time; reversed phase liquid chromatography; tandem mass spectrometry; triple quadrupole mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography"
"The Practice of Exclusive Breastfeeding Can Reduce Frequency of Sick Children and Improve the Productivity of Health-Care Provider Mothers: Study in Samarinda, Indonesia",2019,"Sick children can be a reason a mother is absent from work or does not work optimally. This study aims to look at the relationship between exclusive breastfeeding practices and frequency of sick children and the productivity of health-care provider mothers. This quantitative study was done using a sample of 160 health-care provider mothers from hospitals in cities and districts in Samarinda, Indonesia. Data analysis was approached using Chi-square test for categorical variables. There is a significant relationship between the practice of exclusive breastfeeding and the frequency of sick children and the productivity of health-care provider mothers (p = 0.002). The results showed that the scores of OR on the frequency variable of sick children and maternal-productivity variables are 3.22 and 2.99, respectively. The practice of exclusive breastfeeding can reduce the frequency of sick children and the productivity of health-care provider mothers. The health-care provider mothers play a role in promoting exclusive breastfeeding and as role models in providing support for the application of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative with “Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding”. There is a need for regulations regarding maternity and breastfeeding leave regardless of employment status. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.","article; breast feeding; chi square test; child; city; data analysis; employment status; female; health care personnel; human; Indonesia; infant; mother; productivity; absenteeism; adult; breast feeding; cost of illness; cross-sectional study; health care personnel; health promotion; Indonesia; job performance; mother; newborn; procedures; psychology; Absenteeism; Adult; Breast Feeding; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Health Promotion; Humans; Indonesia; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Mothers; Work Performance"
