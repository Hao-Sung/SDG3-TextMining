Therefore, a population-based cancer registry is considered an essential element in the baseline and comprehensive analysis of the risk factors associated with HCC. We present a multicenter analysis of HCC registry from 2 hospitals in Indonesia. Methods: We performed a follow-up on patients with HCC who were admitted between January 2015 and November 2017 in Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital and Dharmais Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Patient's death was considered the primary outcome of the study. A multivariate analysis was conducted using logistic regression, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: A total of 282 patients with HCC included. At the last follow-up, 136 (48.2%) patients had died. Mortality rate was not significantly affected by sex, age, etiology, the presence of cirrhosis, nor surveillance of HCC. Based on the Child-Pugh (CP) classification, the OR increased progressively in CP C patients (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.08-3.53; P = 0.026). The progressive increase was also found in patients with a higher Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, and the OR for CP C and D patients were 3.50 (95% CI 1.18-10.38; P = 0.024) and 3.41 (95% CI 1.02-11.41; P = 0.047), respectively. Supportive treatment was the most common treatment modality with an OR of 2.17 (95% CI 1.14-4.16; P = 0.019), and it was associated with the mortality rate of HCC. Conclusions: The CP classification, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, and treatment modality might predict mortality in patients with HCC. Moreover, other parameters must be further evaluated. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Cirrhosis; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Mortality; Risk factors,sorafenib; adult; age; Article; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cell differentiation; chemoembolization; Child Pugh score; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; disease association; female; follow up; hepatitis C; human; Indonesia; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; population; radiofrequency ablation; risk factor,2-s2.0-85065903976

The study was a qualitative survey involving 100 selected participants (early adolescents, parents, teachers of junior high schools, and school nurses with 25 participants in each category) through snowball sampling method. Participants were interviewed with semi-structured open-ended questions. Data analysis was accomplished by the triangulation of data source. Smoking initiation arises reactive and assertive community response in rejecting negative impact of smoking-leading situation. Community response to the initiation of smoking among early adolescents has certain complex characteristics. Health professionals need to actively participate in building smoke-free community by constructing a practical model of public health nursing which is comprehensive to protect Indonesian early adolescents from negative impacts of culturally allowed smoking. ? 2020, ? 2020 The Author(s).

Methods: In cooperation with a Japanese company, we established a research team and gathered information on occupational health and safety (OHS) practices in nine countries where the target company operated manufacturing sites. We then developed a model hypothesis via research team meeting. The model hypothesis was introduced to local factories in Indonesia and Thailand as trial sites. We evaluated the roles of the company headquarters, the implementation process, and any improvements in OHS practices at the sites. Based on the results, a global OHSMS model was formalized for global introduction. Results: The model consisted of both headquarters and site roles. These roles were well-functioning, and OHS at the sites improved. Two issues concerning the functioning of the headquarters were identified: the need to establish a reporting system to the headquarters and the need to support the improvement of specialized human resources. By improving the model hypothesis to address these issues, the model was formalized for global introduction. Conclusions: The global OHSMS model was based on the use of methods and specialized human resources relevant to each region and their common objectives, as well as evaluation indicators based on the minimum requirements of the company headquarters. To verify the effectiveness of this model, the experiment should be extended to other countries. ? 2019 The Authors.

It has been suggested that SIRT1 activators may have a protective role against type 2 diabetes, the aging process, and inflammation. This study aimed to explore and identify medicinal plant compounds from Indonesian Herbal Database (HerbalDB) that might potentially become a candidate for SIRT1 activators through a combination of in silico and in vitro methods. Two pharmacophore models were developed using co-crystalized ligands that allosterically bind with SIRT1 similar to the putative ligands used by SIRT1 activators. Then, these were used for the virtual screening of HerbalDB. The identified compounds were subjected to molecular docking and 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation. Molecular dynamics simulation was analyzed using MM-GB(PB)SA methods. The compounds identified by these methods were tested in an in vitro study using a SIRT-Glo? luminescence assay. Virtual screening using structure-based pharmacophores predicted that mulberrin as the best candidate SIRT1 activator. Virtual screening using ligand-based pharmacophores predicted that gartanin, quinidine, and quinine to be the best candidates as SIRT1 activators. The molecular docking studies showed the important residues involved were Ile223 and Ile227 at the allosteric region. The MM-GB(PB)SA calculations confirmed that mulberrin, gartanin, quinidine, quinine showed activity at allosteric region and their EC50 in vitro values are 2.10; 1.79; 1.71; 1.14 μM, respectively. Based on in silico and in vitro study results, mulberin, gartanin, quinidine, and quinine had good activity as SIRT1 activators. ? 2019 The Authors",Indonesia medicinal plants database (HerbalDB); Molecular dynamics simulation; Pharmacophore-based; SIRT1 activator; Virtual screening,"Acetylation; Database systems; Ligands; Molecular modeling; Pharmacodynamics; Plants (botany); Reaction kinetics; Medicinal plants; Molecular dynamics simulations; Pharmacophores; SIRT1 activator; Virtual Screening; Molecular dynamics; SIRT1 protein, human; sirtuin 1; chemistry; factual database; human; Indonesia; medicinal plant; metabolism; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; Databases, Factual; Humans; Indonesia; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Plants, Medicinal; Sirtuin 1",2-s2.0-85069931969

Design/methodology/approach: IDZ has five components in measuring the effectiveness of charity for the welfare of the community is the economic dimension, the dimension of education, dimension of health, social dimension of humanity and dimensions of da’wah. The economic dimension consists of four variables, namely, the presence of productive economic activities, trade centers and access to transportation and logistics services and the presence of access to financial institutions. Findings: Based on IDZ measurement in Bringinsari village, it is found that IDZ of this village is 0.47. It showed that the condition of the village is good enough. As the result of this calculation, Bringinsari village is under consideration to receive zakat funding. Research limitations/implications: This research will be done in Bringinsari village Sukorejo district, Kendal regency from April 1, 2018 until July 2, 2018. Practical implications: Based on the result of IDZ result done in Bringinsari Sukorejo district, Kendal regency, it is gained index calculation result for about 0.47. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that the village deserves to get zakat funding. Economic dimension is still low, 0.32. Therefore, in this case, a motivation to help villagers is needed. The exact program in improving the people in Bringinsari based on priority is economic, health, education program in accordance with IDZ calculation. Social implications: The welfare measurement of zakat receiver or mustahiq adopts welfare index (CIBEST). CIBEST model combines material and spiritual fulfillment of human needs quadrants. This index is split into four categories, namely, welfare, material poverty, spiritual poverty and absolute poverty (Puskas BAZNAS, 2016). Originality/value: Based on measurement result that has been obtained, the authors can recommend some program activities to help improving their welfare. There are three dimensions, which IDZ prioritized or considered to be assisted, such as economic dimension, activity program for housewives. If Bringinsari has got an indicator as a good village and the impact is good as well, therefore, it can try to move zakat fund distribution to other villages. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Assessment; Evaluation; Zakat; Zakat village index,,2-s2.0-85071604870

However, extraction of radiosensitivity data from the literature is highly labor-intensive. To aid in this task, using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other computer technologies, we developed an analysis pipeline that extracts radiosensitivity data derived from clonogenic assays from the literature. Materials and methods: Three classifiers (C1–3) were developed to identify publications containing radiosensitivity data derived from clonogenic assays. C1 uses Faster Regions CNN with Inception Resnet v2 (fRCNN-IRv2), VGG-16, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify publications that contain semi-logarithmic graphs showing radiosensitivity data derived from clonogenic assays. C2 uses fRCNN-IRv2 and OCR to identify publications that contain bar graphs showing radiosensitivity data derived from clonogenic assays. C3 is a program that identifies publications containing keywords related to radiosensitivity data derived from clonogenic assays. A program (iSF2) was developed using Mask RCNN and OCR to extract surviving fraction after 2-Gy irradiation (SF2) as assessed by clonogenic assays, presented in semi-logarithmic graphs. The efficacy of C1–3 and iSF2 was tested using seven datasets (1805 and 222 publications in total, respectively). Results: C1–3 yielded sensitivity of 91.2% ± 3.4% and specificity of 90.7% ± 3.6%. iSF2 returned SF2 values that were within 2.9% ± 2.6% of the SF2 values determined by radiation oncologists. Conclusion: Our analysis pipeline is potentially useful to acquire radiosensitivity data derived from clonogenic assays from the literature. ? 2019 The Authors",Clonogenic assays; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Radiation oncology; Radiosensitivity,article; classifier; clonogenic assay; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; drug efficacy; human; human cell; in vitro study; mining; molecular recognition; pipeline; publication; radiation oncologist; radiation oncology; radiosensitivity; sensitivity and specificity; convolutional neural network,2-s2.0-85070721005

Known formerly as histiocytosis X, the disease has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including eosinophilic granuloma (solitary bone lesion), diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos. Many of these patients initially present to orthopaedic surgeons, and misdiagnosis is frequent. Methods: We deliver a case of a 10-month-old boy who consulted to our department. Previously misdiagnosed as a Kawasaki syndrome, TORCH, and osteomyelitis. He had undergone several examinations and had been discussed in clinocipathological conference (CPC) to narrow down the diagnosis. Result: After serial examinations, the diagnosis of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis was confirmed and chemotherapy was initiated. And after 6 cycles of chemotherapy, with 1-week interval of each therapy, the clinical appearance of this patient significantly improved. Conclusion: Despite major advances in our understanding and management of LCH, it remains one of the most challenging diagnoses for the orthopedic surgeon. By doing a comprehensive examination, it is possible to narrowing down the diagnosis and planning the accurate treatment. ? 2019 The Author(s)",Bone lesion; Case report; Langerhans cell hystiocytosis,etoposide; vinblastine; Article; bone lesion; bone radiography; case report; clinical article; cortical bone; echography; femur; fever; hemoptysis; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; infant; Langerhans cell histiocytosis; lymphadenopathy; male; multiple cycle treatment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pediatric patient; rectum hemorrhage; soft tissue; thigh; throat irritation,2-s2.0-85070412283

Methods and Materials: Between October 2007 and May 2016, 106 patients with untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were enrolled in the present study. Radiation therapy consisted of pelvic irradiation (total dose, 50 Gy in 25 fractions including central shielding), prophylactic paraortic regional irradiation (36-40 Gy in 20 fractions), and either high- or low-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) according to institutional practice. The planned point A dose was 21 to 28 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions for high-dose-rate ICBT and 40 to 41 Gy in 1 to 2 fractions for low-dose-rate ICBT. Five cycles of weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2) were administered during the radiation therapy course. Results: A total of 106 patients were enrolled. Of these, 9 had major protocol violations and 2 did not receive treatment because of worsened general condition. Thus, 95 patients were evaluable. The median follow-up was 56 months. Of the 95 patients, 76 (80%) received 4 or 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Acute grade 3 leukopenia was observed in 20 of the patients (21%), and late grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in 3%. The 2-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rate for all patients were 96%, 78%, and 90%, respectively.

Methods: This cross-sectional comparison analytic study aimed to identify the differences between the supportive nursing care needs of the gynecological cancer inpatients and outpatients. Data were collected from 200 participants who were recruited through consecutive sampling method. Results: The results showed that gynecological cancer inpatients needed more supportive nursing care than the outpatients. The most reported supportive nursing care needs of the inpatients were in the domains of physical (80%) and the psychological (84%). Whilst, the outpatients needed more health information support (78%).

The climate change and poor level of awareness and knowledge of the community in Indonesia have caused an increase in the DHF cases. Outbreaks on January until April 2015, the morbidity rate reached 50.75. In 1996, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted threefold increase in the dengue hemorrhagic fever incidents in Indonesia by 2070, if the environment and community conditions do not improve. This study aims to provide a dynamic model to predict the dynamics of the DHF incidents based on climate variability in the Special Capital Region of Jakarta. The design of this study was ecologic study with hypothesis test, modelling, simulation, and intervention. In collecting the data, interview with respondents and measurement of climate variables were conducted. Interviews with respondents include the level of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour (PSP) of the community. Measurements of climate factors include rainfall, temperature, humidity and CO2 level in the ambient environment. The DHF system dynamics model simulation shows that the significant effect on the decline of Breeding Places and the decrease of DHF cases were achieved by increasing the participation of the community to actively control water places that are potential for mosquito breeding places. ? 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Climate models; Environmental engineering; Ambient environment; Climate variability; Climate variables; Dengue hemorrhagic fever; Hypothesis tests; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Mosquito breeding; System dynamics model; Climate change,2-s2.0-85071868681

Although neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be important for viral clearance, is it not clear whether the quantitative and qualitative nature of antibodies play a role in progression to chronic disease. Objectives: To characterize and compare the antibody responses in acute and chronic patients in a prospective observational CHIKV study in Cura?ao during the 2014-2015 outbreak. Study design: We performed virus neutralization tests and ELISA on plasma samples collected from a prospective observational chikungunya study in Cura?ao to compare the complement-dependent and –independent neutralization capacity, as well as the antibody avidity index of acute and chronic patients. Results: We found that there was no significant difference in the virus neutralization titers between patients with acute and chronic chikungunya infection. Furthermore, we found that complement increased the neutralization capacity when large amounts of virus was used. Moreover, we found that patients with acute chikungunya disease had a significantly higher antibody avidity index compared to those with chronic disease. Conclusions: This study suggests that virus neutralization titers in late convalescent sera do not play a role in chronic chikungunya. However, the median antibody avidity was lower in these patients and may therefore suggest a role for antibody avidity in the development of chronic disease. ? 2019","acute; Chikungunya; chronic; complement,avidity; neutralizing antibody",glycoprotein E1; glycoprotein E2; immunoglobulin G antibody; neutralizing antibody; protein antibody; virus antibody; acute disease; acutely ill patient; antibody affinity; antibody response; Article; Asian; chikungunya; Chikungunya virus; chronic disease; chronic patient; Curacao; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemic; genotype; human; major clinical study; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; virus neutralization,2-s2.0-85067500076

Cancer is a life threatening disease in the world today. There are so many types of cancer in the world, one of which is colon cancer. Colon cancer is one of the number one killers in the world. However, because there isn't any obvious symptom of colon cancer at an early stage, people do not realize that they suffer from it. Even though cancer formation is different for each type of cancer, it is still a big challenge to make cancer classification with good accuracy. Many machine learning has been applied to the data of human's genes in order to get the most relevant genes in the classification of cancer. The author proposes the Na?ve Bayes Classifier model as a classification method to show that the model has good accuracy, good precision, good recall, good f 1 - score in classifying the data of patients suffering from colon cancer or not. In this proposed model, Na?ve Bayes Classifier is a technique prediction based on simple probabilistic and on the application of the Bayes theorem (or Bayes rule) with a strong independence assumption. Therefore, this model is able to make higher classification accuracy with less complexity. In particular, it achieves up to 95.24% classification accuracy, thus this model can be an efficient analysis tool. ?

Both of these diseases share common pathogenesis involving inflammation of prostatic tissues. Chronic inflammation will induce the release of cytokines, followed by cells injury and tissues damage. One of the cytokines that play a role in prostate pathology is IL-6. The inflammation will also induce the releases of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGFβ-1. AIM: This study aims to analyse the expression of IL-6 and TGFβ-1, in prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an observational study, using paraffin-embedded tissue samples of prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Samples were obtained from the laboratory of Pathological Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Andalas University, Padang, Indonesia. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the cytokine expression, and a semiqunatitaves measurement according to Immunoreactive score (IRS) was performed for evaluation. For the TGFβ-1, the stromal expression was also analysed by measurement of the stromal stained area. The correlation of cytokine expression to Gleason index score was also analysed in prostate cancer. RESULTS: The result showed that this study found that TGFβ-1 was detected both in the stromal component as well as epithelial. With the stromal being the dominant site of expression. The stromal TGFβ-1 expression was of significantly higher in prostate hyperplasia compares to prostate cancer (p > 0.05), while the epithelial expression of TGFβ-1 was not found to be significantly different. IL-6 was mostly expressed intracytoplasmic in epithelia. The IL-6 expression was significantly higher in prostate cancer compared to hyperplasia. However, there was no significant correlation to found between IL-6 expression to the Gleason Score among prostate cancers.

Talaromyces atroroseus was isolated from the rat that caught from the house of patient with talaromycosis, while Purpureocillium lilacinum and Penicillium citrinum were isolated from the other rat caught in the house of healthy individual. Although naturally could be found in the environment, these species had been reported to cause fatal systemic mycosis in human. In conclusion Talaromyces atroroseus, Purpureocillium lilacinum and P. citrinum could be found in rat. This result indicates that rat could be a reservoir for these fungi. ? 2019 Author(s).",fungi; Jakarta; mycosis; rat; zoonoses,,2-s2.0-85067074757

There is no specific medication against the dengue virus. Recently, many types of research have been conducted to discover a new drug for dengue virus using natural resource extracts. Indonesia, as a tropical country, has a wide biodiversity. There are several medicinal plants in Indonesia that are believed to possess anti-dengue activity, such as Myristica fatua, Cymbopogon citratus, and Acorus calamus plants. We conducted an in vitro laboratory experiment of several extracts from Indonesian herbs combined with in silico analysis. The extracts were evaluated for safety and antiviral activity in Huh7it-1 cell lines, using a single dose of 20 ?g/mL and dose-dependent (5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 ?g/mL) of plant extracts against dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) NGC strain. The DMSO 0.1% was used as a negative control. The cytotoxic aspect was assessed by counting the cell viability, while the antiviral activity was calculated by counting the average inhibition. The selectivity index (SI) of plant extracts were performed from a ratio of CC50/EC50 value. In silico analysis was conducted to determine the free energy of binding between NS5 of dengue virus with bioactive compounds contained in Myristica fatua, Cymbopogon citratus and Acorus calamus extract plants. We determined that all extracts were not toxic against Huh7it-1 cell lines. The methanolic extracts of A. calamus, C. citratus, and M. fatua showed inhibition of DENV-2 at a dose of 20 ?g/mL to 96.5%, 98.9%, and 122.7%, respectively. The dose-dependent effects showed that M. fatua has the best inhibition activity towards DENV-2. Molecular docking result showed that artesunic acid within M. fatua has the best free energy of binding (?7.2 kcal/mol), followed by homoegonol (?7.1 kcal/mol) which was slightly different from artesunic acid among others. The methanolic extracts of A. calamus, C. citratus, and M. fatua showed prospective anti-dengue activities both in vitro and in silico. Future research should be conducted to find the pure extracts of all useful herbs as a new candidate of antiviral drug. ? 2019 by the authors.

We assessed the effects of maternal antenatal exposure to SHS on infant growth rate, and secondarily, on birth weight, birth length and head circumference at birth. Methods In this prospective cohort, 305 mother-infant pairs were studied. Mothers filled out questionnaires about exposure to SHS in pregnancy at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Infant anthro-pometry was performed at birth, day 7, and months 1, 2, 4, and 6, postnatally. Linear mixed modeling and linear regression were used to calculate growth rates over the first 6 months. The association between SHS-exposure with growth rate and birth sizes was assessed using multivariate linear regression adjusted for confounders, with SHS as both number of cigarettes and as groups (no exposure, SHS &lt; 23 cigarettes, SHS 23 cigarettes). Results Seventy-three mothers were not exposed and 232 were exposed. SHS exposure (per cigarette) was not related to gain in weight, length, head circumference, and weight for length. However, infants born to mothers exposed to 23 cigarettes/d had lower head circumference gain (-0.32 mm/m, 95% CI -0.60, -0.03) than those born to non-exposed mothers. SHS exposure (per cigarette) was not related to birth weight, length, and head circumference, but exposure to 23 cigarettes was related to lower head circumference at birth (-11.09 mm, -20.03, -2.16). Conclusions Heavy antenatal exposure to SHS in non-smoking mothers results in reduced neonatal head circumference at birth and head circumference gain over the first 6 months of life. Our findings show no clear relations between exposure to SHS during pregnancy and other markers of neonatal growth and birth size. ? 2019 Soesanti et al.

Typically, the first source of correlation needs to be addressed but its quantification is of less interest. Here, we focus on the correlation between time points. In addition, the effects of covariates on the multivariate counts distribution need to be assessed. To fulfill these requirements, a regression model based on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution for association between covariates and the categorical counts is extended by using random effects to deal with the additional clustering. This model is the Dirichlet-multinomial mixed regression model. Alternatively, a negative binomial regression mixed model can be deployed where the corresponding likelihood is conditioned on the total count. It appears that these two approaches are equivalent when the total count is fixed and independent of the random effects. We consider both subject-specific and categorical-specific random effects. However, the latter has a larger computational burden when the number of categories increases. Our work is motivated by microbiome data sets obtained by sequencing of the amplicon of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. These data have a compositional structure and are typically overdispersed. The microbiome data set is from an epidemiological study carried out in a helminth-endemic area in Indonesia. The conclusions are as follows: time has no statistically significant effect on microbiome composition, the correlation between subjects is statistically significant, and treatment has a significant effect on the microbiome composition only in infected subjects who remained infected. ? 2019 The Authors.

To date, there is no data on patient-reported outcomes reflecting the real-world practice in Asia where endometriosis is a relevant health, social and economic burden. This non-interventional, multi-center, prospective study aims to investigate the influence of dienogest on HRQoL. Methods: Asian women received dienogest (2 mg/daily) and were followed for 24 months. The effectiveness of dienogest to improve HRQoL and endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP) was assessed by patient-reported outcomes. HRQoL, especially the ""pain"" domain as primary endpoint, was evaluated with the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30) questionnaire. The numeric rating scale served to determine changes in the severity of EAPP. Within the presented interim analysis (data cut-off: 2017-11-27), the mean changes in EHP-30 and EAPP scores from baseline to 6 months upon availability of the data were evaluated. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and bleeding profiles were documented. Results: Dienogest therapy decreased EHP-30 scores in all assessed domains (score 0-100, lower scores indicate better HRQoL). Primarily, the ""pain"" domain was improved in 78.4% of patients. EAPP was reduced (score 0-10, lower scores reflect less pain), highlighted by a mean reduction of the pain score by - 4.5 points. Patients with a higher EAPP score at baseline had an increased response to dienogest (- 6.2 points mean change) compared to patients with low baseline EAPP severity (- 1.4 points mean change). Both surgically and clinically diagnosed patients described comparable pain reduction, as well as women with or without prior treatment. Drug-related TEAEs were documented for 31.5% of patients, with amenorrhoea (5.9%) and metrorrhagia (5.1%) being the most common events. The bleeding pattern was changed upon dienogest, characterized by decreased normal bleeding (84.2 to 28.8%) and increased amenorrhea (3.2 to 42.9%) at 6 months. Conclusion: The data indicate an amelioration of HRQoL and EAPP upon dienogest therapy. No new safety signals were observed. Therefore, its use as first-line therapy for long-term management of debilitating and chronic endometriosis-associated pain represents an interesting option that remains to be further investigated.

Patient compliance with tuberculosis treatment is still very low. Thus the success rate of treatment is also unsatisfactory. Concordance behaviour is a model of the doctor-patient relationship that combines aspects of the partnership, sharing decision making and trust. It is considered better than adherence to improve compliance and quality of life in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. AIM: This study aims to assess the relationship between concordance and the level of adherence to pulmonary tuberculosis treatment along with the quality of life in Medan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 259 tuberculosis patients from several clinics and hospitals in Medan from 2015 to 2017, by asking patients to fill out questionnaires that had been tested for validity and reliability first. The concordance behaviour questionnaire contains 56 questions covering aspects of knowledge, partnership, sharing decision making, trust, and support. While compliance was measured by 14 questions covering attitude and behaviour. Statistical analysis was performed by Chi-Square test in SPSS v20. RESULTS: This study shows that most TB patients (75.7%) have a good concordance, in which the aspect of knowledge, partnership, sharing and support were all good. However, the component of trust in the most patient (75.7%) was still low. Based on the level of compliance, 84.2% of patients had good compliance. However, the level of behaviour in 55.2% of patients was still low. Statistical analysis showed that there was a significant relationship between concordance and compliance (p = 0.009), in which patient with good concordance had 2.6 higher probability for good compliance. However, there was no significant association between concordance and quality of life (p = 0.63). CONCLUSION: Concordance behaviour is a good concept to be applied to improve treatment compliance of pulmonary TB patients. ? 2019 Pandiaman Pandia, Tamsil Syafiuddin, Adang Bachtiar, Kintoko Rochadi.",Compliance; Concordance; Quality of life; Tuberculosis,adult; aged; Article; attitude to health; behavior; child; cross-sectional study; decision making; doctor patient relationship; female; government; health care; human; knowledge; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; middle aged; patient compliance; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; validity,2-s2.0-85071914932

Perception is also an important factor that acts as a precursor to a behavior or a basis for risk prevention. School employees are in direct contact with children, who often have accidents. Therefore, risk perception studies involving school employees are required to develop any necessary accident prevention programs. Ten health and safety risks were chosen, which were being pinched, hit or pricked; falling down the stairs; being hit by a motorized vehicle; fire; natural disasters; noise; food contamination; hazardous chemicals; eye strain; and stress due to workload. Nine psychometric paradigms, namely: Voluntariness of risk, the immediacy of effect, known to those exposed to of risk, known to science, controllability, newness, chronic-catastrophic, common-dread, and severity of consequences, were used to evaluate the perception. The population of this study was all teachers and administrative staff at 14 primary schools at Depok City. The total number of respondents was 199 people. This study shows that, of the ten risks studied, a risk that can be accepted voluntarily is eye strain; risks that cannot be accepted voluntarily are fire and contaminated food; a risk that has a delayed effect is stress due to workload; a long-standing risk which has an immediate effect is being pinched, hit or pricked; a risk that is known to science and is often experienced but can be controlled is eye strain; while a risk which has many effects, may be fatal, and is feared and uncontrollable is a natural disaster. It was shown that natural disaster has been perceived as unacceptable risk among ten risks under study. The perception of natural disasters was that they are catastrophic, dreaded, certainly fatal, and sometimes uncontrollable. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Most of the migrant workers are females with children, creating a huge number of left-behind children (LBC). The issue of LBC has become important to discuss because LBC tends to experience more emotional and behavioral problems than non-LBC. The aim of this study was to assess and compare emotional and behavioral problems between LBC and non-LBC in Indonesia. This paper analyzes data from a project by the Community Mental Health Research Group from the Faculty of Psychology, Universitas Indonesia, held in 2015 - 2016. Materials and Methods: Participants were 629 adolescents: 359 LBC and 270 non-LBC. The data were acquired in a cross-sectional study conducted in rural Indonesia. Data on emotional and behavioral problems were assessed with Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, while data related to risk factor variables were collected using multidimensional scale of perceived social support, the 6-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, and Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems in LBC was 28.4% compared to 21% among non-LBC. Peer attachment, communication, social support, and loneliness were identified as factors that impact the emotional and behavioral problems among LBC. Conclusions: LBC has more emotional and behavioral problems than non-LBC. Comprehensive understanding of various protective and risk factors is needed to provide impactful interventions for LBC. ? 2019 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch | Published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow.",Adolescents; emotional and behavioral problem; left-behind children; migrant parent,,2-s2.0-85066896481

Previous study found that hyperglycemia and or local inflammation (such as periodontitis) modulated systemic pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the effect of DM and or periodontitis on systemic cytokines and adipocytokines levels. Methods and materials: A total of 57 participants with age of 29–71 years were recruited for this study. We divided them into three groups; DM-periodontitis (n = 22), periodontitis without DM (n = 16) and control (n = 19). All participants underwent physical examinations (BMI, WC, periodontal status examination) and laboratory examinations (FBG, fasting insulin, CRP, adiponektin, leptin, TNF-α and IL-10). Results: The proportion of severe periodontitis were higher in DM-periodontitis group compared to periodontitis without DM (77.3% vs 6.2%). DM-periodontitis group had lower adiponectin levels than that of periodontitis without DM group [5860.78 ± 4182.40 vs 9553.13 ± 6794.73; p = 0.046].

This study compared fasting with postprandial TG and analyzed the relationship between postprandial TG with various demographic and metabolic parameters after ingestion of standardized high fat liquid meal. Result: There was an upward trend from fasting TG to 2 h postprandial TG and 4 h postprandial TG. There was strong correlation between fasting TG and 2 h postprandial TG with 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.731; p < 0.0001 dan r = 0.669; p < 0.0001, respectively).

In a systematic review, 4.6 per cent (95% CI 2.7-8.2) of pregnancies were complicated by preeclampsia worldwide. Preeclampsia occurs in around 10% of pregnancies in the world whereas developing countries contribute more than developed countries. In developing countries, there are 13 cases of preeclampsia in every 1,000 births, whereas in developed countries only 2-3 cases of preeclampsia are found in every 10,000 deliveries. Variations in prevalence among countries reflect, at least in part, differences in the distribution of maternal age and the proportion of nulliparous pregnant women in the population. AIM: We aimed to investigate the role of placental growth factor, soluble endoglin, and uterine artery diastolic notch to predict the early onset of preeclampsia. METHODS: This study used an analytical study with a nested case-control design. The study was conducted at Bunda Thamrin Hospital, Tanjung Mulia Mitra Medika Hospital, Sundari Hospital and a private clinic, from March to November 2018 with a total sample of 70 research subjects. RESULTS: Uterine artery diastolic notch was not found in 50% of subjects. A total of 27 subjects (38.6%) had a unilateral diastolic notch, and 8 subjects (11.4%) had a bilateral diastolic notch. Cut-off point PIGF levels was 441 pg/ml, and Area Under Curve (AUC) 82.5% (95% CI 61.5%-100%), with sensitivity 80% and specificity 87.7%. The levels sEng in this study could not predict the incidence of early-onset preeclampsia (p = 0.113). Combined PlGF and pulsatile index of uterine arteries may predict early onset preeclampsia with sensitivity 40% and specificity 90.77%. From these results, pregnant women o 22-24 weeks of pregnancy, the levels of PlGF and the uterine artery pulsatility index can be a predictor of early-onset preeclampsia. Examination of PlGF levels alone is sufficient as a predictor of early-onset preeclampsia.

Fast and accurate fault diagnosis in the transformer remains a challenge. This study proposes an intelligent system to diagnose fault types in the transformer using data mining approach, i.e. support vector machine (SVM). SVM has been known for its robustness, good generalization ability and unique global optimum solutions.

Patients who receive palliative therapy exhibit very diverse profiles. As such, researchers are keen to study the general characteristics of palliative patients. In addition, researchers will also assess the patient's and their family's insight that influences the success of the therapy and the impact of estimated survival time in making treatment decisions. METHODS: this research used cross-sectional descriptive analytic study and secondary data of 300 palliative patients who consult to Psychosomatic Palliative Team at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. The data were processed using SPSS version 25. The data processed included: sociodemographic characteristics, length of stay, incidence of death in hospital, DNR cases, the patient's and their family's insight, and the impact of estimated survival time on treatment decisions. RESULTS: most palliative patients were women (52.0%) aged 51 - 60 years (27.0%), unemployed (29.0%), and suffered from cancer (55.3%). In addition, the patients were generally treated for less than 1 month (83.6%), died in the hospital (37.3%), and consented to DNR orders (36.7%). These DNR cases are highly correlated to the family's understanding regarding the prognosis of the patient's condition (p = 0.022). The family's understanding of the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment goals (92.3%, 81.3%, and 87.7%) was better than the patient's (79.0%, 64.0%, and 69.7%). Furthermore, no link was found between the therapy choice (optimal, withholding, and withdrawing therapies) with the patient's estimated survival time (p = 0.174). CONCLUSION: female, elderly, and cancer patients most often get palliative therapy. The consent for DNR orders to palliative patient is notably frequent. Currently, the family's insight is much better than the patient's, which means that health care providers need to improve patient education and information. In addition, patients and families generally still opt for optimal therapy despite low estimated survival time.",Characteristics; do not resuscitate (DNR); Insight; Palliative; Therapy Options,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; attitude to health; child; cross-sectional study; decision making; family; female; human; Indonesia; male; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; palliative therapy; prognosis; psychology; resuscitation; sex factor; survival analysis; tertiary care center; time factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Making; Family; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Palliative Care; Prognosis; Resuscitation Orders; Sex Factors; Survival Analysis; Tertiary Care Centers; Time Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85071163962

Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is used to supplement cell culture media. However, human platelet lysate (hPL) represents an attractive alternative as it is nonxenogeneic. Methods: Human third molars were collected from six healthy donors (19–35 years old) with no history of regular alcohol consumption or smoking. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) at the second passage were divided into two culture media groups, 10% FBS and 5% hPL, as well as a control group after 24 h of serum starvation. A flow cytometry analysis was conducted to measure CD90, CD105, CD73, CD34, CD45, and Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR isotype (HLA-DR). Cellular proliferation was evaluated on days 1, 3, and 5. Results: The flow cytometry analysis revealed that the majority of the cells expressed positive mesenchymal stem cell surface markers, including CD73 (98.5%), CD90 (98.3%), and CD105 (71.0%), and lacked CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR. There were significant differences among the 5% hPL, 10% FBS, and control groups on days 1, 3, and 5. Conclusion: For a nonxenogeneic culture, 5% hPL can be used as an alternative in culture media for hDPSC proliferation. ? 2019 The Authors.",Fetal bovine serum; Human dental pulp stem cells proliferation; Human platelet lysate,5' nucleotidase; CD34 antigen; CD45RA antigen; cell surface marker; endoglin; growth factor; HLA DR antigen; receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase C; Thy 1 membrane glycoprotein; adult; Article; cell adhesion; cell growth; cell isolation; cell lysate; cell proliferation; cementoenamel junction; comparative study; controlled study; dental pulp stem cell; fetal bovine serum; flow cytometry; human; human cell; human tissue; mesenchymal stem cell; MTT assay; starvation; thrombocyte,2-s2.0-85067968161

The population of Asia exceeds 4.4 billion people. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Asia is characterized by specific distribution of genotypes, lack of access to specific therapeutic agents, relatively high cost of treatment, and lack of experienced healthcare providers. Clear consensus on the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of HCV infection specific to the Asian region is a major unmet need. The consensus guidelines documents that have been published to date by major medical societies presume access to an array of direct acting antiviral agents and diagnostic tests that are not broadly applicable to resource limited settings, including Asia. Methods. To address the lack of an Asia-specific set of HCV treatment guidelines, we assembled a panel of 15 HCV experts in the field of hepatology from India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Pakistan, Philippines, and Mongolia convened in April 2017 to review the updated literature and provide recommendations on the diagnosis and management of chronic HCV infection that reflects local conditions. Results. An evidence-based comprehensive compilation of the literature supported by the graded recommendations from the expert panel for the optimization of the diagnosis, pretreatment, on treatment, and posttreatment assessments, and management of chronic HCV infection has been presented in this article. Conclusions. With the evolving treatment landscape and addition of several new direct-acting antiviral agents and combination regimens into the therapeutic armamentarium, the current article may serve as a guide to the clinicians in optimizing the diagnosis and treatment selection for the management of chronic HCV infection in resource-limited settings. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Case report: We present the case of a 4-year-old boy with a closed left femoral fracture after he hit the floor. He was diagnosed with TM 1 year ago and was treated with oral methylprednisolone for 8 months. Discussion: In children, the prolonged use of corticosteroid enhances the osteoclast activity but reduces the osteoblast activity; this imbalance bone turnover causes osteoporosis that increases the fracture risk, which depends on the corticosteroid dose and treatment duration. Of note, the risk of fracture might last for years. Conclusion: The increased risk of fracture because of the prolonged use of corticosteroids might not impede the corticosteroid treatment if indicated. Hence, bone health status and nutritional monitoring must be performed at the beginning of treatment in children who need corticosteroid therapy with a cumulative dose >1 g/year. ? 2019 The Authors",Corticosteroid; Fracture; Transverse myelitis,methylprednisolone; Article; bone turnover; case report; child; clinical article; corticosteroid therapy; femur fracture; human; limb swelling; male; myelitis; osteoblast; osteoclast activity; osteoporosis; pain assessment; pathologic fracture; physical examination; physiotherapy; preschool child; prescription; priority journal; speech delay; speech rehabilitation; treatment duration; X ray,2-s2.0-85061897534

In the absence of BCR-ABL, the conventional diagnostic algorithm recommends JAK2 V617F mutation testing to support diagnosis of other MPN diseases such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. In certain cases of thrombocythemia, simultaneous upfront testing of both BCR-ABL and JAK2 may be desirable. We wanted to test the feasibility of multiplex detection of BCR-ABL transcript variants and JAK2 V617F mutation simultaneously using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based reverse dot-blot hybridization (RDB) method. Material and Methods: Separate biotinylated RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify specific BCR-ABL transcripts and JAK2 V617F mutant alleles. Specific hybridization of RT-PCR products with arrays of membrane-bound probes followed by colorimetric development would allow simultaneous visualization of BCR-ABL and/or JAK2 mutant transcripts in a given specimen. To validate the RDB method, we used cDNA specimens previously referred to our laboratory for routine clinical testing of BCR-ABL and/or JAK2. Results: The limit of detection or analytical sensitivity of the RDB method using cDNA specimens was 0.5% and 6.25% in detecting BCR-ABL and JAK2 mutant transcripts, respectively. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity to detect BCR-ABL and JAK2 were 100% and 92.3% (N = 38); and 100% and 100% (N = 27), respectively. RDB also detected BCR-ABL transcripts in 22% of JAK2 V617F mutation-positive samples (N = 14). Conclusions: RT-PCR RDB is a promising qualitative multiplex method to detect BCR-ABL and JAK2 mutant transcripts simultaneously. In this study, we described the feasibility of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reverse dot-blot hybridization for BCR-ABL and JAK2 co-testing in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. We have demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR reverse dot-blot hybridization method are similar to routine methods. This method is suitable for laboratories in developing countries. We are hopeful that our results would contribute to simplify the diagnostic workup of suspected myeloproliferative neoplasms, especially in the developing countries with limited access to real time RT-PCR-based tests. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",CML; Diagnostic test; Indonesia; Multiplex testing; PV,BCR ABL protein; complementary DNA; Janus kinase 2; Article; cancer diagnosis; chronic myeloid leukemia; colorimetry; controlled study; developing country; dot hybridization; feasibility study; HL-60 cell line; human; K-562 cell line; limit of detection; myelofibrosis; myeloid metaplasia; myeloproliferative neoplasm; oligonucleotide probe; polycythemia vera; predictive value; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; thrombocythemia,2-s2.0-85061373041

Two interaction effects were observed: (a) a stronger ethnic identity was associated with less distress among the foreign born than the U.S. born; and (b) a stronger ethnic identity exacerbated the relationship between everyday discrimination and distress among the U.S. born. Ethnic identity, which involves ethnic pride, participation in cultural practices, and cultural commitment or sense of belonging, was associated with better psychological well-being among the foreign born than the U.S. born.

Biclustering is the process to cluster the dataset through two perspectives. The result of biclustering can be applied to predict unidentified protein interactions. Currently, this technique is more efficiently and effectively than the experimental method. The LCM-MBC is one of the biclustering algorithms to find biclusters from protein interactions dataset.

Biological markers such as fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) are related to muscle invasiveness of bladder cancer. This study was aimed to analyze the expression of FGFR3 and HIF-1α to predict muscle invasiveness in bladder cancer patients. METHODS This was an observational study with a case-control design. Sixty patients with bladder cancer, who underwent histopathology examinations at the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara/H. Adam Malik Hospital from January 2012 to December 2015, were included in this study. Samples were then classified into 30 NMIBC and 30 MIBC groups. All samples were analyzed with an immunohistochemistry assay for FGFR3 and HIF-1α. H-scores were used to determine the relationships between each group. RESULTS FGFR3 was expressed in 29 (96.7%) patients of the NMIBC group, and 23 (76.7%) patients of the MIBC group (p=0.026, OR=8.8; 95% CI=1.01-76.96).

Epithelial ovarian cancer type II is characterized by rapid tumor growth and is genetically more labile than type I. This study was aimed to demonstrate the prognostic value of CSC by using the markers CD133, CD44, and ALDH1A1 in EOC. METHODS Clinicopathological and demographic data were collected from medical records. The markers CD133, CD44, and ALDH1A1 were examined with flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression in patients with ovarian cancer types I and II were related to chemotherapy and survival. In multivariate analysis, the prognosis model was tested for ten months. RESULTS The largest demographic consisted of patients aged ?45 years, with stage I, poor differentiation, and type II, of which there were 40 samples (72.7%), 23 samples (41.8%), 30 samples (54.5%), and 16 samples (29.1%), respectively. There is a high correlation between the 10-month chemotherapy response and the 4 variables, i.e., age ?45 years, type II, stage III-IV, and CD44, with an ROC of 80.75% and a post-test probability of 82.5%. Using the ROC curve, the highest chemoresistance score was 0.841, based on the combination of CSCs markers and clinicopathological factors, that is stage III-IV, age ?45 years, poor differentiation, type II, negative CD133, high CD44, and high ALDH1A1. CONCLUSIONS CSC (CD133, CD44, and ALDH1A1) markers and clinicopathological factors are prognostic of epithelial ovarian cancer. ? 2019 Authors.",Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1; Cancer stem cells; CD133 antigen; CD44 antigen; Chemotherapy response; Epithelial ovarian cancer,aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1a1; CD133 antigen; Hermes antigen; tumor marker; unclassified drug; adult; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer stem cell; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; flow cytometry; histology; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; ovary carcinoma; predictive value; prospective study; protein expression; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; tumor growth,2-s2.0-85069193720

This study was conducted to investigate fatigue risk factors among pilots in PT XYZ. There were 196 participants in the study. In order to gather more information, a questionnaire was administered, and a systematic in-depth interview was performed on each pilot individually. The Samn-Perelli Subjective Scale, designed specifically to measure fatigue, was used, and the measurements were analysed using regression and correlation analysis. Of the participants, 60.5% frequently experienced post-flight fatigue. Measurement of fatigue levels showed that 26 participants (13%) experienced physical fatigue, 61 participants (30.5%) experienced mental fatigue and 47 participants (23.5%) experienced emotional fatigue. Occupational and non-occupational factors played a substantial role in the occurrence of fatigue. Of the various risk factors (such as quality of sleep, quantity of sleep and working hours), the number of flight sectors showed a positive correlation with fatigue. In contrast, smoking habits, exercise, caffeine consumption, flight duration and napping showed negative correlations with fatigue. To reduce the occurrence of fatigue, the current established programmes at PT XYZ (which include limitations on flight time and working hours, and provision of resting time) should be continued. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

It’s needed a mix method (epidemiology, ecology, and system thinking approach) to analyze and to choose the best intervention based on time series data. The study located in Demak, Jawa Tengah on May to November, 2014. Based on an existing model that formulated by time series data for six years (2007 – 2013), leptospirosis control was simulated using a system dynamics method. The simulation was based on seven pre-defined scenarios. The software used to assist the completion of the dynamic model was Powersim version 2.5 for Windows. Predictions extended over 5 years. The model predicted that, if the intervention was biological control and included rodent control, the leptospirosis cases could be prevented up to 20.7%. Wound care could prevent up to 1.6% of the disease. Efforts to prevent direct contact between healthy humans and urine of infected rodents had the strongest impact on reducing leptospirosis in this model, as this could decrease cases by up to 98.14%. Domestic waste management as a source of rodent food in households reduced the predicted number of leptospirosis cases by 1.8%. A combination of the prevention of contact between healthy humans with contaminated water, wound care, biological and mechanical rodent control, and domestic waste management together resulted in a predicted incidence of 0.45% leptospirosis cases per year. The model was a useful tool to predict the efficiency of leptospirosis control under various intervention scenarios. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Despite its in?vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the effects of CTX preventive therapy on tuberculosis (TB) remain unclear. Methods: Adults living with HIV enrolled in a regional observational cohort in Asia who had initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) were included in the analysis. Factors associated with new TB diagnoses after cohort entry and survival after cART initiation were analysed using Cox regression, stratified by site. Results: A total of 7355 patients from 12 countries enrolled into the cohort between 2003 and 2016 were included in the study. There were 368 reported cases of TB after cohort entry with an incidence rate of 0.99 per 100?person-years (/100?pys). Multivariate analyses adjusted for viral load (VL), CD4 count, body mass index (BMI) and cART duration showed that CTX reduced the hazard for new TB infection by 28% (HR 0.72, 95% CI l 0.56, 0.93). Mortality after cART initiation was 0.85/100?pys, with a median follow-up time of 4.63?years. Predictors of survival included age, female sex, hepatitis C co-infection, TB diagnosis, HIV VL, CD4 count and BMI. Conclusions: CTX was associated with a reduction in the hazard for new TB infection but did not impact survival in our Asian cohort. The potential preventive effect of CTX against TB during periods of severe immunosuppression should be further explored. ? 2019 The Authors.

The two families function in opposite directions. ZnT transporters mediate cellular zinc efflux or intracellular sequestration. Zn is found in human tooth enamel and dentine at levels that have been related to environmental exposures, such as pollution, disease, and dietary intake. The mechanism by which Zn in the odontoblast is deposited in the hard tissue of the tooth, however, is unknown but is important in determining the physical properties, and hence resilience, of enamel and in the context of the use of tooth zinc level as a biomarker of exposure. We hypothesised that zinc efflux mediated by members of the ZnT family of 10 transporters is a key step in this process and is regulated by zinc availability through effects on mRNA levels. Thus, we determined the profile of ZnT transporter mRNA in a human active-secretory odontoblast-like cell model under conditions of high- and low-extracellular Zn concentration and determined if the same transporter mRNAs were present in human dental pulp. ZnT1, ZnT5 and ZnT9 mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR in both the secretory odontoblast cells and human dental pulp. ZnT2, ZnT3 and ZnT10 mRNAs were not detected, and ZnT4 mRNA was detected in secretory odontoblasts only, which may be indicative of a specialised zinc efflux function during the active secretory phase of tooth development. ZnT1 mRNA was significantly increased in response to extracellular Zn exposure (60 μM) after 24 h. The presence of Zn transporter mRNAs in secretory odontoblasts and dental pulp indicates that the corresponding transport proteins function to deposit zinc in the dental hard tissues. The responsiveness of ZnT1 in odontoblasts to zinc availability is concordant with this being a process that is regulated to maintain cellular Zn homeostasis and that is a mediator of the relationship between environmental Zn exposure and dental Zn deposition. These findings have likely relevance to human dental health through effects of Zn transporter expression level on the hard tissue properties. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Enamels; Proteins; Tissue; Tooth enamel; Dental hard tissues; Dietary intakes; Environmental exposure; Extracellular; Human tooth enamels; Transport proteins; Transporter expression; Zn deposition; Zinc; carrier protein; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; zinc; zinc ion; zinc transporter; zinc transporter 1; zinc transporter 2; zinc transporter 5; zinc transporter 9; Article; Caco-2 cell line; cell differentiation; controlled study; dental health; dental pulp stem cell; dentin; enamel; environmental exposure; gene expression; human; human cell; odontoblast; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tooth development; tooth pulp,2-s2.0-85063321197

Methods and materials: This cross-sectional study recruited 60 FDR of T2DM age of 19–39 years old in Jakarta, Indonesia. We matched 60 non-FDR as controls. All participants had neither glucose intolerance nor hypertension. Anthropometry, body composition and laboratory measurements (blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, liver and kidney function test) were assessed. Results: In males, FDR aged 30–39 years old had higher Total Cholesterol (TC) level ([233 ± 51.43 mg/dL vs. 177.83 ± 22.08 mg/dL, p = 0.036] and Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) level [173.83 ± 39.83 mg/dL vs. 125.67 ± 21.50 mg/dL, p = 0.026] than those of non-FDR significantly.

Decisions by developing countries to establish vaccine manufacturing should be based on economic viability, however reliable assessments of vaccine production costs are lacking. This study aimed to quantify the cost of establishing vaccine manufacturing facilities and producing vaccines in developing countries. This study estimates vaccine production costs in developing countries based on twelve vaccines produced by eight DCVMs. The results were based on estimates of the capital and operating costs required to establish vaccine manufacturing facilities under three hypothetical scenarios of production scale and scope. Cost patterns were then compared to vaccine prices paid by countries in both industrialized and developing country markets. The cost of producing vaccines in developing countries was estimated to be on average US$ 2.18 per dose, ranging between US$ 0.98 and US$ 4.85 for different vaccine types and formulations. Vaccine costs-per-dose decrease as production scale and scope increase. Cost-per-dose is mainly driven by fixed costs, but at a scale of production over 20 million doses per year it becomes driven by variable costs. Under the three hypothetical scenarios used, costs-per-dose of vaccines produced by developing countries were around 47% lower than vaccine prices in developing-country markets and 84% lower than prices in industrialized-country markets. This study has found that local production of vaccines in developing countries exhibits both economies of scale and economies of scope. The lower costs relative to prices suggests that a producer surplus and potential profits may be attainable in both developing and developed country markets, supporting sustainable production. ? 2018 World Health Organization",Cost analysis; Developing country; Vaccine; Vaccine production,vaccine; Article; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; developed country; developing country; drug cost; drug formulation; drug manufacture; drug marketing; health care disparity; human; priority journal; vaccine production,2-s2.0-85059800387

To achieve this target, it is essential to provide adequate social protection. As only a few studies in many countries have evaluated social-protection programs to determine whether the target is being reached, we assessed the effect of financial support on reducing the incidence of catastrophic costs due to TB in Indonesia. Methods: From July to September 2016, we interviewed adult patients receiving treatment for TB in 19 primary health centres in urban, sub-urban and rural area of Indonesia, and those receiving multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB treatment in an Indonesian national referral hospital. Based on the needs assessment, we developed eight scenarios for financial support. We assessed the effect of each simulated scenario by measuring reductions in the incidence of catastrophic costs. Results: We analysed data of 282 TB and 64 MDR-TB patients. The incidences of catastrophic costs in affected households were 36 and 83%, respectively. Patients' primary needs for social protection were financial support to cover costs related to income loss, transportation, and food supplements. The optimum scenario, in which financial support would be provided for these three items, would reduce the respective incidences of catastrophic costs in TB and MDR-TB-affected households to 11 and 23%. The patients experiencing catastrophic costs in this scenario would, however, have to pay high remaining costs (median of USD 910; [interquartile range (IQR) 662] in the TB group, and USD 2613; [IQR 3442] in the MDR-TB group). Conclusions: Indonesia's current level of social protection is not sufficient to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of TB. Financial support for income loss, transportation costs, and food-supplement costs will substantially reduce the incidence of catastrophic costs, but financial support alone will not be sufficient to achieve the target of 0% TB-affected households facing catastrophic costs. This would require innovative social-protection policies and higher levels of domestic and external funding. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cash transfer; Catastrophic cost; Financial support; Indonesia; Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; Social protection; Tuberculosis,"Article; attitude to health; catastrophic cost; cost; cost utility analysis; data analysis; dietary supplement; financial management; food supplement cost; health care facility; household; human; incidence; income loss; Indonesia; lowest income group; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; social status; transportation cost; adolescent; adult; aged; economic model; economics; family size; health care cost; middle aged; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; statistics and numerical data; tuberculosis; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Family Characteristics; Financial Support; Health Care Costs; Humans; Indonesia; Middle Aged; Models, Economic; Tuberculosis; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85060929329

There were significant differences in the mean systolic (R 2 = 0,049) and diastolic blood pressure (R 2 = 0,061) in workers in the form of sleep duration. Conclusion: The majority of worker’s blood pressure is categorized prehypertension based on blood pressure category by JNC-7. Results indicate that abnormal sleep duration, the frequency of protein consumption, physical activity that does not fit with the recommendation and lack of knowledge about hypertension contribute to higher of worker’s blood pressure. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Method. Data were derived from a cross-sectional study in Tuban, Kediri, and Lumajang District (East Java Province) and Lombok Barat, Lombok Timur, and Sumbawa District (West Nusa Tenggara Province). Information was obtained from 5,930 respondents using a structure questionnaire. We estimated adjusted odds ratios to evaluate for social determinant factors associated with LAPMs use using multivariate logistic regressions. Results. The prevalence of LAPMs use was 19%. The odds of LAPMs use among women who paid transport cost were higher than that among women who paid none. Similarly, LAPMs use were positively associated with LAPMs availability, encouragement to use LAPMs, perceived distance, knowledge about LAPMs, desire to have no more children, and contraceptive decisions jointly with husbands. Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate the relatively low level of LAPMs use among currently married Indonesian women, and highlight social determinants that influence women to choose LAPMs. Further studies are warranted to include health provider perspective as well as collecting qualitative data in order to adequately assess behaviors of women associated with LAPMs use. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Workers in the concrete industry can be negatively affected by exposure to particulate matter. Particulate matter that is 2.5 microns in width or less (PM 2.5 ) is one of the most dangerous air pollutants because it can be inhaled into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Objective. This research analyzed workers’ health risks due to inhalation exposure to PM 2.5 in at a concrete batching plant. Materials &amp; Method. The risk was calculated using an environmental health risk assessment method to determine the value of the risk quotient (RQ). The RQ was obtained by dividing the body exposure intake by the reference concentration. If the value of RQ&gt;1, then risk management is necessary. This study calculated the risk of PM 2.5 exposure for 59 workers. Samples were collected at 4 points in the plant for 1 hour using a high-volume air sampler; each point was sampled 2 times, once during the day and once at night. Results. The average concentration of PM 2.5 was 120 mg/m 3 that means the concentration was above the quality standard. The calculation shows that PM 2.5 is risky to workers in life time duration (25 years) with the average yield at least for the next 9 years because reach RQ=1,096. Thus, risk management is required for the next 25 years by reducing PM 2.5 concentration. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

This cross-sectional study aims to delineate the contributions of different aspects of impulsivity to risk behavior, among female inmates living in a prison in Jakarta (N = 214). The relationships between various aspects of impulsivity, risk behaviors and seropositivity were tested using analyses of variance and logistic regression analyses. Motor impulsivity was related to alcohol use, reward-related impulsivity to drug use, and cognitive/goal-directed impulsivity to sexual risk behavior. Finally, goal-directed impulsivity was also directly associated with seropositivity. Specific aspects of impulsivity are associated with different types of risk behavior in Indonesian female prisoners, which can be relevant for future studies on infection prevention strategies for such a population. ? 2019 Arends et al.

METHODS: A previously-tested questionnaire on 1000 adults in Jakarta was used in the present study. The data included sociodemographic factors and answers to assess the awareness of oral cancer, early signs and symptoms, risks factors, lifestyles, and history of dental visits. RESULTS: Only 53.2% of participants were aware of oral cancer. The level of awareness significantly differed by level of education, occupation, and experience of dental visits. Only 30% of patients had been asked about their tobacco and alcohol habits, and had been informed about the hazards of these by their dentists. All of the smokers knew that tobacco increased the risk for oral cancer. However, only a few participants considered alcohol, betel quid chewing, UV light exposure, poor diet, and genetics to play role in the development of oral cancer.

This paper describes the impact of a socio-economic development (SED) intervention that uses a twin-track approach (two micro-credit models) to reduce leprosy-related stigma in Cirebon District, Indonesia. A randomized-controlled mixed-methods study design was used to test the effectiveness of the SED intervention. Three scales were used to measure stigma and participation restrictions among 30 SED clients and 57 controls, 20 in-depth interviews with SED clients and seven Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with key persons were held and 65 profiles of the clients were written up and analysed. The qualitative data shows the socio-economic status of 44 out of 65 SED clients (67%) improved. The median family income increased by 25%, more clients reported higher self-esteem, better interaction with neighbours and less stigma than before, although disclosure concerns remained an issue. The scales indicate a positive effect of the intervention on reducing stigma (e.g., Stigma Assessment and Reduction of Impact (SARI) stigma scale mean difference total score of pre and post assessment for SED clients versus the control group was 8.5 versus 5.6). A twin track socio-economic intervention, if embedded and integrated, can increase participation, and be constructive in reducing leprosy-related stigma. ? 2019 by the authors.

Transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF ?1) is a cytokine which has been proposed to be involved in the fibrotic process in the CC. We aimed to evaluate the course of TGF ?1 in the systemic and cavernous blood of 17 healthy males through different phases of the sexual arousal response (exemplified by the penile conditions flaccidity, tumescence, rigidity and detumescence). An enzyme-linked immunoassay was used to measure the concentration of TGF ?1 (ng/ml) in both the systemic and cavernous blood at the stages of flaccidity, tumescence and detumescence. TGF levels were significantly higher in the cavernous compartment than in the systemic blood. A linear decrease was evident in the cavernous blood when the flaccid penis became tumescent (24.3?±?14.5 to 13.9?±?6.5) and rigid (to 8.7?±?3.1). At detumescence, TGF increased to 18.3?±?10.4. In contrast, the levels in the systemic circulation remained unchanged. The results are in support of the hypothesis that the concentration of TGF ?1 in the CC is regulated by adequate blood flow and oxygenation. ? 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",penile erection; sexual arousal; transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF ?1),transforming growth factor beta1; transforming growth factor beta1; adult; Article; blood; blood flow; corpus cavernosum; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; human experiment; male; normal human; oxygenation; penis; sexual arousal; sexual behavior; systemic circulation; erectile dysfunction; penis erection; physiology; reference value; vascularization; young adult; Adult; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Penile Erection; Penis; Reference Values; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85053796789

So, it requires a handling where the image of the retina can be categorized into appropriate categories. Based on the problem, two experimental mechanisms were conducted for each hierarchy, i.e approach computer vision that only focus to process the whole image and the approach taken by the medical using texture feature as marker feature to detect DR. The data are obtained from DiaretDB0 public database. In this research, we present Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to extract feature. To select the best feature from HOG, we used factor analysis as a feature selection method. This step was done to get good performance in classification step. In our experimental design, we implented shallow learning such as Support Vector Machines learning and Random Forest learning to classify moderate/sever NPDR vs. mild NPDR, mild NPDR vs. Normal, and moderate/severe NPDR vs. Normal.

In the previous works, we have been developing a microwave imaging system. To evaluate the imaging system, simple numerical and physical phantoms are used to represent normal and abnormal tissue structure. Two dipole antennas are used for transmitting and receiving microwaves signals at 3 GHz. The data acquisition system uses translational and rotational method. From the scattering S21 parameters, are then used as the acquired data to generate a reconstructed image. In this paper, we investigate the effect of antenna position when the transmitting antenna is fixed at certain position to acquire the data prior to image reconstruction process by using simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) algorithm.

Arthritis due to Mycobacteriurn tuberculosis usually presents as a chronic, slowly progressive, monoarticular infection that predominantly involves the weight-bearing joints and the spine. The hand and wrist are rare sites for tuberculosis (TB) and comprises of < 1% of all skeletal TB. Even though it is rare, TB of the wrist is a cause of great morbidity. We presented a case of wrist TB treated with debridement and synovectomy. Presentation of Case: A 35 years old woman came with the chief complaint of pain and swelling on the right wrist since 1 year ago and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis of the wrist. Patient then was given methylprednisolone 4 mg twice a day and methotrexate 175 mg once a week. However, the pain and swelling of her right wrist became worse. Subsequently patient was admitted to hospital and laboratory findings suggested a tuberculous arthritis of the wrist. Debridement, synovectomy, and biopsy, in addition to antituberculosis therapy, were then performed. Discussion: Tuberculous arthritis is generally a monoarticular disease that typically involves the spine or large and medium-sized joints. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and tuberculous arthritis may have similar clinical characteristics, which consists of a chronic course with periarticular soft-tissue swelling. Conclusion: Tuberculous arthritis and RA can have similar characteristic but laboratory examination can help in establishing diagnosis. ? 2019 The Authors",Debridement; Rheumatoid arthritis; Tuberculous arthritis; Wrist tuberculosis,C reactive protein; ethambutol plus isoniazid plus pyrazinamide plus rifampicin; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; rheumatoid factor; adult; antibiotic therapy; Article; bone biopsy; case report; clinical article; debridement; diagnostic error; disease duration; Doppler flowmetry; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; follow up; hospital admission; human; human tissue; intensive care; laboratory test; medical history; morbidity; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; range of motion; rheumatoid arthritis; synovectomy; synovial fluid; treatment duration; tuberculous arthritis; visual analog scale; weight bearing; wrist disease; X ray,2-s2.0-85072026671

Although areca nut is one of the plants with a risk of inducing that cancer, areca nut is believed to have high antioxidant properties. Due to the current interest in the apoptosis effects from areca nut for oral cancer treatment, we investigated its ability to induce apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in oral cancer cell lines: HSC-2 and HSC-3. Methods: We examined the effect of areca nut on apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells. Flow cytometry was conducted for the quantification of the cells that were apoptotic and expressing the caspase-3 enzyme for 24 and 48 hours. Results: Areca nut induced a significant increase (p<0.01) in late apoptosis of HSC-2 cells and mostly occurred over 48 hours. The study also found that in HSC-3, there were significant increases (p<0.01) the percentage of cells in early apoptosis after 24 hours and late apoptosis at 48 hours. Caspase-3 activity increased after 24 and 48 hours of areca nut exposure in both cells.

Material and methods. A narrative review approach conducted on all existing evidence in selected scientific bibliographic sources. The researchers defined the keywords based on the research question as a search strategy. Results. Scarce resources and limited access, alongside national policy on TB control and management, contribute in different ways to impede first-line TB treatment in Indonesia.

The role of the hospital and private practitioner networks in the treatment and management of TB patients is essential for developing active-case-finding-approach programs for TB suspects in primary care in an Indonesian setting. Contrarily, the potential misunderstandings in TB treatment have led to peculiar events affected by poor surveillance systems for TB investigation contacts to prevent TB incidences in large populations. Conclusions. This study addressed the barrier of all stakeholders, particularly primary care, to achieve the Indonesian government’s goals of TB elimination by 2030 and zero TB findings by 2050. ? 2019 by Wydawnictwo Continuo.",Developing countries; Drug resistance; Indonesia; Primary care; Tuberculosis,amikacin; ciprofloxacin; cycloserine; ethionamide; kanamycin; protionamide; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; quinolone; awareness; drug sensitivity; government; health care facility; health care personnel; health care policy; health service; incidence; Indonesia; medical record; middle income group; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; outcome assessment; patient; physician; primary medical care; quality control; Review; treatment failure; tuberculosis,2-s2.0-85070824533

This study aims to determine glucose and lipid profiles in adolescents with thalassemia major and its association with iron overload in pancreas and liver. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study. Subjects were thalassemia major adolescents without any confounding factors that may affect glucose and lipid levels. Blood samples were collected to measure the glucose level, lipid profiles, ferritin level and transferrin saturation. T2- Magnetic Resonance Imaging was used to evaluate the iron overload in organs. RESULTS: From a total of 60 subjects, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 1 subject and impaired fasting glucose was diagnosed in 3 subjects. All subjects had high triglycerides/ high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, 59 subjects (98%) had low HDL-C, 18 subjects (30%) had hypertriglyceridemia, and none had abnormal high level of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). The majority of subjects had ferritin ?2,500 ng/mL (70%), mild pancreatic iron overload (56.6%), and moderate hepatic iron overload (43.8%). Degree of hyperferritinemia was not associated with glucose and lipid profiles. Blood glucose profiles were not associated with various degree of pancreatic iron overload. Similar result was also observed between lipid profiles and hepatic iron overload. CONCLUSION: Abnormal glucose and lipid profiles in thalassemia major can be found in adolescence. Normal blood glucose level isn't necessarily associated with normal pancreatic iron deposition. Hepatic iron overload may worsen dyslipidemia in thalassemia major patients. ? 2019 Prodia Education and Research Institute.",Glucose profile; Hepatic iron overload; Lipid profile; Pancreatic iron overload; Thalassemia major,,2-s2.0-85070774807

Foot ulcers are influenced by many factors. DM puts patients at risk of injury because of visual impairment. Hyperglycemia can damage blood vessels, which results in peripheral artery disease (PAD). The purpose of this study was to find the relationship of visual impairment and PAD with diabetic foot ulcers. This research used observational analytic study with case-control methods. It used purposive sampling in 34 DM patients with foot ulcers and 34 DM patients without foot ulcers. The research instruments were an interview guide to assess visual impairment, physical examination to assess PAD, and documentation study, which was used to know the incidence of diabetic ulcers. The results showed that the respondents who experienced ulcers with visual impairment were 44.1% and the respondents who had foot ulcers with PAD were 73.5%. The results of statistical tests showed that there was no relationship between visual impairment and the incidence of ulcers (P = 0.166). The respondents with PAD will have a chance to suffer from foot ulcers 5.808 times higher than those who do not have PAD. There is no relationship between visual impairment and the incidence of diabetic foot ulcers in Dr. Moewardi Hospital, but there is relationship between PAD and the incidence of diabetic foot ulcers in Dr. Moewardi Hospital.

We, therefore, aimed to study the health dimensions that affect the quality of life in Indonesian patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. This cross-sectional study was conducted at three hospitals in Jakarta and Bandung in 2015. In total, 100 patients (50 hemodialysis and 50 peritoneal dialysis) were selected and matched by age, sex, years on dialysis, and diabetes status. Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Indonesian version of the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, with statistical analysis based on the EQ-5D descriptive system and visual analog scale (EQ-VAS). The analysis based on EQ-5D-3L questionnaire shows that only anxiety/depression dimension which significantly distinguishing the quality of life between the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients (p < 0.05). For all the dimensions, although the statistical analyses showed no significance differences between the groups based on age and sex, they did show that numerically more patients who underwent peritoneal dialysis felt that they had better health outcomes. Peritoneal dialysis was also associated with greater improvement from dialysis-related complications if patients were younger than 50 years, improved mobility among males, and improved usual activity among females. Anxiety and depression most affected the quality of life of patients, irrespective of whether they received hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, indicating that strategies are needed to manage these dimensions better. Moreover, this supports our hypothesis that understanding a patient's values and preferences when choosing dialysis could substantially improve outcomes from end-stage renal disease. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",Dialysis; EQ-5D; EQ-VAS; Quality of life,,2-s2.0-85069544249

This study analyzed the effect of CIT against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity using oxidative stress biomarkers. Administration of DOX (intraperitoneal injection) was performed to induce cardiotoxicity in 20 Wistar rats, divided into 4 groups. Two doses (300 and 600 mg/kg of body weight) of CIT were administered via gavage prior to, during, and after DOX injection.

The concentration of MDA was also increased in the low-dose (P=0.103), and high-dose groups (P < 0.001). The observed elevations were dose-dependent. Administration of CIT did not exert a beneficial effect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The increased level of MDA in CIT group indicates increased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), secreted by L cells of the intestine, acts as a signal for energy balance. GLP-1 is a satiation signal that can promote satiety and reduce food intake. Its secretion is thought to be impaired in obese individuals, causing reduced satiety and hyperphagia. This study was conducted as a clinical trial to determine the effect of breakfast with a balanced macronutrient composition (68.2% carbohydrates, 22.6% lipids, and 12.4% protein) on GLP-1 levels in 22 obese versus 21 non-obese subjects. Blood glucose levels were also evaluated Subjects were provided breakfast, followed by measurement of blood glucose and GLP-1 levels at 0, 15, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after intervention. We found that there are no significant differences between blood glucose levels in obese versus non-obese subjects before or after having breakfast with a balanced macronutrient composition (p > 0.05). There was a significant difference between GLP-1 levels in obese and non-obese subjects at 15 and 60 minutes following intervention (p = 0.042 and p = 0.037, respectively). This finding suggests that there is impairment in postprandial GLP-1 secretion in obese subjects. ? 2019 Journal of International Dental and Medical Research.",Blood Glucose; GLP-1; Obese,,2-s2.0-85069436178

Various treatments have improved in the recent decades, which allow for better control of brain metastatic lesions. Various prognostic scoring tools have been developed and used worldwide to stratify patients with brain metastases to determine who will benefit most from aggressive treatment. The three most commonly used prognostic scoring tools are recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), basic score for brain metastases (BSBM) and graded prognostic assessment (GPA). The aim of this study is to validate these scoring tools using an Indonesian cancer patient population.Method:A retrospective analysis of all patients presenting with brain metastases from January 2012 until December 2014, through using hospital medical records, was conducted. All patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy during this period were included in this study. A follow-up with a telephone call was carried out to determine the patient's health and survival status. Uncontactable patients were excluded from the analysis. Survival analysis was carried out by stratifying patients based on the three prognostic scoring systems.Result:A total of 80 patients were eligible to be included in the study, with 18 excluded due to being uncontactable. The remaining 62 patients' data were analysed and stratified with all three scoring systems. The RPA was found to confer better stratification than BSBM and GPA in our study population.Conclusion:GPA was non-prognostic in our study population and BSBM was less prognostic, especially in the middle group, class 1 and class 2. Those BSBM class 1 and class 2 did not provide good prognostic stratification in our study population, whereas RPA was proven to be the best in stratifying patients' prognosis with brain metastases in our study population. ?

Methods: A prevalence-based cost-of-illness model was constructed from previous population-based DR study. Projection for 2025 was derived from estimated diabetes population in 2025. Direct treatment costs of DR were estimated from the perspective of healthcare. Patient perspective costs were obtained from thorough interview including only transportation cost and lost of working days related to treatment. We developed four cost-of-illness models according to DR severity level, DR without necessary treatment, needing laser treatment, laser +intravitreal (IVT) injection and laser + IVT +vitrectomy. All costs were estimated in 2017 US$. Results: The healthcare costs of DR in Indonesia were estimated to be $2.4 billion in 2017 and $8.9 billion in 2025. The total cost in 2017 consisted of the cost for no DR and mild-moderate non-proliferative DR (NPDR) requiring eye screening ($25.9 million), severe NPDR or proliferative DR (PDR) requiring laser treatment ($0.25 billion), severe NPDR or PDR requiring both laser and IVT injection ($1.75 billion) and advance level of PDR requiring vitrectomy ($0.44 billion). Conclusions: The estimated healthcare cost of DR in Indonesia in 2017 was considerably high, nearly 2% of the 2017 national state budget, and projected to increase significantly to more than threefold in 2025. The highest cost may incur for DR requiring both laser and IVT injection. Therefore, public health intervention to delay or prevent severe DR may substantially reduce the healthcare cost of DR in Indonesia. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

In order to salvage the limb, resection followed with total humeral replacement is preferred. In situations where those prostheses are not available, a technique of modified total humeral replacement could be used. Case presentation: A 20-year-old female patient came with osteosarcoma of the right humerus accompanied by pathological humeral shaft fracture, with the onset of six months. The lesion extended along the proximal to distal part of humerus. The patient underwent a neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery and a limb salvage surgery by wide excision of the humerus and reconstruction using modified total humeral replacement was performed. Modifications to the shoulder hemiarthoplasty and total elbow prostheses were made, so both prostheses could join as one unit. Discussion: After the surgery, no disturbances of hand function were seen, and functional outcome was evaluated by using Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score (MSTS)score with score of 83% (excellent). After 3 years of follow up, patient could work and resume daily activity with improved MSTS score. There were neither sign of tumor recurrence nor distant metastasis on follow up.

There are varus, procurvatum, and internal tibia rotational deformity. Treatment varies for each patient, depending on age, magnitude of deformity, discrepancy, psychosocial factor, and surgeon's experience. The aim of treatment is to acutely correct deformity and realign the mechanical axis. We proposed a technique of step cut “V” Osteotomy which could achieve the aim of treatment safely and effectively. Methods: Twenty-seven legs from eighteen patients were underwent Step Cut “V” Osteotomy technique in our institution from 2015 to 2017 to produce overvalgus correction. Eleven patients had bilateral deformities, and seven patients had unilateral deformity. All patients had mechanical axis deviation (MAD) away medially to the center of the knee, increase of tibiofemoral angle, and Drennan angle. Outcomes were recorded postoperatively such as infection, compartment syndrome, nerve palsy, range of motion, stability of knee ligaments, union time, early weight bearing and recurrence. Results: From this Step Cut “V” Osteotomy, we can accurately measure the angle of correction we want to achieve preoperatively. Drennan angle and Tibiofemoral angle (TFA) of the patients improved with subsequent correction of interbal tibia rotation and procurvatum. No complication of compartment syndrome and nerve palsy were found. Patient could perform early mobilization, and weight bearing on second month after surgery because of strong fixation and good ligament stability. No significant postoperative infection occurred. Union time achieved in two to three months, but four legs from patients over 4 years old who underwent surgery experienced a recurrence. Conclusion: Step Cut “V” Osteotomy is a simple, safe and effective technique for acute correction of severe Blount's disease. And can produce an accurate correction, high union rate and early weight bearing with no complication as a result that would be achieved at the end of treatment. ? 2019 The Authors",Acute correction; Blount's disease; Outcomes; Step cut “V” osteotomy,adolescent; Article; Blount disease; body mass; child; clinical article; compartment syndrome; cross-sectional study; deformity; disease classification; female; follow up; human; Indonesia; intraoperative period; knee; knee ligament; male; mechanics; mobilization; nerve paralysis; obesity; osteosynthesis; osteotomy; patella; patient compliance; postoperative infection; priority journal; range of motion; recurrence risk; surgical technique; tibia osteotomy; tibia torsion; valgus deformity; weight bearing,2-s2.0-85064413243

A pre-post study was carried out in Perobatang village on July 2016. Children aged 1-15 years old were enrolled in the study and asked to collect stool samples which were then examined using Kato-Katz method. The children infected with STH were given albendazole 400 mg for three consecutive days. From 246 subjects examined, 192 (78%) were positive for any STH consisting of T. trichiura (64%), A. lumbricoides (60%), and hookworms (10%). After treatment, the prevalence of STH decreased significantly (McNemar test, p<0.001) to 27%, T. trichiura 25%, A. lumbricoides 2%, and hookworm 0%. Cure rate for T. trichiura, A. lumbricoides, and hookworms was 61%, 97%, and 100%, respectively. Significant decrease of eggs per gram of feces was found in all STH (Wilcoxon test, p value <0.001 for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, p value = 0.027 for hookworms); egg reduction rate for T. trichiura was 91%, A. lumbricoides was 100%, and hookworms was 100%.

The liquid chromatography system is using rapid separation on Acquity UPLC?BEH C18 with gradient mobile phase contained formic acid and acetonitrile. Prior to detection, curcumin and internal standard (IS) were ionized using electrospray ionization positive source and the ions were monitored at m/z 369 → 177 and 260 → 183 for curcumin and IS, respectively. The calibration curve was linear (r ? 0.99) over the concentration range of 1-50 ng/ml and 1-30 ng/ml for rat plasma and for ovary homogenate, respectively. The lower limit of quantification was 1 ng/ml. The mean accuracy ranged from 98.9% to 103.2% and 98% to 108.9%, while the coefficient of variation (CV) values of precision in rat plasma were below 11.92% and 10.47% for within and between run, respectively. In rat ovary homogenate, the mean concentration and CV of within run accuracy and precision were 95.53%-109.78% and 3.34%-9.14%, respectively. The developed method was used to quantify curcumin in rat plasma and ovary after an oral gavage. In conclusion, the developed and validated method should be useful for quantification of curcumin accurately and precisely in plasma and target organs from relevant animal models of human diseases. ? 2019 W.

As soon as the capacity of iron-regulating proteins (e.g., ferritin, transferrin) are used up, free plasma iron increases generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress. Hence, blood transfusions should be accompanied by iron-chelating therapy, e.g., deferiprone (DFP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of mangiferin (M) and an aqueous leaf extract of Mangifera foetida L (EMF) as alternative iron-chelating antioxidants in an animal model. Methods: Thirty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 equal groups: normal control, iron overload (IO), IO+DFP, IO+M, and IO+EMF. Iron overload was induced by intraperitoneal iron dextran injection with a total dose of 90 mg/mouse (15 mg Fe/mouse every 3-4 days for 3 weeks) followed by oral administration of DFP 462.5 mg/kg, mangiferin 75 mg/kg, or EMF 2.930 g/kg for 7 days. Results: Body weight (BW) increased in all groups during the 4 weeks of experiment, except for the IO group. As expected, DFP decreased significantly the total plasma iron and increased iron excretion via urine in iron-overloaded rats (positive control), mangiferin and EMF had similar - although slightly smaller - effects than DFP. The antioxidant activity of M and EMF were stronger compared to DFP as determined by plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Conclusion: Mangiferin and EMF have iron-chelating and antioxidant effects and might be used for the treatment of iron overload in the body. ? 2019 Nickan Research Institute.

Early treatment is the key to successful management of PSS with secondary glaucoma. However, unremitting exposure of high intraocular pressure (IOP) because of the high recurrence rate of PSS may cause further optic nerve damage and visual field defect. It is assumed that trabeculectomy may become the surgical treatment of choice in order to prevent further damage to the optic nerve despite recurring attack of PSS. Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and releasable suture was performed in 5 patients (3 females and 2 males) with recurring attacks of PSS and secondary glaucoma after acute attack had subsided. Before surgery, these patients had already suffered more than 3 acute attacks which were alleviated with antiglaucoma and anti-inflammatory medications; however, optic nerve damage and visual field defect had already developed. After trabeculectomy, 4 patients experienced no recurrent attacks during the follow-up period. One patient only suffered another episode of acute attack; however, an abrupt increase in IOP of more than 22 mmHg did not occur. In all cases, blebs were well formed, and no further optic nerve damage or visual field defects were observed up until final follow-up. In PSS with secondary glaucoma, medication may alleviate the IOP increase and inflammation; however, there is still a chance of damage occurring to the optic nerve each time an attack recurs. Trabeculectomy may be considered a safe and effective surgical treatment modality in PSS with secondary glaucoma in order to prevent further optic nerve damage due to the extreme IOP spike in each recurrent attack.",Mitomycin C; Posner-Schlossman syndrome; releasable suture; secondary glaucoma; trabeculectomy,alkylating agent; eye drops; mitomycin; adult; case report; female; glaucoma; human; intraocular pressure; male; middle aged; optic nerve disease; pathophysiology; postoperative complication; procedures; sclera; suture technique; trabeculectomy; treatment outcome; Adult; Alkylating Agents; Female; Glaucoma; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Mitomycin; Ophthalmic Solutions; Optic Nerve Diseases; Postoperative Complications; Sclera; Suture Techniques; Trabeculectomy; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85060233642

Even in endemic country, this atypical presentation may be the cause of delayed diagnosis and treatment. Presentation of case: A 51-year-old woman was admitted with painless massive lump on both of her thighs that have been enlarging for the past 6 months. She had a history of previous tuberculosis treatment. From the MRI examination submuscular gluteal abscess, which was an extension of the sacral tuberculosis, were found. Open debridement and biopsy were performed, which confirmed the suspicion of tuberculosis. Oral anti tuberculosis drugs were administered after. There was no recurrence and complication at the final follow up. Discussion: Cold abscess formation is common in spine tuberculosis however the formation of gluteal abscess as the extension of sacral tuberculosis is rare. Although MRI's specificity in determining the underlying cause is poor, it has a great role not only determining the location and size of the lesion, but also to describe anatomical pathophysiology of the abscess dissemination from sacral tuberculosis. Conclusion: Despite the limitation of the study and the rarity of this case, tuberculosis should be made as the main differential diagnosis for atypical sacral lesion that occurs with submuscular gluteal abscess. ? 2018",Gluteal abscess; Sacral tuberculosis; Spinal tuberculosis,tuberculostatic agent; abscess; adult; Article; bone biopsy; case report; clinical article; debridement; delayed diagnosis; differential diagnosis; epithelioid cell; female; follow up; histiocyte; histopathology; human; human tissue; Langhans giant cell; lymphocyte; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; sacral tuberculosis; sacral tuberculosis; submuscular gluteal abcess; tuberculosis,2-s2.0-85057565761

In Indonesia, it covers 37% or about 1.8 millions mortality cases. Hence, human vital sign monitoring such as electrocardiograph (ECG) monitoring system is very essential for mitigating and preventing people hearth's fail to be handled a proper assistance from healthcare physicians. For that purpose, we propose a real time ECG monitoring system, which the ECG data is monitored wirelessly directly without any server for data pooling (centralized database). ECG QRS wave and arrhythmia detection are important features for ECG monitoring system. Up to now, there are several studies ECG wave detection, however, they are mainly focus on internet of things - based telemedicine system for data transfer. In this case, real time monitoring system could be disrupted by a pooling time and packet loss due to its IP-based connection. Hence, we propose a wireless ECG patient monitoring system based on point to point communication scheme at 2.4 GHz band by using 3-lead acquisition system on single channel wireless ECG device. The system is developed based on AD8232 chip for acquisition, NRF24101 wireless link platform for data transfer and Arduino?microcontroller for ECG data processing. In order to evaluate the performance of wireless ECG system, our developed wearable textile antennas (as Tx and Rx antenna) are attached on the human body and experimentally evaluated within indoor environment, simulating off-/on-body communication system. The wearable textile antenna is lightweight, small and insensitive to the resonant frequency due to the human body effect. The measurement is conducted by embedding the antennas at some body positions of the volunteers. The experimental results show that the proposed ECG monitoring system is able to transfer and display real time ECG signals well for off-/on-body communication schemes. In addition, to validate the results, the obtained ECG data are compared and analyzed with the healthcare clinic equipment. According to QRS wave analysis, the ECG signals have reasonable RR, PR, QRS and ST wave interval in comparison with the standard ECG signals. We convince that our developed ECG patient monitoring system is stable by applying our developed textile antennas and it is promising to be adopted in the hospital for future implementation. ? 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE).",,Data handling; Data transfer; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Health care; Natural frequencies; Patient monitoring; Textiles; Wearable antennas; Wearable computers; Centralized data-base; Chronic obstructive lung disease; Human vital sign monitoring; Lower respiratory infections; Patient monitoring systems; Point-to-point communication; Real time monitoring system; World Health Organization; Data communication systems,2-s2.0-85060918784

The role of clinical instructors is to instil in students the importance of patient safety. Therefore, it is important to have competent clinical instructors. Their experience can be enhanced through the application of quality circles. This study identifies the effect of quality circles on improving the safety of patients of nursing students. Patient safety is inseparable from the quality of nursing education. Existing research shows that patient safety should be emphasised at all levels of the healthcare education system. In hospitals, the ratio between nursing students and clinical instructors is disproportionately low. In Indonesia, incident data relating to patient safety involving students is not well documented, and the incidents often occur in the absence of a clinical instructor. Methods: This study used a quasi-experimental research design with pre-test and post-test non-equivalent control groups. The aim of the project was to explore the implications of the quality circle on clinical instructors by comparing the students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices of control and intervention groups. A questionnaire will be conducted to evaluate the implementation of patient safety and the impact of the intervention. The data were statistically analysed using independent t tests. The intervention was the implementation of quality circles that focused on patient safety issues for the use of clinical instructors to assess and guide student nurse behaviour in regard to patient safety. The authors of this study trained the clinical instructors on how to use quality circle methods to solve nursing problems especially with relevance to the patient safety issues of students. Results: The results showed a significant increase in the behaviour of nursing students towards patient safety issues (p < 0.001; α = 0.05). Conclusions: The implementation of quality circles has a significant effect on patient safety. Therefore, it is recommended to implement quality circles as a problem-solving technique to optimize patient safety. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Clinical instructors; Nursing student; Patient safety; Quality circles,adult; article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; controlled study; drug safety; human; Indonesia; nursing education; nursing student; patient safety; pretest posttest design; problem solving; questionnaire,2-s2.0-85058815241

Post-term pregnancy is a pregnancy that has lasted 42 weeks (294 days) or more, in the regular menstrual cycle an average of 28 days and the first day of the last menstruation is known with certainty. According to World Health Organization in 2010, every year around the world 358,000 mothers die during pregnancy or during labor where 355,000 (99%) coming from developing countries. Statistical data showed that the mortality rate in post-term pregnancies was higher than in term pregnancies, where the post-term pregnancy mortality reaches 5-7%. In Indonesia there are 3.5 until 14% births with post-term pregnancies from the total first pregnancy. In this case, there is an increase in mortality in advanced pregnancy. Methods. This study used a descriptive cross-sectional design that provided an overview of the characteristics of 163 patients with post-term pregnancies at Klungkung General Hospital, Bali-Indonesia in the period from 1st January till 31st December 2017. The patients were divided into 58 primigravida and 105 multigravida. Results Most age groups who experienced post-term pregnancies in the multigravida group tend to have older age. Based on the vaginal delivery method, primigravida groups tend to require more induction. Based on the mode of delivery through caesarian section, the primigravida group tends to be more due to fetal distress.

The widespread and long-term use of anthelmintics can cause resistance. The research on animals shows that factor that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) codon 200 β-tubulin gene of the worms is one of the factors that can cause the decreased efficacy of anthelmintics. This study aimed to determine the bases of codon 200 in A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, which infect the people in Nangapanda, East Nusa Tenggara. Methods: The worm samples were obtained from the intestinal helminth-infected patients from Nangapanda Sub-district. The DNA from the worm tissues were isolated, amplificated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequenced. The sequencing results were aligned to the reference sequence to obtain the codon bases in the 200 β-tubulin gene. Results: TTC constitute the codon bases in the 200 β-tubulin gene found in two A. lumbricoides and one T. trichiura.

Mycobacterium leprae resistance, especially to rifampicin, is a serious problem as it potentially thwarts the worldwide leprosy-elimination program by the World Health Organization (WHO). One of the suspected causes of rifampicin resistance is poor treatment compliance. It was necessary to assess the association between the treatment compliance and the occurrence of mutation rifampicin resistance in multibacillary (MB) leprosy patients. Methods: A comparative, analytical, cross-sectional study was performed in MB leprosy patients who had completed treatment at the Dermatovenereology Outpatient Clinic in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and the Sitanala Center for Leprosy Hospital from October 2012 to April 2013. Based on treatment regularity and history of drug discontinuation, the subjects were classified as either having good or poor compliance. Skin smear from a slit skin smear (SSS) examination was further analyzed by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing technique to detect rifampicin resistance. Results: Fifty-seven study subjects were enrolled in this study. In the good treatment compliance group (29 subjects), only 1 case of mutation for rifampicin resistance was found. Meanwhile, in the poor drug compliance group (28 subjects), 8 cases of mutation for resistance (29%) were found. This difference in mutation rate was statistically significant (OR=11.2; 95% CI=1.296–96.787; p=0.012). Conclusion: This study revealed that the risk of occurrence of M. leprae resistance to rifampicin in patients with poor drug compliance was significantly higher than in those with good drug compliance. ? 2019, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia.

The utilization of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with many possible mechanisms to cause POCD. However, there is no evidence confirming that CPB alone is the cause of POCD. Objectives: The current study aimed at evaluating several factors suspected to cause POCD following cardiac surgery in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Methods: The current prospective cohort study was conducted on 54 patients who were candidates for cardiac surgery. The assessment of memory, attention, and executive functions was performed by neuropsychological tests, before and after the surgery. Cognitive decline was defined as a 20% decrease in cognitive function in at least one of the tests. Inclusion criteria were adults spokeing Bahasa Indonesia fluently, literate, and giving consent to participate in the study. The analyzed risk factors included age, diabetes, educational level, duration of aortic cross clamp, and duration of cardio-pulmonary bypass. Results: POCD occured in 40.7% of subjects that underwent cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Age was the only influential factor through bivariate test and logistic regression analysis (P = 0.001). The current study conducted a logistic regression test on age variable; the obtained result indicated an increasing trend of POCD in accordance with age group. Conclusions: Durations of CPB, cross clamp, diabetes, and educational level were not the main risks of POCD. Old age was a significant predictor to POCD. ? 2018, Author(s).",Cardiopulmonary bypass; Cognitive function; Open heart surgery; Pocd,,2-s2.0-85059274182

Methods: The questionnaire, based on physicians, contains 9 questions focused on UC management and cancer surveillance. In addition, the questionnaire based on neoplastic cases, which contains 17 questions, was collected and analyzed. Results: With regard to the diagnosis of UC-associated cancer, most respondents started surveillance colonoscopy within 10 years from onset, favored targeted biopsies, and thought advanced imaging was useful. As for morphology, the frequency of elevated lesion and type 4 lesions was most common in early and advanced cancer, respectively. Peritoneal metastasis was frequently observed, and undifferentiated tumor was frequently developed. Laparoscopic surgery was widely used because it is less invasive. The prognostic outcome was poor, particularly in stage III and undifferentiated type.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a post hoc analysis of a randomized trial evaluating the use of 500 μg intra-arterial nitroglycerin just before sheath removal in 1706 patients undergoing transradial catheterization. Patients who received 200 μg or 300 μg nitroglycerin after sheath placement (group A; n ? 688) were compared with patients who received 5 mg verapamil after sheath placement (group B; n ? 1018). The primary endpoint was RAO diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound examination at 1 calendar day after the procedure. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of RAO. RAO occurred in 16.0% of group A and 5.4% of group B. After adjustment for potential confounders, neither the use of verapamil nor nitroglycerin was associated with RAO (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-3.02; P?.62). Radial artery compression >4 hours was the strongest predictor of RAO (OR, 5.41; 95% CI, 2.31-12.65; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the use of verapamil or nitroglycerin as a spasmolytic regimen was not associated with RAO. Given the strong association between duration of radial compression and RAO, further studies are needed to determine the interaction between vasodilator agents and compression protocols on RAO. ? 2018 HMP Communications.",Radial artery occlusion; Spasmolytic regimen; Transradial catheterization,glyceryl trinitrate; verapamil; adult; artery compression; artery occlusion; Article; catheterization; disease association; Doppler flowmetry; female; human; incidence; injection; interpersonal communication; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; radial artery occlusion; sheath removal; therapy effect; transradial catheterization,2-s2.0-85057763209

Unfortunately, most classification processes still require accuracy enhancement, especially to complete the classification in seven classes and to get a qualified classification process. In addition, attempts to improve the single image classification of Pap smears were performed to be able to distinguish normal and abnormal cells. This study proposes a better approach by providing different handling of the initial data preparation process in the form of the distribution for training data and testing data so that it resulted in a new model of Hierarchial Decision Approach (HDA) which has the higher learning rate and momentum values in the proposed new model. This study evaluated 20 different features in hierarchical decision approach model based on Neural Network (NN) and genetic algorithm method for single image classification of Pap smear which resulted in classification experiment using value learning rate of 0.3 and momentum of 0.2 and value of learning rate of 0.5 and momentum of 0.5 by generating classification of 7 classes (Normal Intermediate, Normal Colummar, Mild (Light) Dyplasia, Moderate Dyplasia, Servere Dyplasia and Carcinoma In Situ) better. The accuracy value enhancemenet were also influenced by the application of Genetic Algorithm to feature selection. Thus, from the results of model testing, it can be concluded that the Hierarchical Decision Approach (HDA) method for Pap Smear image classification can be used as a reference for initial screening process to analyze Pap Smear image classification.

We sought to define and categorize the scope, methods, and practices that fall under the description of forensic medicine, the various issues encountered in current forensic medical practice, and the potential role of evidence-based practice in forensic medicine. We searched electronic databases and reviewed relevant articles, as well as conducting personal correspondences with forensic medical practitioners around the world, to obtain a description of current forensic medical practice.

Data on SOV + RBV were collected from 2015 to 2016, while those on SOF + DCV were collected from 2016 to 2017. The baseline characteristics were recorded from the medical record unit in Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. The primary outcome was the achievement of sustained virological response at 12?weeks (SVR12). Results: Of 309 patients, 64.4% (199/309) had genotype 1 infections, 29.8% (92/309) had cirrhosis, and 4.9% (15/309) had co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). At the end of treatment (EOT), 99.3% (136/137) patients in the SOF + RBV group and 99.4% (164/165) in SOF + DCV group had no detectable viral load. The criterion for SVR12 was met in 90.8% (109/120) patients in SOF + RBV regimen and 98.2% (108/110) in SOF + DCV regimen. Among patients with cirrhosis, 84.4% (38/45) patients and 100% (27/27) achieved SVR12 in the SOF + RBV and SOF + DCV groups, respectively. Conclusion: SOF + DCV regimen had higher SVR rates compared to SOF + RBV regimen (p = 0.034). However, both the regimens showed an impressive outcome, with overall SVR12 rates above 90%, irrespective of presence of cirrhosis and HCV genotype. In non-structural protein 5A inhibitor limited setting, SOF + RBV regimen still can be used as treatment for HCV infection, particularly in non-cirrhotic patients.

Although the virus has been known for more than 40 years, no approved drug or treatment can efficaciously cure this disease. Thus, Ebola remains as one of the most challenging health problems worldwide. The most lethal EVD is caused by Ebola virus (EBOV), which classifies into Filoviridae family. EBOV genes encode seven polyproteins, one of them is VP40, the most abundant protein in the viral layer. VP40 is essential for the viral assembly and budding process of EBOV. Hence, makes it viable as the drug target for treating this malignant disease. In this research, a total of 3,429 Indonesian natural product compounds, gathered from various sources, underwent a series of virtual screening and docking simulations to predict their binding affinity against EBOV VP40.

An effective treatment for DENV infection is indispensable to reduce the mortality rate. Targeting DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) methyltransferase (MTase) could be a potential treatment. The inhibition of NS5-MTase could reduce DENV infection rate. In this research, we used flavonoid compounds from ChEBI Database due to its biological activity as antiviral. The molecular docking simulations of flavonoid database toward NS5-MTase were performed using MOE 2014.09. The docking site of NS5-MTase is determined based on guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding site.

The optimal control problem was constructed to handle a limited intervention budget, to reduce the number of infected humans and mosquitos. The Pontryagin Minimum Principle was used to formulate the optimal control problem, which was solved numerically with the forward-backward iterative method. The numerical simulation was performed with two scenarios, i.e., for different numbers of initially infected compartments (low and high) and for different numbers of initial basic reproduction (less than and greater than one). We find that fumigation intervention could be used to reduce the spread of dengue as long as the resistance of the mosquitos to the fumigant is low. We also found that fumigation intervention is much better in a prevention scenario since the cost function is much smaller than in a countermeasure scenario. Simulating the second scenario, we found that reducing the spread of dengue in a high risk area (basic reproduction number greater than one) is more costly than in a low risk area (basic reproduction number less than one). ? 2018 Author(s).",Basic reproduction number; dengue; fumigation intervention; optimal control; resistant,,2-s2.0-85056159295

There is a controversy regarding method better associates with and predicts sepsis and septic shock patients' mortality. This study address the association of achieving one or two targets of microcirculatory resuscitation endpoints and early mortality in sepsis and septic shock. METHODS: a cohort study was conducted in adult sepsis and septic shock patients in Intensive Care Unit, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Indonesia. Patients' resuscitation endpoints data and outcome were observed during the first 120 hours of hospitalization. Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis was used to analyse the early mortality risk in subject groups achieving lactate clearance target only, ScvO2 target only, both targets, and not achieving any target in 6 hours after onset of resuscitation adjusted for number of organ dysfunction. RESULTS: subjects consisted of 268 patients. There were significant differences in the mortality risk between subjects who achieved both targets with subjects who achieved ScvO2 target only (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 13.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.17-35.08) and subjects who not achieve any target (aHR 16.12; 95%CI 7.43-34.95). There were insignificant difference the early mortality risk between subjects who achieved both targets with subjects achieved lactate clearance target only (aHR 2.29; 95%CI 0.83-6.32). CONCLUSION: in patients with sepsis and septic shock, achievement of lactate clearance and ScvO2 targets associates with similar early mortality risk compared to achievement of lactate clearance target only. However, it associates with lower early mortality risk compared with ScvO2 target only.",central venous oxygen saturation; early mortality; lactate clearance; sepsis; septic shock,"lactic acid; oxygen; adult; aged; blood; central venous pressure; comparative study; epidemiology; female; fluid therapy; human; Indonesia; intensive care unit; male; microcirculation; middle aged; mortality; physiology; prospective study; risk assessment; sepsis; septic shock; survival analysis; young adult; Adult; Aged; Central Venous Pressure; Female; Fluid Therapy; Humans; Indonesia; Intensive Care Units; Lactic Acid; Male; Microcirculation; Middle Aged; Oxygen; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Sepsis; Shock, Septic; Survival Analysis; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85059828542

Moreover, in single nodule with size of less than 2 cm, RFA can be the primary treatment. Although resection is the main treatment and one of the curative treatments in nodule meeting Milan criteria, it needs consideritation of the surgery risk stratification. This report was aimed to search evidence of RFA compared with RFA in term of survival in patient with HCC single nodule size of more than 5 cm. METHODS: the searching was done using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, dan CINAHL from EBSCO with keyword of ""hepatocellular carcinoma"", ""single nodule"", ""radiofrequency ablation"", ""resection"", and ""survival"". The limitation of the article was English with clinical question of ""In patient with HCC single nodule size of more than 5cm, was RFA more superior in resection in term of survival?"". RESULTS: there were three articles with retrospective study. One of the article combined RFA and percutaneous ethanol injection in the analysis, meanwhile another article combined RFA and transarterial chemoembolization. These articles showed conflicting data that showed absolute risk reduction of 33% till absolute risk increment of 60.6%. CONCLUSION: all studies used RFA as the alternative of resection when the the tumor was irresectable which means the severity is higher in RFA group. Hence, we can not solely conclude that RFA resulted in worse survival.",hepatocellular carcinoma; radiofrequency ablation; resection,"case report; chemoembolization; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; middle aged; mortality; radiofrequency ablation; surgery; treatment outcome; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chemoembolization, Therapeutic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Radiofrequency Ablation; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85059828066

Here, we investigated whether peripheral blood expression of type 1 interferon (IFN)-inducible genes may be of use to stratify QFT-positive patients with uveitis into groups of high versus low risk of having active TB-associated uveitis. We recruited all new uveitis patients in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia for one year. We included 12 patients with uveitis and clinically diagnosed active pulmonary TB, 58 QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause, 10 newly diagnosed sputum-positive active pulmonary TB patients without uveitis and 23 QFT-negative healthy controls. Expression of 35 type 1 IFN-inducible genes was measured in peripheral blood cells from active pulmonary TB patients without uveitis and healthy controls. Differentially expressed genes were identified and used for further clustering analyses of the uveitis groups. A type-1 IFN gene signature score was calculated and the optimal cut-off value for this score to differentiate active pulmonary TB from healthy controls was determined and applied to QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause. Ten type 1 IFN-inducible genes were differentially expressed between active pulmonary TB and healthy controls. Expression of these 10 genes in QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause revealed three groups: 1); patients resembling active pulmonary TB, 2); patients resembling healthy controls, and 3); patients displaying an in-between gene expression pattern. A type 1 IFN gene signature score 5.61 displayed high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (91%) for identification of active TB. Application of this score to QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause yielded two groups with expected different likelihood (high vs. low) of having active-TB uveitis, and therefore may be useful in clinical management decisions. ? 2018 La Distia Nora et al.

In various studies, meridians are alternatively called as Bong-Han ducts, primo vessels, or hyaluronic-acid rich ducts, while acupoints are called Bong-Han corpuscles, primo nodes, or hyaluronic-acid rich nodes. Meridians and acupuncture points form a system that is now called primo vascular system (PVS), which is claimed to contain various kinds of stem cells. The stem cell size is between 1-5 microns. The smallest is the primo microcells that have a putative role in regeneration. Other stem cells are adult pluripotent and hematopoietic stem cells that play a role in extra bone marrow hematopoiesis. The presence of PVS has been reproduced by many studies.

Prediabetic patients are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes within a decade unless they adopt a healthier lifestyle that includes weight loss and increased physical activity. Alternative therapies, such as laserpuncture, are being continuously refined and may be applicable to prediabetes treatment. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of laserpuncture on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and oral glucose tolerance (OGT) levels in prediabetic patients. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 26 patients allocated into a laserpuncture or a sham laserpuncture group. Laserpuncture therapy was administered two times weekly at the MA-IC 3 Endocrine ear acupoint for 6 weeks. FPG and OGT levels were used to measure the primary outcome. At 6 weeks, mean change in FPG was significantly different between the groups (laserpuncture group, 10±7.810 mg/dl and sham laserpuncture group, -4.08±10.943 mg/dl). Mean change in OGT was -3.38±30.065 and -6.23 9.774 mg/dl in the laserpuncture and sham laserpuncture groups, respectively (p<0.05).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects, singly and in combination, of two components with proven larvicidal activity, namely, the Ag-TiO2 nanocomposite and Carica papaya seed extract, on the mortality of A. aegypti larvae. This experimental study was categorized into the control and three intervention groups: 1) papaya seed extract at concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 ppm; 2) Ag-TiO2 at concentrations of 0, 5,10,15, 20, and 25 ppm; and 3) mixture of Ag-TiO2 and C. papaya seed extract 50% and 90% lethal concentration. After 24 h exposure, the 50% lethal concentration and the 90% lethal concentration were determined for the Ag-TiO2 nanocomposite (5.19 ppm and 10.87 ppm, respectively) and the C. papaya seed extract (25.98 ppm and 44.30 ppm, respectively). Significant differences were detected among Ag-TiO2 concentrations and mixture-group concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). Significant positive correlations were detected between larval mortality and Ag-TiO2 concentrations and mixture group concentrations (r = 0.812, p = 0.001 and r = 0.343, p &lt; 0.001, respectively).

This study aimed to determine the diagnostic values of a simple ultrasound examination for the detection of ovarian malignancy and compare them with the postoperative histopathological findings of the tumor. This cross-sectional study conducted at the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital evaluated gynecologic outpatients with ovarian tumors who had undergone surgery during the period of March 2015 to July 2015. Samples were obtained by consecutive sampling. Analysis was performed using the chi-squared test and logistic regression to ascertain the relationship between the ultrasound morphologic patterns and the histopathologic findings. Furthermore, a model derived from the logistic regression was used to calculate the probability of developing ovarian malignancy. Among the 80 subjects with ovarian cancer, 72.5% presented with benign tumors and 27.5% with malignant tumors. Using a cutoff of ?2 morphologic patterns in the ultrasound examination, 53.8% subjects presented with malignancy, and the diagnostic values of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 82.8%, 68.8%, and 100%, respectively. The probability of a subject having an ovarian malignancy if ?3 morphologic patterns were present was above 88.9%.

Here, we examined the effect of silymarin addition on the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were exposed to doxorubicin for 14 days. Subsequently, the cells were treated with different concentrations of silymarin (10, 25, 50, or 100 μM) with or without doxorubicin. On days 3 and 7 following the treatment, cells were analyzed for viability and BCRP mRNA expression. MCF-7 cells exposed to doxorubicin for 14 days showed reduced sensitivity to doxorubicin, as indicated by the 9.5-fold shift in cytotoxicity concentration and the 9.7-fold increase in BCRP mRNA expression. Treatment with the combination of different concentrations of silymarin and doxorubicin significantly decreased the percent cell viability and reduced BCRP mRNA expression on days 3 and 7.

GDF-9 mRNA expression was investigated by real-time PCR. The numbers of retrieved oocytes, mature oocytes, and the oocyte morphology score were lower in patients with endometriosis than in controls; the difference was statistically significant. GDF-9 mRNA expression levels were quantitatively lower in the endometriosis groups than in the control group (5.05 [0.00002-3523.0] ng/mL vs. 81.93 [1.47-32450] ng/μL; p = 0.01). However, no correlation was obtained between GDF-9 expression levels and oocyte quality (oocyte morphology score and fertilization rate). The GDF9 mRNA level was lower in the endometriosis group than in the control group. However, no direct relationship was noted between individual GDF-9 level and oocyte quality.

Accordingly, flight safety is threatened by the incidence of dyslipidemia, as a main risk factor for atherosclerosis and heart attack. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with dyslipidemia in a consecutive sample of civilian pilots who attended periodic medical check-ups at Balai Kesehatan Penerbangan, Indonesia. Blood lipid profile data were obtained through questionnaire, and variables such as the total flight hours, food intake, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit, and physical activity were included in the analysis. Among the 128 respondents who met the inclusion criteria, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was 61.7% and the low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol index was high, at 57%. Obesity and inappropriate food intake were the dominant risk factors associated with dyslipidemia in this study; namely, civilian pilots with inappropriate food intake had a 2 times risk of dyslipidemia relative to those with an appropriate food intake [odds ratio (OR) = 2.01; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91-4.43; p = 0.08, while obese pilots had a 4 times risk of dyslipidemia relative to those with a normal BMI (OR = 3.47; 95% CI: 1.29-10.84; p = 0.002.

Thus, HIF-1α becomes potential target of therapeutic approach in developing HIF-1α inhibitors. The aim of this research is to investigate potential inhibitors which are known as Acetogenins (AGEs) isolated from Annona muricata against HIF-1α. In order to achieve this goal, chemical structures of all compounds were retrieved from PubChem database. Molecular docking was performed by AutoDock Vina program and the resulting binding modes were analyzed with AutoDock Tools program. Among all the compounds, murihexocin A showed the best binding modes compared to other two inhibitors based on the lowest binding energies (LBE = -7.9 kcal/mol) as high as gefitinib. This was indicating that murihexocin A has favorable interaction with the essential amino acid residues at catalytic site of HIF-1α. Drug-likeness calculation of AGEs were also performed.

In the clinical setting, patients who presented with respiratory difficulties such as superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS), radiotherapy should be given immediately to address the emergency while waiting for the results of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation test. However, there has been no study that described the role of radio-therapy in Indonesian patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: This preliminary study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicities of gefitinib and radiotherapy combination in lung adenocarcinoma patients in Persahabatan National Respiratory Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Subjects were consecutively recruited between January 2013 and December 2016. RESULTS: Thirty-one lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations were enrolled. Most of them were male (51.61%) with a median age of 54.5 years old (range 38-70 years old). EGFR mutation characteristics were on exon 21 L858R point mutation (61.30%), exon 21 L861Q point mutation (16.12%) and exon 19 deletion (22.58%). Radiotherapy was given at doses between 30-60 Gy. Among these subjects, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 185 days (95%CI; 123.69 - 246.30), 1-year survival rate (1-yr) was 45.2%, and median overall survival (OS) was 300 days (95%CI; 130.94 - 469.06). There were no grade 3/4 hematological and nonhematological toxicities recorded. The most frequent grade 1 and 2 non-hematological toxicities were skin rash, diarrhea, and paronychia that might be related to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

Glycocalyx degradation, marked by increased serum syndecan-1 levels, alters vascular permeability, which can manifest as albuminuria in the glomerulus. Therefore, elevated urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) potentially provides an index of systemic glycocalyx degradation. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between urinary ACR and serum syndecan-1 levels. Methods: A longitudinal prospective study with repeated cross-sectional design was conducted on children with sepsis in pediatric intensive care unit, we evaluated serum syndecan-1 levels and urinary ACR on days 1, 2, 3, and 7. A descriptive study on healthy children was also conducted to determine the reference value of syndecan-1 in children. Results: 49 subjects with sepsis were recruited. Based on the data of the healthy children group (n=30), syndecan-1 level of >90th percentile (41.42 ng/mL) was defined as systemic glycocalyx degradation. The correlation coefficients (r) between urinary ACR and syndecan-1 levels were 0.32 (p<0.001) from all examination days (162 specimens), 0.298 (p=0.038) on day 1, and 0.469 (p=0.002) on day 3. The area under the curve of urinary ACR and systemic glycocalyx degradation was 65.7% (95% CI 54.5%– 77%; p=0.012). Urinary ACR ?157.5 mg/g was determined as the cut-off point for glycocalyx degradation, with a sensitivity of 77.4% and a specificity of 48%. Conclusion: Urinary ACR showed a weak correlation with systemic glycocalyx degradation, indicating that the pathophysiology of elevated urinary ACR in sepsis is not merely related to glycocalyx degradation. ? 2018 Authors.",Glycocalyx degradation; Sepsis; Syndecan-1; Urinary albumin: creatinine ratio,albumin; syndecan 1; albuminuria; area under the curve; Article; artificial ventilation; blood vessel permeability; capillary permeability; clinical article; clinical examination; clinical outcome; cross-sectional study; depression; disease severity; glomerulus; glycocalyx; heart rate; human; leukocyte; longitudinal study; neuromuscular disease; neutrophil; normal human; pathophysiology; pneumonia; prospective study; sepsis; tachycardia; thorax radiography; thrombocyte; urinalysis,2-s2.0-85055195379

This study aimed to introduce a new technique of modified exorotation graft tension at tibial fixation to minimize endorotation, reduce tibial internal rotation, and prevent patellofemoral pain syndrome. Methods: This study was a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial. ACL rupture patients underwent ACLR surgery between December 2014 and Februrary 2015. They were randomized to standard endorotation group or modified exorotation group. Hamstring autograft was used and fixed with an EndoButton? and bioabsorbable interference screw. Tibial tubercle to trochlear grove (TTTG) was used to evaluate rotation, whereas cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) was employed to analyze cartilage breakdown. The functional outcome was measured using the Kujala score to assess patellofemoral joint function. Evaluations were conducted before the surgery and at 6 months postoperation. Results: A total of 29 subjects were recruited. Sixteen subjects were allocated into the standard endorotation group, and 13 were assigned to the modified exorotation group. The exorotation group demonstrated better results than the endorotation group in all three parameters: TTTG (p=0.028), COMP (p<0.001), and Kujala score (p=0.015). Conclusion: A new technique of modified exorotation direction of graft tension for ACL reconstructive surgery at tibial fixation showed a significant reduction in tibial internal rotation and cartilage breakdown.

The objective of this study was to assess the use of drug treatment for dengue in several hospitals and primary health center (PHC) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A retrospective study was conducted on 239 dengue patients in selected hospitals or PHC between April 1st, 2014 and March 31st, 2015. Patients who were clinically diagnosed/laboratory confirmed as dengue with evidence of fever for more than 1 day (plus one of the World Health Organization dengue symptoms) were included. Information on patients’ characteristics was gathered from medical records, while drug use data were collected from the prescriptions records. These data were analyzed descriptively. An average of 4.16±2.16 drugs was prescribed per prescription in the hospital, and 2.48±1.21 drugs were prescribed per prescription in PHC. There were 71.6% drugs prescribed in the hospital and 92.7% drugs prescribed in PHC included in the National Formulary. Generics were prescribed in 39.4% and 95.4% drugs in the hospital and PHC, respectively. The most commonly prescribed drugs were analgesics (26.3%), vitamins (14.2%), drugs for acid-related disorders (11.7%), and systemic antibacterials (10.2%). Systemic corticosteroids were prescribed in 6.0% patients. In conclusion, the treatment of dengue patients who visited the hospitals and PHC in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, was rational in some aspects. However, antibiotics and corticosteroids were still used, and positive changes and improvements are needed to increase the rational drug use in dengue patients. ? 2018, Pharmainfo Publications.

In this study, a species-specific primer was designed to identify V. infantium on the basis of the sequence of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (dnaK) gene of Veillonella infantium JCM 31738T (= TSD-88T). The primer pair generated a specific PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) product specific for V. infantium, but not for other oral Veillonella species. This specific primer pair could detect dnaK even from 1 pg of genomic DNA extracted from the V. infantium type strain. To validate the primer pair, a number of strains of Veillonella species were isolated from tongue biofilm of 3 Japanese children, DNA was isolated from each strain, and PCR was performed using species-specific primers. All oral Veillonella species except V. infantium were identified by one-step PCR method reported previously. Four kinds of Veillonella species were detected in these subjects. V. rogosae was detected in all subjects and the most predominant species with an average prevalence of 82%. However, V. infantium was detected in 2 of 3 subjects and it was the second most predominant species of oral Veillonella detected in these subjects with an average prevalence of 9.4%. V. infantium appears to coexist with other oral Veillonella species in tongue biofilm. This species-specific primer pair established in this study could be useful to detect V. infantium and support the study of Veillonella for oral health in the future. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",dnaK gene; Japanese children; Species-specific primer; Tongue biofilm; Veillonella; Veillonella infantium,"genomic DNA; bacterial protein; heat shock protein 70; primer DNA; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium detection; bacterium identification; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; biofilm; child; DNA extraction; DNA isolation; dnaK gene; female; gene sequence; human; Japanese (people); male; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; validation process; Veillonella; Veillonella infantium; Veillonella rogosae; classification; genetics; Gram negative infection; isolation and purification; microbiology; phylogeny; preschool child; species difference; Bacterial Proteins; Child; Child, Preschool; DNA Primers; Female; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Male; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Species Specificity; Veillonella",2-s2.0-85049322164

These signs of plasma leakage, in the early phase, are usually difficult to ascertain by physical examination and laboratory tests where the patient is only reflecting a mild degree of plasma leakage. This study aimed to investigate whether gallbladder wall thickening (GBWT) in the early phase of the disease can be used to detect the occurrence of plasma leakage in dengue patients. METHODS: a diagnostic study was conducted among dengue patients. Patients with fever less than 3 days, positive results of non-structural protein 1 antigen dengue and RT-PCR examination were included consecutively. Laboratory tests and chest and abdominal ultrasonography examination were also performed daily from day-3 to day-7 of fever to confirm the occurrence of plasma leakage using WHO 1997 criteria during treatment. RESULTS: there were 69 patients included in this study. Male patients were found more frequently (52.2%), average age was 24.2 years, and 46 patients (66.7%) presented with secondary dengue infection. On the third day of fever, 37 patients presented with GBWT, 30 of which showed plasma leakage during treatment. Out of 46 patients found to have plasma leakage during treatment, 12 patients had presented with plasma leakage on the third day of fever. Sensitivity and specificity of GBWT on the third day of fever were 65% (95% CI: 0,51-0,79) and 70% (95% CI: 0.51-0.88); PPV and NPV were 81% (95% CI: 0.68-0.94) and 50% (95% CI: 0.33-0.67); LR (+) and LR (-) were 2.14 (95% CI: 1.12-4.12) and 0.5 (95% CI: 0.31-0.81), respectively.

As many as 400 million people are infected yearly. Even though the vaccine is available, the use of dengue vaccine is still limited due to some concerns. Among patient infected with dengue viral infection, early recognition of the virus and prompt supportive treatment are important to avoid complication and mortality.The clinical spectrum of dengue viral infection is diverse ranging from undifferentiated fever to dengue shock syndrome characterized by plasma leak and hemoconcentration. No specific antiviral therapy is available. Therefore, anticipation of complication should be performed adequately.The most dangerous complication of dengue infection is shock syndrome. Hypothetically the occurrence of shock is a result of secondary viral infection. The manifestation of increased vascular permeability and low intravascular volume lead to the development of shock. In addition to that, another complex mechanism underlies the occurrence of shock such as endothelial dysfunction that could happened abruptly. No specific method exists to identify this condition as early as possible.During dengue infection, fever can be last between 2 and 7 days. The localized plasma leakage could happen and manifested as a pleural effusion fluid accumulation in abdominal cavity or hemoconcentration. This will only last for 48 hours and will be resolved later spontaneously. Severity of leakage varies among patients and the unanticipated of leakage due to failure to recognize and treat this manifestation related to mortality.Most of the fatal cases of dengue are related to late detection of the illness as shown by massive hemorrhage and severe intravascular volume depletion. The role of dendritic cells is as the initiator of immune response that facilitate virus uptake. On the other hand, the non-neutralize cross reactive antibodies will increase virus uptake and resulted in more viral replication. Some studies showed higher NS1 protein were found in patients with more severe disease. In addition to that antibody to NS1 could bind to the endothelial cells and lead to apoptosis of these cells. Both host and viral factors contribute to the severity of the illness.One of the important factors for dengue viral infection is the capacity of clinicians to identify the risk factors for shock. Studies reported that female, infants, elderly, patients with concomitant diseases are prone to have more severe infection. Virus serotype and genetic susceptibility may also contribute but the evidence is still limited. So, those are not sensitive enough be used in clinical setting.Besides those, after the diagnosis of with dengue infection based on WHO criteria and confirmation by serology detection or viral material in the blood, no specific sign and symptoms are available to determine any potential severity. There were studies performed to monitor the plasma leakage using mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) instead of hematocrit values. Rapid intervention can be administered by monitoring MAP to avoid deleterious consequences.The classification of WHO 1997 or 2009 were not able to detect the plasma leakage earlier.

Plasma half-life is an important parameter to calculate its dose. This study was conducted to evaluate the biological half-life of DLBS1033 by measuring serial plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP) complex. PAP complex is a stable and inactive compound as a result of fibrinolysis process. METHODS: this was an open-label clinical trial in healthy adult subjects. Subjects were divided into two groups to receive single dose drugs (received 3 x 490 mg) or repeated administration until steady state conditions (3 x 490 mg/day for 3 days). Blood samples for PAP complex measurement were collected at time 0 (before drug administration for single dose group), then at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after drug administration. Safety parameters used in this study were creatinine, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), SGOT, and SGPT. RESULTS: the biological half-life of DLBS1033 was calculated based on the mean of PAP complex concentration on each time sampling. In single dose group, the highest mean of PAP complex concentration was reached before drug administration. Our result showed that the activity of DLBS1033 could not be determined after single dose administration. In steady state condition, the PAP complex concentration increase in 2 hours after last drug administration. The biological half-life of DLBS1033 was 8.6 hours. There were no significant safety findings on all laboratory parameters and no serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: it is concluded that the fibrinolytic effects of DLBS1033 can be measured in steady state condition. The biological half-life of DLBS1033 in steady state condition was 8.6 hours. There were no serious adverse events on two groups of subjects.",biological half-life; DLBS1033; fibrinolytic; Lumbricus rubellus; plasmin-antiplasmin complex,"alpha 2 antiplasmin; DLBS 1033; fibrinolytic agent; plasmin; plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex; tissue extract; adult; animal; area under the curve; chemistry; controlled study; half life time; human; Indonesia; male; normal human; Oligochaeta; oral drug administration; randomized controlled trial; young adult; Administration, Oral; Adult; alpha-2-Antiplasmin; Animals; Area Under Curve; Fibrinolysin; Fibrinolytic Agents; Half-Life; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Oligochaeta; Tissue Extracts; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85055071809

Lung as a microvascular-contained organ may be affected by the T2DM microvascular complication that results in lung diffusion capacity disorder. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved adult T2DM patients, without overt lung disorder, terminal kidney failure, or cardiovascular disorder, and who were on an outpatient basis. Patients who were recruited through consecutive sampling underwent interview session, physical examination, laboratory test, spirometry, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) test. Results: Decreasing DLCO value has a significant relation to the high level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (P < 0.05). Patients with HbA1c >6.5 have 21 times risk to have decreasing DLCO value compared to patients with HbA1c <6.5 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Uncontrolled glycemic status significantly contributed in the decreasing lung diffusion capacity among patients with T2DM.

This is usually done by scanning using Computed Tomography (CT) scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, those modalities are costly, bulky and not portable. Microwave Imaging is one of the emerging modalities that may overcome the aforementioned problems. Up till now, we have been developing microwave imaging, but still with large measurement data. Basically, in imaging system, good reconstruction result usually requires large measurement data. In order to reduce the measurement data, in this research, we investigate Compressive Sensing (CS) approach to be applied in microwave imaging application. CS allows reconstruction of signal with fewer measurement than required in Shannon-Nyquist theorem. This study provides simulation using transmission method on acquisition data which is based on first generation of CT. To meet the concept of CS, Discrete Radon Transform (DRT) is used as projection matrices on data acquisition scheme. This scheme is varied to 18 angles, 36 angles, and 51 angles to test the performance of CS in reconstructing the signal with few number of measurements. Dictionary matrix that is used as a sparse basis is Discrete Cosine Transform, and algorithm that is used to reconstruct the sparse signal is Basis Pursuit. Simulation results show that reference image can be well reconstructedusing CS approach by applying only few measurement data. Reconstructed image using CS is also compared withthe Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) and the Filtered Back Projection (FBP) algorithms to show the relevance and advantage of using CS approach in microwave imaging applications. ? 2018 IEEE.",compressive sensing; discrete radon transform; image reconstruction; microwave imaging,Compressed sensing; Data acquisition; Discrete cosine transforms; Image reconstruction; Imaging systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Matrix algebra; Microwaves; Algebraic reconstruction techniques; Compressive sensing; Computed tomography scan; Discrete radon transform; Filtered back projection; Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); Microwave imaging; Transmission methods; Computerized tomography,2-s2.0-85049340495

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional, online questionnaire survey was administered to 3,925 urban respondents in Indonesia, Melbourne, Shanghai, Singapore and Vietnam. Cross-tabulation, confirmatory factor analyses and multiple regression analyses were employed. Findings: Most respondents supported government communications to promote healthy eating and to a lesser extent, regulatory measures to control unhealthy food marketing. Personal values and country of residence were more strongly associated with the respondents’ views than demographic variables. Overall, strongest support for nutrition promotion and for stricter regulation of food marketing was seen in Shanghai, Indonesia and Vietnam. Broadly, two groups were identified across the region: those who held equality-nature or tradition-security-conformity personal values, who disapproved of food marketing but supported government health promotion campaigns, and, those with stronger hedonist values who held opposite views. Research limitations/implications: First, a wider range of personal values could be included in future studies to better represent Asian values. Second, changes in population views could be assessed in future longitudinal studies. Finally, future studies should include dietary assessments and the views of people from a variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Practical implications: These findings suggest that health policy makers and communicators need to frame their communications to match the world views of household food providers in their countries. Originality/value: The study provides confirmation of attitude-values theories within five different countries in the Asia Pacific region and demonstrates the importance of personal values and country of residence in influencing food providers’ views. ? 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Asia Pacific; Attitudes; Food marketing; Household food providers; Promotion; Regulation; Survey; Values,adult; article; eating; factor analysis; female; government; health care policy; health promotion; household; human; human experiment; Indonesia; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; marketing; multiple regression; nutritional assessment; personal value; questionnaire; Singapore; Viet Nam,2-s2.0-85048098014

Most patients receive follow-up and rehabilitation after hospitalization, but some cannot attend due to cost and transportation difficulties since they are scattered in various areas across the island. Nursing teleconsultation is the provision of nursing services that can be administered to patients electronically in remote areas. In practice, nursing teleconsultation must be supported by qualified nursing knowledge, supportive communication technologies, and strategies to protect patient confidentiality, system and information security. Innovations in nursing teleconsultation can potentially be applied in West Java to provide continuous nursing service to TBI patients without being constrained by the problems associated with distance and cost. ? 2018 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).",,,2-s2.0-85056672217

The fundamental differences between these procedures are the size of the incision, the discectomy procedure and the volume of disc taken. However, until now, there has not been any class 1 evidences explaining the efficacy of these procedures, and there is only a few studies about its safety and factors influencing its efficacy in treating HNP, especially in Indonesia. This study is aimed to assess clinical outcomes and safety of MED in HNP patients who underwent this procedure. Patient with HNP who underwent MED were followed prospectively in a period of January 2015 until December 2016. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by using Visual Analog Score (VAS) for assessing back pain and leg, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The mean of pre-treatment score was compared with the mean of post-surgical treatment score by using paired t-test. Subjects were 78 HNP patients treated surgically. The average surgery duration (± SD) was 60 ± 17.1 minutes. The pretreatment score mean on VAS and ODI were 4.88 ± 1.10 and 35.21 ± 8.24. After surgical treatment, the VAS and ODI score obtained were significantly reduced to 1.53 ± 1.14 and 5.16 ± 5.52, respectively (p<0,001). A type of complication was observed, which was 5 (6.4%) cases of dural tear; no deficit in ankle dorsiflexion nor foot paresis were found. MED has been shown to be able to treat HNP with clinical outcomes similar to conventional open discectomy but with better levels of safety and effectiveness. However, this procedure still requires high quality randomized controlled trials studying about its efficacy and cost effectiveness in HNP treatment.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease that escalates mortality rate, but not all DM develop into chronic kidney disease. Aims: To estimate the prevalence of kidney dysfunction (KD) in DM and the associated dominant risk factors among productive age Indonesian based on the National Health Survey (Riskesdas) 2013. Methods: The statistical data consisted of 15,791 females and 10,349 males, aged 20 to 54, who lived in rural and urban areas. The data was obtained from National Institute of Health Research and Development (NIHRD), Ministry of Health. Data were collected from 33 provinces using cross sectional method. The variables data analyzed were sociodemographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, blood pressure, blood lipid, blood glucose, and creatinine. Kidney dysfunction was defined according to Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the dominant associated risk factors. Results: The prevalence of KD in DM was 4% (CI 95% 3.1–5.1) and only 0.6% had been diagnosed. Many associated risk factors could affect DM leading to KD such as age, sex, rural, economic status, sugary food/drinks, salty food, coffee, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL, high LDL, and hypertriglyceridemia. The dominant associated risk factors were age, sex, economic status, sugary food/drinks, and low HDL. Conclusion: The prevalence of KD in DM among productive age Indonesian was 4% and only 0.6% had been diagnosed. Early detection of identification of KD in DM is needed in order to slow progression and complications. The dominant associated risk factors of KD in DM were age, sex, economic status, sugary food/drinks, and low HDL. Controlling of risk factors in DM should be done in order to prevent diabetic kidney disease. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Diabetes mellitus; Kidney dysfunction; Prevalence; Risk factors,high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; agricultural worker; Article; coffee; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; educational status; employment status; female; fisherman; groups by age; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; hypertriglyceridemia; Indonesian; kidney dysfunction; major clinical study; male; middle aged; obesity; physical activity; prevalence; risk factor; sex difference; smoking; social status; sugar-sweetened beverage; urban rural difference,2-s2.0-85049495801

Different mutation patterns were attributed to different hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotypes in each population study. HBV surface proteins are reported to induce the activation of NF-κB, a transcriptional factor known to play an important role in the development of liver disease. This study aimed to see the effects of HBs variants in HBV subgenotype B3 on the expression and activation of NF-κB as one of the mechanisms in inducing advanced liver disease. HBV subgenotypes B3, each carrying wild-type (wt) HBs, M120 V, and pre-S2 deletion mutation were isolated from three HCC patients. HBs genes were amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1 and were transfected using Lipofectamine into a Huh7 cell line. NF-κB activation was measured through IκB-α expression, which is regulated by NF-κB. RNA expressions for HBs, IκB-α, and NF-κB subunit (p50) were evaluated using real-time PCR. M120 V mutant had a significantly higher mRNA level compared with wt and pre-S2 deletion mutant; however, there were no significant differences in HBs protein expressions. The transcription level of p50 was higher in M120 V mutation compared with HBs wild-type and pre-S2 deletion mutant. NF-κB activation was higher in HBs wild-type compared with the two mutant variants. Pre-S2 mutations had no effect on the increment of NF-κB activation. However, M120 V mutation may utilize a different pathway in liver disease progression that involves high expression of NF-κB subunit, p50. ? 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",HBV; hepatocellular carcinoma; NF-κB activation; pre-S2 mutation,"glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lipofectamine; membrane protein; messenger RNA; plasmid DNA; plasmid dna 3.1; unclassified drug; hepatitis B surface antigen; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; presurface protein 2, hepatitis B surface antigen; protein precursor; Article; cancer patient; clone; comparative study; cross-sectional study; deletion mutant; gene amplification; genetic transfection; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus subgenotype B3; Huh-7 cell line; human; human cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; pre S2 start codon mutation; protein expression level; real time polymerase chain reaction; start codon; cell line; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; Hepatitis B virus; Indonesia; liver cell; metabolism; mutation; pathology; virology; virus cell transformation; Cell Line; Cell Transformation, Viral; Codon, Initiator; Cross-Sectional Studies; Genotype; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatocytes; Humans; Indonesia; Mutation; NF-kappa B; Protein Precursors",2-s2.0-85048331606

The suppression effect was observed histopathologically by counting the mitotic cells and hyperplasia cells of the crypt of small intestine with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Results: Mitosis cells mean of NC group was not significant difference either with MD 12.5 (p=0.394) or MD 6.5 (p=0.310). However, mitosis cell mean appears to be lower in the NPMD 12.5 (p=0.09) and NPMD 6.25 (p=0.05) groups than the NC group. There was a significant difference among the mean of hyperplasia NC group and MD and also NPMD group. Significant difference also can be showed between MD 12.5 and MD 25 (p=0.026), and between NPMD 6.25 and NPMD 12.5 (p=0.002), and between MD 12.5 and NPMD 12.5 (p=0.002). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate suppression of hyperplasia small intestine by either nanoparticle or extract of Phaleria macrocarpa extracts. The suppression of mitosis was showed by administration of nanoparticle. ? 2018 The Authors.",Chemoprevention; Hyperplasia; Kaempferol; Mitosis; Phaleria macrocarpa; Quercetin; Small intestine,antineoplastic agent; chitosan nanoparticle; dextran sulfate; drinking water; kaempferol; Phaleria macrocarpa extract; plant extract; quercetin; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer prevention; cell cycle G2 phase; cell hyperplasia; colon carcinogenesis; controlled study; dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis; histopathology; hyperplasia; male; mitosis; Moraceae; mouse; nonhuman; Phaleria macrocarpa; plant leaf; small intestine; small intestine cancer,2-s2.0-85048223721

Chromosome 9pter aberrations, such as ring chromosome have been reported to cause 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD), due to involvement of DMRT1 gene located at the 9p24.3 region. Case presentation: This study presents a unique case of a 12-year-old female with mos 46,XY, (r)9[31]/45,XY,-9[9] karyotype, presenting with intellectual disability and short stature, mimicking Turner syndrome. Re-karyotyping was performed using standard GTL-banding technique. Further cytogenetic study using standard metaphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique was applied to cultured lymphocytes from peripheral blood, hybridized using green control probe specific to 9q21 loci, and red DMRT1 probe specific to 9p24.3 loci. Cytogenetics and FISH analysis revealed mos 45,XY,-9[8]/46,XY,r(9)[29]/47,XY,+idic r(9)× 2[1]/46,XY,idic r(9)[1]/46,XY[1] and haploinsufficiency of DMRT1 gene in most cells. CGH array revealed a deletion around 1.25 Mb at 9p24.3 loci [arr 9p24.3(204,193-1,457,665)× 1] and three duplications around 13 Mb [9p24.3p22.3(1,477,660-14,506,754)× 3] near the breakage point that formed the ring chromosome 9. Conclusions: The clinical presentation of the subject that mimics Turner syndrome highlights the importance of cytogenetic analysis to detect the possibility of ring chromosome 9. Sex reversal due to haploinsufficiency of DMRT1 gene in ring chromosome 9 structures is exceedingly rare with only a handful of cases ever reported. This finding further highlights the importance of DMRT1 gene in sex determination and differentiation in males. More research is required to pinpoint the exact mechanism that underlies sex reversal caused by DMRT1 haploinsufficiency. ? 2018 The Author(s).","46,XY-DSD; DMRT1; Ring-chromosome-9; Sex-reversal; Short-stature",BRM protein; interleukin 33; Janus kinase 2; academic underachievement; AK3 gene; Article; case report; child; chromosome analysis; clinical article; comparative genomic hybridization; disorder of sex development; DMAC1 gene; DMRT1 gene; DMRT2 gene; DMRT3 gene; DOCK8 gene; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; fluorescence microscopy; gene; gene deletion; gene duplication; gene loss; GTL banding; haploinsufficiency; human; IL33 gene; intellectual impairment; JAK2 gene; KANK1 gene; karyotyping; KDM4C gene; obesity; physical examination; priority journal; PUM3 gene; RCL1 gene; RFX3 gene; school child; short stature; SMARCA2 gene; socialization; SPATA6L gene; VLDR gene,2-s2.0-85046625670

However, the antigen types which stimulate the human immune response are variable, as a result, neither effective vaccines nor antiviral treatments have been successfully developed for this disease. The NS2B/NS3 protease of the dengue virus (DENV) responsible for viral replication is a potential drug target. The ligand-enzyme binding site determination is a key role in the success of virtual screening of new inhibitors. The NS2B/NS3 protease of DENV (PDB ID: 2FOM) has two pockets consisting of 37 (Pocket 1) and 27 (Pocket 2) amino acid residues in each pocket. In this research, we characterized the amino acid residues for binding sites in NS3/NS2B based on the hydrophobicity, the percentage of charged residues, volume, depth, ΔGbinding, hydrogen bonding and bond length. The hydrophobic percentages of both pockets are high, 59 % (Pocket 1) and 41% (Pocket 2) and the percentage of charged residues in Pocket 1 and 2 are 22% and 48%, and the pocket volume is less than 700 ? 3. An interaction analysis using molecular docking showed that interaction between the ligand complex and protein in Pocket 1 is more negative than Pocket 2. As a result, Pocket 1 is the better potential target for a ligand to inhibit the action of NS2B/NS3 DENV. ? 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Previous studies revealed that breast cancer chemotherapy led to BCSC enrichment which contributed to therapy resistance. Our recent in vivo study using Next Generation Sequencing has demonstrated that PCNA - the proliferative gene - and BIRC5 - the antiapoptosis gene - were under-expressed in human breast tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This study aimed to verify the role of PCNA and BIRC5 expression in doxorubicin-treated human BCSCs in vitro and its association with cell viability. Method: Human BCSCs (ALDH+) were treated with 0.25 uM of doxorubicin for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 days respectively. Cell viability was measured using trypan blue exclusion assay and the expressions of PCNA and BIRC4 mRNA were determined using qRT-PCR. Results: This study demonstrated that the viability of ALDH+ BCSCs decreased after 2 days and increased again after 8 days of doxorubicin treatment, indicating the decrease of doxorubicin sensitivity. Interestingly, PCNA and BIRC5 genes were modulated in line with the modulation of cell viability during doxorubicin treatment of human BCSCs. Conclusion: In conclusion, we suggest that the PCNA and BIRC5 expressions play an important role on the BCSCs viability which associated with the sensitivity of doxorubicin treatment. ? 2018 Hiroshima University Medical Press.",BIRC5; Cell viability; Doxorubicin; Human breast cancer stem cells; PCNA,cycline; doxorubicin; messenger RNA; RNA 18S; survivin; Article; BIRC5 gene; breast cancer; cancer stem cell; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; gene; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation,2-s2.0-85057802942

Tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α) polymorphism play a significant role in liver inflammation and Insulin resistance its pathophysiological hallmark. The association between TNF- α (-238 and -308) polymorphism) and the severity of NAFLD was evaluated. Method: A total of 155 subjects (80 NAFLD cases and 75 controls) were included. Liver biopsy was performed for evaluated severity of NAFLD based on NAFLD Activity Score- CRN in all cases. Controls subjects defined was not any liver disease by ultrasound. Plasma TNF- α was measured in all subjects. Polymorphism of TNF- α promoter gene -308 and -238 were identified using PCR-RFLP confirmed with direct sequencing. Results: Liver biopsy established the diagnosis of NASH in 29 cases. There was no association between the incidence of NAFLD with TNF- α polymorphism at the TNF- α -308 or the -238 (p>0.05). The prevalence ratio of TNF- α polymorphism -238 was significantly higher for subject with NASH (p< 0.02). There was no different prevalence ratio for TNF- α polymorphism -308 (p>0,05). We found novel polymorphism of TNF- α -245 T/C in a subject with possible NASH, high plasma TNF- α level (20.27 pg/cc) and very high value of Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance HOMA-IR (22.73).

However, standard treatment and routine image study may not be available for all Indonesian patients because of complex geographic reason in Indonesian archipelago. Therefore, we aimed to review treatment outcome of osteosarcoma in Indonesia and validate potential laboratory markers associated with oncological outcomes. Materials and Methods: From January 2015 to August 2016, we retrospectively reviewed 57 patients with osteosarcoma who had received treatment in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (RSCM), Jakarta, Indonesia. Association between laboratory markers including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and oncological outcomes including mortality and distant metastasis have been validated. Results: Our results showed that a combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy would lead to the best oncological and functional outcome. ESR, CRP LDH and ALP level decreased after surgery and chemotherapy. Lower level of ESR and CRP were not associated with less distant metastasis and less mortality. On the other hand, the elevated LDH was correlated with higher mortality (P < 0.01), whereas elevated ALP was also correlated with a higher risk of distal metastasis (P = 0.044). Conclusions: Patients who had been properly treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy had the best oncological and functional outcomes.

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) given in conjunction to regular treatment is thought to be beneficial in replacing this pancreatic enzyme deficiency, avoiding the need of elemental diet. This study aims to evaluate the benefit of PERT in chil-dren with persistent diarrhea. Methods and Study Design: This is a randomized, two double-blind parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects of pancreatic enzyme supplementation in persistent diar-rhea. Children age 6-60 months were recruited from pediatric inpatient and outpatient units of five hospitals in Jakarta. Subjects was randomly assigned to either pancreatic enzyme 8371 USP unit of lipase or placebo, 3 times daily for 1 month, as an adjunctive therapy to standard treatment. Subjects were then reevaluated at 2 weeks and 4 weeks interval after administration of enzyme or placebo. Variables observed were length of diarrhea after the start of intervention, change in serum prealbumin, and change in FE-1 between week 0 and week 4. Results: Pan-creatic enzyme supplementation shortens the length of diarrhea by 7 days in the intervention group compared to placebo (p=0.019). Serum prealbumin and FE-1 shows trend that favors the intervention group, although not sta-tistically significant (p>0.05). Conclusion: PERT is clinically effective in reducing the length of diarrhea, thus minimizing the need, accessibility and costs of an elemental diet. ? 2017, HEC Press.",Children; Length of diarrhea; Pancreatic enzyme supplementation; Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency; Persistent diarrhea,"triacylglycerol lipase; child; controlled study; diarrhea; diet therapy; double blind procedure; elemental diet; enzyme replacement; enzymology; female; human; infant; male; pancreas; preschool child; randomized controlled trial; Child; Child, Preschool; Diarrhea; Double-Blind Method; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Female; Food, Formulated; Humans; Infant; Lipase; Male; Nutrition Therapy; Pancreas",2-s2.0-85046719339

Levels of vitreous advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and D-dimer may reflect the pathological changes in the retina, but only few studies have assessed their correlation with blood hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels. This study aimed to find the association between blood HbA1c levels with vitreous AGEs and D-dimer levels in patients with proliferative DR. METHODS: an analytical cross-sectional study was performed in subjects with proliferative DR who underwent vitrectomy. Subjects were divided into 2 subgroups, i.e. uncontrolled (HbA1c >7%) and controlled (HbA1c <7%) groups. Vitreous AGEs and D-dimer levels were assessed; the levels were compared between uncontrolled and controlled hyperglycemic patients. Statistic correlation tests were also performed for evaluating blood HbA1c, vitreous AGEs, and D-dimer levels. RESULTS: a total of 47 patients were enrolled in this study and 32 (68.1%) of them were women. Median vitreous AGEs level was 11.0 (3.0 - 48.0) ?g/mL; whereas median vitreous D-dimers level was 5,446.0 (44.0 - 37,394.0 ) ng/mL. The median vitreous AGEs levels was significantly higher in patients with uncontrolled vs. controlled hyperglycemia (14.0 vs. 4.0 mg/mL; p<0.001). There was a significant positive correlation with moderate strength between blood HbA1c level and vitreous AGEs level (r=0.524; r2=0.130; p=0.0001). Blood HbA1c level could be used to predict vitreous AGEs level by using the following calculation: vitreous AGEs = -1.442+ (1.740xblood HbA1c). Vitreous D-dimer levels were not significantly different between uncontrolled and controlled hyperglycemia (median 4607.5 vs. 5701.6 ng/mL; p = 0.458). There was a positive significant correlation between blood HbA1c and vitreous D-dimer levels (r = 0.342; p = 0.019); however the correlation was weak. Vitreous AGEs level had a positive significant correlation with vitreous D-dimer levels (r = 0.292; p = 0.046) and the correlation strength was also weak. CONCLUSION: median vitreous AGEs levels were significantly higher in proliferative DR patients with uncontrolled than those with controlled hyperglycemia. Blood HbA1c level can be used to assess vitreous AGEs level in patients with proliferative DR by using the following calculation: vitreous AGEs = -1.442+(1.740 x HbA1c). However, the blood HbA1c level can not be used to predict vitreous D-dimer level in patients with proliferative DR.",blood HbA1c; proliferative diabetic retinopathy; vitreous advanced glycation end products; vitreous D-dimer,"advanced glycation end product; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; glycosylated hemoglobin; blood; chemistry; complication; cross-sectional study; diabetic retinopathy; female; human; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; vitreous body; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Vitreous Body",2-s2.0-85064879346

Management of this complicated condition is challenging and limited time. Nevertheless, autopsy studies revealed that thrombotic occlusion of more than one major epicardium coronary artery is not uncommon. A 68-year-old woman presented with sudden onset of limited breath and chest discomfort since two hours prior to admission. She also felt exert dyspnoea since one month ago. She has two risk factors that were uncontrolled that is hypertension (HT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). On admission, she succumbed into cardiogenic shock and pulmonary oedema. ECG revealed a diminished R wave in V2-V4 with ST elevation in V2-V5 and in aVR. Biphasic T wave was seen in V2-V6. The working diagnosis was anterior STEMI, Killip class IV with thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score of 8. While being transferred to catheter lab, she gasped, became desaturation, and was intubated prior to procedure. The patient was given double inotropes which run maximally.

However since it can lead to excess iron, the iron chelation therapy is needed. Deferiprone and deferasirox are the most often used therapy in Indonesia. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of deferasirox with deferiprone with cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Methods: Data were taken retrospectively and sampling was done using total sampling based on medical records and hospital information system. Serum ferritin levels of patients consuming deferasirox (n=27) and deferiprone (n=33) were measured to observe the mean changes of serum ferritin levels as effectiveness' parameter.The cost was median of the total direct medical cost, summed from the cost of drugs, medical devices, hospitalization, administration, physician, laboratories and blood bags. Results: Based on the results of this study, the effectiveness of deferasirox (1164 ng/mL) was greater than deferiprone (692 ng/mL). Median total cost of deferasirox was more expensive (Rp 76,610,618.69) than deferiprone (Rp 51,869,965.64). Cost-effectiveness ratio of deferasirox (CER: Rp 65,816.68/effectiveness) was lower than deferiprone (CER: Rp 74,956.60/ effectiveness). None of both medications was dominant and therefore we could not determine which medication was the most cost-effective therapy. Changing of medication from deferiprone to deferasirox requires an extra cost of Rp 52,416.64 per one incremental unit of effectivity. Conclusion: The policy maker in healthcare facility need to consider the budget and whether the incremental cost of deferasirox is proportional to its increased effectiveness. ? 2018 EManuscript Technologies.

The acetylation rate is different in each ethnic, therefore it is very interesting to study of INH acetylation. The aims of this study were to synthesize Ac-INH and the produced Ac-INH was used as a working standard for the pilot study of INH acetylation in Melanesian healthy subjects from Indonesia. Methods: Ac-INH can be simply synthesized by acetylation reactions between INH and acetic anhydride. The synthesis results were characterized by organoleptic observation, purity test, UV-Vis spectrophotometry analysis, FTIR analysis, and mass spectrometry analysis. The pilot study of INH acetylation used high performance liquid chromatography to analyze the levels of INH and Ac-INH in blood of Melanesian healthy subjects. The acetylation rate of INH was determined by the ratio between Ac-INH and INH concentrations at 3 h after administration of INH. Results: The acetylation reaction to synthesize Ac-INH has been performed at temperature of 60°C for 30 min. The obtained Ac-INH had the same quality specifications with reference standard of Ac-INH. The average of ratio between of Ac-INH and INH concentrations was <1.5. The results showed that the six healthy subjects of Melanesians had slow acetylation. There was significant difference in the ratio between Ac-INH and INH concentrations in subjects (P<0.05). Conclusion: The obtained Ac-INH could be used for pilot study of INH acetylation by calculating the ratio of Ac-INH and INH concentrations in plasma subject.

The interventions of treatment for infected humans and use of repellent are included in the model to see how these interventions could be considered as alternative ways to control the spread of malaria. Analysis will be made of the disease-free equilibrium point along with its local stability criteria, construction of the next generation matrix which followed with the sensitivity analysis of basic reproduction number.

Methods: This was an experimental study that treated culture of BCSCs with PL from breast cancer (BC) patients or healthy donors. Venous blood from all subjects were subjected to prior hematology test and then processed to obtain platelet rich plasma (PRP). Platelet counts in PRP were determined. PRP was processed to obtain PL. PDGF-AB contents in PL were measured. PL at concentrations of 0.01% (v/v) was supplemented into DMEM-F12 medium and used for culturing BCSCs (CD24-/CD44+ cells).

Cardioplegic solution is one method to achieve good myocardial protection. Inevitably, ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs with aortic crossclamping. Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution is a frequently used cardioplegia for complex congenital heart surgery. We postulated that addition of terminal warm blood cardioplegia before removal of the aortic crossclamp might improve myocardial protection. Method: A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 109 cyanotic patients aged, 1 to 5 years who underwent complex biventricular repair. They were divided into a control group of 55 patients who had histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate only and a treatment group of 54 who had histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate with terminal warm blood cardioplegia. Endpoints were clinical parameters, troponin I levels, and caspase-3 as an apoptosis marker. Results: The incidence of low cardiac output syndrome was 34%, with no significant difference between groups (35.2% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.84). The incidence of arrhythmias in our treatment group was lower compared to the control group (36% vs. 12%, p = 0.005). Troponin I and caspase-3 results did not show any significant differences between groups.

Air pollution in Indonesia, especially in Jakarta due to the number of private vehicles increased at least 10% every year. This air pollution can have an impact on public health. One effort to do as a protection of people health is to use a mask. Activated carbon can be coated to mask in order to improve the effectiveness in reducing the pollutants. One good material used as material for activated carbon is coconut shell. Selection of coconut shell as the raw material of activated carbon is also based on cellulose content of 26.06%, hemicellulose content 27.07% and a lignin content of 29.40% in the dry state. This research was done in some variation such as activation methods, activated carbon mass, and adhesive material types. Based on pollutants adsorption test, mask with 6 grams of activated carbon, chemically activated, and used TEOS as adhesive is the best variation that able to adsorb as much 76,25% of CO2 Pollutants.

Cancers or tumor tissue cells are cells that grow abnormally and turn to take over and damage the surrounding tissues. At the beginning, cancers or tumors do not have definite symptoms in its early stages, and can even attack the tissues inside of the body. This phenomena is not identifiable under visual human observation. Therefore, an early detection system which is cheap, quick, simple, and portable is essensially required to anticipate the further development of cancer or tumor. Among all of the modalities, microwave imaging is considered to be a cheaper, simple, and portable system method. There are at least two simple image reconstruction algorithms i.e. Filtered Back Projection (FBP) and Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART), which have been adopted in some common modalities. In this paper, both algorithms will be compared by reconstructing the image from an artificial tissue model (i.e. phantom), which has two different dielectric distributions. We addressed two performance comparisons, namely quantitative and qualitative analysis. Qualitative analysis includes the smoothness of the image and also the success in distinguishing dielectric differences by observing the image with human eyesight. In addition, quantitative analysis includes Histogram, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) calculation were also performed. As a result, quantitative parameters of FBP might show better values than the ART. However, ART is likely more capable to distinguish two different dielectric value than FBP, due to higher contrast in ART and wide distribution grayscale level. ? 2018 Author(s).

One of the disadvantage impact is arising the degenerative diseases such as cancers and tumors, not just common infectious diseases. Every year, victims of cancers and tumors grow significantly leading to one of the death causes in the world. In early stage, cancer/tumor does not have definite symptoms, but it will grow abnormally as tissue cells and damage normal tissue. Hence, early cancer detection is required. Some common diagnostics modalities such as MRI, CT and PET are quite difficult to be operated in home or mobile environment such as ambulance. Those modalities are also high cost, unpleasant, complex, less safety and harder to move. Hence, this paper proposes a microwave imaging system due to its portability and low cost. In current study, we address on the performance of simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) algorithm that was applied in microwave imaging. In addition, SART algorithm performance compared with our previous work on algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), in order to have performance comparison, especially in the case of reconstructed image quality. The result showed that by applying SART algorithm on microwave imaging, suspicious cancer/tumor can be detected with better image quality. ? 2018 Author(s).

It can be an indicator for mental health hospital admission. Violent behaviors can be characterized by verbal and physical attacks demonstrated by the individuals intensively. Management of violent behaviors in hospital often uses restraint, but it has physical and psychological effects. This study aimed to explore experience of restraint use among patients with violent behaviors in mental health hospital. Method: To gain deep understanding related to the patients’ experiences, this study used a qualitative design with a phenomenological approach. Purposive sampling was employed to find patients who were restrained during their hospitalization. The number of participants in this study was 8 participants. The data were analyzed with Colaizzi's method. Results: Patients with violent behavior, specifically with physical restraint during their hospital-ization had negative impacts on patients. The results of this study were described in three themes: 1) aggressive behavior as one of the main reason of restraint; 2) professional healthcare supports during the restraint use, and 3) physical and psychosocial impact of the restraint use. Conclusions: The impact of restraint is related to human right violations and ethical dilemma.

Results: Six themes were identified: pain as the main complaint reported by cancer patients; pain assessment using a pain scale; an awareness of the absence of nurses’ role in pain management; a lack of understanding of pain conditions; acknowledgement that a pain assessment tool should be practical and user friendly; and the need to develop a pain assessment tool. We also explored the knowledge of nurses in pain management and achieved an in-depth understanding of the nurses’ desire to seek additional knowledge related to pain assessment. Conclusions: A pain assessment tool should be developed to assist nurses to independently interpret data about pain and allow them to select or modify interventions consistent with the patients’ needs. Pain management for cancer patients is one of the essential nurses’ responsibilities in providing comprehensive meaningful nursing care. ? 2018 Elsevier Espa?a, S.L.U.",Cancer pain; Oncology nursing; Pain assessment,adult; cancer pain; female; health personnel attitude; human; Indonesia; male; middle aged; nursing; oncology nursing; pain measurement; procedures; young adult; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cancer Pain; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Middle Aged; Oncology Nursing; Pain Measurement; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85045119833

The objective of this paper was to critically examine the implementation of GCI in Indonesia by reviewing the background, effects, and sustainability of this program. Method: A literature search of studies related to GCI, other types of micro health insurance, and their applications in developing countries was conducted. Recent news (post 2014) related with the implementation of GCI was also consulted. Results: The literature revealed that the foundation of GCI was informed by the Declaration of Alma Ata with the ideal of making health care services accessible to everyone. Unlike most health insurance, the mechanisms of GCI seem less likely to trigger moral hazard among its beneficiaries. However, as a micro insurance program, the sustainability of GCI continues to be called into question. Conclusions: The critical analysis of the present study has highlighted the application of GCI, a micro health insurance initiative, and its relevance to Indonesia. GCI tended to work well as it was able to utilise Indonesia's social capital. However, GCI should aim to increase the benefits package available to its members in order to maintain the sustainability of the program ? 2018 Elsevier Espa?a, S.L.U.",Developing country; Garbage Clinical Insurance; Micro health insurance,"government; health insurance; human; Indonesia; program evaluation; waste; Garbage; Government Programs; Humans; Indonesia; Insurance, Health; Program Evaluation",2-s2.0-85045080678

Due to the current interest in the apoptosis effects from areca nut for oral cancer treatment, we investigated its ability to induce apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in oral cancer cell lines: HSC-2 and HSC-3. Methods: We examined the effect of areca nut on apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells. Flow cytometry was conducted for the quantification of the cells that were apoptotic and expressing the caspase-3 enzyme for 24 and 48 hours. Results: Areca nut induced a significant increase (p<0.01) in late apoptosis of HSC-2 cells and mostly occurred over 48 hours.

Periodontitis is a prevalent oral inflammatory disease that leads to alveolar bone loss and linked to several systemic health problems. Ligature-induced periodontitis model is considered to be similar to human periodontitis in various aspect and is one of the most used animal models in periodontal research. The present study aims to investigate the effect of fasting regimen in experimentally-induced periodontitis in mice. In this study we applied two different kinds of fasting regimens: Intermittent fasting (IF / every other day fasting)and prolonged fasting (PF / 2 days fasting and 5 days free food intake) for 4 weeks. We found that both fasting regimen groups showed less amount of bone loss compared to the nonfasting groups at the ligature-periodontitis site, furthermore also at the contralateral side of the maxillae where the physiological bone loss occurs. PQCT and calcein-labeled histomorphometric analyses showed higher bone regeneration capacity in the fasting groups than in the nonfasting groups. Bone marrow cells from the femurs of the fasting groups produced more mineralized modules than the nonfasting groups. Data from this study showed fasting would be beneficial for resisting bone destruction in periodontitis and for maintaining periodontal bone health, which could be due to the increase of osteoprogenitor cells in bone marrow. ? 2018 University of Dicle.",Animal Experiment; Intermittent Fasting; Periodontitis; Prolonged Fasting,,2-s2.0-85067030804

Objective: Here we provide molecular data for HIVDR in the CRF01_AE subtype in Bali, Indonesia. Method: Seventy patients were enrolled in this study and grouped into treatment failure and treatment na?ve groups. The full-length pol gene was amplified using nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and the product was then sequenced. The readable sequence was then subjected to Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database genotyping. Results: We found that clinical classification was in accordance with the presence of HIVDR markers in the pol gene. Independent of therapy history, the treatment failure group showed resistance markers against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), ranging from 72%–100% of patients. Only a small proportion of na?ve patients harbored HIV with drug resistance markers to NNRTI. No protease inhibitor-resistant marker was found in either patient group. Molecular marker mutations, which were found in more than 50% of treatment failure patients, were M184V (100%), T215A/Y/F (88.2%), D67N/G (76.5%), and M41L (58.8%). Conclusion: The protocol used in this study to determine genetic markers of HIVDR based on subtype B can be applied for the rapid determination of resistance of the CRF01_AE subtype.

Therefore, this study aims at analyzing a multidimensional poverty measurement in Indonesia. Applying Alkire and Foster’s multidimensional framework and utilizing the 2011 National Socio-Economic Survey Indonesia, this study confirmed that the monetary measurement of poverty should be complemented with the multidimensional poverty measurement to capture a comprehensive picture of deprivation in Indonesia. Around 61% of populations categorized as non-poor by the conventional poverty measurement are still categorized as poor using the multidimensional poverty measurement. Although Spearman’s rank correlations shows that both poverty measurements at the provincial level are weakly correlated, our econometric estimations confirmed that both determinants of poverty are relatively similar – for instance, a higher educational attainment of the household head leads to a higher probability of being non-poor in terms of both monetary and multidimensional poverty. Our study also identifies that a health indicator is the major source of multidimensional poverty in Indonesia; therefore, a universal health program launched in 2014 is important for tackling multidimensional poverty as well as improving human capital. ? 2018, Statistical Economic and Social Research and.

Recently, high-intensity intermittent training (HIIT) appears to have the same beneficial effects or even superior to those of continuous moderate-intensity training (CMIT) on body fat mass reduction. Exercise may induce myokine secretion such as irisin, which plays a role as a mediator of beiging process, and thus might contribute as treatment of obesity. However, the effects of those exercise formulas on irisin level changes as beiging agent are not known. In addition, metabolic states may affect the irisin responses to those exercise formulas. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the different effects of exercises using HIIT and CMIT on circulating and tissue irisin levels in normal and abnormal metabolic conditions (obese). Methods. Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks of age) were randomized to 4 groups according to training regimens (HIIT and CMIT) and metabolic conditions (normal and abnormal/obese). The groups are (1) HIIT on normal metabolic (n=4), (2) CMIT on normal metabolic (n=4), (3) HIIT on abnormal metabolic (n=4), and (4) CMIT on abnormal metabolic (n=4). Abnormal metabolic condition was induced with high fat diet (19% fat) for 8 weeks in obese rats. Irisin levels in serum, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue were evaluated by ELISA. Results. Serum irisin levels were shown significantly higher in normal metabolic compared to abnormal metabolic condition (P<0.001). The effect of interaction between metabolic condition and exercise formula was found (P<0.01) on adipose irisin levels. The effect of HIIT was shown significantly more effective on adipose irisin levels, compared with CMIT in abnormal metabolic conditions. However, no significant differences of skeletal muscle irisin levels were found in both normal and abnormal metabolic subjects (P>0.05). Regarding exercise formula, no different effects were found between HIIT and CMIT on skeletal muscle irisin levels in both metabolic conditions (P>0.05). The similar findings were observed in serum irisin levels (P>0.05). Conclusions. The exercise effects in abnormal metabolic condition might be more adaptable in maintaining the irisin levels in skeletal muscle and induce the irisin uptake from circulation into adipose tissue. In addition, HIIT might be more involved to induce irisin uptake into adipose tissue; thus it might have the significant role in beiging process. However, further research about how the HIIT formula affects the regulation mechanisms of irisin uptake into adipose tissue is still warranted. ? 2018 Neng Tine Kartinah et al.",,"irisin; fibronectin; FNDC5 protein, rat; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; Article; continuous moderate intensity training; controlled study; exercise; high intensity interval training; lipid diet; male; nonhuman; obesity; protein blood level; rat; skeletal muscle; white adipose tissue; animal; high intensity interval training; kinesiotherapy; metabolism; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; Sprague Dawley rat; Adipose Tissue, White; Adiposity; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Exercise Therapy; Fibronectins; High-Intensity Interval Training; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",2-s2.0-85059931617

Frequent occurrence and long-term wasting can lead to stunting. Indonesia has one of the world's highest wasting prevalence of 12.1% and ranked the 4th highest for wasting globally in 2012. Methods: Data from Rand Corp Indonesia Family Life Survey for 2000, 2007 and 2014 were used to examine wasting trend, while data for 2000 and 2014 were used to determine the associated factors of wasting in infants aged 0-23 months. Data was analysed using SPSS. Logistic regression was used to predict the variables contributing to wasting. Results: Wasting prevalence in 2000, 2007 and 2014 were 12.0%, 11.2% and 10.1%, respectively. Birth weight correlated significantly with wasting prevalence in 2000 while in 2014, wasting prevalence correlated significantly with birth weight, birth length, poverty, and ownership of ""Mother and Child Health Book"". Logistic regression showed that birth weight was an important associated factor in 2000 and 2014, while ownership of ""Mother and Child Health Book"" was the only important associated factor of birth weight in 2014. Conclusion: The prevalence of wasting among young Indonesian children was lower in 2014 compared to 2000, but is still at a high level. Birth weight consistently remains the significant factor affecting wasting. It is important that the nutritional status of women be taken care of before and during pregnancy for optimal birth outcomes. ? 2018 Nutrition Society of Malaysia.",Birth length; Birth weight; Child care; Trend; Wasting,article; birth weight; child; child care; child health; controlled study; data analysis software; family life; female; human; Indonesia; Indonesian; infant; nutritional status; poverty; pregnancy outcome; prevalence,2-s2.0-85059302303

Because of this contradiction, this study aims to analyze the correlation between urinary TGF-β1 concentration and UACR, and also estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients by controlling some confounding factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, and the samples were obtained using consecutive sampling technique. The study was performed on 99 subjects (62 DM normoalbuminuria patients, 27 DM albuminuria patients, and 10 non-DM patients as controls) at Pasar Minggu Community Health Center. Urinary TGF-β1 concentration was measured by ELISA, and UACR was measured using immunoturbidimetry and an enzymatic colorimetric method. The eGFR value was calculated based on serum creatinine using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. The results were then subjected to be analyzed statistically. Results: There was an increase of urinary TGF-β1 in albuminuria (326.49±48.98) as compared to normoalbuminuria (290.54±30.71) and non-DM subjects (229.83±31.90), but the values did not differ statistically (P=0.790). In addition, no correlation was observed between urinary TGF-β1 and UACR (r=?0.084, P=0.410) and eGFR (r=0.155, P=0.125), but a correlation was found with SBP (r=?0.224, P=0.026). Linear regression analysis showed that urinary TGF-β1 and HbA1c could predict UACR, but only HbA1c could be considered as a significant predictor of UACR. Conclusion: There is an increase of urinary TGF-β1 concentrations in albuminuria patients clinically, but not statistically. The concentration of TGF-β1 was not correlated with UACR and eGFR, but correlated with SBP. Since TGF-β1 could be interfered by many factors, including hypertension and its medication, urinary TGF-β1 might not be independently associated with renal function in diabetes. ? 2018 Sauriasari and Pratiwi.",Albuminuria; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic nephropathy; TGF-β1; UACR,albumin; creatinine; hemoglobin A1c; transforming growth factor beta1; adult; albuminuria; Article; colorimetry; concentration (parameters); confounding variable; controlled study; correlational study; creatinine blood level; cross-sectional study; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic patient; disease association; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; glomerulus filtration rate; health center; human; immunoturbidimetry; Indonesia; kidney function; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prediction; protein urine level; renal system parameters; urine albumin to creatinine ratio,2-s2.0-85059013494

The most common form of such combined injury is a low median-ulnar palsy, usually due to laceration of the volar wrist. It is a devastating injury, and with delayed presentation the injury is going to be more difficult to reconstruct. Presentation of case: Ten-year-old girl was admitted to hospital with numbness of her left palm and fingers, 5 months before admission. She was hit by a car while riding a bicycle from opposite direction from she was heading and cut her left forearm by licensed plate. Initially treated at nearby clinic but later couldn't extend her fingers after the pain subsided and left untreated for 5 months. Discussion: Traditionally, number of static procedures have been described to correct the claw hand deformity by preventing MCP joint hyperextension. Nevertheless, these procedures are reserved for those having ability to extend IP joints while MCP joint hyperextension were prevented. Conversely, static procedure like Zancolli capsulodesis is simple and do not sacrifice any motors in an already compromised extremity. Combined with sural graft, the outcome for the patient is hopefully better than Zancolli procedure alone.

A growing number of studies had addressed fear of cancer recurrence, yet they are largely focused on the breast cancer survivors of the western world countries. This study investigates the fear of cancer recurrence and its relations to social support in Indonesian gynecological cancer survivors. Methods: Gynecological cancer survivors (n = 153) in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia completed Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, socio-demographic and clinically-related characteristics questionnaires. Pearson r correlation tests, t-tests, and ANOVAs were used to identify the relationships between variables, and linear regression to determine to what extent the social support may predict the survivors’ fear of recurrence. Results: Indonesian gynecological cancer survivors with higher social support were more likely to experience lower levels of fear of cancer recurrence. Whereas, having a family history of cancer was an important predictor of fear of cancer recurrence levels. Conclusion: Social support plays an essential role in predicting fear of cancer recurrence among Indonesian gynecological cancer survivors. ? 2018, Institute of Oncology Sremska Kamenica.

To use the color indicator precisely, we tested several color sensors to performance in detecting color and chose TCS34725 as the color sensor. The prototype of urine hydration system (UHS) is designed to record hydration status data in daily basis in cloud computing and the urine information can be accessed by Android smartphone. The prototype employs a set of microcontrollers and sensors as IoT devices and support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier. To evaluate the accuracy of hydration status, we compared the prediction with urine specific gravity (USG) as golden standard.

Differences in vertical condylar height, observed in the assessment of mandibular asymmetry, is a structural alteration that represents a risk factor for TMD. The study aimed to evaluate the association between TMD symptoms and vertical mandibular symmetry in young adult orthodontic patients in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Methods: The cross-sectional study included 18-25-year-old (mean ± SD, 21.9 ± 2.0 years) old orthodontic patients admitted to the Dental Hospital of Universitas Sumatera Utara, Medan, between June 2016 and March 2017. Vertical mandibular asymmetry was assessed from all 106 subjects using Kjellberg's technique from pre-treatment panoramic radiographs. The TMD symptoms were assessed by structural interviews using modified questionnaires based on Temporomandibular Disorder Diagnostic Index and Fonseca's Anamnestic Index. Results: Of the 106 subjects, 26 (24.5% of the total) with vertical mandibular symmetry and 39 (36.8%) with vertical mandibular asymmetry were positive for TMD symptoms. By contrast, 17 patients (16.0% of the total) with vertical condylar symmetry and 24 patients (22.6%) with vertical mandibular asymmetry were regarded negative for TMD symptoms. There was no significant difference (p=0.520) in TMD symptoms based on vertical mandibular symmetry. Conclusion: The results from this studied Sumatran population indicate that there are common TMD symptoms in young adult orthodontic patients, but there is no significant association between vertical mandibular asymmetry and TMD symptoms. Further study on the development of TMD, mandibular asymmetry and treatment planning for growing patients is suggested, using longitudinal and transitional approaches. ? 2018 Sofyanti E et al.",Vertical mandibular asymmetry; temporomandibular disorder,adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; cross-sectional study; disease assessment; Fonseca Anamnestic Index; human; Indonesia; major clinical study; orthodontics; panoramic radiography; Temporomandibular Disorder Diagnostic Index; temporomandibular joint disorder; vertical mandibular symmetry; young adult,2-s2.0-85048660328

Inflammation is widely recognized to play an important role in cancer progression and is related to thrombosis. Soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) is one of several biomarkers that may be predictive of thrombosis in cancer. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between monocyte count and sP-selectin in various stages of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Methods. Fifty-five patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were divided into three groups according to nodal and distant metastasis (group of stages I-IVA, IVB, and IVC). Monocyte count was calculated from routine peripheral blood examination, while sP-selectin level was measured using commercial ELISA kit. Results. The monocyte count of subjects in groups IVB and IVC was significantly higher compared to group I-IVA (707/μL versus 528/μL, p=0.022; 841/μL versus 528/μL, p=0.005). Plasma levels of sP-selectin in group IVC were higher than group I-IVA (59.5 ng/mL versus 41.97 ng/mL, p=0.001) and group IVB (59.5 ng/mL versus 45.53 ng/mL, p=0.007). In subjects with high monocyte count (>665/μL), there was moderate correlation between monocyte count and sP-selectin (r=0.436, p=0.022). Conclusion. Advanced stages of nasopharyngeal carcinoma had higher levels of monocyte count and sP-selectin compared to earlier stages.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of rotenone-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the modulation of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression and cell viability in human glioblastoma (GBM) T98G cells. Methods: In this in vitro experimental study, T98G cells were treated with high-dose rotenone (0.5, 5, and 50 μM, respectively). Following rotenone treatment and intracellular ROS, both peroxide and superoxide radicals were determined. Moreover, we analyzed MnSOD mRNA expression, protein, and specific activity, as well as cell survival including viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial structure. Results: High-dose rotenone treatment of T98G cells significantly increased intracellular ROS and MnSOD mRNA, but its protein and specific activity definitely decreased. The treatment also led to a reduction of cell viability, enhancement of apoptosis, and disruption of mitochondrial integrity. Conclusion: Overproduction of ROS in rotenone-treated human GBM T98G cells could suppress the MnSOD protein level and activity even though mRNA synthesis has been increased. This modulation led to reduced survival of T98G cells through induction of cell death rather than inhibition of cell proliferation. ? 2018 The Authors.",Cell viability; Glioblastoma multiforme; Manganese superoxide dismutase; Rotenone,manganese superoxide dismutase; messenger RNA; peroxy radical; reactive oxygen metabolite; rotenone; superoxide; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell culture; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme inhibition; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; mitochondrion; real time polymerase chain reaction; T98G cell line; transmission electron microscopy,2-s2.0-85039856147

The latest technique in thermal ablation is Microwave Ablation (MW Ablation) that rely on the propagation of electromagnetic waves that is able to increase the temperature of a tissue rapidly. Changes in temperature during the ablation process will reduce the water content in the body tissue (78% of the liver tissue is composed of water) and affect the value of permittivity and conductivity of the tissue. These changes cause the impedance matching of the antenna applicator also change during the ablation process. The change on impedance will make the system does not match with the previous resonant frequency. In addition, the microwave ablation applicator, which is designed for specific frequencies (2.4 GHz and 915MHz) with narrow band characteristics will be suffered from aforementioned phenomenon. Meanwhile, according to the previous studies there are other prominent resonant frequencies that used for MW Ablation, i.e. 1.9 GHz, 6 GHz, 9.2 GHz and 10 GHz. Therefore to accommodate some of the frequencies that are widely used in microwave ablation technique and to tackle the problems arising from the reduced transmission efficiency, then an applicator that has ultrawideband (UWB) characteristics is proposed. In this paper, we design an applicator, which has the characteristics of UWB by modifying the ground plane of the applicator by a hexagonal-sectioned coil.

Their instinctive love develops strong emotional connections with their children, especially when their children have sensory impairments (SI). Feelings experienced by mothers, such as anxiety toward dental treatment, can affect their children’s emotions. Salivary alpha amylase (sAA) has been proposed as a biomarker of stress due to its sensitivity to changes in the body, such as dental anxiety. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between sAA levels in mothers and children with SI before dental treatment. Methods: Measurement of sAA from sixty pairs of children with SI and their mothers was taken together in the waiting room before the children’s dental treatment. Spearman’s analysis was used to find the correlation between their sAA levels. Results: In this study, sAA levels in mothers accompanying their children with SI correlated significantly with their children’s sAA levels (r=0.533; p<0.002). Conclusions: The correlation between dental anxiety in mothers and children with SI before dental treatment was found to be significant. Practical Implications: Anxiety toward dental care is a phenomenon that frequently arises in children. Mothers, the main influencers of their children’s development, are thought to be one cause of high anxiety in children. Children with special needs are at a higher risk for developing dental problems. Therefore, an understanding of these children’s levels of anxiety can be used by pediatric dentists to improve dental care. ? 2017 The Authors.",Anxiety; Before dental treatment; Children; Salivary alpha amylase; Sensory impairment,alpha amylase saliva isoenzyme; amylase blood level; Article; child; controlled study; correlational study; dental anxiety; dental procedure; disease association; female; human; medical research; mother child relation; personal experience; sensory dysfunction; time to treatment; waiting room,2-s2.0-85040712544

Tissue engineering is currently exploring alternatives for generating new bone tissue. The base triad for bone tissue engineering is manipulation of osteogenic cells, growth factors, and bio scaffolds. Diamond concept includes mechanical environment and this base triad. Provided constant stream of pluripotent stem cells and biomolecular signals that is necessary for bone formation are some advantages of this in vivo bioreactor. Thus, we conducted article searches by using computerized database of PUBMED and Google Scholar. After sorting and selecting, 14 articles were finally obtained. Several things are considered upon designing an in vivo bioreactor. Before conception, it is necessary to measure the size and geometry of the defect. Afterwards, the materials for bioreactor construction must be determined. These include the scaffold material, cell seeding, and growth factors. Method of prefabrications follows to be decided, including site for implantation and time until transfer. Lastly, additional strategies to improve angiogenesis and osseointegration can be considered and added, until the graft is clinically applied. Some issues still need to be covered on this new trending discovery. Study comparing prefabrication sites to find the most optimal site is needed, as well as the optimal time to harvest. Further development regarding technique to produce large volume of bone tissue must be considered. Moreover, further studies in human subjects with larger samples followed by evaluation after clinical implantation would be necessary to examine the applicability and feasibility in human population. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Bio scaffolds; Bioreactor; Bone defect; Osteoconductive; Osteoinductive,growth factor; angiogenesis; bioreactor design; bone defect; disease severity; geometry; human; nonhuman; omentum; osseointegration; periosteum graft; Review; skin graft; systematic review,2-s2.0-85028346716

Adolescent girls contributed to maternal mortality based on early marriage, unwanted pregnancy, and childbirth. Prevention efforts have been taken through government programs and non-governmental organizations, but in practice those were considered ineffective. Thus, a preventative effort in the form of health education should be made, preferably embedded in a popular mobile application that most teenagers would be apt to use. This study aimed to develop an interactive health education model based on adolescent-friendly applications, according to their needs. The design of this research was mixed-method. A quantitative approach was used by conducting a survey of 188 teenagers aged 15–19?years in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia through questionnaires. This research also contained a qualitative component via in-depth interviews with students, parents, and counseling teachers. The quantitative results showed that respondents’ knowledge was low about male and female reproductive organs, prevention of pregnancy, and the use of condoms. Respondents’ attitudes toward risky behaviors indicate a positive attitude about smoking, drinking, and illegal drugs, as well as premarital sex, while respondents have a negative attitude toward unwanted pregnancies. Respondents’ attitudes toward application-based health education shows a high interest. Respondents desired that the application have privacy, up-to-date information, interesting features, can be discussed with peer groups and health workers, include a game, animation, and simulation, and can identify reproductive health independently. Qualitative results indicate the need for reliable, accessible, and personal sources of information. The next research recommendation is to develop an interactive health education model based on the application of Djuwita and evaluate its influence on the knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of young women in maintaining their reproductive health. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis.",Adolescent girls; Djuwita application; health education,adolescent; adolescent pregnancy; contraceptive behavior; female; health education; human; Indonesia; maternal mortality; pregnancy; procedures; program development; psychology; qualitative research; questionnaire; student; young adult; Adolescent; Contraception Behavior; Female; Health Education; Humans; Indonesia; Maternal Mortality; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Program Development; Qualitative Research; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85034778236

Various outcomes of geriatric patient care, such as improved functional status and quality of life have not been evaluated. Prolonged hospitalization and re-hospitalization are potentially affecting the efficiency care of this vulnarable group. This study aimed to identify the differences of functional status improvement, quality of life improvement, length of stay, and hospitalization of geriatric patients admitted to CMH between prior to and after NHI implementation.METHODS: a cohort study with historical control was conducted among geriatric patients admitted to Acute Geriatric Ward CMH Hospital on two periods of time: January-December 2013 (pre-NHI implementation) and June 2014-May 2015 (after NHI implementation). Patients who died within 24 hours of hospital admission, those with APPACHE II score >24, advance stage cancer, transfer to other wards before they were discharged or have incomplete record were excluded from the study. Data on demographical and clinical characteristics, functional status, quality of life, length of stay, and re-hospitalization were taken from patient's medical record. The differences of studied outcomes were analyzed using t-test or Mann-Whitney test.RESULTS: there were 102 subjects in pre-NHI and 135 subjects in NHI groups included in the study. Median lengths of stay were not different between two groups (12.5 days in pre-NHI and 10 days in NHI groups, p=0.087), although the proportion of patients with in-hospital stay less than 14 days was higher in NHI group. The difference of functional status of discharged patients in pre-NHI and NHI groups were 3 and 3 (p=0.149) respectively, whereas for health-related quality of life, although NHI group in the beginning showed a lower quality of life compared to the pre-NHI (0.163 [0.480] vs. 0.243 [0.550]; p=0.012). However, after incorporating comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) the quality of life improved significantly by the end of in-hospital care in both groups. Re-hospitalization incidence in NHI group was lower compared to pre-NHI (7 [5.2%] vs. 13 [12.7%]; p=0.038).CONCLUSION: our study shows that there was? no? significant difference regarding length of stay, functional status, and health-related quality of life between prior to and after national health insurance implementation on admitted geriatric patients.

Methods: This study used data from the medical and financial records of ovarian cancer patients who were admitted to Dharmais National Cancer Hospital (RSKD) between 2008 and 2012 and subsequently underwent surgery and were treated with chemotherapy. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, and a Kaplan–Meier graph was plotted to compare the survival of the patients in the taxane-based and cisplatin-based chemotherapy groups. Results: Of 41 patients, treatment costs were available for nine patients who had undergone taxane-based chemotherapy and for 31 patients who had undergone cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In general, surgical procedures accounted for the highest proportion of the treatment costs, followed by chemotherapy. Taxane-based chemotherapy (six cycles) was 4 times more expensive than cisplatin-based therapy. The pre- and post-chemotherapy costs of care among those treated with the taxane-based regimen were 3-4 times more expensive than those of the patients who received cisplatin-based treatment. The disease-free recurrence duration of the patients treated with taxane was longer (median=18 months) than that of the patients treated with cisplatin (median=5 months). Conclusions: Taxane-based therapy increased the disease-free recurrence duration of the patients, with disease-free recurrence 3 times longer than that of the patients treated with the cisplatin-based regimen.

Therefore, drug-related problems (DRPs) are common in the elderly. The main objectives of this study were to reduce the number of DRPs in the elderly through pharmacist involvement and to analyze differences after pharmacist recommendations. Methods: In a quasi-experimental study, 12 primary health centers were selected and randomly divided into two groups (six in each group). In the first group, the physicians received pharmacist recommendations verbally through discussions, and in the second group, the physicians received recommendations through letters. DRPs were analyzed from all older inpatients’ medical records 1 month before and 1 month after the pharmacist recommendations. The main outcome being measured was the incidence of DRPs, classified into problems, and causes according to the Indonesian translated version of Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe, Version 6.2 (PCNE V 6.2). The problems were identified based on journal articles and other relevant literature. Results: A total of 205 patients were analyzed before pharmacist intervention (Group 1: 121; Group 2: 84) and 202 patients after the intervention (Group 1: 108; Group 2: 94). The most common problem in these elderly patients was that they suffered from toxic effects. The most common cause was inappropriate drug selection. The number of DRPs and causes were decreased significantly through the discussions (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, problems p=0.027, causes p=0.028). DRPs were also significantly decreased through the recommendation letters (paired t-test, number of problems p=0.003, and causes p=0.004). Discussion with physicians seemed more effective and decreased more problems (p=0.001) and causes (p=0.002). Through discussions, the decrease in a number of problems was 20.83±8.931, and the decrease in the number of causes was 25.33±11.431 versus the recommendation letter, at 4.17±1.941 and 5.17±2.483, respectively. Conclusion: Pharmacist involvement decreased DRPs among older inpatients. Discussing DRPs with the physicians treating the patients is more effective than giving recommendations in writing only. The PCNE V 6.2 DRP classification system is useful for documenting DRPs among the elderly as it can help pharmacists develop plans to reduce DRPs. ? 2017, Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

It is also one of the factors that cause non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases. DNA hypermethylation can be reversed by suppressing DNMT1 activity using a DNMT inhibitor. This study was conducted to seek out inhibitor candidates among natural products. Methods: The search for potential inhibitors was conducted through a virtual screening of the Indonesian Herbal Database using AutoDockVina as docking software. Twenty-five compounds known for their inhibitory activity against DNMT1 were used as actives and as a reference for generating decoys, which was done using the Directory of Useful Decoys, Enhanced. Results: The 12 compounds with binding energies below the cutoff value were cassiamin C (A1), procyanidin B2 (B2), ent-epicatechin-(4alpha->8)-ent-epicatechin (C3), epicatechin-(4beta->8)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (D4), neorhusflavanone (E5), 3-O-galloylepicatechin-(4beta->6)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (F6), withanolide (G7), 3-O-galloylepigallocatechin-(4beta->6)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (H8), cyanidin 3-(6’’-caffeylsophoroside)-5-glucoside (I9), epifriedelanol (J10), gallocatechin-(4alpha->8)-epicatechin (K11), and scutellarein 7-glucosyl-(1->4)-rhamnoside (L12). A1 had the lowest binding energy of ?12.7 kcal/mol, whereas K11 had the highest of ?11.5 kcal/mol.

The absence of an effective vaccine and Plasmodium strains that are resistant to antimalarial drugs emphasize the importance of developing new chemotherapeutic agents. The use of computers for in-silico screening, or virtual screening, is currently being developed as a method for discovering antimalarial drugs. One of the enzymes that can support the development of the malaria parasite is the Plasmodium falciparum enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (PfENR). Inhibition of these enzymes leads to Type II lipid biosynthesis inhibition on the parasite. Methods: This research investigates the use of virtual screening to find PfENR inhibitor candidates. A molecular docking method using GOLD software and the medicinal plants in Indonesia database will be used. This target has been optimized by the removal of residues and the addition of charge. Ligand is expected to be an inhibitor of PfENR. Results: In-silico screening, or virtual screening, found that the top five compounds with the highest GOLD score at trial are kaempferol 3-rhamnosyl-(1-3)-rhamnosyl-(1-6)-glucoside; cyanidin 3,5-di-(6-malonylglucoside); 8-hydroxyapigenin 8-(2’’, 4’’-disulfato glucuronide); epigallocatechin 3,5,-di-O-gallat; quercetin 3,4’-dimethyl ether 7-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1-6)-glucoside.

Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional to examine the effectiveness and cost of different treatments for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among outpatients at Dr. Sitanala Leprosy Hospital in Tangerang, using cost-effectiveness analysis. Participants had consumed the same drug over the past 4 months and were divided into three groups, as follows: An insulin group (n=29), sulfonylurea group (n=29), and sulfonylurea–metformin combination group (n=39). The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated by considering Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values. The measured cost was direct medical cost. Results: The results showed that there were more female patients (65.96%) than male patients with T2DM, and their average age was 50-59 years. The highest effectiveness was shown in combination in the sulfonylurea–metformin group, with an HbA1c level of 7.48±1.89, although the difference was not statistically significant. The direct medical cost of sulfonylurea monotherapy was significantly lower than that of the other therapies. The average cost-to-effectiveness ratio in the insulin group was Rp. 40,866 that in the sulfonylurea group was Rp. 1,369 and that in the combination of sulfonylurea–metformin group was Rp. 2,621 per percentage of effectivity. The incremental cost-to-effectiveness ratio for the sulfonylurea–metformin to sulfonylurea monotherapy treatment was Rp. 16,194 per percentage effectivity.

This study aimed to assess the effect of pharmacist intervention on the number and types of drug-related problems in outpatients undergoing hemodialysis at Indonesia Christian University Hospital. Methods: This pre- and post-prospective study was conducted from January 2013 to June 2013. We evaluated 86 patients who were prescribed 804 drugs. Results: A total of 337 drug-related problems were identified (41.86% of the total drugs prescribed). The types of drug-related problems identified were as follows: Failed therapy (18.69%); sub-optimal therapy (52.23%); indication of non-administration of therapy (2.37%); and non-allergic adverse drug effects (26.71%). The physicians received 59 recommendations, and the patients received 278 recommendations. These recommendations resulted in a decrease in ineffective drug therapy or therapeutic failure (18.69-0%), sub-optimal therapy (52.23-21.36%), indications of non-administration of drug (2.37-2.08%), and non-allergic adverse drug effects (26.71-9.20%). The factors that significantly affected the occurrence of drug-related problems were hemodialysis frequency, number of comorbidities, and number of drugs prescribed. Patients undergoing hemodialysis 3 times a week were more likely to experience a decrease in drug-related problems than those undergoing hemodialysis twice a week (odds ratio 26.33, 95% confidence interval 2.710-255.884).

These factors have been conflated and evince the potential of robot-assisted TOE. Hence, a careful integration of clinical experience and Systems Engineering methods was used to develop a concept and physical model for TOE manipulation. The motion of different actuators of the fabricated motorized system has been tested.

One of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in CKD is the complication of cardiovascular disease. Mastin? is a supplement that is locally produced in Indonesia and is made from extract of mangosteen pericarp, which is reported to have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties. The present study aimed to investigate whether Mastin? could improve antioxidant responses in the rat heart during CKD by measuring the expression of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor (Nrf)2, a master regulator of antioxidant response elements. RNA was extracted from the heart tissue of three groups of rats: a normal group, a nephrectomy group, and a nephrectomy with Mastin? group. Two-step real-time RT-PCR was then conducted to calculate the relative expression of the Nrf2 gene. Nrf2 expression was markedly decreased in the nephrectomy group vs the normal group, but slightly increas ed in the nephrectomy with Mastin? group vs the nephrectomy group. CKD resulted in impaired activation of the Nrf2 pathway in the rat heart. Although the administration of Mastin? slightly increased Nrf2 expression, it was not enough to confer cardioprotective effects through the Nrf2 pathway. ?

Acupuncture has been recognized as an adjunctive therapy for obesity, and recent evidence suggests its potential to reduce the inflammatory response in adipose tissue, a condition believed to be responsible for obesity-related health problems. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been proposed as an important mediator of the inflammatory response in adipose tissue, but the number of studies addressing the issue is still limited. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with36 obese patients currently receiving dietary intervention. The patients were randomly allocated into the catgut embedding acupuncture group with diet intervention or the sham (placebo) embedding acupuncture group with diet intervention. Catgut embedding therapy was given twice at CV12 Zhongwan, ST25 Tianshu, CV6 Qihai, and SP6 Sanyinjiao acupoints with two week intervals between procedures. The study endpoints were the IL-6 levels in the blood plasma and body mass index (BMI), measured before and after the intervention. We observed a reduction in the IL-6 levels (mean reduction 0.13 pg/mL, 95% CI: 0.03-0.23) and BMI (mean reduction 0.66, 95% CI 0.43-0.88) in the accupuncture group. The average difference in mean reduction of BMI between the accupuncture and sham groups was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.17-0.52). No difference was found in mean IL-6 reduction between the two groups (95% CI: -0.17 to 0.06). The results suggest that acupoint catgut embedding therapy may help reduce IL-6 levels and BMI in obese patients receiving dietary intervention. ?

This study aims to assess the tumor response to and side effects of reirradiation, the effect of time interval between first radiation treatment and cancer recurrence on the tumor response and side effects, and the effect of tumor size on tumor response. A cohort retrospective study with no comparison was done with the Radiotherapy Department at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta. Participants were recurrent cervical cancer patients undergoing reirradiation. Data was collected from patients' medical records and follow-up phone calls. Twenty-two patients participated in this study. Nine patients (40.9%) had complete responses, 10 patients (45.5%) had partial responses, 1 patient (4.5%) had a stable response, and 2 patients (9.1%) had tumor progressions. In general, 15 patients (68.2%) had no to light side effects (grade 0-2 RTOG) and 7 patients (31.8%) had severe side effects (grade 3-4 RTOG). Four patients (18.1%) had severe gastrointestinal acute side effects, 6 patients (27.3%) had severe gastrointestinal late side effects, 2 patients (9.1%) had severe urogenital side effects, and there were no patients had severe urogenital late side effects.

The cell deaths caused by the anticancer characteristics of chitosan show that apoptosis is not the death pathway of the primary cells involved. The interactions between LMWC and the cells need to be explored. The objective of this study was to compare the ultrastructural morphology of oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC Ca)-922 and noncancer keratinocyte HaCaT cell lines after exposure to LMWC and cisplatin. The cells were treated with LMWC and cisplatin, and their ultrastructural morphology was analyzed using scanning electron micrographs. Features of early apoptosis, seen as the loss of microvilli, were detected in the LMWC-exposed Ca9-22 cells, and there was a material surrounding the cells. In contrast, the LMWC-exposed HaCaT cells showed no changes related to apoptosis. The results were the opposite when cisplatin was used. This study confirms that there are differences in the ultrastructural surface morphology of LMWC-exposed and cisplatin-exposed oral cancer cells and keratinocytes that could be correlated with their biological activity. ?

This experiment aimed to amplify a target region in the integrase gene of Indonesian HIV-1 subtypes CRF01-AE and B that contain genetic mutations known to confer resistance to anti-integrase drug. Eleven archived plasma samples from individuals living with HIV-1 were obtained from the Virology and Cancer Pathobiology Research Center for Health Service (VCPRC FKUI-RSCM) laboratory. One of the plasma samples contained HIV-1 subtype B, and the remaining plasma samples contained subtype CRF01-AE. The target regions for all samples were amplified through RT-PCR, with an annealing temperature of 55 °C, using the primer pair AE-POL 4086F and AE-POL 5232R that were designed by VCPRC FKUI-RSCM. The results of this experiment show that 18.2% (2/11) of the samples were successfully amplified using the one-step RT-PCR. While the primer pair was effective in amplifying the target region in the integrase gene sequence for subtype B (100%; 1/1), it had a low efficacy (10%, 1/10) for subtype CRF01-AE. In conclusion, the primer pair can be used to amplify the target region in Indonesian HIV-1 strain subtypes CRF01-AE and B. However, optimization of the PCR condition and an increased number of samples would help to determine an accurate representation of the efficacy of the primer pair. ?

Hepatitis D infection can occur simultaneously with hepatitis B (co infection) or after a person is exposed to chronic hepatitis B (super infection). Since HDV cannot live without HBV, HDV infection is closely related to HBV infection, hence it is very realistic that every effort of prevention against hepatitis B can indirectly prevent hepatitis D. This paper presents clustering of HBV DNA sequences by using k-means clustering algorithm and R programming. Clustering processes are started with collecting HBV DNA sequences from GenBank, then performing extraction HBV DNA sequences using n-mers frequency and furthermore the extraction results are collected as a matrix and normalized using the min-max normalization with interval [0, 1] which will later be used as an input data. The number of clusters is two and the initial centroid selected of the cluster is chosen randomly. In each iteration, the distance of every object to each centroid are calculated using the Euclidean distance and the minimum distance is selected to determine the membership in a cluster until two convergent clusters are created. As the result, the HBV viruses in the first cluster is more virulent than the HBV viruses in the second cluster, so the HBV viruses in the first cluster can potentially evolve with HDV viruses that cause hepatitis D. ? 2017 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85026244081

In Indonesia, an estimate of 9,1 million people has diabetes mellitus. There are many herbal treatments that are said to help diabetic patients, such as cinnamon. Cinnamon is thought to be able to improve glucose uptake and insulin signalling in in-vitro and animal studies, but results of trials on humans are still highly variable. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of cinnamon as an adjuvant diabetes mellitus treatment in reducing fasting blood glucose levels. Methods: Literature search is done through PubMed? and EBSCO? database, from which one Cochrane review is found relevant. Results: From a meta-analysis in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, it is found that the reduction of fasting blood glucose caused by the usage of cinnamon as an adjuvant treatment to oral hypoglycemic agents is not significant (mean difference ?0.08 [95% CI ?0,34, 0,18] p = 0.55). Discussion: The result of the meta-analysis appraised is consistent with all the RCT analyzed. The six RCTs are somewhat biased with highly variable methods of interventions. This subject has potential to be studied further in high quality RCTs, due to the lacking body of evidence and methodological limitations of currently available studies.

In Indonesia, abortion reaches 2,4 million/year. According to State Ministry for Population and National Family Planning (BKKBN) of Indonesia, there is an increase of abortion as much as 15% each year. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to know the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards risks of abortion among women of reproductive age in Ciracas district in order to decrease the burden. Methods: This is an observational analytic study using cross-sectional design. Between 4th–15th April 2016, 106 women aged 18–50 years old who had been pregnant at least once and visited one of four public health center (Puskesmas) in Ciracas District are recruited. The data were collected using clustered sampling by means of pre-validated questionnaire. Thereafter, we used bivariate analysis to evaluate the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards risks of abortion. Result: Subjects who had good knowledge, attitude, and practice were 31 (29,2%), 35 (33,0%), 39 (36,8%) consecutively. Bivariate analysis shows that there is significant difference between subjects’ knowledge and practice level (RP = 0,363; CI 95% 0,144–0,918; p = 0,029). Meanwhile, there is no significant difference between knowledge and attitude level (RP = 1,428; CI 95% 0,596–3,421; p = 0,423). Conclusion: There is significant difference between subjects’ knowledge and practice level. By increasing the knowledge such as public promotion, education, or informative media, it is expected that there will be an increase in the practice towards abortion. ? 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

Since gallic acid and its synthetic derivatives have been known to reduce cell viability in several cancer cells, this study intended to investigate whether these substances also inhibit the viability of endometriosis cells. Method: Endometriosis cells were isolated and cultured from patients who had undergone laparoscopy surgery using enzymatic technique. After cells were 70–80% confluent, they were harvested and divided into 10,000 cells per well. Cells were given treatment of gallic acid and two of its synthetic derivatives forms-heptyl gallate and octyl gallate-for 48 hours; each with three dosage of 25.6 μg/ml, 51.2 μg/ml and 102.4 μg/ml. All interventions were made in a set of triplo, along with control and blank. MTS assay was used to observe the viability of the endometriosis cells. Results: After the data was rationalised with control, all three substances showed inhibition of endometriosis cells viability. The highest inhibition for all treatments was at 102.4 μg/ml, with inhibition percentage of 56.481%, 65.028%, and 56.839% for gallic acid, heptyl gallate, and octyl gallate, respectively. Conclusion: The present study suggests that gallic acid, heptyl gallate and octyl gallate, have an inhibition effect towards the viability of endometriosis cell. ? 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Cell viability; Endometriosis; Gallic acid; Heptyl gallate; MTS assay; Octyl gallate,,2-s2.0-85030228258

The need for in vitro propagation to obtain therapeutic quantities of cells imposes a risk of impaired functionality due to cellular senescence. Therefore, this study analyzed the senescent profile of previously cryopreserved human adipose mesenchymal stem cells after multiple passages. Methods: Samples of this in vitro observational analytic study, which was performed from April–September 2016, were adipose mesenchymal stem cells that were cryopreserved in passage one in Stem Cell Integrated Medical Technology Unit RSCM-FKUI. After being recultured, the cells were cryopreserved for the second time. We compared cell size, viability, population doubling time (PDT) and senescence of once and twice cryopreserved cells. Cryopreservation groups were analyzed by independent t-test and ANOVA test for each passage analysis. Results: Senescent cells appeared at passage ten in the once- and passage nine in the twice-cryopreserved group, respectively. In terms of once and twice cryopreservation, there were significant differences in 30% confluence cell size, PDT, percentage of senescent cells, and the size of senescent negative cells at P10 (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.032), respectively. Meanwhile there were no differences in viability and the size of senescent positive cells at P10 (p = 0.98, p = 0.212), respectively.

Recent studies have revealed Rho/ROCK pathway’s critical role in regulation of cancer cell migration and proliferation. Besides reducing cholesterol biosynthesis which is implicated in cancer metabolism, statins also decrease the formation of isoprenoids intermediates essential for mediating Rho/ROCK signalling. This study aimed to determine the antimetastasis (migration) effect of simvastatin on breast cancer through Rho/ROCK pathway. Method: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, perioperative “window” trial conducted from November 2014 until July 2015, thirty breast cancer subjects were treated with simvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo for 4–6 weeks followed by mastectomy (n = 15 in each arm) at multiple hospitals in Jakarta. Changes in migration index, ROCK activity and mRNA RhoC expression were compared between the preintervention biopsy specimen with postintervention surgical tissue. The relationships of significant factors with total cholesterol, grade, ER/PR and HER-2 status were analyzed Result: Simvastatin 40 mg/d significantly reduced migration index (p =0.006) and ROCK activity (p =0.002). A decreasing trend was observed regarding mRNA RhoC expression (p = 0.163). Reduced ROCK activity was significant among subgroups with hypercholesterolemia (p = 0.008), HER-2 amplification (p = 0.009) and low grade (p = 0.019), while it was not significantly affected by hormonal receptor expression. Conclusion: Oral simvastatin inhibits cancer migration and causes biomolecular changes within Rho/ROCK pathway in breast cancer patients, particularly in subgroups with hypercholesterolemia, HER-2 amplification and low grade. ? 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

In the first working diagnosis, PFTC is often misdiagnosed as ovarian cancer. Preoperative workups using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are capable of differentiating PFTC from epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs). Both the sensitivity and the specificity of MRI for identifying PFTC are high. The presence of a hydrosalpinx is a hallmark of PFTC. On MRI, hydrosalpinges have characteristic sausage-shaped appearances due to intrauterine fluid accumulation and fallopian tube distention. Additionally, MRI scans are superior to computed tomography (CT) scans or ultrasound images in detecting tumor infiltration into surrounding organs. Here, we report a case in which PFTC was pre-operatively misdiagnosed as EOC. ? 2017 Winarto and Fernando.",Epithelial ovarian carcinoma; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pre-operative diagnosis; Primary fallopian tube carcinoma,CA 125 antigen; abdominal mass; adult; Article; cancer staging; cancer tissue; case report; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic error; echography; female; human; human tissue; hysterectomy; laparotomy; lymph node dissection; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; omentectomy; ovariectomy; ovary carcinoma; salpingectomy; uterine tube carcinoma,2-s2.0-85021632051

From these actions, to ensure the disease that arises then will be continued by taking blood samples. From these results can be sure what disease is suffered and as bad as what conditions, where the analysis can be done only by a specialist. This is the basis of the researchers to develop a system to analyze dengue fever, where the severity of the disease is determined based on the value of eight components of cells in the blood through the method of Perceptron Artificial Neural Network. This study consists of three main stages, namely laboratory data collection, data normalization with Min-Max method, and severity of dengue disease measurement through neural network. First, all data collection normalized to change the input value interval from eight different blood components to the same interval, which is between 0 to 1. After that, the data is processed into the network training stage to get the weights. These weights are then used in the testing phase along with the testing data to obtain the diagnostic results of the severity of dengue fever. From the testing result of system using parameter of learning rate equal to 0.3, tolerance value of 0.02, 8 input units, 2 output units, binary activation function with threshold equal to 0.5, and number of training sample as much as 20 data, maximum accuracy reached by system le 80%, which 8 out of 10 data successfully predicted the severity level correctly (according to doctor's diagnosis). Therefore, it can be concluded that the application system developed can be applied to help doctors or other medical parties in determining the severity of dengue fever based on the results of blood testing with a fairly good percentage of accuracy, so it can be quickly handled as well as appropriate treatment provided. ?

However, both drugs are only recommended for the patients who have pre-treatment HIV RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL. In resource-limited settings, pre-treatment HIV RNA is not routinely performed and not widely available. The aims of this study are to determine factors associated with pre-treatment HIV RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL and to construct a model to predict this outcome. Methods: HIV-infected adults enrolled in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database were eligible if they had an HIV RNA measurement documented at the time of ART initiation. The dataset was randomly split into a derivation data set (75% of patients) and a validation data set (25%). Factors associated with pre-treatment HIV RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL were evaluated by logistic regression adjusted for study site. A prediction model and prediction scores were created. Results: A total of 2592 patients were enrolled for the analysis. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age was 35.8 (29.9-42.5) years; CD4 count was 147 (50-248) cells/mm3; and pre-treatment HIV RNA was 100,000 (34,045-301,075) copies/mL.

Dengue virus is an RNA virus that has very high mutation frequency with an average of 100 times higher than DNA mutations, and the accumulation of mutations will be possible to generate the new serotype. In this study, we report that mutation occurs in NS5 of DENV serotype 3, glutamine mutates into methionine at position 10 and threonine mutates into isoleucine at position 55. These residues are part of the domain named S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine-Dependent Methyltransferase (IPR029063). ?

Although WHO declared their safety, the use of these preservatives are still controversial because some studies showed that BHA induced proliferative effects in animal testing and TBHQ is considered as carcinogenic and causes DNA cleavage. This study is aimed to analyze the interaction between Calf Thymus DNA with BHA and TBHQ which are mediated with Copper (II) Chloride. The result of the study in spectrophotometric showed there was bathochromic shift as much as 2-3 nm in DNA treated with TBHQ. The next analysis used HPLC method in stationary phase of ODS, mobile phase of 10mM Natrium Hydrogen Phosphate Buffer and Methanol (85 : 15) for DNA adduct formation, 8-Hydroxy-2-Deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG) as biomarker of risk cancer. The resultof the study showed the formation of DNA adduct 8-OHDG in the interaction between DNA and 20-500 ppm of TBHQ. The 8-OHdG formation was greatly increased by the higher concentration of TBHQ. The relative amount of 8 OHDG which formed was reached 946/105 deoxyguanosine in DNA bases. Confirmation test by LCMS/MS was characterized with the detection of mother ion peak (m/z 284); fragment ion peaks at m/z 167.9, and 139.9; at retention time 3.52 min.

Adsorption process creates a pressure drop which can bring down the temperature to the intended condition. This approach can be used in vaccine transportation as the vaccines need to be stored at low temperatures (2°C to 8°C for preserving vaccines). The pressure decrease can be obtained by adsorption water in zeolites and can also produce the temperature drop in the main chamber. The adsorption process of water will decrease until reaching saturation condition. Heat is needed to keep the system continuous as it starts a desorption process. From the simulation using MATLAB, it is found that the mobile vaccine refrigerator can reach the temperature of 2°C in 180 seconds with the amount of cooling power generated is up to 1530?W.

In this clustering method, we use n-mers frequency to calculate the distance matrix which is considered more accurate than using the DNA alignment. The clustering results could be used to discover biologically important sub-sections and groups of genes. Many clustering methods have been developed, while hard clustering methods considered less accurate than fuzzy clustering methods, especially if it is used for outliers data. Among fuzzy clustering methods, fuzzy c-means is one the best known for its accuracy and simplicity. Fuzzy c-means clustering uses membership function variable, which refers to how likely the data could be members into a cluster. Fuzzy c-means clustering works using the principle of minimizing the objective function. Parameters of membership function in fuzzy are used as a weighting factor which is also called the fuzzier. In this study we implement hybrid clustering using fuzzy c-means and divisive algorithm which could improve the accuracy of cluster membership compare to traditional partitional approach only. In this study fuzzy c-means is used in the first step to find partition results. Furthermore divisive algorithms will run on the second step to find sub-clusters and dendogram of phylogenetic tree. To find the best number of clusters is determined using the minimum value of Davies Bouldin Index (DBI) of the cluster results. In this research, the results show that the methods introduced in this paper is better than other partitioning methods. Finally, we found 3 clusters with DBI value of 1.126628 at first step of clustering. Moreover, DBI values after implementing the second step of clustering are always producing smaller IDB values compare to the results of using first step clustering only. This condition indicates that the hybrid approach in this study produce better performance of the cluster results, in term its DBI values. ? 2017 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85017573874

This disease is not only difficult to be cured, but also to be detected and may cause death. For this reason, RF ablation treatment method is proposed to cure cancer. RF ablation therapy is a method in which an applicator is inserted into the body to kill cancer cells by heating the cells. The cancer cells are exposed to the temperature more than 60°C in short duration (few second to few minutes) so thus cell destruction occurs locally. For the sake of the successful treatment, a minimally invasive method is selected in order for perfect local temperature distribution in cancer cells can be achieved. In this paper, a coax-fed dipole-type applicator with interstitial irradiation technique is proposed aimed at RF ablation into hepatic cells. Numerical simulation is performed to obtain a suitable geometric dimension at operating frequency around 2.45 GHz, in order to localize the ablation area. The proposed applicator is inserted into a simple phantom representing an adult human body model in which normal and cancerous liver cells. The simulated results show that the proposed applicator is able to operate at center frequency of 2.355 GHz with blood droplet-type ablation zone and the temperature around the cancer cell by 60°C can be achieved. ? 2017 Author(s).",Ablation zone; applicator; coax-fed dipole-type; hepatic cancer; RF ablation,,2-s2.0-85016057400

A history of illicit drug use did not affect SFR or pH, since both groups had normal SFR and salivary pH. However, it may have affected salivary buffering capacity, as suggested by relatively low buffering capacity in both groups. ? 2017, University of Dicle.",Recovering drugs user; Salivary profile,,2-s2.0-85050217647

Yet, many elderly ESRD patients undergo dialysis, partly due to physicians’ recommendations regarding treatment choice. This study aims to elucidate the factors that influence these recommendations. Methods We surveyed a convenience sample of physicians who attended the 9th Asian Forum of Chronic Kidney Disease Initiative conference. We used vignettes that vary by age and comorbidity status, and asked physicians to recommend dialysis or CM for a hypothetical patient with that profile and to predict survival with both treatment options. We also compared the physician's recommendations to patients for what they would recommend for themselves if they were diagnosed with ESRD. Results On average, physicians believed that dialysis extends life relative to CM. Yet, a large subset believed that CM confers greater survival. Estimates range from 17.3% (for a 65-year-old with diabetes and CHF) to 50% for patients with advanced cancer. Results further reveal high discordance regarding treatment recommendations. For a 65-year-old patient with diabetes, 62% recommended dialysis and 38% did not. For advanced cancer, the split was 25% and 75%. Physicians were far more likely to recommend dialysis for themselves than for their patients. Discussion This study suggests that physicians would benefit from a greater understanding of survival benefits of dialysis and CM for elderly patients with different comorbidity profiles. This would allow patients to make more informed decisions. ? 2016 International Society of Nephrology",comorbidities; conservative management; dialysis; end-stage renal disease; survival benefits; treatment recommendation,,2-s2.0-85020644939

Thus, a fast and accurate method in diagnosing pulmonary TB (PTB) is needed, especially in adult smear-negative-TB cases. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of a novel scoring system (Aziza’s score) using clinical data and characteristic abnormalities that are found in the limited slice non-enhanced thoracic CT. Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study. A limited slice non-enhanced thoracic CT was performed to establish a diagnosis of PTB in patients with suspected PTB and to assess the diagnostic value of the scoring system. A reference standard used in this study was the clinical expertise of two pulmonologists. The scoring system was analyzed using bivariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results: 84 of 130 suspected PTB patients were diagnosed as PTB. They were diagnosed based on pulmonary characteristic abnormalities that were found in the limited slice non-enhanced thoracic CT. The scoring system was analyzed using bivariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The total scores which were equal to or more than 29 could diagnose PTB with the accuracy of 96.1% (95% CIs=91.3–98.3), sensitivity of 96.5% (95% CIs=90.1–98.8), and specificity of 95.6% (95% CIs=90.1–98.8), This novel scoring method was name as an Aziza’s scoring system.

This may be the case in different countries in Eastern Asia. The aim of this study was to determine and understand the differences in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of IBD between Japan and the rest of Asian countries (ROA). Methods: Questionnaires with regard to clinical practice in IBD were distributed to members of the International Gastroenterology Consensus Symposium Study Group. The responders were allowed to select multiple items for each question, as multiple modalities are frequently utilized in the diagnosis and the management of IBD. Dependency and independency of selected items for each question were evaluated by the Bayesian network analysis. Results: The selected diagnostic modalities were not very different between Japan and ROA, except for those related to small bowel investigations. Balloon-assisted enteroscopy and small bowel follow through are frequently used in Japan, while CT/MR enterography is popular in ROA. Therapeutic modalities for IBD depend on availability of such modalities in clinical practice. As far as modalities commonly available in both regions are concerned, there seemed to be similarity in the selection of each therapeutic modality. However, evaluation of dependency of separate therapeutic modalities by Bayesian network analysis disclosed some difference in therapeutic strategies between Japan and ROA. Conclusion: Although selected modalities showed some similarity, Bayesian network analysis elicited certain differences in the clinical approaches combining multiple modalities in various aspects of IBD between Japan and ROA. ? 2016 S.

The aim of this study to investigate the impact of PIH on fetal growth. Methods: A longitudinal cross-sectional study was conducted by 2,076 obstetric patients registered in the book of delivery emergency room BLUD RSUD Ende/ Ende hospital from September 1st 2014 to August 31st 2015. Pregnancy-induced hypertension was classified into gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and severe preeclampsia. Categorical comparative chi-square continued by logistic regression analysis were performed to examine the effect of PIH to infants' growth outcome. Results: Women with preeclampsia had higher number of preterm delivery (26.7%). Infants born from preeclamptic women had lower birth weight (median 2,575 gram; p<0.001), birth length (median 49 cm; p<0.001), and also head circumference (median 32 cm; p<0.001). Severe preeclampsia contributed statistically significance to SGA (OR=1.90; 95% CI=1.20-3.01; adjusted OR=1.91; 95% CI=1.20-3.01) and LGA (OR=2.70; 95% CI=1.00-7.29; adjusted OR=2.92; 95% CI=1.07-8.00). Based on birth weight independent of gestational age, severe preeclampsia had an impact to VLBW (OR=11.45; 95% CI=2.77-47.38; adjusted OR=8.68; 95% CI=1.57-48.04) and LBW (OR=6.57; 95% CI=4.01-10.79; adjusted OR=5.71; 95% CI=3.33-9.78) where it showed statistical significance. Conclusion: PIH women who had SGA or VLBL or LBW infants were caused by the hypoperfusion model as the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Meanwhile, LGA infants born by preeclamptic women were due to the compensation of the decrease from uteroplacental perfusion or other diseases such as obese mother or gestational.diabetes mellitus. ? 2016 Authors.",Fetal growth; Pregnancy-induced hypertension,,2-s2.0-84983526963

The mortality rate of typhoid disease in Indonesia is increasing. The most common detection method currently used is serological test. However, this method is often resulted in less accurate, less sensitive and specific detection. The previous research has successfully discovered fim-C-S. typhi gene which is able to code protein to contribute in adherent or colonization in human epithelial cell. The information of fim-C-S. typhi gene is used to develop more specific and more accurate detection method for S. typhi bacteria by amplification, characterization, specificity and sensitivity assay, and continue with clinical assay. The PCR result was the amplified 0.2 kilo base (kb) DNA fragment using the fimbriae-C-S. typhi primer pairs. The specificity assay was conducted by comparing the amplicon in size of 0.2 kb S. typhi with Gram negative bacteria genome with similar characteristics. The results indicated the fimbriae-C-S. typhi primers can differentiate amplicon in size of 0.2 kb S. typhi against Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia, Vibrio cholera, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, they cannot differentiate S. typhimurium which have higher homology in their genome. Sensitivity assay was conducted by determining the detection level of fim-C-S. typhi primers to S. typhi genome. The sensitivity assay showed the detected fimbriae-C primers S. typhi with 1.295 × 10-39 μg/mL DNA chromosome. The clinical assay was evaluated by comparing the PCR product of suspected patient blood, the isolated bacteria S. typhi genome served as positive control, and uninfected human blood as negative control. The PCR product from 10 suspected patient bloods showed the band size 0.2 kb equals to the size of band produced by the PCR product from isolated S. typhi bacteria genome. Meanwhile, the band was not detected in the uninfected blood. Band size 0.2 kb from the suspected patient blood sample indicated positive infection of S. typhi bacteria. The above results demonstrated the developed clinical detection for typhoid disease using fimbriae-C-S. typhi primer pairs. ? 2016 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-84984549260

However in developing countries, reflective practice is in its infancy. Aim: To introduce reflective practice to postgraduate students in an Indonesian nursing education institution. This paper presents the positive meanings of reflection and reflective practice experienced by the students and the way they used reflection within their practice. Design: A descriptive qualitative study was conducted to explore the meaning of reflection or reflective practice using flashcards. Method: A clinical reflective practice model taking into consideration Indonesian culture was developed and applied during students' clinical placement. A few weeks post clinical placement, 21 students participated in an evaluation session. The meaning of reflection or reflective practice was explored using flash cards containing images of people and environment with different situations and events. Students were asked to choose a card that represented their viewpoints about reflective practice and share it with the group. Data were digitally captured and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Reflection provided a positive experience for the students. In their own words, they discussed their journey of using reflection during the clinical placement period. The use of reflection was identified as expanding their view of nursing practice, providing a safe place to explore their experiences and clarity when they encountered challenging situations during their clinical practice. Reflecting on practice experiences resulted in increased self-awareness, and enhanced their learning. Conclusion: The findings indicate that reflective practice can be implemented successfully in Indonesia and may have value for other Eastern countries that share similar cultural characteristics.

Mesenchymal stem cell is the answer of complicated medicine problems, including orthopaedic. Bone marrow is still the main source. Because of limited source, invasive procedure, pain, and relative less cell, adipose will be a promising source with equal regenerating and differentiating ability. Along with increasing life expectancy, geriatric population is increasing as well as the potential need for stem cell application. Yet there is still controversy about stem cell quality in aging. Methods.This study was conducted in Stem Cell Medical Technology Integrated Service Unit Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, October 2015 - March 2016. 12 patients were divided into 3 age group; 15-30 year, 31-40 year, and 41- 55 year. Bone marrow from posterior iliac crest and adipose tissue were collected, mesenchymal stem cell isolation and culture were done subsequently. Biological characterization, Population Doubling Time, osteogenic differentiation, and alizarin red assaywere carried out. All data was analyzed using SPSS 20. Results. No significant difference was observed in biological characteristic and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow and adipose mesenchymal stem cell among age group (p>0.05). There is significant difference in Population Doubling time in31-40 year group(p=0.000) and 41-55 year group(p=0.000). Conclusions. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell had steady biological characteristic, Population Doubling Time, and osteogenic differentiation. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell had increasing population doubling time in increasing age, apart from biological characteristic and osteogenic differentiation. Adipose could be the source of choice in harvesting mesenchymal stem cell at any age. ? 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

Methods: The modified apoptin gene was optimized using an Integrated DNA Technology (IDT). The gene (606 bp) then ordered and synthesized by Eurofins. The apoptin gene was expressed using E. coli BL21 CodonPlus as host, in cultivation temperature of 37 °C, and 25 °C and purified using Ni-NTA agarose beads. The addition of (His)6 tag enabled the apoptin to be purified in only one step by using nickel column. The expression and purification data analyzed qualitatively as well as quantitatively using SDS-PAGE. MTT assay was used to identify the antitumor effect of octa arginine-apoptin to two kinds of cancer cells, cervix HeLa cancer cell and colon Widr cancer cell. The viability of cell was analyzed when the cell incubated in the variation concentration protein for 72 h. Results: The constructed apoptin gene were expressed in E. coli successfully.

The use of DNA vaccines awakens the somatic cells of the host to produce antigens that will assist the body to prepare to fight infections through preventive measures triggered by the vaccines. These biological inventions have assisted in controlling diseases as well as eliminating some health conditions. Scientific analyses have shown how the plasmid DNA could trigger an artificial immune response in living organisms when associated with the antigens that are plasmidencoded. Such revelations have demonstrated that this invention has a possible therapeutic application as vaccination to prevent numerous pathogens and their related infections. This paper reviews the concept of DNA vaccination and its effects on embryogenesis. The paper first discusses an overview of DNA vaccines and relates it to the production and expression processes. The effects on embryo development have also been described. This review also explains the advantages and disadvantages related to DNA vaccines’ administration and the mechanisms employed to enhance plasmid effectiveness. ? 2016 Ria Margiana.,Antibodies; DNA Vaccination; Embryogenesis; Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and antigen presenting cells (APC); Transfection,,2-s2.0-84979020305

The recently developed medication for HF is still incapable of reducing its morbidity and mortality, and clinical data supporting the efficacy and safety of its mainstay therapy remain insufficient. Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) plays important roles in circulatory and water homeostasis, one of which is water retention through the V2 receptor. In patients with HF, there is an increased level of AVP, contributing to such symptoms as edema, dyspnea, and congestion. Tolvaptan as a selective V2 receptor antagonist, in addition to the conventional therapy, has been shown to cause an increase in net fluid loss, a decrease in body weight, and a reduction in the rate of HF exacerbation. Such evidence has been provided by the Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist (ACTIV) in Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan (EVEREST), Acute Heart Failure Volume Control Multicenter Randomized (AVCMA), and Study of Ascending Levels of Tolvaptan in hyponatremia 1and 2 (SALT-1 and SALT-2) trials.

The RFID offers a better identification system compared to a barcode scanning system due to its simple contact method to the receiver, its storage media, and good accuracy and reliability. In addition, body-centric wireless communications systems (BWCS) have received a great attention recently since their numerous applications including in combination with low rate wireless personal area (LR-WPAN)/Zigbee technology for medical data monitoring system. This paper presents a design of planar loop antenna for wearable health monitoring device aiming at BWCS applications. According to the calculated link budget, the antenna is set to operate at the center frequency 924 MHz, with the gain more than -35 dBi and wide beamwidth pattern in horizontal-plane. The antenna is put in the vicinity of the human body by about 2-mm from the human body surface. The antenna is numerically analyzed in the proximity to a three-layer phantom model, a voxel human body model and homogeneous muscle-equivalent model. As the result of simulation, the antenna performance shows 1.005 of VSWR, minimum gain by -22.18 dBi on axial-plane and -24.74 dBi on sagittal-plane (0?El?180°) at 924 MHz. The measurement is conducted to validate the simulation results by using a muscle-equivalent semi-solid phantom. The measured results tend to show good agreement with the simulation especially in terms of reflection coefficient and radiation pattern. ? 2015 IEEE.",Body-Centric Wireless Communication System; Health Monitoring Device; Numerical Phantom; Planar Loop Antenna; RFID; Zigbee,Biomedical engineering; Budget control; Digital storage; Directional patterns (antenna); Health; Loop antennas; Mobile antennas; Muscle; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Scanning antennas; Wearable antennas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Zigbee; Antenna performance; Body-centric wireless communications; Health monitoring devices; Healthcare industry; Human body modeling; Numerical phantoms; Wireless personal area; Wireless technologies; Monitoring,2-s2.0-84962812188

The aim of this study was to analyze phylogenetically E6 and E7 genes and proteins of HPV16 from Indonesia and predict the effects of single amino acid substitution on protein function. This analysis could be used to reduce time, effort, and research cost as initial screening in selection of protein or isolates to be tested in vitro or in vivo. Methods: In this study, E6 and E7 gene sequences were obtained from 12 samples of Indonesian isolates, which were compared with HPV16R (prototype) and 6 standard isolates in the category of European (E), Asian (As), Asian- American (AA), African-1 (Af-1), African-2 (Af-2), and North American (NA) branch from Genbank. Bioedit v.7.0.0 was used to analyze the composition and substitution of single amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of E6 and E7 genes and proteins was performed using Clustal X (1.81) and NJPLOT softwares. Effects of single amino acid substitutions on protein function of E6 and E7 were analysed by SNAP. Results: Java variants and isolate ui66* belonged to European branch, while the others belonged to Asian and African branches. Twelve changes of amino acids were found in E6 and one in E7 proteins. SNAP analysis showed two non neutral mutations, i.e. R10I and C63G in E6 proteins. R10I mutations were found in Af-2 genotype (AF472509) and Indonesian isolates (Af2*), while C63G mutation was found only in Af2*. Conclusion: E6 proteins of HPV16 variants were more variable than E7.

The objective of this study is to obtain an acetogenin-rich fraction, containing mainly annonacin, known to be present in the highest amount in soursop leaves. Solvents with various polarities (ethyl acetate, hexane, chloroform, ethanol, water) and their mixtures were used in the extraction, fractionation, and isolation steps. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the isolate sample showed that annonacin, having a molecular mass of 597.23, is the dominant acetogenin present. The amount of acetogenin isolated from the soursop leaf samples was 242 mg/g, based on the total lactone determination using the Kedde reagent. The cytotoxicity activity of the isolate sample was determined using the brine shrimp test. This study shows that there is a positive correlation between lactone content due to acetogenins and the level of cytotoxicity in the fractions obtained. The low LC50 value of 1 ppm showed a significant cytotoxicity of the ethyl acetate fraction obtained, higher than cytotoxicity of cancer drug cyclophosphamide. High lactone content and a high cytotoxicity of the ethyl acetate fraction indicate the potential of A. muricata leaves as the source of bioactive compounds for anti-cancer treatment. ?

The objective of the study was to find the correlation between food ingredients storage before they were prepared and cooked and the storage of leftover or unprocessed ingredients in canteens or cafeterias throughout a campus in a university located in Depok, West Java, Indonesia. The design of the study was a cross-sectional conducted in 2010. Food counters in the campus became subjects of the study and the entire food handlers totaling 173 persons became the respondents representing all food the sold. Laboratory examination performed on the sample of dishes served in the canteens or cafeterias to find out the Most Probable Number (MPN) of E. coli. As it turned out, more than half of the dishes sampled or around 59.54% contaminated with E. coli. The factor most closely linked to the contamination was the method for storing the leftover or unprocessed ingredient which consisted of poultry and 40 other types of leftover or unprocessed ingredients while the unprocessed poultry was properly stored and protected from E. coli contamination and during preparation and when served as dishes. Unfortunately, the other 40 types of unprocessed ingredients were facing a risk nine times higher to E. coli contamination during storage and therefore they still carried the risk when served as dishes in the cafeterias. The management of the campus's cafeterias should coordinate with the local Health Office and all food handlers involved in food preparation to improve and enhance the safety system of all the food stored, prepared and served in canteens and cafeterias through out the campus. ?

Eye is one of the important organs used to screen various diseases such as diabetes, pterygium, glaucoma, stroke and etc. Two popular modalities to capture the visualization information of the eyes are photographed and fundus images. Photographed image captures the exterior appearance of the eyes, while fundus image captures the interior surface of the eye. This study focuses on the fundus image, in which the objective is to extract the retinal blood vessels. Condition of the vessels is a good cue for identifying microaneurysm where a sudden jump in vessels trajectory indicate a blockage in the blood flow. Hence, an edge operator is used to extract the possible lines. Two removal steps, which are outer ring and optic disc removal are performed, so that only the vessels are detected. A filling operation is performed by using gaussian kernel such that areas surrounding existing edges are analyzed to label it as blood vessel or not. The proposed technique is then tested on two databases; DRIVE and STARE. Four performance metrics are calculated based on accuracy, sensitivity, error and specificity where the best results are 0.880, 0.546, 0.120 and 0.912 respectively, obtained based on DRIVE database. The proposed system also works well in STARE database with accuracy of 0.860 and error of 0.140. The system can be further improved by using better detection scheme because the number of false negative is relatively high. ? 2015, Asian Research Publishing Network.

Methods: This was a cross sectional study with control group. Case was defined as adolescents with antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia without any mental retardation or other physical illnesses (n=45). The control group consisted of healthy and age-matched adolescents (n=135). Executive function is determined by using Indonesian version of Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-Indonesian version). We used SPSS 16.0 program for windows to calculate the prevalence risk ratio (PRR) and set up the p value <0.05. Results: Mean of age was 16.27 (standard deviation 1.86) year-old. Most of the case group (95%) has been treated with atypical antipsychotic such as risperidone, aripipripazole, olanzapine, and clozapine. Duration of having antipsychotic medication was ranged from one to 36 months. Adolescents with antipsychotic treated-schizophrenia had higher BRIEF T-score, except for inhibit scale, shift scale and behavior regulation index. The prevalence risk ratio on several clinical scales were higher in children with antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia compared to control group, such as on emotional state (PRR=7.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.38-23.15), initiate scale (PRR=6.32, 95% CI=2.51-15.95), monitor scale (PRR=8.11, 95% CI=2.0-32.86), and behavior regulation index (PRR=4.09, 95% CI=1.05-15.98). Conclusion: In general, the results showed that adolescents with atypical antipsychotic treated-schizophrenia had higher BRIEF T-score compared, and comparable with their normal group control.

This is a prospective, single center, randomized trial comparing EES (n=75) and CoCr stent (n=75) implantation in patients with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Intravenous eptifibatide administration was mandatory by protocol in this pilot study. The primary efficacy endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days, defined as the composite of death, reinfarction, and target vessel revascularization. Secondary safety endpoints were stent thrombosis at 30 days and in-hospital bleeding event. Acute reperfusion parameters were also assessed. One-month MACE rate did not differ between EES and CoCr group (1.3 vs. 1.3%, p=1.0). No stent thrombosis cases were observed in the EES group. The groups did not differ with respect to in-hospital bleeding events (5 vs. 9%, p=0.37), achievement of final thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow 2 or 3 (p=0.21), achievement of myocardial blush grade 2 or 3 (p=0.45), creatine kinase-MB level at 8 to 12 hours after stenting (p=0.29), and left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.21). This pilot study demonstrates that after one-month follow-up, the use of EES is as safe and effective as the use of CoCr stents in patients with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI with routine administration of intravenous eptifibatide. ? 2014 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.",cobalt chromium; eptifibatide; everolimus; primary PCI; STEMI; stent,creatine kinase MB; eptifibatide; everolimus; acute heart infarction; adult; article; bare metal stent; bleeding; blood clot lysis; cardiovascular mortality; clinical effectiveness; continuous infusion; controlled study; device safety; drug eluting stent; female; follow up; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle blood flow; heart muscle reperfusion; heart muscle revascularization; heart reinfarction; human; major clinical study; male; medical device complication; outcome assessment; percutaneous coronary intervention; pilot study; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; stent thrombosis; thrombus aspiration,2-s2.0-84903888127
