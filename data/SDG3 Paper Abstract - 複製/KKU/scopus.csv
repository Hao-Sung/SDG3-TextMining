"Penicillin G sodium as a treatment of otosyphilis with hearing loss",2019,"Otosyphilis is one contributing cause of hearing loss in adult patients. There are limited studies on the treatment regimens of otosyphilis. Penicillin G sodium (PGS) plus additional medications, such as benzathine penicillin and probenecid, is an effective regimen. This study investigated the efficacy of PGS alone for the treatment of otosyphilis. We conducted a retrospective study and included all consecutive patients diagnosed with otosyphilis who received only PGS treatment. The study period was from 2009 to 2013. The PGS treatment regimen was PGS 4 mu intravenously every four hours (24 mu/day) for 14 days. Clinical and audiogram outcomes were evaluated one year after treatment. There were 34 otosyphilis patients that were treated with PGS. After one year of treatment, 18 patients (52.9%) had a clinical improvement and 11 patients (32.4%) had an audiogram improvement. In conclusion, PGS at 24 mu/day for two weeks provided an audiogram improvement one year after treatment in one-third of the patients. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Mung bean-derived protein protects against neurodegeneration and memory impairment in animal model of menopause with obesity",2019,"Background: Menopause related neurodegeneration and memory impairment in obesity condition is increasing. Therefore, the neuroprotectant and cognitive enhancer against the mentioned disorder is required. Objective: In the present study, we aimed to assess the effect of mung bean protein supplement on the neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing effects which was investigated in bilateral ovariectomized (OVX) rats with obesity. Material and Methods: Female Wistar rats, weighing 180 to 200 g, were induced experimental menopause by bilateral ovariectomy and then they were induced obesity with high-fat diet. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats with obesity were fed with a high fat diet (HFD) containing 15% mung bean for 8 weeks. The assessments of spatial memory and biochemical profiles, oxidative stress status and apoptosis in the brain together with the serum lipid profiles were determined at the end of treatment. Results: The results showed that mung bean protein treatment improved spatial memory in Morris water maze test. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the hippocampus of OVX rats with obesity which received mung bean protein were decreased. The density of Bax+ cells decreased, but the density of Bcl+ cells in the hippocampus increased. Conclusion: Therefore, mung bean protein is the potential neuroprotectant and cognitive enhancer. The possible underlying mechanism might occur partly via the improvement of cholinergic function, oxidative stress status, and apoptosis. However, the clinical trial study was still necessary to confirm this effect. ?

"Influence of CYP3A5 and SLCO1B1 polymorphisms on atazanavir/r concentrations in Thai HIV-infected patients",2019,"Aim: To evaluate the influence of genetic polymorphisms on plasma trough concentrations of atazanavir (ATV) and ritonavir (RTV). Patients & methods: The concentration-to-dose ratios were compared between different genotype groups of CYP3A5, ABCB1, SLCO1B1 and NR1I2 in 490 patients. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the association between genetic and clinical factors and log-transformed concentration-to-dose ratio of ATV and RTV. Results: Higher concentrations of ATV and RTV were significantly associated with CYP3A5 6986 GG and SLCO1B1 521 TC or CC. Female patients had significantly higher ATV plasma concentration than male patients. Conclusion: Genetic polymorphisms and gender are factors affecting the variability of ATV and RTV concentrations in the Thai population. Thus, genetic testing is worth considering when atazanavir + low dose ritonavir is prescribed. ? 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.","atazanavir; atazanavir plus ritonavir; cytochrome P450 3A5; genomic DNA; multidrug resistance protein 1; pregnane X receptor; ritonavir; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1; ABCB1 gene; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; CYP3A5 gene; drug blood level; female; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genotype; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; NR1I2 gene; pharmacogenetics; sex difference; SLCO1B1 gene; Thai (people); trough concentration"
"Vaccination of hamsters with opisthorchis viverrini extracellular vesicles and vesicle-derived recombinant tetraspanins induces antibodies that block vesicle uptake by cholangiocytes and reduce parasite burden after challenge infection",2019,"Background The liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini infects several million people in Southeast Asia. Adult flukes live in the bile ducts of humans, where they cause hepatobiliary pathology, including cholangiocarcinoma. Here, we investigated the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the fluke and defined recombinant proteins derived from EVs to generate protective immunity in a hamster vaccination-challenge model. Methodology/Principal findings EVs isolated from the excretory-secretory products of O. viverrini and two recombinant EV surface proteins encoding the large extracellular loops (LEL) of Ov-TSP-2 (rOv-TSP-2) and Ov-TSP-3 (rOv-TSP-3) were adjuvanted and used to vaccinate hamsters intraperitoneally followed by challenge infection with O. viverrini metacercariae. The number of adult flukes recovered from hamsters immunized with EVs, rOv-TSP-2, rOv-TSP-3 and rOv-TSP-2 +rOv-TSP-3 were significantly reduced compared to control animals vaccinated with adjuvant alone. The number of eggs per gram feces was also significantly reduced in hamsters vaccinated with rOv-TSP-2 compared to controls, but no significant differences were found in the other groups. The average length of worms recovered from hamsters vaccinated with EVs, rOv-TSP-2 and rOv-TSP-3 was significantly shorter than that of worms recovered from the control group. Anti-EV IgG levels in serum and bile were significantly higher in hamsters vaccinated with EVs compared to control hamsters both pre-and post-challenge. In addition, levels of anti-rOv-TSP antibodies in the serum and bile were significantly higher than control hamsters both pre-and post-challenge. Finally, antibodies against rOv-TSP-2 and rOv-TSP-3 blocked uptake of EVs by human primary cholangiocyte in vitro, providing a plausible mechanism by which these vaccines exert partial efficacy and reduce the intensity of O. viverrini infection. Conclusion/Significance Liver fluke EVs and recombinant tetraspanins derived from the EV surface when administered to hamsters induce antibody responses that block EV uptake by target bile duct cells and exert partial efficacy and against O. viverrini challenge. ? 2019 Chaiyadet et al.","immunoglobulin G; immunological adjuvant; membrane protein; recombinant protein; recombinant tetraspanin; recombinant vaccine; tetraspanin; thrombospondin; thrombospondin 2; thrombospondin 3; unclassified drug; immunoglobulin G antibody; membrane protein; tetraspanin; helminth antibody; helminth protein; tetraspanin; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody production; Article; cholangiocyte; confocal microscopy; controlled study; drug mechanism; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exosome; fecal egg count; growth retardation; hamster; human; male; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis viverrini; parasite load; stunting; ultracentrifugation; vaccination; virus cell interaction; virus entry; virus isolation; Western blotting; animal cell; blood sampling; body height; cholangiocyte; coculture; density gradient centrifugation; enzyme linked immunospot assay; exosome; immunization; metacercaria; microscopy; opisthorchiasis; parasite load; plasmid; animal; female; immunology; Mesocricetus; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; parasitology; physiology; vaccination; Animals; Antibodies, Helminth; Cricetinae; Extracellular Vesicles; Female; Helminth Proteins; Humans; Male; Mesocricetus; Opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; Tetraspanins; Vaccination"
"Dietary patterns and their association with the components of metabolic syndrome: A cross-sectional study of adults from northeast Thailand [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]",2019,"Background: Nutritional transition influences a shift in eating behaviour that is associated with a rise in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises a set of NCD risk factors. This study aimed to investigate dietary patterns and to determine the relationship between dietary patterns and MetS and its components. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 468 adults aged 35–60 years who were residents of a semi-urban district of one of the central provinces in the northeast of Thailand. A factor analysis identified dietary patterns based on the consumption of 21 food groups, which were assessed by using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. MetS was identified by using the harmonized criteria that were stipulated by six leading international organisations. The association between dietary patterns and MetS and its components were evaluated by multiple logistic regressions. The confounding factors adjusted in the model were age, sex, smoking status, physical activity, and medication intake. Results: Two dietary patterns were identified: a traditional pattern characterised by high intakes of sticky rice and animal source foods; a mixed pattern included high intakes of white rice and a variety of food groups. The two dietary patterns did not show any association with MetS. Participants in the highest tertile of the traditional pattern was significantly related to high triglycerides (adjusted OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.10–2.88), in comparison to those from the lowest tertile, whereas participants in the highest tertile of the mixed pattern was inversely associated with abdominal obesity (adjusted OR= 0.49, 95% CI: 0.30–0.81) than those in the lowest tertile. Conclusions: Adherence to a traditional dietary pattern among the northeast Thai adults, in the context of nutrition transition, was associated with high triglyceride levels while the mixed dietary pattern was inversely related to abdominal obesity. ? 2019 Chupanit P et al.","triacylglycerol; abdominal obesity; adult; age; Article; cross-sectional study; dietary pattern; disease association; drug use; female; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; gender; human; male; metabolic syndrome X; physical activity; smoking; suburban population; Thailand; triacylglycerol blood level; diet; feeding behavior; food preference; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; pathophysiology; prevalence; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Preferences; Humans; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Thailand"
"Molecular detection of Leucocytozoon (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida) in black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) from Thailand",2019,"Information regarding vector-parasite association is necessary for fully understanding the epidemiology of vector borne diseases yet, this information is lacking in the case of Leucocytozoonosis in the Oriental region, despite a high incidence of the disease. In this study, we used a molecular approach based on mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) sequence to detect the parasite, Leucocytozoon, in potential black fly (Simuliidae) vectors in Thailand. A total of 404 wild caught black flies representing six morphological species of two subgenera were examined.- Gomphostilbia (Simulium asakoae complex, S. chumpornense) and Simulium (S. chamlongi, S. nodosum, S. nigrogilvum). Forty-four black fly specimens from two species of the Gomphostilbia were positive for Leucocytozoon. Most (35) of these were found in a village where high numbers of domestic chicken were kept, consistent with the possibility that chickens are a host of Leucocytozoon species found in black flies. Sixteen haplotypes were identified among 44 cyt b sequences. Comparisons of the sequences with previous reports revealed that the 11 haplotypes obtained in this study were identical or very similar to unknown Leucocytozoon found in infected domestic chickens. Four haplotypes are genetically similar to L. schoutedeni and one haplotype is genetically very different from existing cyt b sequences in public database. Our results indicate that two black fly species of the subgenus Gomphostilbia in Thailand are possible vectors of Leucocytozoon transmitted among poultry and wild birds in the country. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","cytochrome b; cytochrome b; detection method; disease incidence; disease vector; fly; host-parasite interaction; poultry; adult; Article; chicken; domestic animal; gene sequence; genetic variability; Haemosporida; haplotype; host parasite interaction; human; Leucocytozoon; Leucocytozoon schoutedeni; microorganism detection; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; Simuliidae; Simulium asakoae complex; Simulium chamlongi; Simulium chumpornense; Simulium nigrogilvum; Simulium nodosum; Thailand; animal; disease carrier; genetics; Haemosporida; isolation and purification; microbiology; Simuliidae; Thailand; Apicomplexa; Aves; Diptera; Gallus gallus; Gomphostilbia; Haemosporida; Leucocytozoon; Simuliidae; Simulium chamlongi; Simulium chumpornense; Simulium nigricoxum; Simulium nigrogilvum; Simulium nodosum; Animals; Chickens; Cytochromes b; Disease Vectors; Haemosporida; Haplotypes; Simuliidae"
"CHAMP+ Thailand: Pilot Randomized Control Trial of a Family-Based Psychosocial Intervention for Perinatally HIV-Infected Early Adolescents",2019,"Within Asia, HIV prevalence is highest in Thailand, including thousands of children and adolescents. Care for children born with HIV [perinatal transmission of HIV (PHIV)] will need to focus on adolescents for the foreseeable future. Thai PHIV adolescents experience significant mental health and psychosocial challenges, including treatment adherence. Yet, few, if any, comprehensive interventions for them exist. CHAMP+, an evidence-based intervention adapted for Thailand, was evaluated with a pilot randomized control trial at four HIV clinics. Eighty-eight dyads of 9- to 14-year-old PHIV young adolescents/caregivers were randomized to CHAMP+ or standard of care (SOC). Eleven cartoon-based sessions were delivered over 6 months. Participants completed baseline, 6-month (postintervention), and 9-month surveys, measuring youth outcomes (e.g., mental health and adherence), contextual factors (e.g., demographics and caregiver factors), and self- and social-regulation factors (e.g., HIV knowledge and youth-caregiver communication). Multi-level modeling to account for clustering within individuals was used to assess longitudinal changes within and between groups. All families randomized to CHAMP+ completed the intervention. Although the study was not statistically powered to detect differences in treatment effects, the CHAMP+ group significantly improved at 6 months in youth mental health and adherence, HIV knowledge, youth-caregiver communication, internalized stigma, and HIV-related social support, with most improvements sustained at 9 months and significantly better improvements than the SOC group on a number of outcomes. High levels of baseline viral suppression highlight the importance of reaching these young PHIV adolescents at a period of lower risk before adherence and other challenges emerge. Designed to be delivered with limited cost/resources, CHAMP+ Thailand holds scale-up potential. ?

"Toe flexor strength is not related to postural stability during static upright standing in healthy young individuals",2019,"Background: The human foot has adapted specifically to support body weight when standing upright. At the base of the postural control system, the unique arch structure of the foot still has an uncertain role in human upright standing. Because the toe flexor muscles help to support the foot arches, they might be an important contributor to postural stability. However, no research has identified the influence of the toe flexor strength or the foot arch height on postural stability in static upright standing. Research question: The aim of this study was to examine whether the toe flexor strength and the foot arch height were related to postural stability in static standing in healthy young individuals. Methods: Fifty healthy young individuals were recruited into this cross-sectional study. Toe flexor strength was measured using a toe grip dynamometer, and it was normalised by body mass (rTFS). Foot arch height was assessed as the distance between the navicular tuberosity of the foot and the floor, and it was normalised by height (rFAH). Postural stability was evaluated using the path of the centre of pressure (COP) during double-leg standing with eyes open and single-leg standing with eyes open. Results: rTFS and rFAH were 2.6 ± 0.8 N/kg and 2.8 ± 0.4%, respectively, and they were not significantly correlated (r = 0.094), indicating that they were independent variables. The results of Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that any body size related variables (height, body mass, BMI) were not significantly correlated with COP variables under either double-leg or single-leg standing, rTFS was not significantly correlated with COP variables under either double-leg or single-leg standing and rFAH was not significantly correlated with COP variables under double-leg standing. Significance: Toe flexor strength has no significant role in maintaining postural stability during static upright standing. ? 2019","adult; Article; body equilibrium; body height; body mass; body size; body weight; clinical article; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; dynamometry; female; fitness; foot; foot arch height; hamstring muscle; human; human experiment; male; medical history; muscle strength; navicular bone; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; sex difference; standing; toe; toe flexor strength; triceps surae muscle; walking; young adult; muscle strength; normal human; physiology; skeletal muscle; toe; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Foot; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Postural Balance; Standing Position; Toes; Young Adult"
"Validation of the Thai version of the family reported outcome measure (FROM-16)? to assess the impact of disease on the partner or family members of patients with cancer",2019,"Background: Cancer not only impairs a patient's physical and psychosocial functional behaviour, but also contributes to negative impact on family members' health related quality of life. Currently, there is an absence of a relevant tool in Thai with which to measure such impact. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the Family Reported Outcome Measure (FROM-16) in Thai cancer patients' family members. Methods: Thai version of FROM-16 was generated by interactive forward-backward translation process following standard guidelines. This was tested for psychometric properties including reliability and validity, namely content validity, concurrent validity, known group validity, internal consistency, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Construct validity was examined by comparing the Thai FROM-16 version with the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Results: The internal consistency reliability was strong (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86). A Negative moderate correlation between the Thai FROM-16 and WHOQOL-BREF-THAI was observed (r = - 0.4545, p < 0.00), and known group validity was proved by a statistically significant higher score in family members with high burden of care and insufficient income. The factor analysis supported both 3-factor and 2-factor loading model with slight difference when compared with the original version. Conclusions: The Thai FROM-16 showed good reliability and validity in Thai family members of patients with cancer. A slight difference in factor analysis results compared to the original version could be due to cross-culture application. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; clinical assessment; concurrent validity; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; content validity; controlled study; correlation analysis; cultural anthropology; disease burden; exploratory factor analysis; family; family reported outcome measure; female; health care; human; income; intermethod comparison; internal consistency; known group validity; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; outcome assessment; psychometry; quality of life; quality of life assessment; reliability; scoring system; Thailand; validation study; validity; young adult; neoplasm; patient-reported outcome; psychology; questionnaire; reproducibility; standards; translating (language); Adult; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thailand; Translating"
"Force-generating capacity of the toe flexor muscles?and dynamic function of the foot arch in upright standing",2019,"The muscle and tendon complex of the foot helps to support the foot arch and generates the muscle force of the foot. The present study investigated the force-generating capacity of the toe flexor muscles and the dynamic function of the foot arch when standing upright, and the relationships between these indices. The maximum toe flexor force and foot arch height in the sitting and standing positions were studied in the left and right feet of 224 healthy young individuals. To measure the maximum isometric force of the toe flexor muscles, the subjects exerted maximum force on a toe grip dynamometer. Measurements were repeated three times with at least a 1-min rest period between bouts, and the maximum value among the measurements for each foot was used for further analysis. The absolute value of the toe flexor strength was normalised by body mass. The foot arch height was measured the distance between the tuberosity of the navicular bone and the floor, and normalised by height. The relative foot arch height difference between the sitting and standing positions was evaluated as the foot arch dynamics. The maximum isometric toe flexor strength was 42% higher in the standing position than in the sitting position. There was no relationship between the relative toe flexor strength and the relative foot arch height in either the sitting or standing positions; however, the relative increase in toe flexor strength from sitting to standing (the force amplification factor) was related to the foot arch dynamics, and the flexible foot arch showed a greater increase in the toe flexor strength from sitting to standing compared with the strength in the stiff foot arch. The results of this study suggest that the force-generating capacity of the toe flexor muscles is augmented by bodyweight bearing in upright standing. Additionally, the force amplification mechanism is mechanically regulated by the dynamic function of the foot arch in conjunction with the stretching of the muscle–tendon complex of the foot. ? 2019 Anatomical Society","adult; Article; body mass; controlled study; dynamics; female; flexor muscle; foot arch; force generating capacity; human; human experiment; isometrics; male; muscle strength; musculoskeletal system parameters; navicular bone; normal human; priority journal; sitting; standing; toe flexor muscle; weight bearing"
"Emotional and behavioral resilience among children with perinatally acquired HIV in Thailand and Cambodia",2019,"OBJECTIVES: Psychosocial challenges associated with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) infection are well known, yet many children infected with HIV since birth demonstrate positive outcomes, referred to as resilience. The purpose of this study was to evaluate emotional-behavioral development and identify salient predictors of resilience among long-term survivors of PHIV. DESIGN: Prospective investigation of children with PHIV compared with demographically similar perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) and HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) children, all from Thailand and Cambodia. METHODS: The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; parent version) was administered at baseline and annual follow-up visits (median follow-up of 3 years) to children age 6-14. Resilience was defined as consistent CBCL scores on the Internalizing, Externalizing or Total Problem T scales within normative ranges (T-scores <60) at every time point. Generalized estimating equations examined CBCL scores over time and logistic models examined demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural predictors of resilience. RESULTS: Participants included 448 children (236 PHIV, 98 PHEU, 114 HUU), with median (interquartile range) age at first evaluation of 7 (6-9) years. Children with PHIV exhibited similar rates of resilience as PHEU and HUU on the Externalizing and Total Problems scales. Resilience on the Internalizing scale was more likely in PHEU (71%) compared with PHIV (59%) or HUU (56%), P?=?0.049. Factors associated with resilience in adjusted models included: HIV-exposed but uninfected status, higher household income, Cambodian nationality, female sex, and caregiver type. CONCLUSION: Despite biopsychosocial risks, resilience is observed among PHIV and PHEU children. Further study is needed to understand mechanisms underlying associated factors and intervention priorities.",""
"Factors which affected medical professionalism in internal medicine residents; any differences between the first and last year residents",2019,"Objective: Medical professionalism is one of core competencies for medical students and residents. It may be improved during the residency training. The present study aimed to evaluate if factors affected medical professionalism in internal medicine residents; any differences between the first and last year residents. Materials and Methods: The present study was a cross-sectional study and conducted at Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University. The residents in internal medicine year 1 (PGY1) and year 3 (PGY3) were recruited in the study. All participating residents were informed about medical professionalism by the researchers and provided a self-reported questionnaire regarding factors associated with their medical professionalism in practice. The questionnaire comprised of ten potential factors which affected medical professionalism. The residents were asked to rate each factor by using a range of 0 to 10; while 0 was the least and 10 was the most. Scores of each factor were compared between both groups (PGY1 and PGY3) by descriptive statistics. Results: There were 15 PGY1 and 14 PGY3 participated in the study. Out of 10 factors, there was no significant different between both groups. The PGY1 scored knowledge as the highest score which affected their medical professionalism (9.20/10), while the PGY3 ranged personality and attitude as the most influential factor for medical professionalism (9.07/10).

"The rate of patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease with an optimal low-density cholesterol level: A multicenter study from Thailand",2019,"Background Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events in patients with established atherosclerotic disease (EAD) and in those with multiple risk factors (MRFs). This study aimed to investigate the rate of optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level in a multicenter registry of patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. Methods A multicenter registry of EAD and MRF patients was conducted. Demographic data, medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, anthropometric data, laboratory data, and medications were recorded and analyzed. We classified patients according to target LDL levels based on recommendation by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2011 into Group 1 which is EAD and diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD)-target LDL below 70 mg/dL, and Group 2 which is MRF without diabetes or CKD-target LDL below 100 mg/dL. The rate of optimal LDL level in patients with Group 1 and Group 2 was analyzed and stratified according to the treatment pattern of lipid-lowering medications. Results A total of 3100 patients were included. Of those, 51.7% were male. Average age was 65.8 ± 9.7 years. Average LDL level was 96.3 ± 32.6 mg/dL. A vast majority (92.7%) received statin and 9.3% received ezetimibe. Optimal LDL level was achieved in 20.3% of patients in Group 1 (LDL < 70 mg/dL), and in 46.6% in Group 2 (LDL < 100 mg/dL). The overall rate of optimal LDL control was 23% since 89.6% of study population belongs to Group 1. The rate of optimal LDL was not different between high and low potency statin. Factors that were associated with optimal LDL control were older age, the presence of coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. Conclusions The rates of optimal LDL level were unacceptably low in this study population. As such, a strategy to improve LDL control in high-risk population should be implemented. ?2019 JGC All rights reserved.","atorvastatin; ezetimibe; fluindostatin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; low density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; pitavastatin; pravastatin; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; triacylglycerol; aged; Article; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol level; chronic kidney failure; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; drug potency; female; human; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; major clinical study; male; peripheral occlusive artery disease; Thailand; triacylglycerol blood level; waist circumference"
"Disparities in the impact of overweight on hypertension among Asians: a Japanese and Thai population-based study",2019,"The divergence in cardiovascular disease risk among Asian countries may be related to differences in economics, lifestyles, and cultural backgrounds. We examined the differential association of overweight and hypertension between the high- and middle-income Asian countries, namely Japan and Thailand and extended to compare other cardiovascular risk factors between these two countries, using the data sets from the annual health examinations conducted in 127,152 Japanese (mean age, 41.5 ± 11.1 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 22.4 ± 3.4 kg/m 2 ) and 4243 Thai (mean age, 47.9 ± 10.7 years: mean BMI, 24.0 ± 3.7 kg/m 2 ) aged over 18 years with no history of hypertension treatment. Hypertension was diagnosed as office SBP ? 130 mmHg and/or office DBP ? 80 mmHg. Overweight was defined as BMI ? 25 kg/m 2 . The analysis using the direct standardization method showed a lower prevalence of hypertension in the Japanese than in the Thai population (31.8% vs. 57.3%, P &lt; 0.001). The Japanese population had higher estimated glomerular filtration rate and lower cholesterol level and BMI than in the Thai population (all P &lt; 0.001). The association between overweight and hypertension was observed in both populations regardless of age and sex (all P &lt; 0.05). In the analysis stratified by age and sex, the association between overweight and the presence of hypertension was more prominent in the Japanese population aged &lt;50 years in both sexes compared with the Thai population (all P for interaction &lt; 0.001). These results confirmed the differential impact of overweight on hypertension between the high- and middle-income countries even in the similar regions of Asia. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","adult; age; Article; body mass; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; hypertension; Japanese (people); male; middle aged; obesity; prevalence; race difference; systolic blood pressure; Thai (people)"
"Pneumonia and Risk of Serious Adverse Outcomes in Hospitalized Strokes in Thailand",2019,"Background: The impact of stroke associated pneumonia (SAP) on stroke complications is not well understood; we aimed to study the association between SAP and adverse outcomes including in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay and the risk of developing common serious complications (sepsis, respiratory failure, and convulsions). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from a cohort of 610,668 stroke patients drawn from the Universal Coverage Health Security Scheme (a national insurance database) in Thailand which covers ?80% of the Thai population. Patients were hospitalized between October 2004 and January 2013. Results: Pneumonia was present in 9.6 % (n = 58,586) of patients. Aspiration pneumonia was present in 6.2% (n = 38,060) and nonaspiration pneumonia in 3.4% (n = 20,526). After adjusting for age, sex, stroke type, and comorbidities, patients with SAP had significantly higher odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.90: 2.83-2.96), long length of stay (OR 13.11: 12.83-13.40), sepsis (OR 8.49: 8.22-8.76), respiratory failure (OR 4.37: 4.27-4.48), and convulsions (OR 2.09: 2.00-2.17). On subanalysis, patients with nonaspiration pneumonia were found to have higher odds of adverse outcomes compared to aspiration pneumonia; the corresponding ORs (95% confidence interval) for above outcomes were 1.25 (1.21-1.30), 2.40 (2.32-2.49), 1.34 (1.28-1.40), 1.80 (1.73-1.88), and 1.19 (1.11-1.28), respectively. Conclusions: SAP is associated with higher odds of inpatient mortality, long length of stay, and risk of developing serious stroke complications. Nonaspiration pneumonia is associated with significantly higher likelihood of adverse outcomes compared to aspiration pneumonia in this patient population. Early identification and treatment of SAP is vital in reducing adverse outcomes in acute stroke. ? 2019","aged; aspiration pneumonia; cerebrovascular accident; disease exacerbation; factual database; female; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; length of stay; male; middle aged; mortality; prognosis; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; Thailand; time factor; Aged; Databases, Factual; Disease Progression; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Admission; Pneumonia, Aspiration; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke; Thailand; Time Factors"
"Working hours related to good quality of work life (QoWL) among doctors working in public hospitals in northeastern Thailand",2019,"Objective: Our aims were (1) to assess the maximum working hours per week relating to good QoWL among doctors in public hospitals in northeastern Thailand; and, (2) to assess the factors relating to good QoWL. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in 206 good QoWL doctors and 428 not-good QoWL doctors. The Thai Work-related Quality of Life Scale questionnaire was used (THQoWL). Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regressions were applied and odds ratio with 95% CI presented. Results: Among both the good and not-good QoWL doctors, there were no significant differences vis-a-vis males vs. females, having no underlying disease(s), province worked in, and hospital level (secondary/tertiary). The majority of good QoWL doctors were older than 40, married, working in a university hospital, being a specialist, doing shiftwork (up to 100 h/month), less in working hours per week, and having savings. The majority of not-good QoWL doctors were general practitioners. Maximum working hours of 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 h/week were associated with good QoWL; however, 50 h/week had the strongest association (AOR 3.11, 95% CI: 1.98, 4.88, p<0.001). Other significant related factors were: being in a leadership position; having savings; working at a university hospital; and, doing shift work up to 100 h/month. Conclusion: Working 50 h/week was most strongly associated with good QoWL; thus, to improve the QoWL among doctors working hours should be limited. ?

"Phylogenetic characterization of Salmonella enterica from pig production and humans in Thailand and Laos border provinces",2019,"Background and Aim: The genetic relationship among serotypes of Salmonella enterica from food animals, food of animal origin, and human is of interest as the data could provide an important clue for the source of human infection. This study aimed to determine the genetic relatedness of S. enterica from pig production and human in Thailand–Laos border provinces. Materials and Methods: A total of 195 S. enterica serotypes isolated from pig and pork (n=178) and human (n=17) including four serotypes (Typhimurium, Rissen, Derby, and Stanley) were randomly selected to examine their genetic relatedness using highly conserved sequence of three genes (fim A, man B, and mdh). Results: The results showed that 195 Salmonella isolates of four different serotypes were grouped into five different clusters, and members of the same Salmonella serotypes were found in the same cluster. Salmonella isolated from pig production and human in Thailand–Laos border provinces represented overlapping population and revealed a high degree of similarity, indicating close genetic relationship among the isolates. Conclusion: The results support that the determination of Salmonella serotyping combined with analysis of phylogenetic tree can be used track the clonal evolution and genetic diversity of Salmonella serotypes in different host species.

"Forecasting imbalances of human resources for health in the Thailand health service system: Application of a health demand method",2019,"Background: For an effective health system, human resources for health (HRH) planning should be aligned with health system needs. To provide evidence-based information to support HRH plan and policy, we should develop strategies to quantify health workforce requirements and supply. The aim of this study is to project HRH requirements for the Thai health service system in 2026. HRH included in this study were doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, medical technicians (MTs), physiotherapists (PTs), and Thai traditional medicine (TTM) practitioners. Methods and results: The study mainly relied on the secondary data in relation to service utilization and population projection together with expert opinions. Health demand method was employed to forecast the HRH requirements based on the forecasted service utilizations. The results were then converted into HRH requirements using the staffing norm and productivity. The HRH supply projection was based on the stock and flow approach in which current stock and the flow in and out were taken into account in the projection. The results showed that in 2026, nurses are likely to be in critical shortages. The supply of doctors, pharmacists, and PTs is likely to be surplus. The HRH requirements are likely to match with the supply in cases of dentists, MTs, and TTM practitioners. Conclusion: In 2026, the supply of key professionals is likely to be sufficient except nurses who will be in critical shortages. The health demand method, although facing some limitations, is useful to project HRH requirements in such a situation that people are accessible to health services and future service utilizations are closely linked to current utilization rates. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; article; dentist; forecasting; health care planning; human; nurse; pharmacist; physician; physiotherapist; population projection; productivity; quantitative analysis; Thailand; traditional medicine; workforce; developing country; forecasting; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care planning; health care policy; health service; patient attitude; population growth; procedures; Thailand; Delivery of Health Care; Developing Countries; Forecasting; Health Personnel; Health Planning; Health Policy; Health Services; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services Needs and Demand; Health Workforce; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Population Growth; Thailand"

"A comparison of preferences of elderly patients for end-of-life period and their relatives' perceptions in Thailand",2019,"Background: Goal of palliative care is to experience a good death. Understanding the perceptions of elderly patients and their relatives about this issue should provide healthcare professionals with practical guidance in order to achieve this goal. Objectives: To determine and compare the perceptions of elderly patients and relatives regarding wishes during their end-of-life(EOL) period. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at Siriraj and Srinagarind Hospital in Thailand from September 2017 to February 2018. A questionnaire was given to elderly patients and the relatives of them. The patients were asked to respond to the questions as though they were terminally-ill patients, and relatives were asked to imagine how elderly people would respond to the questions. Results: We recruited 608 elderly patients and 607 relatives. The most important issue in both groups was“receiving the full truth about their illnesses”. The perceptions of the patients and relatives differed significantly in 8/13 areas covered in the questionnaire. Independent factors associated with preference for home death were elderly from Khon Kaen (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.6;95%CI 1.7,4.1), previous self-employed/general work compared to individuals who did not work (AOR 0.5;95%CI 0.3,0.9), low educational level (AOR 2.3;95%CI 1.3,4.0), low income (AOR 1.7;95%CI 1.1,2.5), greater family size (AOR 1.7;95%CI 1.1,2.6) and dissatisfaction in life (AOR 2.5;95%CI 1.1,5.4). Conclusion: Receiving the full truth about their illnesses was the most important issue for participants in both groups. The major differences between the two groups had to do with autonomy. Factors influencing place of death were location of patients, previous occupation, educational level, family income, family size and dissatisfaction in life. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","advance care planning; aged; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; death; family income; family size; female; human; lowest income group; major clinical study; male; palliative therapy; perception; questionnaire; relative; terminally ill patient; Thailand"
"Productivity losses associated with premature mortality due to cancer in Russia: A population-wide study covering 2001–2030",2019,"Aims: Productivity losses related to premature cancer mortality have been assessed for most developed countries but results for Russia are limited to cross-sectional reports. The aim of this study was to quantify productivity costs due to cancer mortality in Russia between 2001 and 2015 and project this to 2030. Methods: Cancer mortality data (2001–2015) were acquired from the State Cancer Registry, whereas population data, labour force participation rates and annual earnings were retrieved from the Federal State Statistics Service. Cancer mortality was projected to 2030 and the human capital approach was applied to estimate productivity losses. Results: The total annual losses increased from US6.5b in 2001–2005 to US$8.1b in 2011–2015, corresponding to 0.24% of the annual gross domestic product. The value is expected to remain high in 2030 (US$7.5b, 0.14% of gross domestic product). Productivity losses per cancer death are predicted to grow faster in women (from US$18,622 to US$22,386) than in men (from US$25,064 to US$28,459). Total losses were found to be highest for breast cancer in women (US$0.6b, 20% of overall losses in women) and lung cancer in men (US$1.2b, 24%). The absolute predicted change of annual losses between 2011–2015 and 2026–2030 was greatest for cervix uteri (+US$214m) in women and for lip, oral and pharyngeal cancers in men (+US$182m). Conclusions: In Russia, productivity losses due to premature cancer mortality are substantial. Given the expected importance especially for potentially preventable cancers, steps to implement effective evidence-based national cancer control policies are urgently required. ?

"Organic anion?transporting polypeptides contribute to the uptake of curcumin and its main metabolites by human breast cancer cells: Impact on antitumor activity",2019,"Curcumin is a natural polyphenolic compound with pronounced anticancer properties, despite its low bioavailability caused by extensive glucuronidation and sulfation. Information on the cellular uptake mechanisms and their contribution to the anticancer effects of curcumin and its biotransformation products is limited. The present study, therefore, investigated the role of organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) in the cellular uptake of curcumin and its major metabolites in OATP-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. The uptake rates for curcumin in OATP1B1-, OATP1B3- and OATP2B1-transfected CHO cells were 2- to 3-fold higher than wild-type cells. Curcumin sulfate was transported by all three OATPs, although to a much lesser extent, while uptake of tetrahydrocurcumin was the highest but only via OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Notably, curcumin glucuronide did not exhibit any affinity for these OATPs. The increased mRNA levels of OATP1B1 in wild-type human breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells compared with OATP1B1 knockdown cells was associated with a higher initial uptake of curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin leading to decreased IC 50 values. In conclusion, our data revealed that OATPs act as cellular uptake transporters for curcumin and its major metabolites, and this may also be applicable to patients undergoing cancer therapy. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Trends of heat-related mortality and association with weather variables in the northeast, Thailand",2019,"Heat-related morbidity and mortality are recognized as public health threat. However, little evidence has been reported for cause-specific mortality from heat. The aims of this study is to explore trends in diseases of heat-related mortality in the northeast among selected specific-cause mortality, in the Northeast Thailand. We used a national database from the Strategy Planning Division, Ministry of Public Health for cause-specific mortality from heat in 4 groups including malignant neoplasm, diseases of the circulatory system, diseases of the respiratory system, diseases of the genitourinary system. Daily weather data provided by the Meteorological Department included temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed for twenty provinces in the northeastern region of Thailand from 2006 to 2015. Joinpoint regression analysis and Poisson regression model was used for estimation the effect of heat on mortality. Results, the trend of annual specific-cause mortality increased with the Annual Percent Change (APC) of 7.74% of Malignant neoplasm, 9.80% for diseases of respiratory system, 12.03% for diseases of the circulatory system and 2.16% for diseases of the genitourinary system. A one-degree Celsius increase with the daily mean temperature was significantly associated with a 16% risk in all included mortalities used as an indicator for heat-related mortality (95% CI IRR= 1.11-1.21, p-value =<0.001), A one-degree Celsius increase in the daily maximum temperature was significantly associated with a 9% decreased risk in the same mortality (95% CI IRR=0.88-0.96, p-value < 0.001). In conclusion, trend analysis showed that heat-related mortality increased significantly during the period. Increased in daily temperature were positively associated with mortality in the northeast of Thailand. This suggested that there is a need to initiate any public health prevention and climate change adaptation from heat as to reduce the adverse effects of heat extremes on health. ? 2019, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment.

"Effects of Gold Nanoparticles with Different Surface Charges on Cellular Internalization and Cytokine Responses in Monocytes",2019,"Surface modification of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) affects the interactions between the AuNPs and biological systems. To use AuNPs in biomedical applications, an investigation of how different surface charges of AuNPs affect the internalization mechanisms and functions of monocytes is needed. In this study, U937 cells were exposed to AuNPs with positive (AuNPs+ve) and negative (AuNPs-ve) surface charges. Cellular responses to the AuNPs, including cell uptake pathways, cell activation and cytokine production, were analysed. The results indicated different responses to AuNPs-ve and AuNPs+ve in outcomes including internalization pathways, cell activation and cytokine production levels. Interestingly, the results suggested that AuNPs+ve tended to enter the cells via macropinocytosis and strongly elicited a cellular response of IL-6 production via NF-kB activation, whereas the AuNPs-ve suppressed IL-6 production. Therefore, these results provide essential information for designing nanoparticles and may contribute to possible future nanomedicine applications, such as drug delivery and vaccination.

"Positive expiratory pressure breathing speeds recovery of postexercise dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",2019,"Objectives: Faster recovery of postexertional dyspnea might enable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients to undertake more physical activity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether breathing with a positive expiratory load to reduce dynamic hyperinflation (DH) would hasten recovery. Methods: Thirteen male COPD patients (59?±?7?years; Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease Stages II and III) took part in a randomized cross-over trial in which they exercised by self-paced spot marching. Interventions at the end of exercise consisted of six breaths against either a 5-cm H2O expiratory load (positive expiratory pressure [PEP]) or no load (Sham), with 3-hr rest between interventions. Recovery was followed for the next 10?min. Primary outcome measures were dyspnea during recovery and inspiratory capacity (IC), measured at rest, at the end of exercise and after the intervention; oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2, heart rate, and breathing frequency were also monitored. Results: Patients exercised for 5?min reaching a heart rate of 70% age-predicted maximum and developed dyspnea of 3–4 on the Modified Borg CR10 scale. Dyspnea recovered significantly faster after the PEP intervention in all patients, taking 2.8?±?0.4?min to return to baseline compared with 5.1?±?0.6?min for Sham (p?&lt;?0.01). IC declined at the end of exercise and was improved by PEP (+270?220–460 ml, median, interquartile range) more than Sham (+100, 40–160?ml). However, PEP was equally effective in reducing dyspnea in all patients irrespective of the degree of DH. Changes in oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2, heart rate, and breathing frequency were similar in PEP and Sham. Conclusions: Positive expiratory pressure breathing is an effective means of reducing postexercise dyspnea and DH in COPD. The benefits were not limited to patients with high DH suggesting PEP may be used to speed recovery and increase the volume of exercise during pulmonary rehabilitation sessions and physical activity at home or work. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","aged; breathing muscle; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; crossover procedure; dyspnea; exercise test; exercise tolerance; female; human; inspiratory capacity; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; positive end expiratory pressure; randomized controlled trial; work of breathing; Aged; Cross-Over Studies; Dyspnea; Exercise Test; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Humans; Inspiratory Capacity; Male; Middle Aged; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiratory Muscles; Work of Breathing"
"Anti-parasitic Drug Ivermectin Exhibits Potent Anticancer Activity against Gemcitabine-resistant Cholangiocarcinoma in Vitro",2019,"Background/aim: The antiparasitic drug, ivermectin (IVM), exerts anticancer activities in diverse cancer types. However, its anticancer activity against cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), especially the drug-resistant phenotype, has not yet been explored. Materials and Methods: IVM was tested for its anticancer activity against gemcitabine-sensitive (KKU214) and gemcitabine-resistant (KKU214GemR) CCA cell lines in vitro using the sulforhodamine B and clonogenic assays as well as cell-cycle analysis. Results: IVM treatment inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation of both KKU214 and KKU214GemR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. KKU214GemR cells were more sensitive than KKU214 to IVM treatment. IVM treatment caused S-phase cell-cycle arrest and also cell death as indicated by an increase of sub-G0/G1 population in KKU214GemR cells treated with IVM for 48 h. Conclusion: IVM exerts anti-CCA activities and gemcitabine-resistant KKU214GemR cells are more sensitive to IVM treatment. Thus, IVM might be useful as an alternative treatment for CCA, especially in patients who do not respond to gemcitabine. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Indocyanine green dye angiography as an adjunct to assess indeterminate burn wounds: A prospective, multicentered, triple-blinded study",2019,"BACKGROUND Clinical assessment of indeterminate burn wounds has been reported to yield poor accuracy, even when performed by burn experts. Indocyanine green (ICG) dye angiography has been found to be highly accurate in assessing burn depth, but there is still limited evidence of its use in indeterminate burn wounds. This study aims to compare the accuracy of ICG angiography to that of clinical assessment in assessing indeterminate burn wounds. METHODS This is a prospective, multicentered, triple-blinded, experimental study. Participants were stable patients, admitted to the hospital with burn wounds of indeterminate depth. The burn wounds were clinically assessed by an attending plastic surgeon. ICG angiography was performed and evaluated by another surgeon. Tissue biopsies were obtained and sent for histological study to be assessed as the gold standard. RESULTS In the 30 burn sites that were assessed, the accuracy of ICG angiography was 100.0%, compared with 50.0% for clinical assessment (p < 0.001). Clinical assessment yielded a sensitivity of 33.3% and specificity of 66.7%, while ICG angiography yielded both a sensitivity and specificity of 100.0%. Therefore, the number needed to treat for using ICG angiography in indeterminate burn wounds was two. CONCLUSION Indocyanine green angiography yields a significantly higher accuracy than clinical assessment in indeterminate burn wounds. This intervention can, thus, be a useful tool to aid clinical judgment. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Self-perceived and Actual Risk of Further Stroke in Patients with Recurrent Stroke or Recurrent Transient Ischemic Attack in Thailand",2019,"Background: The correct perception in patients of their future risk of recurrent stroke may lead to changes in behavior and to successful secondary prevention of stroke. The primary aim was to compare patients’ perceived risk with the actual risk of further stroke. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 2 tertiary hospitals in northeast Thailand. Self-perceived risk of further stroke was assessed by validated questionnaire and categorized as low, medium, or high. Actual risk was calculated using Stroke Prognosis Instrument II which classified patients into 3 risk groups: low, medium, and high. The level of agreement between perceived and actual risk was analyzed using the kappa statistic. Results: One hundred forty patients with recurrent stroke or recurrent transient ischemic attack were enrolled (age 65.6 ± 11.3 years, mean ± standard deviation). Most patients wrongly estimated their risk of further stroke: 43.6% of patients underestimated and nearly one fifth (17.1%) overestimated their risk; the kappa coefficient was.08. Patients with hypertension and diabetes were more likely to underestimate their risk of recurrent stroke. The only characteristic found to be significantly associated with perceived high risk was the level of independence in activities of daily living: patients with Barthel index less than or equal to 60 were more likely to perceive themselves as having high risk for recurrent stroke. Conclusions: Most patients underestimated their risk for further stroke. Implementation of a comprehensive care program to communicate to patients their future risk of stroke and to modify their risk factors is warranted in Thailand. ? 2018","adult; aged; Article; Barthel index; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; diabetes mellitus; disease association; dyslipidemia; educational status; female; heart disease; high risk population; human; hypertension; low risk population; male; patient attitude; priority journal; recurrent disease; self concept; sex difference; Thailand; transient ischemic attack; attitude to health; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; comorbidity; comparative study; convalescence; middle aged; multicenter study; patient; prognosis; psychology; recurrent disease; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; transient ischemic attack; very elderly; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Male; Middle Aged; Patients; Prognosis; Recovery of Function; Recurrence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior; Self Concept; Stroke; Thailand"
"Agreement of tuberculin skin test and quantiFERON?-TB gold-in-tube for screening Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in healthcare workers in a university hospital",2019,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have a high occupational risk for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Common methods of screening for TB infection are the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the agreement of TST and IGRA (QuantiFERON?-TB Gold-In-Tube; QFT-GIT) as applied to HCWs at a large university hospital in northeast of Thailand. Materials and Methods: The study population included the preplacement medical records of new employees who were tested with both TST and QFT-GIT, comprising 212 HCWs. Eligible for data analysis were 197 participants (calculated sample size was 196). SPSS version19.0 was used to analyze Cohen’s kappa coefficient. Results: The samples included 197 HCWs: 63 males (32.0%), 134 females (68.0%), 133 physicians (67.5%) and 64 nurses (32.5%). The mean age was 25.6 years (SD = 3.12). Thirty-eight workers (19.3%) tested positive in the TST and 19 workers (9.6%) were QFT-GIT-positive. The total agreement of TST and QFT-GIT was 88.3 (K = 0.54). Forty workers (20.3%) were positive in at least one test. Conclusion: This study showed moderate agreement of TST and QFT-GIT, which was consistent with the previous studies in high tuberculosis-burden countries (TBC). The authors suggest that pre-placement HCWs in Thailand should be screened for TB infection using the QFT-GIT method. ?

"Accounting for biological variation with linear mixed-effects modelling improves the quality of clinical metabolomics data",2019,"Metabolite profiles from biological samples suffer from both technical variations and subject-specific variants. To improve the quality of metabolomics data, conventional data processing methods can be employed to remove technical variations. These methods do not consider sources of subject variation as separate factors from biological factors of interest. This can be a significant issue when performing quantitative metabolomics in clinical trials or screening for a potential biomarker in early-stage disease, because changes in metabolism or a desired-metabolite signal are small compared to the total metabolite signals. As a result, inter-individual variability can interfere subsequent statistical analyses. Here, we propose an additional data processing step using linear mixed-effects modelling to readjust an individual metabolite signal prior to multivariate analyses. Published clinical metabolomics data was used to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed method. We observed a substantial reduction in variation of each metabolite signal after model fitting. A comparison with other strategies showed that our proposed method contributed to improved classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, we highlight the importance of patient metadata as it contains rich information of subject characteristics, which can be used to model and normalize metabolite abundances. The proposed method is available as an R package lmm2met. ? 2019 The Authors","Biomolecules; Data handling; Diagnosis; Fault tolerant computer systems; Metabolites; Metadata; Natural language processing systems; Biological factors; Linear mixed-effects model; Metabolomics; Multi variate analysis; Subject metadatas; Multivariant analysis; biological marker; adipose tissue; Article; biological variation; clinical trial (topic); colorectal cancer; data processing; female; human; male; metabolomics; metadata; multivariate analysis; priority journal; quality control; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model"
"Childhood cancer incidence and survival in Thailand: A comprehensive population-based registry analysis, 1990–2011",2019,"Background: Southeast Asia is undergoing a transition from infectious to chronic diseases, including a dramatic increase in adult cancers. Childhood cancer research in Thailand has focused predominantly on leukemias and lymphomas or only examined children for a short period of time. This comprehensive multisite study examined childhood cancer incidence and survival rates in Thailand across all International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC) groups over a 20-year period. Methods: Cancer cases diagnosed in children ages 0-19?years (n?=?3574) from 1990 to 2011 were extracted from five provincial population-based Thai registries, covering approximately 10% of the population. Descriptive statistics of the quality of the registries were evaluated. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) were calculated using the Segi world standard population, and relative survival was computed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Changes in incidence and survival were analyzed using Joinpoint Regression and reported as annual percent changes (APC). Results: The ASR of all childhood cancers during the study period was 98.5 per million person-years with 91.0 per million person-years in 1990–2000 and 106.2 per million person-years in 2001–2011. Incidence of all childhood cancers increased significantly (APC?=?1.2%, P?<?0.01). The top three cancer groups were leukemias, brain tumors, and lymphomas. The 5-year survival for all childhood cancers significantly improved from 39.4% in 1990–2000 to 47.2% in 2001–2011 (P?<?0.01). Conclusions: Both childhood cancer incidence and survival rates have increased, suggesting improvement in the health care system as more cases are identified and treated. Analyzing childhood cancer trends in low- and middle-income countries can improve understanding of cancer etiology and pediatric health care disparities. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; adolescent; adult; Article; bone tumor; brain tumor; Burkitt lymphoma; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer registry; cancer survival; carcinoma; child; childhood cancer; childhood leukemia; comparative study; female; follow up; germ cell tumor; gonad tumor; Hodgkin disease; human; infant; kidney tumor; liver tumor; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; medulloblastoma; neuroblastoma; neuroectoderm tumor; newborn; nonhodgkin lymphoma; population research; preschool child; priority journal; retinoblastoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; school child; soft tissue sarcoma; spine tumor; Thailand; young adult; age; incidence; mortality; neoplasm; prognosis; register; survival rate; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mortality; Neoplasms; Prognosis; Registries; Survival Rate; Thailand; Young Adult"
"Impact of coexisting uterine adenomyosis on the survival outcome of patients with endometrial cancer: A retrospective cohort study",2019,"Objective: To determine the effects of uterine adenomyosis on endometrial cancerrecurrence rates. Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed all consecutive patients diagnosed with endometrial cancerwho underwent total hysterectomy-based surgical staging at Srinagarind Hospital between January, 2010 and January, 2016. The patientswere divided into two groups:a uterine adenomyosisgroup and a non-adenomyosis group. Patient demographics, type of surgery, histopathology, stage of endometrial cancer, adjuvant treatment, and survival outcomes were compared. Results: A total 350 patients were enrolled, with 132 (37.71%) in the adenomyosis group and 218 (62.29%) in the nonadenomyosis group. Deep myometrial invasion and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) were more commonly found among patients who had no adenomyosis compared to those with adenomyosis(52.8% vs 39.4%, P=0.02 and 53.2% vs. 38.6%, P=0.01). There were no significant differences in terms of five-year recurrence-free survival (HR=1.47; 95%CI 0.88-2.44) and five-year overall survival (HR=0.81; 95%CI 0.43-1.53) between the two comparison groups. Conclusion: Coexisting uterine adenomyosis in endometrial cancer wasassociated withdeep myometrial invasion and LVSI but did not have significant impact on survival. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.","adenomyosis; adult; aged; complication; endometrium tumor; female; follow up; human; middle aged; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; prognosis; retrospective study; survival rate; uterus cancer; very elderly; Adenomyosis; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Combined Modality Therapy; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Uterine Neoplasms"
"Cervical cancer in women with squamous cell carcinoma cytology",2019,"Objective: To determine the rate of cervical cancer among women with squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) cytology, as well as its associated risk factors. The results were pooled with previously reported findings. Materials and Methods: The authors reviewed data regarding women with SCCA cytology that underwent colposcopy at Khon Kaen University’s Srinagarind Hospital between October 2008 and March 2016. A meta-analysis was performed to incorporate the present study and the previous studies retrieved from a bibliographic database search to provide the pooled rate of cervical cancer among women with SCCA cytology. A random-effects model was applied for meta-analysis. Results: The data of 69 patients were reviewed. After colposcopy, 64 patients underwent cervical conization and/or hysterectomy, and the five remaining patients underwent colposcopically-directed biopsy only. Thirty-six patients (52.2%; 95% CI 40.1 to 64.3) were found to have invasive lesions, all of them were cervical cancer. There were no significant associations between the patients’ age, level of education, menopausal status, parity status, infection with human immunodeficiency virus, or symptoms presented during the cervical smear and the rate of invasive cervical cancer. After combining the data from the present study with the data from six other eligible studies, which were retrieved from the search of standard bibliographic databases, the pooled rate of cervical cancer among women with SCCA cytology was 56% (95% CI 36 to 77). Conclusion: Approximately, half of women with SCCA cytology in the present study harbored cervical cancer. No significant factors predicting underlying cervical cancer were noted. By means of meta-analysis, the pooled rate of cervical cancer among women with SCCA cytology was 56%. ?

"Validity and reliability of the wii balance board for static balance assessment in healthy young adults",2019,"Introduction: The Wii Balance Board (WBB) is a commonly used tool for balance assessment, however the inconsistency in the reported validity for the WBB when used for the assessment of healthy young adults needs to be clarified. Aim: To investigate the concurrent validity and reliability of the WBB for balance assessment in healthy young adults. Methods: Thirty-two young adults participated in this study. Their ability to balance was tested while standing on a WBB and a laboratory-grade force platform, under three conditions: feet together with eyes open, feet together with eyes closed and semi-tandem standing with eyes open. They had 10 min resting period between tests. The agreement between the WBB and the laboratory-grade force platform was investigated, and the reliability of the WBB was determined. Results: A poor agreement between the WBB and the laboratory-grade force platform was found for all standing conditions [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.03 to 0.07]. A moderate to high reliability was found for the WBB for balance assessment in healthy young adults (ICC = 0.66 to 0.76). Conclusion: The WBB was found to be a reliable tool for static balance assessment in healthy young adults. However, it had poor validity compared to the laboratory-grade force platform. ?

"Early and Late Virologic Failure after Virologic Suppression in HIV-Infected Asian Children and Adolescents",2019,"Background:Virologic failure is a major threat to maintaining effective combination antiretroviral therapy, especially for children in need of lifelong treatment. With efforts to expand access to HIV viral load testing, our understanding of pediatric virologic failure is evolving.Setting:An Asian cohort in 16 pediatric HIV services across 6 countries.Methods:From 2005 to 2014, patients younger than 20 years who achieved virologic suppression and had subsequent viral load testing were included. Early virologic failure was defined as a HIV RNA ?1000 copies per milliliter within 12 months of virologic suppression, and late virologic as a HIV RNA ?1000 copies per milliliter after 12 months following virologic suppression. Characteristics at combination antiretroviral therapy initiation and virologic suppression were described, and a competing risk time-to-event analysis was used to determine cumulative incidence of virologic failure and factors at virologic suppression associated with early and late virologic failure.Results:Of 1105 included in the analysis, 182 (17.9%) experienced virologic failure. The median age at virologic suppression was 6.9 years, and the median time to virologic failure was 24.6 months after virologic suppression. The incidence rate for a first virologic failure event was 3.3 per 100 person-years. Factors at virologic suppression associated with late virologic failure included older age, mostly rural clinic setting, tuberculosis, protease inhibitor-based regimens, and early virologic failure. No risk factors were identified for early virologic failure.Conclusions:Around 1 in 5 experienced virologic failure in our cohort after achieving virologic suppression. Targeted interventions to manage complex treatment scenarios, including adolescents, tuberculosis coinfection, and those with poor virologic control are required. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","abacavir; efavirenz; lamivudine; nevirapine; stavudine; tenofovir; zidovudine; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adolescent; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Cambodia; child; cohort analysis; comparative study; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; India; Indonesia; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; observational study; priority journal; risk factor; Thailand; Viet Nam; viral load testing; virus load; Asian continental ancestry group; clinical trial; drug effect; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; multicenter study; treatment failure; virology; Adolescent; Anti-HIV Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Child; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Treatment Failure; Viral Load"
"Reference values of the anterior cerebral artery doppler indices in normal fetuses",2019,"Objective: To establish reference values of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) Doppler indices in normal fetuses during the period between 20-and 37-weeks’ gestation. Materials and Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted on low-risk singleton pregnancies with healthy fetuses. The ACA Doppler spectral waveforms were obtained using transabdominal Doppler sonography, just after the origin of the ACA from the internal carotid artery in the same plane as the middle cerebral artery. The putative normative data were analyzed and constructed for the median, fifth, and ninety-fifth percentiles of ACA Doppler indices for each gestational week. Results: Three hundred fetuses were measured for ACA Doppler indices. The pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) continuously increased from 20-weeks’ gestation until a period of relative stability at 28-to 32-weeks, followed by a gradual reduction thereafter. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) showed a constant increase with advancing gestational age. A quadratic analysis was performed to construct curve-fitted percentile charts for each of these variables. Conclusion: Reference values of the fetal ACA Doppler indices are constructed. This nomogram may be a useful tool for early detection of the brain-sparing effect in growth-restricted fetuses. ?

"GLIM Criteria for the Diagnosis of Malnutrition: A Consensus Report From the Global Clinical Nutrition Community",2019,"Background: This initiative aims to build a global consensus around core diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults in clinical settings. Methods: The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was convened by several of the major global clinical nutrition societies. Empirical consensus was reached through a series of face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, and e-mail communications. Results: A 2-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis was selected, that is, first screening to identify at risk status by the use of any validated screening tool, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition. The malnutrition criteria for consideration were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among GLIM participants that selected 3 phenotypic criteria (non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and 2 etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition at least 1 phenotypic criterion and 1 etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity are proposed. It is recommended that the etiologic criteria be used to guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories. Conclusions: A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed. Next steps are to secure endorsements from leading nutrition professional societies, to identify overlaps with syndromes like cachexia and sarcopenia, and to promote dissemination, validation studies, and feedback. The construct should be re-considered every 3–5 years. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.

"Comparisons of whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis causing MDR-TB and XDR-TB in Thailand",2019,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem. There is little information regarding the genotypic–phenotypic association of anti-TB drugs, especially for second-line drugs. This study compared phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) with predictions based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for 266 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Phenotypic DST used the standard proportional method. Clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis collected in Thailand between 1998 and 2013 comprised 51 drug-sensitive strains, six mono-resistant strains, two multiple-resistant strains, 88 multi-drug-resistant strains, 95 pre-extensively drug-resistant strains and 24 extensively drug-resistant strains. WGS analysis was performed using the computer programs PhyResSE and TB-Profiler. TB-Profiler had higher average concordance with phenotypic DST than PhyResSE for both first-line (91.96% vs. 91.4%) and second-line (79.67% vs. 78.20%) anti-TB drugs. The average sensitivity for all anti-TB drugs was also higher (83.13% vs. 72.08%) with slightly lower specificity (83.50% vs. 86.68%). Regardless of the program used, isoniazid, rifampicin and amikacin had the highest concordance with phenotypic DST (96.2%, 93.5% and 95.6%, respectively). Ethambutol, ethionamide and fluoroquinolones had the lowest concordance (87.34%, 81.44% and 73.85%, respectively). Concordance rates of ofloxacin (a second-generation fluoroquinolone), levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin (third- and fourth-generation fluoroquinolones) were 91.79%, 76.62%, 72.64% and 57.35%, respectively. Discordance between phenotypic and WGS-based DSTs may be due, in part, to the choice of critical concentration and variable reproducibility of the phenotypic tests. It may also be due to limitations of the mutation databases (especially for the second-line drugs) and the analysis program used. Mutations related to fluoroquinolone resistance, especially the later generations, need to be identified. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy","amikacin; aminosalicylic acid; azithromycin; capreomycin; clarithromycin; ethambutol; ethionamide; gatifloxacin; isoniazid; kanamycin; levofloxacin; linezolid; moxifloxacin; ofloxacin; pyrazinamide; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; rifampicin; streptomycin; tuberculostatic agent; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; extensively drug resistant tuberculosis; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; Thailand; whole genome sequencing; comparative study; drug effect; evaluation study; genetics; genotyping technique; human; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; procedures; Antitubercular Agents; Genotyping Techniques; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thailand; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant; Whole Genome Sequencing"

The typical symptoms are pain, weakness, and instability. For severe and symptomatic genu recurvatum patient, the surgical correction should be performed to relieve symptoms and prevent progression of deformity. Many procedures were proposed to treat this condition, but there are some complications such as patella baja, secondary deformity, skin complication, and inadequate correction. Most of the procedures need an additional procedure such as tibial tuberosity transfer to correct the patellar height. In this case, the authors report a new technique in which the osteotomy was performed near the center of rotation angulation. And, the correction did not influence the patellar height. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","adult; anterior open wedge heptalateral osteotomy; bone radiography; case report; clinical article; disease severity; electrodiagnosis; fracture fixation; genu recurvatum; human; immobilization; knee injury; male; osteotomy; patient referral; peroneus nerve paralysis; pes equinus; physical examination; postoperative period; priority journal; proximal tibia fracture; Review; surgical technique; traffic accident; weight bearing; young adult; adolescent; complication; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; knee injury; leg length inequality; osteotomy; pathophysiology; pes equinus; procedures; tibia fracture; Adolescent; Equinus Deformity; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Leg Length Inequality; Male; Osteotomy; Range of Motion, Articular; Tibial Fractures"
"Effects of arm swing exercise training on cardiac autonomic functions in response to incremental exercise in overweight and normal weight young adults",2019,"Background: Excess weight is associated with cardiac autonomic dysfunction at rest and during exercise. Exercise training has been proven to be effective for restoring cardiac autonomic function. Objective: To evaluate the effect of arm swing exercise (ASE) training on cardiac autonomic function in response to incremental exercise in overweight young adults. Materials and Methods: Forty sedentary young adults were classified into overweight and normal weight groups in accordance with age and sex. All subjects took part in an ASE training program for 2 months, 30 minutes/day, 3 days/week. Before and after the training, subjects’ cardiac autonomic function was evaluated via heart rate variability analysis throughout the incremental exercise as well as during recovery. Results: Prior to ASE training, during low-intensity exercise, mean heart rate (HR) in the overweight group was higher than that in the normal weight group (p<0.05). However, during high-intensity exercise, mean HR and the longitudinal diameters of the Poincar? plot (SD2) value in the overweight group were lower than those in the normal weight group (p<0.05). These differences disappeared post ASE training period. During recovery from incremental exercise, before ASE training, mean duration of all normal to normal RR intervals (RR values) were higher (p<0.05), and the ratio between low and high frequency components was lower (p<0.05) in the overweight group compared to those in the normal weight group. Higher mean RR values in the overweight group were maintained post ASE training period (p<0.05). Conclusion: The present study suggested that in response to high-intensity exercise, parasympathetic nerve activity is predominant in young overweight adults. ASE training for 2 months improved cardiac autonomic activity in response to incremental exercise in overweight young adults. ?

"Heart rate variability responses to a combined exercise training program: Correlation with adiposity and cardiorespiratory fitness changes in obese young men",2019,"Although the influence of adiposity indices and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on heart rate variability (HRV) has been demonstrated extensively, the causal link between the changes in adiposity as well as in CRF and the alterations in cardiac autonomic function is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to assess the correlation between the changes in adiposity and CRF and the alterations in HRV after 12-week exercise training. Twenty obese sedentary men aged 20.5±1.2 years were randomly assigned into 2 groups (n=10 each): the control (CG) and the exercise group (EG). The EG trained 60 min of combined aerobic, anaerobic and strengthen-ing exercise, 4 sessions/wk for 12 weeks, whilst the CG remained rela-tively inactive. Measurements of resting HRV, body composition, and peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak ) were obtained at baseline and after the 12-week training program. Compared with CG, the exercise training significantly reduced adiposity indices and improved vagal-related HRV variables and VO 2peak . Significant correlations were observed between changes in HRV variables and adiposity indices and VO 2peak changes. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that changes in a Poincar? plot index (SD1/SD2 ratio) predicted 32.4% of the variance in the relative VO 2peak changes. These findings suggest that obese sedentary young men achieved significant improvements in vagal activity, adiposity indi-ces and aerobic fitness after the exercise training. The higher reduction in fat mass, especially central obesity, the greater alteration of vagal modulation. Moreover, the alteration in resting HRV is a possible predic-tor for adaptations to exercise training in obese sedentary young men. ? 2019 Korean Society of Exercise Rehabilitation.",""
"Questionnaire validation of colorectal cancer literacy scale among thai people in northeastern Thailand",2019,"Background: Colorectal cancer is an important public health problem worldwide. Although progress in screening and treatment has considerably improved the prognosis in the developed world, in developing countries colorectal cancer mortality rate remains relatively high. Colorectal cancer screening literacy is an important initial step in overcoming this problem. Development of a validated assessment instrument is therefore important for implementation of appropriate health education programs to facilitate early detection. Objectives: This study focused on generation and validation of a colorectal cancer screening literacy scale for Thai people in northeastern Thailand. Methods: This methodological study was carried out in two phases: (1) literature reviews and semi-structured interviews were used to select items, then the content and face validity were checked; and (2) a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test construct validity and reliability. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from Thai people aged 50- 65 in June 2017. Results: For the total of 400 participants who responded (response rate 100 %), the age ranged from 50 to 65 years old (mean = 57.3, SD = 4.616). The colorectal cancer screening literacy scale was designed to include 6 domains and it was shown to have good internal consistency, and CFA demonstrated the model to fit data adequately (Chi-squared/degree of freedom = 1.079, p = 0.061, CFI = 1.00, GFI = 0.93, AGFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.014 and SRMR = 0.036). The final version of its, consisting of 57 items across the 6 domains covering key aspects of colorectal cancer screening literacy, demonstrated good psychometric properties for this population. Conclusions: Use of the colorectal cancer screening literacy scale in Thai people could lead to improved educational programs for optimizing colorectal cancer screening. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.","aged; attitude to health; colorectal tumor; early cancer diagnosis; female; follow up; health literacy; human; male; middle aged; prognosis; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; Thailand; validation study; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Literacy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thailand; Validation Studies as Topic"
"Highly selective Cr2O72- removal in aqueous medium by using a flexible 2D metal-organic framework through single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation",2019,"The contamination of toxic Cr(VI) oxoanion in water has been a major problem in water treatment and public health concerns. Thus, the development of new materials for high efficiency, high selectivity and reusability for Cr(VI) trapping remains challenge. Herein, the water-stable neutral two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) of [Co(1,4-phda)(4,4′-bpp)(H2O)2](H2O)2 (1) (4,4′-bpp = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane and 1,4-H2phda = 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid) with high flexibility of the framework has been synthesized. Remarkably, 1 exhibits an excellent ability to trap Cr2O72- in a wide pH range (pH ? 2-9) through reversible single-crystal-to-single-crystal (2D→3D) transformation and chemisorption processes via oxoanion coordination bond which is a new pathway for Cr(VI) trapping. Among adsorbent materials, the capture of Cr2O72- in 1 shows high adsorption efficiency (176 mg g-1) with exceptional high selectivity associated with naked eye. This material also exhibits a good reusability without loss of Cr(VI) trapping-releasing ability. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"Effect of chewing rate on meal intake",2019,"Fast eating has been shown to increase the risk of overweight in both children and adults. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the correlation between chewing rate and the number of chews per mouthful and to evaluate if they were associated with the weight of meal intake. Thirty healthy subjects, aged 18–24 yr, ate a test lunch at their habitual speed until they felt satiated. The activities of masseter and suprahyoid muscles were recorded to determine the number of chews and the moment of swallowing. The weight of meal intake was recorded along with body mass index (BMI), chewing rate, number of chews per mouthful, meal duration, ingestion rate, hunger, and food preference levels. The mean weight (±SD) of meal intake, chewing rate, and number of chews per mouthful were 261.4 ± 78.9 g, 94.4 ± 13.5 chews min?1, 19.2 ± 6.4 chews per mouthful, respectively. Chewing rate was not correlated with the number of chews per mouthful. The multivariable linear regression showed that meal intake was significantly positively associated with chewing rate, meal duration, and BMI, but inversely associated with the number of chews per mouthful (adjusted R2 = 0.42). It was concluded that the number of chews was not associated with chewing rate but meal intake was explained by both reduced number of chews and increased chewing rate. ? 2018 Eur J Oral Sci","adolescent; body mass; caloric intake; feeding behavior; female; human; male; mastication; physiology; statistical model; young adult; Adolescent; Body Mass Index; Energy Intake; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Mastication; Young Adult"

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was developed and given to all of the medical students at two medical schools in Thailand (Siriraj and Srinagarind Hospital) from September 2017 to February 2018. They were asked to response to the questions by imagining how older people would think, and their preferences regarding care at the end-of-life period. The anonymous questionnaires were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 1029 out of 2990 surveys were returned (34.4%). A minority of the sixth-year medical students rated themselves as being knowledgeable about palliative care (11.3%). According to the survey, desire to have spiritual needs met and have their loved ones present were the most important conditions that contributed to a ""good death"". Factors associated with reluctance to receive prolonged treatment were female sex (adjusted odds ratio (AOR 1.39), being in the clinical years of training (AOR 1.92), self-rated good health (AOR 1.45), and prior experience of watching someone dying (AOR 1.61). Enrollment in Srinagarind medical school (AOR 2.05), being a clinical student (AOR1.91), and being dissatisfied with life (AOR 1.78) were independent factors related to preference for home death. Conclusions: Most medical students signified understanding of concepts of geriatric palliative care but felt that they had insufficient knowledge in this area. Multiple factors related to decision regarding the care that was required were identified. Medical schools should consider this information to improve geriatric palliative medical education in undergraduate training. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aged; article; cross-sectional study; curriculum; death; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical school; medical student; palliative therapy; perception; questionnaire; Thailand"
"Household disaster management capacities in disaster prone II area of Mt. Slamet",2019,"Disaster prone II in Mt. Slamet, Indonesia presents the highest risk for human settlement. To live in this natural disaster-prone area, specific household characteristics are essential. Household capitals and transformation in process and structure were supported by the disaster management framework. However, households in disaster prone II area had limited assets and were required to identify factors influencing disaster management. To study the factors influencing household disaster management capacities, this research, using the sample measurement of Becker and Hursh-Cesar, collected data of 538 households spread across five villages in the disaster prone II area of Mt. Slamet. Sequential mixed methodology combining both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used: samples in the Rukun-Warga-level area were collected by a two-stage stratified random sampling, and to choose the sample of households systematic random sampling was employed. Path analysis through Stata was carried out to analyse the direct and indirect factors supporting disaster management capacity, and multicollinearity was tested before path analysis. This research found direct and indirect effects of household characteristics and household capitals on disaster management. This could be influenced by the transformation in process and the structure of the local government. The quantitative result has been confirmed by the result of the qualitative methodology. Social capital owned by households in disaster-prone area supports disaster management practices. The household relationship and networking access has been strongly supported by disaster management capacities. Disaster management capacities of households in disaster prone II areas could be improved by both internal and external factors. Internal factors include supporting the household members' health and increasing the size of land and vehicle owning. Meanwhile, external factors has been applied by the policy published by government as to improve the social and cultural belief of households. ? 2019. The Authors.",""
"Urine TWEAK level as a biomarker for early response to treatment in active lupus nephritis: A prospective multicentre study",2019,"Background TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a proinflammatory molecule that plays a key role in active inflammation of lupus nephritis (LN). Urine TWEAK (uTWEAK) levels were found to be associated with renal disease activity among patients with LN. Here, we determined whether serial measurements of uTWEAK during induction therapy could predict treatment response or not. Methods Spot urine samples were collected from patients with biopsy-proven active LN at time of flare, and 3 and 6 months after flare to assess the uTWEAK levels. All patients received standard immunosuppressive therapy and treatment response was evaluated at 6 months. The performance of uTWEAK as a predictor for treatment response was compared with clinically used biomarkers for patients with LN. Results Among 110 patients with LN, there were 29% complete responders (CR), 34% partial responders (PR) and 37% non-responders (NR). On average, uTWEAK level was consistently low in CR, trended down by 3 months in PR and persistently elevated in NR. uTWEAK levels at month 3 were able to predict complete response at month 6 (OR adjusted for age, sex and creatinine=0.34 [95% CI 0.15 to 0.80], the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC-AUC]=0.68, p=0.02). The optimal threshold for uTWEAK level at month 3 was 0.46 pg/mgCr, discriminating complete response with 70% sensitivity and 63% specificity. Combining uTWEAK and urine protein at month 3 improved predictive performance for complete response at 6 months (ROC-AUC 0.83, p<0.001). Conclusions In addition to urine protein, uTWEAK level at 3 months after flare can improve the accuracy in predicting complete response at 6 months of induction therapy. ?

"Effect of temperature on the killing of opisthorchis viverrini eggs in vitro",2019,"Contaminated liver fluke egg in the environment has led to the high prevalence of human opisthorchiasis associated with cholangiocarcinoma in Southeast Asia. To find the effective lessening methods of Opisthorchis viverrini eggs in the contaminated environment, we investigated the temperature conditions for killing of these trematode eggs in vitro. Numerous O. viverrini eggs were obtained in the proximal part of uteri of adult worms from experimental hamsters. Mature eggs with miracidium were allocated by experimental groups (2 control: positive and negative and 4 treatment: 50, 60, 70, and 80°C) with 0.85% saline, and treated by the experimental plan. Eggs in each experimental groups were observed under the confocal microscope after stain with Propidium Iodide (PI) to evaluate the effect of temperatures. Eggs in 70 and 80°C groups were all killed after over 10 min heated. Majority of eggs in 60°C (10, 15, and 30 min heated), 70 and 80°C (5 min heated) groups were inactivated. However in 50°C group, below half of eggs were to be killed in all time lapse (10, 15 and 30 min). In order to prevent O. viverrini infection and cholangiocarcinoma, direct treatment of sewage by heating at 70 or 80°C at least 10 min is essential. Therefore, treatment of O. viverrini eggs at a high temperature is a potential method for controlling egg contamination in sewage. ? 2019, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine.","propidium iodide; sodium chloride; fluorescent dye; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bile duct carcinoma; controlled study; female; hamster; heating; high temperature; in vitro study; microbial contamination; miracidium; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis viverrini; sewage; temperature; uterus; worm egg; animal; confocal microscopy; heat; metabolism; Opisthorchis; physiology; radiation response; staining; survival analysis; zygote; Animals; Cricetinae; Fluorescent Dyes; Hot Temperature; Microscopy, Confocal; Opisthorchis; Propidium; Staining and Labeling; Survival Analysis; Zygote"
"HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2020,"Associations between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported. To consolidate the results from all available reports in scientific databases, systematic review and meta-analysis techniques were used to quantify these associations. Studies investigating associations between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity were systematically searched in PubMed, Human Genome Epidemiology Network, and the Cochrane Library. Primary outcomes were the associations between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity. Overall odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95%CIs were calculated using a random-effect model to determine the associations between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity. A clear association between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity was identified in our analyses. The summary OR was 6.23 (95%CI = 4.11–9.45). Similar associations were also found in the subgroup analyses by lapatinib treatment regimens. ORs were 10.04 (95%CI = 6.15–16.39), 8.65 (95%CI = 4.52–16.58), and 3.88 (95%CI = 2.20–6.82) in the lapatinib group, lapatinib + trastuzumab group, and lapatinib + chemotherapy or lapatinib + trastuzumab + chemotherapy group, respectively. Since HLA-DRB1*07:01 is associated with lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity, genetic screening of HLA-DRB1*07:01 in breast cancer patients prior to lapatinib therapy is warranted for patient safety. In addition, further studies should define the risk of HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity in specific ethnicities. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","alanine aminotransferase; antineoplastic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; carboplatin; HLA DRB1 antigen; lapatinib; paclitaxel; tenascin; trastuzumab; adjuvant therapy; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; breast cancer; disease association; gene linkage disequilibrium; human; meta analysis; odds ratio; priority journal; quantitative analysis; systematic review; toxic hepatitis"
"Bioaccumulation of heavy metals in local edible plants near a municipal landfill and the related human health risk assessment",2019,"The increase in municipal solid waste generation, along with high concentrations of heavy metals in environments near municipal landfill, has led to human health hazards. This study investigated heavy metal contamination in water, sediment, and edible plants near a municipal landfill, including the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and potential health risks. The heavy metal concentrations in the samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The concentrations of arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) in water samples were not detected (ND), ND, 0.006 ± 0.01?mg/L, and ND, respectively, and in sediment samples, the concentrations were 1.19 ± 0.44, 3.20 ± 0.62, 0.46 ± 0.21, and 6.97 ± 0.34?mg/kg, respectively. The highest concentrations of As (5.03 ± 0.38), Pb (1.81 ± 0.37), and Cd (1.93 ± 0.13) were found in Marsilea crenata, whereas that of Cr (5.68 ± 0.79) was detected in Ipomoea aquatica. The Cr concentration in all plant species exceeded the standard for vegetables. The BAF values followed the heavy metal concentrations. All plant species have a low potential for accumulating Pb and Cr. The edible plants in this study area might cause health hazards to consumers from As, Pb, and Cd contamination. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",""
"Differentiation of patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate from other glucosamine preparations will optimize osteoarthritis treatment",2019,"Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs) are recommended for the medium- to long-term management of knee osteoarthritis (OA) due to their abilities to control pain, improve function and delay joint structural changes. Among SYSADOAs, evidence is greatest for the patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate (pCGS) formulation (Mylan). Glucosamine is widely available as glucosamine sulfate (GS) and glucosamine hydrochloride (GH) preparations that vary substantially in molecular form, pharmaceutical formulation and dose regimen. Only pCGS is given as a highly bioavailable once-daily dose (1500 mg), which consistently delivers the plasma levels of around 10 μmol/L required to inhibit interleukin-1-induced expression of genes involved in the pathophysiology of joint inflammation and tissue destruction. Careful consideration of the evidence base reveals that only pCGS reliably provides a moderate effect size on pain that is higher than paracetamol and equivalent to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), while non-crystalline GS and GH fail to reach statistical significance for pain reduction. Chronic administration of pCGS has disease-modifying effects, with a reduction in need for total joint replacement lasting for 5 years after treatment cessation. Pharmacoeconomic studies of pCGS demonstrate long-term reduction in additional pain analgesia and NSAIDs, with a 50% reduction in costs of other OA medication and healthcare consultations. Consequently, pCGS is the logical choice, with demonstrated medium-term control of pain and lasting impact on disease progression. Physician and patient education on the differentiation of pCGS from other glucosamine formulations will help to improve treatment selection, increase treatment adherence, and optimize clinical benefit in OA. ? 2017 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","antirheumatic agent; glucosamine; patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate; unclassified drug; antirheumatic agent; glucosamine; clinical effectiveness; cost effectiveness analysis; drug cost; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug safety; human; osteoarthritis; patient care; patient risk; priority journal; Review; treatment outcome; animal; cost benefit analysis; crystallization; drug formulation; economics; osteoarthritis; patent; patient education; Animals; Antirheumatic Agents; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Crystallization; Drug Compounding; Drug Costs; Glucosamine; Humans; Osteoarthritis; Patents as Topic; Patient Education as Topic; Treatment Outcome"
"An investigation on the P300 event-relatedpotential and brain topographical organization of veterinary medicine students through working memory training",2019,"The study was designed to investigate the effects of constructionism, metacognition, and neurocognitive-based(CMEN) teaching model on veterinary medicine students’ P300 event-related potential and brain topographical organization. Researchers sought to examine and compare the significant change after the intervention of CMEN with working memory training and a conventional teaching model (CM) without working memory training in an experimental and a control group, respectively. The total participants were 40 second year students from Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, a public university in KhonKaen province, Thailand. They were equally distributed to 20 students in each group and attended to the two different teaching models. Researchers employed an experimental research pre-test and a post-test control group design and data was analyzed using 2X2 multivariate analysis of variance. Initial results indicated that there was no significant difference between groups in all the dependent variables before intervention. However, students in the experimental group showed a significant higher voltage at fronto-parietal cortices than the control group. Moreover, the experimental group had shorter latency time and higher amplitude at all electrode site compared to the control group. As a conclusion, the CMEN teaching model has greater effects compared to the CM teaching model subsequently enhancing working memory ability. ? 2019, Advanced Scientific Research.

"Effects of a health education program on fall risk prevention among the urban elderly: A Quasi-experimental study",2019,"Background: Elderly falls increase dramatically with age and are a leading cause of injury, carrying a risk of loss of independence and death. We studied the effects of a health education program on fall-risk prevention among urban elderly persons in the municipality of Khon Kaen, Thailand. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2 communities. The calculated sample size was 216 individuals: 108 for intervention and 108 for control, all of whom were 60 or older, and registered at the Sam-lium Primary Care Unit (SPCU). The educational intervention was a fall risk intervention program by an elderly buddy. A structured questionnaire that incorporated questions from the Thai Fall Risk Assessment Tool (Thai-FRAT) was used to collect general and specific information. Data were analyzed using the independent sample t-test and ?2, with P&lt;0.05 being statistically significant. Results: The response rate was 94.4%. More than half of the respondents were at risk of a fall. The prevalence of risk of a fall among the intervention group was slightly less than that for those within the control group [In-tervention group=52.9% (95%CI: 42.85, 62.81, P&lt;0.001); Control group=60.8% (95%CI: 50.59, 70.15, P=0.016)]. After 6 months of intervention, the balance impairment, medicine usage, and overall proportion with risk of fall were decreased. The difference between the intervention and control groups was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The provision of a health education program designed for fall risk prevention among the elderly would be a useful public health initiative. ? 2019, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

"Immunity to Hepatitis B virus as a fitness for duty program for health workers at the university hospital in Thailand",2019,"Background: Health workers (HWs) are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; especially those with no immunity to HBV. Notwithstanding, no prior Thai studies regarding HBV immunity as a fitness for duty program have been published. Objective: This study aimed to describe the status of HBV immunity as related to an occupational health program for new health workers. Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive study in which 1,302 samples were collected from existing data recorded by the Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) Office between 2013 and 2016. Descriptive statistics were used to describe proportions. Results: The immunity to HBV amongst persons with direct contact to blood-borne pathogens (BBPs) between 2013 and 2016 represented the majority who had immunity to HBV. The number with HBV immunity rose every year between 2013 and 2016 (50.0% to 84.7%) whereas those actually infected with HBV declined (4.3% to 0.6%). When assessing fitness for duty, 95.4% were fit for duty with BBPs. Conclusion: The trend of BBPs-sero-protected against hepatitis B virus among HWs is increasing. Occupational health programs for health workers were used to ensure fitness for duty with BBPs, and specifically HBV. ?

"Overexpression of polycomb repressive complex 2 key components EZH2/SUZ12/EED as an unfavorable prognostic marker in cholangiocarcinoma",2019,"BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal liver cancer arising from bile duct epithelium. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a histone methyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27, resulting transcriptional gene silencing. The key components of PRC2 are EZH2, SUZ12 and EED, which EZH2 is a catalytic subunit. The defect of individual PRC2 components has been shown to enhance carcinogenesis and cancer progression. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of individual PRC2 components and evaluate its association with clinicopathological data in CCA patients. METHODS: The expression of PRC2 components including EZH2, SUZ12 and EED was determined by immunohistochemistry in 40 CCA tissue samples. RESULTS: The expression of EZH2 and SUZ12 in CCA tissue was significantly higher than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissue (P < 0.001). The high cytoplasmic EZH2 expression was significantly associated with short overall survival in CCA (P = 0.030). Interestingly, a combined high nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of EZH2 was found to be a worse prognostic marker for overall survival (P = 0.015). Moreover, combined high expression of EZH2 and SUZ12/EED was also associated with short overall survival (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that overexpression of the PRC2 key components especially EZH2 in both nucleus and cytoplasm can be potentially used as a prognostic marker for CCA. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH","embryonic ectoderm development protein; polycomb repressive complex 2; suppressor of zeste 12; transcription factor EZH2; unclassified drug; EED protein, human; EZH2 protein, human; polycomb repressive complex 2; SUZ12 protein, human; transcription factor EZH2; adult; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lymph node metastasis; male; middle aged; overall survival; protein expression; tumor volume; aged; bile duct cancer; bile duct carcinoma; cancer staging; metabolism; mortality; pathology; prognosis; survival rate; Aged; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Cholangiocarcinoma; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Female; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Prognosis; Survival Rate"

Methods and results: We pooled two, large, global trials, with similar design, in 13 174 patients with HFrEF (patient distribution: China 833, India 1390, Japan 209, Korea 223, Philippines 223, Taiwan 199 and Thailand 95, Western Europe 3521, Eastern Europe 4758, North America 613, and Latin America 1110). Asian patients were younger (55.0–63.9 years) than in Western Europe (67.9 years) and North America (66.6 years). Diuretics and devices were used less, and digoxin used more, in Asia. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use was higher in China (66.3%), the Philippines (64.1%) and Latin America (62.8%) compared to Europe and North America (range 32.8% to 49.6%). The rate of cardiovascular death/heart failure hospitalization was higher in Asia (e.g. Taiwan 17.2, China 14.9 per 100 patient-years) than in Western Europe (10.4) and North America (12.8). However, the adjusted risk of cardiovascular death was higher in many Asian countries than in Western Europe (except Japan) and the risk of heart failure hospitalization was lower in India and in the Philippines than in Western Europe, but significantly higher in China, Japan, and Taiwan. Conclusion: Patient characteristics and outcomes vary between Asia and other regions and between Asian countries. These variations may reflect several factors, including geography, climate and environment, diet and lifestyle, health care systems, genetics and socioeconomic influences. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Attenuation of CD47-SIRPα Signal in Cholangiocarcinoma Potentiates Tumor-Associated Macrophage-Mediated Phagocytosis and Suppresses Intrahepatic Metastasis",2019,"The involvement of chronic inflammation in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) progression is well established. Cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) is mutually expressed in various cancers and serves as a protective signal for phagocytic elimination. CD47 signaling blockage is a recent treatment strategy; however, little is known regarding CD47 in CCA. Therefore, the potential use of CD47 targeting in CCA was focused. CD47 was highly expressed in CCA compared to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Disturbance of CD47-signal regulatory protein-α (SIRPα) interaction by blocking antibodies promoted the macrophage phagocytosis. The therapeutic potential of anti-CD47 therapy was demonstrated in liver metastatic model; alleviation of cancer colonization together with dense macrophage infiltrations was observed. The usefulness of anti-CD47 was emphasized by its universal facilitating macrophage activities. Moreover, increased production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-10, in macrophage exposed to CCA-conditioned media suggested that CCA alters macrophages toward cancer promotion. Taken together, interfering of CD47-SIRPα interaction promotes macrophage phagocytosis in all macrophage subtypes and consequently suppresses CCA growth and metastasis. The unique overexpression of CD47 in CCA but not HCC offers an exceptional opportunity for a targeted therapy. CD47 is therefore a novel target for CCA treatment. ? 2018","angiotensin; CD14 antigen; CD163 antigen; CD47 antibody; CD47 antigen; CD86 antigen; cytokine antibody; epithelial derived neutrophil activating factor 78; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; melanoma growth stimulatory activity factor; monocyte chemotactic protein 2; monocyte chemotactic protein 3; peptides and proteins; signal regulatory protein alpha; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cancer tissue; cell infiltration; cholangiocarcinoma cell line; chronic inflammation; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; gene overexpression; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lymphocytic infiltration; metastasis; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; phagocytosis; phagocytosis assay; protein expression; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor volume"
"Clinical correlates of resilience factors in geriatric depression",2019,"Background: Traditional perspectives conceptualize resilience as a trait and depression as resulting from resilience deficiency. However, research indicates that resilience varies substantially even among adults who are clinically depressed, as well as across the lifespan of an individual. Few studies have investigated resilience in depression, and even fewer have examined resilience in depressed older adults. Methods: Three hundred thirty-seven adults ?60 years with major depressive disorder completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and measures of mental health, quality of life (QOL), and medical comorbidity. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the factor structure of the CD-RISC. Correlations and general linear models were used to examine associations between resilience and other variables. Results: The rotated component matrix indicated a four-factor model. Sorting of items by highest factor loading revealed constructs associated with (1) grit, (2) active coping self-efficacy, (3) accommodative coping self-efficacy, and (4) spirituality. Resilience was significantly correlated with increased age, lower cognitive functioning, greater cerebrovascular risk, and greater medical comorbidity. Resilience was negatively associated with mental health symptoms (depression, apathy, and anxiety) and positively associated with QOL. The final optimal model identified less depression, less apathy, greater medical comorbidity, higher QOL, and minority (non-White) race as factors that significantly explained variability in resilience. Conclusions: Resilience was significantly associated with a range of mental health constructs in a sample of older adults with depression. Future clinical trials and dismantling studies may help determine whether interventions targeting grit, active coping, accommodative coping, and spirituality can increase resilience and help prevent and treat depression in older adults. ?

"A prospective randomized comparative study of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and non-invasive ventilation in hypoxemic patients undergoing diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy",2019,"Background: Although oxygen supplementation during bronchoscopy in patients with pre-existing hypoxemia is provided, adequacy of oxygenation may not be achieved, resulting in the occurrence of respiratory failure that requires endotracheal tube intubation. The purpose of this study was to compare high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients with pre-existing hypoxemia undergoing flexible bronchoscopy (FB) on the ability to maintain oxygen saturation during bronchoscopy. Methods: A prospective randomized study was conducted in patients who had hypoxemia [defined as partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) less than 70 mmHg at room air] and required FB for the diagnosis of abnormal pulmonary lesions. Patients were randomized to receive either HFNC or NIV during FB. The primary outcome was the lowest oxygen saturation level during FB. Results: Fifty-one patients underwent randomization to HFNC (n=26) or NIV (n=25). Baseline characteristics in terms of age, Simplified Acute Physiologic Score II values, and cardiorespiratory parameters were similar in both groups. After receiving HFNC or NIV, oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximeter (SpO2) increased to greater than 90% in all cases. During FB, although the lowest SpO2 was similar in both groups, the lowest SpO2 &lt;90% tended to occur more often in the HFNC group (34.6% vs. 12.0%; P=0.057). In patients with baseline PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg on ambient air, a decrease in PaO2 from preprocedure to the end of FB was less in the NIV group (-13.7 vs. -57.0 mmHg; P=0.019). After FB, the occurrence of SpO2 &lt;90% was 15.4% and 4.0% in the HFNC group and NIV group, respectively (P=0.17). Conclusions: In overall, NIV and HFNC provided the similar effectiveness in prevention of hypoxemia in hypoxemic patients undergoing FB. However, in subgroup analysis, NIV provided greater adequacy and stability of oxygenation than HFNC in patients with baseline PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg on ambient air. ? Journal of Thoracic Disease.

"Augmentation of diethylnitrosamine–induced early stages of rat hepatocarcinogenesis by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine",2019,"Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) are classical carcinogens used in experimental rodent carcinogenesis. However, the interaction effects of these carcinogens on biochemical and molecular changes during carcinogenesis have not been investigated. Therefore, the effect of DEN and DMH co-administration on preneoplastic lesion formation and its molecular mechanism in rats were determined. Triple intraperitoneal administrations of DEN were made before, during or after double subcutaneous injections of DMH. At week 8 of the experiment, the preneoplastic hepatic glutathione-S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci and colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were analyzed. The combined treatment of these carcinogens increased toxicity to rats. Administration of DMH alone did not induce hepatic GST-P positive foci, while co-treatment with DMH enhanced hepatic GST-P positive foci formation. However, DEN did not influence the size or number of colonic ACF. The treatment with DMH alone induced CYP2E1 and P450 reductase, demonstrating that DMH enhanced DEN metabolism in DEN- and DMH-treated rats. These findings were related to increases in hepatic O6-methylguanine DNA adducts and hepatotoxicity, which are associated with the induction of cell proliferation and liver cancer development. DEN-induced early stages of rat hepatocarcinogenesis were synergistically promoted by DMH via metabolic enzyme induction leading to enhanced DNA mutation and hepatocarcinogenicity. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","1,2 dimethylhydrazine; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; beta actin; cytochrome c; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 2B1; cytochrome P450 2C11; cytochrome P450 2E1; cytochrome P450 3A2; cytochrome P450 reductase; diethylnitrosamine; glucuronosyltransferase; glucuronosyltransferase 1A1; glutathione transferase; glutathione transferase alpha; aberrant crypt focus; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cell proliferation; DNA adduct; enzyme activity; enzyme induction; liver carcinogenesis; liver toxicity; male; nonhuman; protein expression; rat"
"Cervical cancer in Khon Kaen, Thailand: Analysis of 1990-2014 incidence data and prediction of future trends",2019,"Background: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer of women in Thailand. There have been no reports of incidence and future in Khon Kaen, a province in northeastern Thailand, where the relatively high prevalence gives evaluation of cervical cancer screening a high priority. Objectives: To determine cervical cancer incidence rates in Khon Kaen for 1990-2014 and predict future trends until 2029. Methods: Cancer incidence data from the Khon Kaen population-based cancer registry were analyzed and age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were estimated. Joinpoint analysis and age-period-cohort modeling were applied for data from 1990 to 2014 and the Nordpred package was employed to project trends from 2015 to 2029. Results: Between 1990 and 2014, a total of 3,258 cases were diagnosed with ICD-O code C53 (invasive cervical cancer). Before 2005, an annual percentage change (APC) varied widely, with outliers in 1993 and 1999. The APC computed with the Joinpoint software decreased at -2.8% (95% CI;-4.5 to -1.1) per year on average. After 2005, a rise was noted until 2008, after which a drop became apparent with an APC of -8.0% (95% CI; -14.5 to -1.1) per year on average. Both period and cohort effects played a role in shaping the decrease in incidence. The three projection method suggested that incidence rates would continue to decrease in the future. Conclusions: A decreasing trend in incidence of cervical cancer in Khon Kaen was noted from 1990 to 2014 with a prediction of continuous decrease until 2029. Maintenance and improvement of the screening program is advised. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.","adult; age; aged; cohort analysis; early cancer diagnosis; female; follow up; human; incidence; male; middle aged; prognosis; register; statistics and numerical data; Thailand; time factor; trends; uterine cervix tumor; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Registries; Thailand; Time Factors; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Young Adult"
"Overexpression of HexCer and LacCer containing 2-hydroxylated fatty acids in cholangiocarcinoma and the association of the increase of LacCer (d18:1-h23:0) with shorter survival of the patients",2019,"Alteration of glycosphingolipid (GSL) synthesis is observed in many types of cancer. In this study, we have analyzed the expression of sphingolipids and GSLs in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues. Neutral lipids were extracted from tissue samples using mild-alkaline treatment method followed by TLC and LC-MS analysis. The expression of ceramides, hexosylceramides (HexCer), and lactosylceramides (LacCer) was altered in CCA tissues, 61.1% (11/18) of them showing an increase whereas 38.9% (7/18) showing a decrease, compared with the adjacent normal tissue. Cers and GSLs containing 2-hydroxylated fatty acids except one LacCer molecular species were overexpressed in CCA tissues, and the increase of LacCer (d18:1-h23:0) was correlated with shorter survival of CCA patients, suggesting the involvement of GSL synthesis and fatty acid hydroxylation in progression of CCA. Taken together, we have demonstrated in this study the increase of GSL synthesis and fatty hydroxylation in CCA, which probably be used as a target for CCA treatment. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","ceramide; fatty acid; tumor marker; bile duct cancer; bile duct carcinoma; chemistry; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Biomarkers, Tumor; Ceramides; Cholangiocarcinoma; Fatty Acids; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged"
"Estimating the willingness to pay and the value of fatality risk reduction for car drivers in Myanmar",2019,"To curb the rising road traffic accident trend in Myanmar, there is an urgent need to improve road safety. This study aims to evaluate current government road safety interventions. The contingent valuation-payment card method was used to elicit car drivers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for fatality risk reduction. The value of statistical life (VSL) was then estimated and the factors influencing the WTP were examined using structural equation modeling. The estimated range for VSL was found to be MMK 104.167 million (US$ 86,805) to MMK 195.771 million (US$ 163, 142). Gender (male), mediating good driving behavior, and age indicators were found to negatively influence the WTP, whereas socioeconomic characteristics, good driving behavior, and risk perception factors were found to positively influence the WTP. The proposed model explained 33.7% of the variance and traffic accident risk perception was found to have the strongest influence on the WTP. This study can serve as a decision making tool for road safety improvement policies. ? 2019",""
"Isocitrate dehydrogenase gene mutations and 2-hydroxyglutarate accumulation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) are key metabolic enzymes that convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. Somatic point mutations in IDH1/2 confer a gain-of-function in cancer cells, resulting in overproduction of an oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG interferes with cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation, contributing to oncogenesis. Given that IDH1 and IDH2 are attracting attention as promising therapeutic targets, better evaluation of the incidence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and 2HG level in human cancers is clinically important. This is the first study to assess their incidence in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). First, we established pyrosequencing assays for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and revealed that these mutations were absent in 10 ESCC cell lines and 96 ESCC tissues. Second, utilizing IDH1 and IDH2 overexpression vectors, we demonstrated that LC-MS/MS assays can accurately evaluate 2HG level and found that some ESCC cases presented a high level of 2HG. In conclusion, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations play a limited role in the development of ESCC. 2HG is potentially synthesized to high levels in the absence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and this may correlate with progression of ESCCs. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2 hydroxyglutaric acid; isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; isocitrate dehydrogenase 2; alpha-hydroxyglutarate; glutaric acid derivative; IDH1 protein, human; isocitrate dehydrogenase; isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, human; Article; cancer incidence; cancer tissue; controlled study; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line; evaluation study; gene mutation; gene overexpression; human; human cell; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; priority journal; pyrosequencing; dna mutational analysis; enzymology; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; genetics; HeLa cell line; high throughput sequencing; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; mutation; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; reproducibility; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Mutational Analysis; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Glutarates; HeLa Cells; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; MCF-7 Cells; Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reproducibility of Results"
"A New Dataset on Horizontal Structural Ethnic Inequalities in Thailand in Order to Address Sustainable Development Goal 10",2019,"Thailand is the world’s fourth most unequal country by wealth, but past research on this phenomenon has mainly been along individual or geographic lines as the census is insufficiently detailed to provide ethnic-based measures. This article introduces an innovative methodological solution to measure horizontal inequality in countries where the census excludes ethnicity. We investigate the roots of a structural ‘ethnic penalty’ by contextualising in some detail an ethnic gap in Thai public policies concerning poverty and inequality. Then, using data from the United Nations Development Programme’s ‘Human Achievement Index’ for Thailand, the Thai Office of the National Culture Commission’s Ethnolinguistic Maps of Thailand report, and Thai National Statistical Office population and poverty data, we compile the country’s first dataset on horizontal (between-group) inequality by ethnicity. Employing this novel approach, we then examine the eight sectors in the Human Achievement Index: health, education, employment, income, housing and living environment, transport and communication, family and community life, and participation. Describing how Thailand’s major ethnic groups fare in each sector and comparing inequality amongst sectors, this ethnolinguistics-based approach provides evidence of a significant ‘ethnic penalty’ in Thailand and makes initial recommendations for addressing the issue. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","data set; ethnic minority; ethnicity; human development index; poverty; quality of life; sustainable development; Thailand"
"Perception of a “good death” in Thai patients with cancer and their relatives",2019,"Background: Understanding the perceptions regarding what constitutes a “good death” among cancer patients and their families could help healthcare teams to ensure proper palliative and supportive care. Objectives: To demonstrate and compare the wishes cancer patients and the perceptions of their relatives regarding end-of-life care, and to identify factors associated with patients' preferences regarding place of death. Methods: A sample of cancer patients and their relatives who attended the Srinagarind Hospital (Thailand) oncology clinic or day chemotherapy from September 2017 to August 2018 were enrolled. Questionnaires were given to the participants, in which the patients were asked to respond based on their own end-of-life preferences, and relatives were asked to imagine how the patients would respond to the questions. Results: One hundred eighty pairs of patients and relatives were recruited. Respondents in both groups placed importance on place of death, relationship with family, physical and psychological comfort, and relationship with the medical staff. Both groups generally agreed with the statements on the questionnaire (10/13 statements). Relatives underestimated the preferences of the patients in 3 areas: “not being a burden to others,” “preparation for death,” and “physical and psychological comfort.” Being married (adjusted odds ratio (AOD) 6.4, 95%confidence interval (CI) 1.1,36.5), having had more than 6 years of education (AOD 6.5, 95%CI 1.8,23.7), having lung cancer compared to colon cancer (AOD 12, 95%CI 1.2,118.7), duration after cancer diagnosis (AOD 0.9, 95%CI 0.93,0.99), previous hospital admission (AOD 5.7, 95%CI 1.5,21.2), and life satisfaction (AOD 17.6, 95%CI 2.9,104.9) were factors associated with preference for home death. Conclusion: Thai cancer patients and their relatives indicated similar preferences with regard to what constitutes a good death and patients' wishes for their end-of-life period. However, the patients' relatives underestimated the importance patients placed on statements in three domains. Factors that influenced a preference for a home death were identified. ? 2019 The Author(s)",""

"Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in Heart Failure Patients with Left Ventricular Assist Device",2019,"Background: There is limited data in the literature evaluating outcomes of bariatric surgery in severely obese patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to make them acceptable candidates for heart transplantation. This study aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients with previously implanted LVAD at our institution. Methods: All the patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF) and implanted LVAD who underwent LSG from2013 to January 2017 were studied. Results: Seven patients with end stage heart failure (ESHF) and implanted LVAD were included. The median age and median preoperative BMI were 39?years (range: 26–62) and 43.6?kg/m2 (range 36.7–56.7), respectively. The median interval between LVAD implantation and LSG was 38?months (range 15–48). The median length of hospital stay was 9?days (rang: 6–23) out of which 4 patients had planned postoperative ICU admission. Thirty-day complications were noted in 5 patients (3 major and 2 minor) without any perioperative mortality. The median duration of follow-up was 24?months (range 2–30). At the last available follow-up, the median BMI, %EWL, and %TWL were 37?kg/m2, 47%, and 16%, respectively. The median LVEF before LSG and at the last follow-up point (before heart transplant) was 19% (range 15–20) and 22% (range, 16–35), respectively. In addition, the median NYHA class improved from 3 to 2 after LSG. Three patients underwent successful heart transplantations. Conclusion: Patients with morbid obesity, ESHF, and implanted LVAD constitute a high-risk cohort. Our results with 7 patients and result from other studies (19 patients) suggested that bariatric surgery may be a reasonable option for LVAD patients with severe obesity. Bariatric surgery appears to provide significant weight loss in these patients and may improve candidacy for heart transplantation. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; bariatric surgery; body mass; body weight loss; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; device infection; end stage heart failure; female; follow up; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart transplantation; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; length of stay; male; morbid obesity; mortality rate; New York Heart Association class; outcome assessment; patient safety; postoperative care; postoperative complication; priority journal; surgical technique; treatment duration; treatment planning; adverse event; complication; gastrectomy; heart assist device; heart failure; heart stroke volume; laparoscopy; middle aged; morbid obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Adult; Bariatric Surgery; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Female; Gastrectomy; Heart Failure; Heart Transplantation; Heart-Assist Devices; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity, Morbid; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss"
"Characterisation of the Urinary Metabolic Profile of Liver Fluke-Associated Cholangiocarcinoma",2019,"Background: Human infection with Opisthorchis viverrini, a carcinogenic liver fluke inhabiting the biliary tree, is endemic in Southeast Asia. Chronic infection is associated with a fatal complication, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a late-presenting and aggressive malignancy. Currently, annual mortality rates from CCA mirror trends in incidence, due in part to limited availability of efficient prognostic and early diagnostic biomarkers. With ability to detect thousands of urinary metabolites using metabonomics, the urine metabolome holds great potential in providing an insight into system-level alterations in carcinogenesis and in identifying metabolic markers altered in response to disturbed homoeostasis. Methods: Global molecular profiling using reversed-phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was utilised to acquire the urinary spectral profile of 137 Thai subjects (48 at high risk of infection, 41 with O. viverrini infection, 34 periportal fibrosis and 14 CCA) from Khon Kaen, Thailand. Results: Multivariate statistical analysis identified perturbation in several molecular classes related to purine metabolism and lipid metabolism in the CCA urine metabolome. These markers mainly reflect changes in energy metabolism to support proliferation (increased fatty acid oxidation and purine recycling), DNA methylation and hepatic injury. Conclusions: Several metabolites of biological interest were discovered from this proof-of-principle dataset. Augmenting these findings is essential to accelerate the development of urinary metabolic markers in CCA. ? 2019 The Authors","1 methylhypoxanthine; 2 naphthoic acid derivative; 2 trans,4 decadienoylcarnitine; 2,6 dimethylheptanoylcarnitine; 3 amino 2 naphthoic acid; 7 methylguanine; acylcarnitine; benzoic acid derivative; betaine derivative; butyrylcarnitine; carnitine derivative; citric acid; creatinine; glycocholic acid; hippuric acid; hypoxanthine; hypoxanthine derivative; isocitric acid; leucyl proline; levacecarnine; n methyluric acid; n sulfooxybenzoate; phenylalanine; proline; proline betaine; proline derivative; purine; unclassified drug; uric acid; uric acid derivative; valerylcarnitine; adult; aged; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; DNA methylation; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; female; human; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver injury; major clinical study; male; metabolomics; opisthorchiasis; priority journal; purine metabolism; reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography; Thailand; urinalysis"
"Temporal changes in head and neck cancer incidence in Thailand suggest changing oropharyngeal epidemiology in the region",2019,"PURPOSE Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, and the largest burden occurs in developing countries. Although the primary risk factors have been well characterized, little is known about temporal trends in head and neck cancer across Thailand. METHODS Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) occurrences diagnosed between 1990 and 2014 were selected by International Classification of Diseases (10th revision; ICD10) code from the Songkhla, Lampang, Chiang Mai, and Khon Kaen cancer registries and the US SEER program for oral cavity (ICD10 codes 00, 03-06), tongue (ICD10 codes 01-02), pharynx (ICD10 codes 09-10, 12-14), and larynx (ICD10 code 32). The data were analyzed using R and Joinpoint regression software to determine age-standardized incidence rates and trends of annual percent change (APC). Incidence rates were standardized using the Segi (1960) population. Stratified linear regression models were conducted to assess temporal trends in early-onset HNSCC across 20-year age groups. RESULTS Although overall HNSCC rates are decreasing across all registries, subsite analyses demonstrate consistent decreases in both larynx and oral cavity cancers but suggest increases in tongue cancers among both sexes in the United States (APCmen, 2.36; APCwomen, 0.77) and in pharyngeal cancer in Khon Kaen and US men (APC, 2.1 and 2.23, respectively). Age-stratified APC analyses to assess young-onset (&lt; 60 years old) trends demonstrated increased incidence in tongue cancer in Thailand and the United States as well as in pharyngeal cancers in Khon Kaen men age 40 to 59 years and US men age 50 to 59 years. CONCLUSION Although overall trends in HNSCC are decreasing across both Thailand and the United States, there is reason to believe that the etiologic shift to oropharyngeal cancers in the United States may be occurring in Thailand.

"Differential trafficking of albumin and IgG facilitated by the neonatal Fc receptor in podocytes in vitro and in vivo",2019,"Proteinuria is strongly associated with kidney disease progression but the mechanisms underlying podocyte handling of serum proteins such as albumin and IgG remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that albumin and IgG are transcytosed by podocytes in vitro. In other epithelial cells, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is required to salvage albumin and IgG from the degradative pathway thereby allowing these proteins to be transcytosed or recycled. Here we directly examine the role of FcRn in albumin and IgG trafficking in podocytes by studying handling of these proteins in FcRn knockout (KO) podocytes in vitro and in a podocyte-specific FcRn knockout mice in vivo. In vitro, we find that knockout of FcRn leads to IgG accumulation in podocytes but does not alter albumin trafficking. Similarly, in vivo, podocyte-specific knockout of FcRn does not result in albumin accumulation in podocytes in vivo as measured by mean albumin fluorescence intensity whereas these mice demonstrate significant intraglomerular accumulation of IgG over time. In addition we find that podocyte-specific FcRn KO mice demonstrate mesangial expansion as they age and activation of mesangial cells as demonstrated by increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin. Taken together, these results suggest that trafficking pathways for albumin and IgG differ in podocytes and that sustained disruption of trafficking of plasma proteins alters glomerular structure. ? 2019 Dylewski et al.

"Molecular identification and genetic diversity of Gnathostoma spinigerum larvae in freshwater fishes in southern Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar",2019,"Gnathostomiasis, an emerging food-borne parasitic zoonosis in Asia, is mainly caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum (Nematoda: Gnathostomatidae). Consumption of raw meat or freshwater fishes in endemic areas is the major risk factor. Throughout Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar, freshwater fish are often consumed raw or undercooked. The risk of this practice for gnathostomiasis infection in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar has never been evaluated. Here, we identified larvae of Gnathostoma species contaminating freshwater fishes sold at local markets in these three countries. Public health authorities should advise people living in, or travelling to, these areas to avoid eating raw or undercooked freshwater fishes. Identification of larvae was done using molecular methods: DNA was sequenced from Gnathostoma advanced third-stage larvae recovered from snakehead fishes (Channa striata) and freshwater swamp eels (Monopterus albus). Phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene showed that the G. spinigerum sequences recovered from southern Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar samples had high similarity to those of G. spinigerum from China. Sequences of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 region closely resembled sequences of G. spinigerum from Thailand, Indonesia, the USA, and central Lao PDR. This is the first molecular evidence of G. spinigerum from freshwater fishes in southern Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cytochrome c oxidase; fresh water; protozoal DNA; spacer DNA; animal; Cambodia; classification; fish; food poisoning; genetic variation; genetics; Gnathostoma; gnathostomiasis; Indonesia; isolation and purification; Laos; larva; Myanmar; parasitology; phylogeny; Smegmamorpha; veterinary medicine; zoonosis; Anguilla; Animals; Cambodia; DNA, Intergenic; DNA, Protozoan; Electron Transport Complex IV; Fishes; Foodborne Diseases; Fresh Water; Genetic Variation; Gnathostoma; Gnathostomiasis; Indonesia; Laos; Larva; Myanmar; Phylogeny; Smegmamorpha; Zoonoses"
"Dependency of Cholangiocarcinoma on Cyclin D–Dependent Kinase Activity",2019,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a bile duct cancer with a very poor prognosis. Currently, there is no effective pharmacological treatment available for it. We showed that CCA ubiquitously relies on cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) activity to proliferate. Primary CCA tissues express high levels of cyclin D1 and the specific marker of CDK4/6 activity, phospho-RB Ser780. Treatment of a 15-CCA cell line collection by pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibitors leads to reduced numbers of cells in the S-phase and senescence in most of the CCA cell lines. We found that expression of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is required for activity of the CDK4/6 inhibitor, and that loss of pRB conferred CDK4/6 inhibitor-drug resistance. We also identified that sensitivity of CCA to CDK4/6 inhibition is associated with the activated KRAS signature. Effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibition for CCA was confirmed in the three-dimensional spheroid-, xenograft-, and patient-derived xenograft models. Last, we identified a list of genes whose expressions can be used to predict response to the CDK4/6 inhibitor. Conclusion: We investigated a ubiquitous dependency of CCA on CDK4/6 activity and the universal response to CDK4/6 inhibition. We propose that the CDK4/6-pRB pathway is a suitable therapeutic target for CCA treatment. ? 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","abemaciclib; cyclin D1; cyclin D2; cyclin D3; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin dependent kinase 6; cytokeratin 19; Ki 67 antigen; palbociclib; protein p16; retinoblastoma protein; ribociclib; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cell aging; controlled study; drug response; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; female; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression profiling; human; human cell; human tissue; KKU-M214 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene K ras; priority journal; protein expression; regulator gene; S phase cell cycle checkpoint; tumor spheroid; tumor xenograft"
"O-GlcNAc-induced nuclear translocation of hnRNP-K is associated with progression and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma",2019,"O-GlcNAcylation is a key post-translational modification that modifies the functions of proteins. Associations between O-GlcNAcylation, shorter survival of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients, and increased migration/invasion of CCA cell lines have been reported. However, the specific O-GlcNAcylated proteins (OGPs) that participate in promotion of CCA progression are poorly understood. OGPs were isolated from human CCA cell lines, KKU-213 and KKU-214, using a click chemistry-based enzymatic labeling system, identified using LC-MS/MS, and searched against an OGP database. From the proteomic analysis, a total of 21 OGPs related to cancer progression were identified, of which 12 have not been previously reported. Among these, hnRNP-K, a multifaceted RNA- and DNA-binding protein known as a pre-mRNA-binding protein, was one of the most abundantly expressed, suggesting its involvement in CCA progression. O-GlcNAcylation of hnRNP-K was further verified by anti-OGP/anti-hnRNP-K immunoprecipitations and sWGA pull-down assays. The perpetuation of CCA by hnRNP-K was evaluated using siRNA, which revealed modulation of cyclin D1, XIAP, EMT markers, and MMP2 and MMP7 expression. In native CCA cells, hnRNP-K was primarily localized in the nucleus; however, when O-GlcNAcylation was suppressed, hnRNP-K was retained in the cytoplasm. These data signify an association between nuclear accumulation of hnRNP-K and the migratory capabilities of CCA cells. In human CCA tissues, expression of nuclear hnRNP-K was positively correlated with high O-GlcNAcylation levels, metastatic stage, and shorter survival of CCA patients. This study demonstrates the significance of O-GlcNAcylation on the nuclear translocation of hnRNP-K and its impact on the progression of CCA. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Impact of heart failure on stroke mortality and recurrence",2019,"Objective We aimed to examine the impact of heart failure (HF) on stroke mortality (in-hospital and postdischarge) and recurrence in a national stroke cohort from Thailand. Methods We used a large, insurance-based database including all stroke admissions in the public health sector in Thailand between 2004 and 2015. Logistic and Royston-Parmar regressions were used to quantify the effect of HF on in-hospital and long-Term outcomes, respectively. All models were adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities and stratified by stroke type: Acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) or intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Multistate models were constructed using flexible survival techniques to predict the impact of HF on the disease course of a patient with stroke (baseline-[recurrence]-death). Only first-ever cases of AIS or ICH were included in the multistate analysis. Results 608 890 patients (mean age 64.29±13.72 years, 55.07% men) were hospitalised (370 527 AIS, 173 236 ICH and 65 127 undetermined pathology). There were 398 663 patients with first-ever AIS and ICH. Patients were followed up for a median (95% CI) of 4.47 years (4.45 to 4.49). HF was associated with an increase in postdischarge mortality in AIS (HR [99% CI] 1.69 [1.64 to 1.74]) and ICH (2.59 [2.07 to 3.26]). HF was not associated with AIS recurrence, while ICH recurrence was only significantly increased within the first 3 years after discharge (1.79 [1.18 to 2.73]). Conclusions HF increases the risk of mortality in both AIS and ICH. We are the first to report on high-risk periods of stroke recurrence in patients with HF with ICH. Specific targeted risk reduction strategies may have significant clinical impact for mortality and recurrence in stroke. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

"Urine proteomics study reveals potential biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and periductal fibrosis",2019,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a primary malignant tumor of the epithelial lining of biliary track associated with endemic Opisthorchis viverrini (Ov) infection in northeastern Thailand. Ov-associated periductal fibrosis (PDF) is the precancerous lesion for CCA, and can be detected by ultrasonography (US) to facilitate early detection. However, US cannot be used to distinguish PDF from cancer. Therefore, the objective of this study was to discover and qualify potential urine biomarkers for CCA detection in at-risk population. Biomarker discovery was conducted on pooled urine samples, 42 patients per group, with PDF or normal bile duct confirmed by ultrasound. After depletion of high abundance proteins, 338 urinary proteins were identified from the 3 samples (normal-US, PDF-US, CCA). Based on fold change and literature review, 70 candidate proteins were selected for qualification by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) in 90 individual urine samples, 30 per group. An orthogonal signal correction projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) multivariate model constructed from the 70 candidate biomarkers significantly discriminated CCA from normal and PDF groups (P = 0.003). As an independent validation, the expression of 3 candidate proteins was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in CCA tissues: Lysosome associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1), lysosome associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP2) and cadherin-related family member 2 (CDHR2). Further evaluation of these candidate biomarkers in a larger cohort is needed to support their applicability in a clinical setting for screening and monitoring early CCA and for CCA surveillance. ? 2019 Duangkumpha et al.

"Molecular characterization of Plasmodium juxtanucleare in Thai native fowls based on partial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene",2019,"Avian malaria is one of the most important general blood parasites of poultry in Southeast Asia. Plasmodium (P.) juxtanucleare causes avian malaria in wild and domestic fowl. This study aimed to identify and characterize the Plasmodium species infecting in Thai native fowl. Blood samples were collected for microscopic examination, followed by detection of the Plasmodium cox I gene by using PCR. Five of the 10 sampled fowl had the desired 588 base pair amplicons. Sequence analysis of the five amplicons indicated that the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were homologous to each other and were closely related (100% identity) to a P. juxtanucleare strain isolated in Japan (AB250415). Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree of the cox I gene showed that the P. juxtanucleare in this study were grouped together and clustered with the Japan strain. The presence of P. juxtanucleare described in this study is the first report of P. juxtanucleare in the Thai native fowl of Thailand. ? 2019 Korean Society of Veterinary Science.

"Serologic prevalence of syphilis in acute ischemic stroke",2019,"Background: Syphilis is a sexual-transmitted infectious disease that can cause stoke in elderly, called neurosyphilis. Objective: The authors determined the serologic prevalence of syphilis and associated factors in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Materials and Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was performed during 1 September 2015 to 31 January 2017. A total 466 patients who admitted in stroke unit of Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, were included. Syphilis serologic test (VDRL and TPHA) were tested. Data regarding, age, gender, severity (NIHS score), stroke classification (TOAST) were collected to assess factors influencing seropositive patients. Seropositive patients were defined as the patients who had positive test for VDRL and/or TPHA. Results: Of 466 AIS patients tested. The serologic prevalence of syphilis in AIS patients was 12.6%. Median age was 75.2 years (IQR 70.3 to 84.2) in seropositive patients, compare to seronegative patients which had 63.7 years (IQR: 54.9 to 74.0, p<0.01]. Other associated factors, such as gender, severity (NIHS score), and TOAST could not show statistically significant. Conclusion: Syphilis in AIS patients in Khon Kean was modest, therefore, clinician should perform syphilis serologic test in elderly AIS patients. ?

"Genetic variation of Enterobius vermicularis among schoolchildren in Thailand",2020,"Enterobiasis, caused by the nematode Enterobius vermicularis, is a common health problem among schoolchildren in Thailand. We provide the first molecular identification of this nematode from Thai schoolchildren and document genetic variation among E. Vermicularis eggs using sequence analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene and the nuclear ribosomal DNA second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2). A cross-sectional parasitological survey was conducted in schoolchildren (n = 491) in five regions of Thailand between May 2015 and December 2016. The diagnosis of Enterobius infection was made using the adhesive tape perianal swab technique. Enterobius eggs were recovered from 43 participants (8.75%). DNA was extracted from these eggs and the cox1 gene and partial ITS2 region amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nineteen amplified PCR products of the cox1 gene (441 bp) and 18 of the ITS2 region (623 bp) were subsequently sequenced. All sequences were identified as belonging to E. Vermicularis based on database searches. Phylogenetic analysis and a median-joining network of available E. Vermicularis cox1 sequences showed 66 haplotypes. We found haploclusters (types A and B) represented among the Thai sequences. Six haplotypes from Thailand fell into type A (of Nakano et al., 2006) (along with sequences from Japan and Korea) and five haplotypes into type B (with sequences from Japan, Iran, Czech Republic, Greece, Denmark and Sudan). The overall haplotype diversity (Hd) was 0.9888. Transmission of worms with type B haplotypes from primates to humans in Asia or from humans in Europe possibly occurs in Thailand. Copyright ?

"The stimulation of GV20 with laser produces neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing effects by improving cholinergic function, oxidative stress status and apoptosis in hippocampus",2019,"Background: The cognitive impairment in menopause with obesity is rising in accompany with the increased prevalence of menopause and obesity. Laser application can improve oxidative stress status and neurodegeneration in hippocampus together with memory enhancement. Therefore, the beneficial effect of laser stimulation at GV20, one of the acupoints commonly used for treating dementia, on memory impairment and neurodegeneration in menopause with obesity has been considered. Objective: To elucidate this issue, the present study aimed to determine the neuroprotective and memory enhancing effects of GV20 stimulation with red laser on in animal model of menopause with obesity. Materials and Methods: Female Wistar rats were exposed to the bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) and fed with high fat diet for 16 weeks. Then, OVX rats which fed with diet were exposed to a 10 minute-stimulation with red laser once daily for 14 days. Spatial memory was assessed every 7 days. At the end of study period, acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), an oxidative stress status and apoptosis were measured. Results: It was found that GV20 stimulation enhanced spatial memory and neurons densities in CA1, CA2, CA3 and Dentate gyrus of hippocampus. The decreased AChE, MDA and Bax+ cells density together with the increase in SOD, CAT, GPx and Bcl-2+ cells in hippocampus were also observed. Conclusion: Taken all together, the neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing effects of GV20 stimulation by red laser might occur via the improvements of cholinergic, oxidative stress status and apoptosis. ?

"Clinical Presentation of Influenza in Children 6 to 35 Months of Age: Findings from a Randomized Clinical Trial of Inactivated Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine",2019,"Background: In an exploratory analysis of an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) trial in children 6-35 months without risk factors for influenza, we evaluated clinical presentation of influenza illness and vaccine impact on health outcomes. Methods: This phase III trial was conducted in 13 geographically diverse countries across 5 influenza seasons (2011-2014). Children were randomized 1:1 to IIV4 or control. Active surveillance was performed for influenza-like episodes (ILE); influenza was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The total vaccinated cohort was evaluated (N = 12,018). Results: 5702 children experienced ?1 ILE; 356 (IIV4 group) and 693 (control group) children had RT-PCR-confirmed influenza. Prevalence of ILE was similar in RT-PCR-positive and RT-PCR-negative cases regardless of vaccination. Breakthrough influenza illness was attenuated in children vaccinated with IIV4; moderate-to-severe illness was 41% less likely to be reported in the IIV4 group than the control group [crude odds ratio: 0.59 (95% confidence intervals: 0.44-0.77)]. Furthermore, fever >39°C was 46% less frequent following vaccination with IIV4 than with control [crude odds ratio: 0.54 (95% confidence intervals: 0.39-0.75)] in children with breakthrough illness. Health outcome analysis showed that, each year, IIV4 would prevent 54 influenza cases per 1000 children and 19 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 new influenza case. Conclusions: In addition to preventing influenza in 50% of participants, IIV4 attenuated illness severity and disease burden in children who had a breakthrough influenza episode despite vaccination. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Heavy metal accumulation in frogs surrounding an e-waste dump site and human health risk assessment",2019,"This study was performed heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, and Pb) in water, soil and frogs around an electronic-waste dump site. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of heavy metals in three frog species and potential human health risks were assessed. Heavy metals were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The Cd and Pb concentrations in water samples and As and Pb concentrations in soil samples from within the e-waste dump site exceeded the standards. The heavy metal concentrations in the muscles of three frog species were as follows: Cr > Pb > As > Cd, and there were no significant differences among frog species except in the case of Pb (p < 0.05). Only the Cr concentrations exceeded the food quality standards. The relative order of the BAFs for heavy metals in frogs as a result of uptake from the water and soil was Cr > As > Pb > Cd and Cr > As > Cd > Pb, respectively, which indicated that the uptake from water was greater than that from the soil.

In the past two decades, the number of obese patients increased at an alarming rate. Objective: To investigate natural history of anesthesia or surgical related complications, contributing factor and corrective strategies in patients whose body mass index (BMI) was equal or higher than 35 kg/m2. Materials and Methods: The present study was prospective descriptive study. After being approved by each Institutional Ethical Committee, written informed consents were waived. Each hospital was asked to anonymously report incidence of anesthesia related adverse events. Two thousand two hundred six incidence reports were provided. Patient with a BMI equal or over 35 kg/m2 that underwent surgery were selected from the incident reports. Data were discussed and analyzed by three senior anesthesiologists for contributing factors, clinical courses, factors minimizing incident, and suggested corrective strategies. Results: Fifty-eight cases (2.63%) from the 2,206 reports of the PAAd Thai Study met the inclusion definition and were reviewed. Seventy-eight incidents occurred from 3,028 critical incidents reports (2.57%), one-third was male and the rest were female. The average age was 39.96±6.72 year and BMI was 39.8±5.1 kg/m2. The highest incidence occurred in patients with BMI 35 to 39.9 kg/m2 (65.52%). Half was classified as the ASA physical status 3. The adverse events were found more frequent in elective surgery (40 incidents or 68.96%) than emergency surgery. General surgery such as laparotomy had higher incidence compared to other surgical specialties. Oxygen desaturation was the most common incident (51.7%). Severe arrhythmia, difficult intubation, and cardiac arrest in 24 hours post-operatively were found in the same frequency (12.1%). Contributing factors from the present report were inadequate preanesthetic evaluation and preparation, inexperience, inappropriate decision, and urgency. Having experiences, more vigilance, and experienced assistant or effective supervision were factors for minimizing outcomes.

"Melatonin protects against methotrexate-induced memory deficit and hippocampal neurogenesis impairment in a rat model",2019,"Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapy agent linked to cognitive deficits in cancer patients received chemotherapy treatment. MTX decreases cell proliferation in the hippocampus, which is concomitant with cognitive deficits in animal models. The present study aimed to investigate the disadvantages of MTX on cognition associated with cell division, survival, and immature neurons involved in hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as the practical neuroprotective effects of melatonin. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given two injections of MTX (75 mg/kg) on days 8 and 15 followed by Leucovorin (LCV, 6 mg/kg) at hours 18, 26, 42, 50 via i.p. injection. Some rats received co-treatment with melatonin (8 mg/kg, i.p. injection) for 15 days before and during MTX administration (preventive), 15 days after MTX administration (recovery), or both (30 days total; throughout). Hippocampal-dependent memory was examined using novel objection location (NOL) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Cell division, survival and immature neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampus were evaluated using immunofluorescence staining. Rats given MTX/LCV were found to have cognitive memory deterioration based on the NOL and NOR tests. Moreover, reductions in cell division, cell survival, and the numbers of immature neurons were detected in the MTX/LCV group when compared to the controls. This damage was not observed in rats in the preventive, recovery, or throughout groups. These findings reveal that melatonin has the potential to diminish the negative effects of MTX on memory and neurogenesis. This also indicates the benefit of melatonin co-administration in patients who undergo chemotherapy treatment. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","broxuridine; folinic acid; melatonin; methotrexate; melatonin; methotrexate; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell division; cell proliferation; cell survival; cognition; developmental disorder; drug effect; drug mechanism; hippocampus; immunofluorescence; male; memory disorder; nerve cell; nervous system development; nonhuman; novel object recognition test; priority journal; rat; animal; animal behavior; hippocampus; memory disorder; nervous system development; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cell Proliferation; Hippocampus; Male; Melatonin; Memory Disorders; Methotrexate; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley"

"Effect of CYP3A5 genotype on hospitalization cost for kidney transplantation",2019,"Background Dosage quantities of tacrolimus (TAC) vary according to cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) genotype. Genotyping is expected to optimize the response to TAC response and to minimize adverse effects. In Thailand, kidney transplantation is reimbursable with the same diagnosis-related group payment regardless of patient’s CYP3A5 genotype. Objective This study aimed to determine the costs of TAC administration, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), and hospitalization for kidney transplantation across CYP3A5*1/*1, *1/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes. Setting A single transplant center in a university hospital. Method This is an observational study that collected data from patients pooled from both arms of a randomized controlled trial that tested initial doses of TAC. Main outcome measure TAC and TDM cost and hospitalization cost for transplantation were compared between genotypes. Results The CYP3A5*1/*1 patients had the highest median combined TAC–TDM cost and hospitalization cost ($1062 and $9097), followed by CYP3A5*1/*3 ($859 and $6467) and CYP3A5*3/*3 patients ($761 and $5604). The CYP3A5*1/*1 patients had a higher hospitalization cost by $2787 over the CYP3A5*1/*3 patients, despite marginal significance. The CYP3A5*1/*1 patients had a significantly higher cost of TAC plus TDM (by $309) and hospitalization cost (by $3275) than the CYP3A5*3/*3 patients. Both study costs were significantly higher in patients with delayed graft functioning than in patients with instant or slow graft functioning. Conclusion The benefits of genotype detection in patients with CYP3A5*1/*1 should be considered for a higher reimbursement rate because of the substantial differences in total hospitalization cost for kidney transplantation among patients with different CYP3A5 genotypes. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","basiliximab; methylprednisolone; mycophenolate mofetil; mycophenolic acid; prednisolone; tacrolimus; CYP3A5 protein, human; cytochrome P450 3A; immunosuppressive agent; tacrolimus; adult; Article; comparative study; controlled study; CYP3A5 1 1 gene; CYP3A5 1 3 gene; CYP3A5 3 3 gene; delayed graft function; drug cost; drug dose reduction; drug effect; drug monitoring; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; female; genotype; hospitalization cost; human; kidney disease; kidney transplantation; major clinical study; male; observational study; outcome assessment; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; reimbursement; university hospital; economics; genetics; hospital cost; hospitalization; kidney transplantation; middle aged; trends; Adult; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Female; Genotype; Hospital Costs; Hospitalization; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Tacrolimus"

"Effects of aestivation on survival of Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos snails and the infection of Opisthorchis viverrini in the irrigation area of wet- and dry-season rice paddy",2019,"The snail Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos acts as the first intermediate host of the human liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, a major cause of cholangiocarcinoma in Northeast Thailand. In this study, we investigated host-parasite interactions in wet- and dry-season rice paddy plantation. The snails that aestivated through 4-month-dried period after rice harvest had average mortality rate of 36.45% and monthly increasing from 17.76% to 54.57%. Surprisingly, at depths greater than 5 cm experienced a higher mortality rate than upper level. Average mortality rate at the depth more than 5 cm, was 42.97%. In the initial month of aestivation, mortality rate of 0–5 and 5–10 cm depth was 9.13% and 26.39% then increase to 57.58% and 51.97%, respectively in the last 4th month. The average prevalence O. viverrini infection in snails during the study period was 0.44%. The highest prevalence of O. viverrini infection was found in the cool dry and wet season. The odds of O. viverrini infection in female snails and large snails were higher relative to male snails and medium-sized snails. The physicochemical factors involved in increased prevalence of O. viverrini infection in snail hosts were mean daily air temperature and average monthly rainfall. Short aestivation period made lower mortality in irrigation area than the previous report of non-irrigation area, that is, the aestivation is one of snail population control. ? 2019","rain; dry season; estivation; host-parasite interaction; irrigation; paddy field; parasite; snail; survival; wet season; aestivation; air temperature; Article; Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos; controlled study; cool dry season; dry season rice paddy; host parasite interaction; irrigation (agriculture); mortality rate; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; parasite transmission; physical chemistry; plantation; population dynamics; prevalence; rice; season; snail; survival rate; wet season; wet season rice paddy; aestivation; agriculture; animal; female; host parasite interaction; male; opisthorchiasis; Oryza; parasitology; physiology; season; snail; temperature; Thailand; veterinary medicine; Thailand; Bithynia; Fasciola hepatica; Gastropoda; Opisthorchis viverrini; Agriculture; Animals; Estivation; Female; Host-Parasite Interactions; Male; Opisthorchiasis; Oryza; Seasons; Snails; Temperature; Thailand"
"Accuracy of urine and serum assays for the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis by three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protocols",2019,"To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of urine assay for the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis, three different immunoassays were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of anti-Strongyloides immunoglobulin G (IgG) in urine and compared with those in serum samples. Analyses by InBios enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (recombinant NIE antigen), SciMedx ELISA kit (Strongyloides stercoralis antigen), and our in-house ELISA (Strongyloides ratti antigen) yielded comparable diagnostic performances between urine and serum assays. Levels of Strongyloides-specific IgG in urine significantly correlated with those in serum. Tests for diagnostic agreement between urine and serum IgG assays showed substantial to fair agreement (κ = 0.207–0.615). The observed quantitative and qualitative concordance between urine and serum assays in strongyloidiasis suggests that urine has similar diagnostic value to that for serum. Because of the ease and noninvasiveness of clinical sample collection, urine assay has a high potential for the initial diagnosis and mass screening of strongyloidiasis.

"Hesperidin alleviates methotrexate-induced memory deficits via hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rats",2019,"Methotrexate (MTX), a folic acid antagonist, is widely used in cancer treatment. However, treatment with MTX reduces hippocampal neurogenesis, leading to memory deficits. Hesperidin (Hsd) is a flavonoid glycoside that promotes anti-inflammation, acts as an antioxidant, and has neuroprotective properties. Consumption of Hsd enhances learning and memory. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of Hsd against MTX-induced impairments of memory and neurogenesis; male Sprague Dawley rats were administered with a single dose of MTX (75 mg/kg) by intravenous (i.v.) injection on days 8 and 15 or Hsd (100 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 21 days. Memory was tested using novel object location (NOL) and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks. Immunofluorescence staining of Ki-67, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and doublecortin (DCX) was performed to assess cell proliferation, survival, and immature neurons. The data showed that Hsd and MTX did not disable locomotor ability. The MTX animals exhibited memory deficits in both memory tests. There were significant decreases in the numbers of cell proliferation, survival, and immature neurons in the MTX animals. However, co-administration with MTX and Hsd alleviated memory loss and neurogenesis decline. These results revealed that Hsd could protect against MTX side effects in the animals in this study ? 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Antitumor effects of flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, on human cholangiocarcinoma in vitro and in an in vivo xenograft model",2019,"Flavopiridol, a pan-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)inhibitor, was recently identified as an effective antitumor agent for several cancers. We investigated the antitumor effect of flavopiridol on cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), in vitro and in vivo. A methylthiotetrazole assay revealed that the proliferation of certain CCA cells was inhibited by flavopiridol, which induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis of CCA cells. Although increased cell cycle arrest was observed at the G2/M phase, caspase activation occurred earlier than 24 h, indicating that caspase-dependent apoptosis is the major pathway for the suppression of cell proliferation. Flavopiridol potently reduced the CCA tumor growth in a xenograft model without observable adverse effects. These findings indicated that flavopiridol could be a potential antitumor agent for the treatment of CCA. ? 2019",""
"Spatial and temporal patterns of dengue incidence in northeastern Thailand 2006-2016",2019,"Background: Dengue, a viral disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, is an important public health concern throughout Thailand. Climate variables are potential predictors of dengue transmission. Associations between climate variables and dengue have usually been performed on large-scale first-level national administrative divisions, i.e. provinces. Here we analyze data on a finer spatial resolution in one province, which is often more relevant for effective disease control design. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of seasonal variations, monthly climate variability, and to identify local clusters of symptomatic disease at the sub-district level based on reported dengue cases. Methods: Data on dengue cases were retrieved from the national communicable disease surveillance system in Thailand. Between 2006 and 2016, 15,167 cases were recorded in 199 sub-districts of Khon Kaen Province, northeastern Thailand. Descriptive analyses included demographic characteristics and temporal patterns of disease and climate variables. The association between monthly disease incidence and climate variations was analyzed at the sub-district level using Bayesian Poisson spatial regression. A hotspot analysis was used to assess the spatial patterns (clustered/dispersed/random) of dengue incidence. Results: Dengue was predominant in the 5-14 year-old age group (51.1%). However, over time, dengue incidence in the older age groups (> 15 years) gradually increased and was the most affected group in 2013. Dengue outbreaks coincide with the rainy season. In the spatial regression model, maximum temperature was associated with higher incidence. The hotspot analysis showed clustering of cases around the urbanized area of Khon Kaen city and in rural areas in the southwestern portion of the province. Conclusions: There was an increase in the number of reported dengue cases in older age groups over the study period. Dengue incidence was highly seasonal and positively associated with maximum ambient temperature. However, climatic variables did not explain all the spatial variation of dengue in the province. Further analyses are needed to clarify the detailed effects of urbanization and other potential environmental risk factors. These results provide useful information for ongoing prediction modeling and developing of dengue early warning systems to guide vector control operations. ? 2019 The Author(s).","rain; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; climate change; dengue; disease association; disease severity; environmental temperature; epidemic; female; groups by age; human; incidence; infant; major clinical study; male; middle aged; physical parameters; rural area; seasonal variation; sex difference; spatial pattern; symptomatology; temporal pattern; Thailand; urban area; animal; Bayes theorem; city; cluster analysis; dengue; incidence; preschool child; season; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Cities; Cluster Analysis; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Rain; Seasons; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Temperature; Thailand"
"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants for Stroke Prevention in Thai Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation and a High Risk of Bleeding",2019,"Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of direct-acting oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in Thai patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a HAS-BLED score of 3. Methods: Total costs (US$) in 2017 and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated over 20?years using a Markov model. A base-case analysis was conducted under a societal perspective, which included direct healthcare, non-healthcare and indirect costs in Thailand. Clinical events for warfarin and utilities were obtained from Thai patients whenever possible. The efficacy of direct-acting oral anticoagulants was derived from trial-based East Asian subgroups and adjusted for time in the target international normalized ratio range of warfarin. Results: In the base case, use of apixaban instead of warfarin incurred an additional cost of US$20,763 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Substituting apixaban with rivaroxaban and rivaroxaban with high-dose edoxaban would incur an additional cost per quality-adjusted life-year by US$507 and US$434, respectively. Compared with warfarin, high-dose edoxaban had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$9704/quality-adjusted life-year, followed by high-dose dabigatran (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio US$11,155/quality-adjusted life-year). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on a payer perspective were similar. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was below Thailand’s cost-effectiveness threshold when high-dose dabigatran and edoxaban prices were reduced by 50%. Changes in key parameters had a minimal impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Conclusions: For both societal and payer perspectives, high-dose edoxaban with a price below the country cost-effectiveness threshold should be the first anticoagulant option for Thai patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a high risk of bleeding. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","apixaban; dabigatran; edoxaban; rivaroxaban; warfarin; Article; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; cerebrovascular accident; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug megadose; health care cost; hidden Markov model; human; international normalized ratio; priority journal; quality of life; Thai (people)"
"Predictive factors for neurological deficit in patients with spinal tuberculosis",2019,"Background: Spinal tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of damage to the spine and associated neural structures. Purpose: This study aims to identify the risk factors for neurological deterioration in spinal TB patients to promptly care for the patients before paralysis develops. Methods: The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and radiographic findings of spinal TB patients were collected between 1993 and 2016. The data were analyzed using logistic regression methods. The predictive factors for neurological deficit were identified. Results: There were 125 spinal TB patients (70 men and 55 women). The average age ± standard deviation was 55.7 ± 2.0 and 52.3 ± 2.4=years, respectively. According to the univariate analysis, the significant risk factors associated with neurological deterioration were signal cord changes, notable Cobb angle (>30°), radiating pain, and epidural abscess. The multivariate analysis revealed that only signal cord change and notable Cobb angle significantly influenced neurological status. Conclusion: The predictive factors for neurological deterioration in spinal TB patients are signal cord change and notable Cobb angle. Surgery should be considered in patients who present with these factors before the development of neurological deterioration. ?

"The Inhibition Kinetics and Potential Anti-Migration Activity of NQO1 Inhibitory Coumarins on Cholangiocarcinoma Cells",2019,"Altered expression of a cytosolic flavoenzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) has been seen in many human tumors. Its remarkable overexpression in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA; an aggressive malignancy of the biliary duct system) was associated with poor prognosis and short survival of the patients. Inhibition of NQO1 has been proposed as a potential strategy to improve the efficacy of anticancer drugs in various cancers including CCA. This study investigated novel NQO1 inhibitors and verified the mechanisms of their enzyme inhibition. Among the different chemical classes of natural NQO1 inhibitors are coumarins, flavonoids, and triterpenoids. Coumarins are a group of particularly potent NQO1 inhibitors. The mechanisms and kinetics of enzyme inhibition of coumarin, aesculetin, umbelliferone, and scopoletin using the cell lysates as a source of NQO1 enzyme best fit with an uncompetitive inhibition model. Among the NOQ1 inhibitors tested in KKU-100 CCA cells, scopoletin and umbelliferone had the strongest inhibitory effect on this enzyme, while aesculetin and coumarin barely affected intracellular NQO1. All coumarins were further tested for cytotoxicity and anti-migration activity. At modest cytotoxic doses, scopoletin and umbelliferone greatly inhibited the migration of KKU-100 cells, whereas coumarin and aesculetin barely reduced cell migration. The anti-migration effect of scopoletin was associated with decreased ratio of matrix metalloproteinase 9/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 (MMP9/TIMP1) mRNA. These findings suggest that natural compounds with potent inhibitory effect on intracellular NQO1 have useful anti-migration effects on CCA cells. In order to prove that the potent NQO1 inhibitor, scopoletin, is clinically useful in the enhancement of CCA treatment, additional in vivo studies to elucidate the mechanism of these effects are needed. ?

"Knowledge and attitudes regarding brain death and organ donation among young males in the northeastern thailand: Cross-sectional survey",2019,"Objective: To determine public perception of brain death and organ donation from participants of the northeast region of Thailand, answered questionnaires from audiences of the organ donation exhibition were reviewed to assess knowledge and attitude. Materials and Methods: These exhibitions were arranged in 15 places in three provinces between July 1 and December 31, 2012 by the Organ Transplantation Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University. Audiences were asked to fill out the questionnaire before they were educated about organ donation from well-trained officers. Results: Seven hundred seventy-five subjects undertook the survey. Most were male (99.4%) and most (99.2%) were aged between 19 and 30 years old. Importantly, 54.3% did not feel that brain death truly defined death while 36.3% thought that brain death patients could recover. The other interesting point is 29.2% noted that donated organs might be sold. Only 14.8% believed that organ donation could cause disability in the next life and 65.9% did not agree or did not know that organ donation is justified in religious concept. Conclusion: The significant barrier to organ donation are deficiency in knowledge about brain death, organ donation, and transplantation as well as underrated social reliance on process regulation. These information contrast with previous studies in Thais. ?

"Blunted nighttime sympathetic nervous system response to stress among thai men with positive family history of sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome",2019,"Sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) is prominent among northeast Thai men. This study tests the hypothesis that Thai men with positive family history of SUNDS display abnormal diurnal, autonomic nervous system responses to stress. Healthy northeast Thai men (20-49 years old) lived in the same rural area were divided into two groups based on their positive (PF) or negative family (NF1) history of SUNDS. A second control included Thai men with an NF history of SUNDS from a non-endemic area (NF2). All data were collected at 4:00-6:00 AM (nighttime) and 4:00-6:00 PM (daytime). All three groups displayed nighttime decreases in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose. Furthermore, all subjects displayed similar glucose tolerance and electrolyte balance. The tachycardic responses to a four-minute step test were similar among groups in the daytime, but the nighttime responses were significantly blunted in the PF group compared to either control group (about 20 bpm less). Tachycardic responses to a cold pressor test tended to decrease more during the nighttime in the PF compared to NF1 and NF2 groups, but the difference was not significant. Arterial pressure responses to the exercise were similar among the three groups during the nighttime, whereas in the NF2, daytime mean arterial pressures increased more than those in the other groups. The present data suggest that Thai men with a PF history of SUNDS display blunted sympathetic nervous system responses to stress during the nighttime, a potential factor that may trigger cardiac arrhythmias and contribute to SUNDS. ? 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

"Glucose tolerance test and pharmacokinetic study of kaempferia parviflora extract in healthy subjects",2019,"Kaempferia parviflora Wall. ex Baker (KP), Krachaidam in Thai or Thai ginseng, is a herbal medicine that has many potential pharmacological effects. The effect of KP extract on blood glucose level in rodent was reported. This study focused on the oral glucose tolerance test and pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers administered with KP extract (90 and 180 mg/day, placebo). The oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at baselines and 28-days of administration. The pharmacokinetics were determined after a single dose administration of the tested products using 3,5,7,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF) and 5,7,4′-trimethoxylflavone (TMF) as markers. The results showed that glucose metabolism via oral glucose tolerance test was not affected by KP extract. Blood glucose levels of volunteers at 120 min after glucose loading were able to be returned to initial levels in placebo, KP 90 mg/day, and KP 180 mg/day groups both at baseline and 28-days of administration. The results of the pharmacokinetic study revealed that only TMF and PMF, but not 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF) levels could be detected in human blood. The given doses of KP extract at 90 and 180 mg/day showed a linear dose-relationship of blood PMF concentration whereas blood TMF was detected only at high given dose (180 mg/day). The half-lives of PMF and TMF were 2–3 h. The maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve of blood concentration and time (AUC), and time to maximum concentration (Tmax) values of PMF and TMF estimated for the 180 mg/day dose were 71.2 ± 11.3, 63.0 ± 18.0 ng/mL; 291.9 ± 48.2, 412.2 ± 203.7 ng·h/mL; and 4.02 ± 0.37, 6.03 ± 0.96 h, respectively. PMF was quickly eliminated with higher Ke and Cl than TMF at the dose of 180 mg/day of KP extract. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that KP extract had no effect on the glucose tolerance test. In addition, this is the first demonstration of the pharmacokinetic parameters of methoxyflavones of KP extract in healthy volunteers. The data suggest the safety of the KP extract and will be of benefit for further clinical trials using KP extract as food and sport supplements as well as a drug in health product development. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Glycosylation markers in cancer",2019,"Alteration of glycosylation, a hallmark of cancer, results in the production of tumor-associated glycans or glycoproteins. These molecules are subsequently secreted or membrane-shed into the blood stream and thus serve as tumor-associated markers. Increased glycosylation in cancer is triggered by overexpression of glycoproteins that carry certain specific glycans, increase or decrease of nucleotide sugar donors and altered expression of glycosyltransferase and glycosidase enzymes. In this chapter, the biochemistry and function of glycoprotein, glycan and enzyme markers are reviewed. These glycosylation markers, applicable for detection and monitoring of cancer, include CA19-9, CA125, CEA, PSA and AFP. Because of their specific affinity to distinct sugar moieties, lectins are useful for developing assays to detect these tumor associated glycans and glycoproteins in clinical samples. As such, various enzyme-linked lectin assays (ELLA) have been developed for diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis. Because glycosylation changes occur early in cancer, the detection of tumor associated glycosylation markers using lectin based assays is an effective strategy to improve diagnosis and treatment resulting better outcomes clinically. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","glycoprotein; polysaccharide; tumor marker; animal; glycosylation; human; metabolism; neoplasm; protein processing; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Glycoproteins; Glycosylation; Humans; Neoplasms; Polysaccharides; Protein Processing, Post-Translational"

Kao klini?ki prediktor u neurokirur?koj jedinici intenzivnog lije?enja]",2019,"The APACHE II scoring system is approved for its benchmarking and mortality predictions, but there are only a few articles published to demonstrate it in neurosurgical patients. Therefore, this study was performed to acknowledge this score and its predictive performance to hospital mortality in a tertiary referral neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU). All patients admitted to the Neurosurgical ICU from February 1 to July 31, 2011 were recruited. The parameters indicated in APACHE II score were collected. The adjusted predicted risk of death was calculated and compared with the death rate observed. Descriptive statistics including the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was performed. The results showed that 276 patients were admitted during the mentioned period. The APACHE II score was 16.56 (95% CI, 15.84-17.29) and 19.08 (95% CI, 15.40-22.76) in survivors and non-survivors, while the adjusted predicted death rates were 13.39% (95% CI, 11.83-14.95) and 17.49% (95% CI, 9.81-25.17), respectively. The observed mortality was only 4.35%. The area under the ROC of APACHE II score to the hospital mortality was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.44-0.79). In conclusion, not only the APACHE II score in neurosurgical patients indicated low severity, but its performance to predict hospital mortality was also inferior. Additional studies of predicting mortality among these critical patients should be undertaken. ? 2019, Klinicka Bolnica Sestre Milosrdnice.

"Effect of specific deep cervical muscle exercises on functional disability, pain intensity, craniovertebral angle, and neck-muscle strength in chronic mechanical neck pain: A randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Exercise is known to be an important component of treatment programs for individuals with neck pain. The study aimed to compare the effects of semispinalis cervicis (extensor) training, deep cervical flexor (flexor) training, and usual care (control) on functional disability, pain intensity, craniovertebral (CV) angle, and neck-muscle strength in chronic mechanical neck pain. Methods: A total of 54 individuals with chronic mechanical neck pain were randomly allocated to three groups: extensor training, flexor training, or control. A Thai version of the Neck Disability Index, numeric pain scale (NPS), CV angle, and neck-muscle strength were measured at baseline, immediately after 6 weeks of training, and at 1- and 3 -month follow-up. Results: Neck Disability Index scores improved significantly more in the exercise groups than in the control group after 6 weeks training and at 1- and 3-month follow-up in both the extensor (P=0.001) and flexor groups (P=0.003, P=0.001, P=0.004, respectively). NPS scores also improved significantly more in the exercise groups than in the control group after 6 weeks’ training in both the extensor (P<0.0001) and flexor groups (P=0.029.

At 1 month, the CV angle had improved significantly in the flexor group (P=0.006). Muscle strength in both exercise groups had improved significantly more than in the control group at 6 weeks and 1- and 3-month follow-up (extensor group, P=0.04, P=0.02, P=0.002, respectively; flexor group, P=0.002, P=0.001, and 0.001, respectively). The semispinalis group gained extensor strength and the deep cervical flexor group gained flexor strength. Conclusion: The results suggest that 6 weeks of training in both exercise groups can improve neck disability, pain intensity, CV angle, and neck-muscle strength in chronic mechanical neck pain.

"Prevalence of human papillomavirus in oral rinse samples from healthy individuals in northern Thailand",2019,"Background: The incidence of oral cancers associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been increasing in recent years. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate HPV prevalence in oral cells and exposure to risk factors in various age groups. Methods: Oral rinse samples from healthy individuals in northern Thailand were investigated for HPV prevalence and genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction (GP5+/6+ primers) and DNA sequencing of the PCR products. Results: Samples were collected from 594 participants between 4 and 60?years of age. HPV was detected in 3.7% of samples. The prevalence of HPV-positive cases was 8.6% in the 31-50 age group. HPV prevalence increased with age and was the highest (9.2%) in the 41-50 age group, but decreased (to 3%) in the 51-60 age group. Risk factors significantly associated with HPV-positive cases included alcohol consumption, coffee drinking, sexual activity, and having children. HPV 16 and 18 were common genotypes, especially in the 31-50 age group, and were associated with having sexual activity (odds ratio 19.0 [95% CI: 2.5-142.5]). At follow-up of some individuals in the 4-10 age group, a 9-year-old child was found to be positive for HPV18. Conclusions: These results suggest that HPV can be acquired at a young age and the prevalence peaks in the middle age class among healthy individuals in northern Thailand, especially in the 31-50 age group. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Serum pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase as a prognostic marker for cholangiocarcinoma",2019,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is a Ser/Thr kinase that inactivates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase and serves a key role in aerobic glycolysis, which is a hallmark of cancer cells. The present study determined the PDK expression in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) tissues and sera to evaluate their applicability as a biomarker for CCA. Using proteomic analysis, PDK was revealed to be the most overexpressed mitochondrial protein in CCA tissues. Then, the expression of PDK isoforms in CCA tissues was examined in 15 CCA cases by immunohistochemistry. The PDK3 isoform levels in the sera were measured using a dot blot assay for 39 patients with CCA, 20 patients with benign biliary disease and 19 healthy volunteers. The results revealed a 27-fold overexpression of PDK3 in cancerous tissues when compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The immunohistochemical results demonstrated that the PDK1, 2 and 3, but not the PDK4, isoforms were overexpressed in cancerous tissues. When the PDK3 levels in the sera were examined, they were significantly higher in CCA when compared with the BBD and healthy groups. The specificity and sensitivity of PDK3 as a marker for CCA were 97.5 and 33.0%, respectively, and high PDK3 levels in the sera were correlated with a short survival time for CCA. In conclusion, PDK3 can be used as a diagnostic/prognostic marker for CCA. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"Association between periductal fibrosis and bile duct dilatation among a population at high risk of cholangiocarcinoma: A cross-sectional study of cholangiocarcinoma screening in Northeast Thailand",2019,"Objectives To assess associations between periductal fibrosis (PDF) and bile duct dilatation (BDD) in ultrasonography (US) screening of population at risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) due to residence in an endemic area for Opisthorchis viverrini. CCA survival rates are low, and early identification of risk factors is essential. BDD is one symptom that can identify patients at risk of CCA. Detection of PDF by US can also identify at-risk patients, at an earlier stage of CCA development. Identification of association between PDF and BDD will inform screening practices for CCA risk, by increasing the viability of PDF screening for CCA risk. Setting Nine tertiary care hospitals in Northeast Thailand. Design Cross-sectional study. Participants Study subjects in the Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care Program (CASCAP) in Northeast Thailand. CASCAP inclusion criteria are all residents of Northeast Thailand aged ?40 years. Participants are recruited through CCA screening centres and through primary healthcare units. So far, 394 026 have been enrolled. Methods PDF and BDD were identified through US. PDF was categorised into three groups, PDF1, 2 and 3, depending on their high echo locality in the peripheral, segmental and main bile duct, respectively. Associations between PDF and BDD were determined by adjusted OR and 95% CI using multiple logistic regression. Results BDD was found in 6.6% of PDF3, 1.7% of PDF2 and 1.4% of PDF1 cases. Among PDF cases, especially in PDF3, BDD was found in men more than in women (8.9% and 4.6%, respectively). Compared with non-PDF, the association between PDF3 and BDD was highly significant (adjusted OR=5.74, 95% CI 4.57 to 7.21, p<0.001). Conclusions Our findings reveal that there is a relationship between PDF and BDD, which is associated with CCA. Therefore, PDF can also be an indicator for suspected CCA diagnosis through US. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"Children’s environmental health in south and Southeast Asia: Networking for better child health outcomes",2019,"Children are particularly vulnerable to environmental hazards because they receive higher doses of pollutants in any given environment and often do not have equitable access to social protection mechanisms such as environmental and health care services. The World Health Organization established a global network of collaborating centres that address children’s environmental health (CEH). The network developed a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is broadening its reach by conducting regional workshops for CEH. Objective: This paper reports on the outcomes of a workshop held in conjunction with the 17th International Conference (November 2017) of the Pacific Basin Consortium for Environment and Health, focused on the state of CEH in South and Southeast Asia as presented by seven countries from the region (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Vietnam, Thailand, Sri Lanka). Workshop outcomes: Country reports presented at the meeting show a high degree of similarity with respect to the issues threatening the health of children. The most common problems are outdoor and household air pollution in addition to exposure to heavy metals, industrial chemicals, and pesticides. Many children still do not have adequate access to clean water and improved sanitation while infectious diseases remain a problem, especially for children living in poverty. Child labour is widely prevalent, generally without adequate training or personal protective equipment. The children now face the dual burden of undernutrition and stunting on the one hand and overnutrition and obesity on the other. Conclusion: It is evident that some countries in these regions are doing better than others in varying areas of CEH. By establishing and participating in regional networks, countries can learn from each other and harmonise their efforts to protect CEH so that all can benefit from closer interactions. ? 2019 The Author(s).","heavy metal; industrial chemical; pesticide; air pollution; Article; Bangladesh; Bhutan; child; child health; child labor; environmental health; household; human; India; malnutrition; Nepal; obesity; outcome assessment; overnutrition; poverty; sanitation; Sri Lanka; stunting; Thailand; Viet Nam; workshop"

"Interrater reliability of various thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TIRADS) classifications for differentiating benign from malignant thyroid nodules",2019,"Background: Thyroid ultrasound(US) is used as the first diagnostic tool to assess the management of disease but is operator dependent. There have been few reports evaluating interrater variability in US assessment. Therefore, we evaluated interrater reliability in US assessment of thyroid nodules and estimated its diagnostic accuracy for various TIRADS systems. Methods: This retrospective study included 24 malignant nodules and 84 benign nodules from January 2015 to October 2017. Two blinded observers independently reviewed stored US images by using TIRADS. All analyses followed guidelines proposed by ACR-TR, Siriraj-TR and EU-TR systems. Interrater reliability was calculated using Cohen's Kappa statistics. Diagnostic accuracy were also calculated. Results: Interobserver agreement showed substantial agreement for composition (K=0.616); echogenicity and echogenic foci showed fair agreement (K=0.327 and 0.288, respectively); margin showed slight agreement (K=0.143). Interrater reliability for the final assessment; moderate agreement for ACR-TIRADS system (K=0.500); fair agreement for EU-TIRADS system (K=0.209) and slight agreement (K=0.114) for Siriraj-TIRADS system. The diagnostic performance from the two observers; ACRTIRADS system; sensitivities were 75% and 79.2%, specificities were 58.3% and 56%, positive predictive value (PPV) were 34% and 33.9% and negative predictive value (NPV) were 89.1% and 90.4%. For the Siriraj-TIRADS system, sensitivities were 41.7% and 25%, specificities were 84.5% and 89.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) were 43.5% and 40% and negative predictive value (NPV) were 83.5% and 80.6%. For the EU-TIRADS system, sensitivities were 45.8% and 66.7%, specificities were 79.8% and 72.6%, positive predictive value (PPV) were 39.3% and 41% and negative predictive value (NPV) were 83.8% and 88.4%. Conclusion: The ACR-TIRADS had highest interobserver agreement, a trend to have highest sensitivity and negative predictive value for diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules. Siriraj-TIRADS had higher specificity and accuracy, but lower interobserver agreement. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.","adolescent; adult; aged; child; classification; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; echography; female; follow up; human; male; middle aged; pathology; procedures; prognosis; retrospective study; risk assessment; thyroid gland; thyroid nodule; thyroid tumor; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Neoplasms; Thyroid Nodule; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Ultrasonography; Young Adult"
"Chemical pesticide use and quality of life of rubber farmers in the Northeast of Thailand",2019,"Background Chemical pesticide has known to have impacts on human health and environment. However, there are limited studies on chemical pesticide use has influence on quality of life (QOL) of rubber farmers in Thailand. Objective To determine the pesticide use and its association with quality of life of rubber farmers in the northest region of Thailand. Method This cross sectional study recruited the total of 362 samples by using a multistage random sampling from eight provinces in the Northeast of Thailand. A selfadministered questionnaire was developed and used to collect the data. The multiple logistic regressions were used to determine the association between chemical pesticide use and quality of life when controlling other covariates, presenting adjusted odd ratio, 95% CI and p-value. Result Of the total 362 respondets, 66.57% of rubber farmers used chemical pesticides, only 32.60% had good quality of life (95% CI:27.75-37.45%). The multivariable analysis indicated that those who did not use chemical was associated with having good quality of life (adj. OR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.34 to 3.58, p-value =0.002). Similarly, other factors associated with good quality of life were; working 6-7days/week (adj. OR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.91, p-value = 0.031), had good attitude on rubber farming (adj. OR= 1.83; 95% CI: 1.071 to 3.14, p-value = 0.027, had low to moderate levels of stress (adj. OR=1.73; 95% CI: 1.017 to 2.67, p-value= 0.042) and had low level of knowledge on occupational health in rubber farming (adj. OR=1.66; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.72, p-value = 0.044). Conclusion Most of the farmers used chemical pesticides, only one-third had good quality of life. Chemical pesticide use as well as work load, psychological factors and awareness on occupational health problems had influence on quality of life. ? 2019, Kathmandu University.

In 2017, key opinion leaders throughout Thailand gathered to review and evaluate the current clinical evidence regarding dyspepsia and to develop consensus statements, rationales, levels of evidence, and grades of recommendation for dyspepsia management in daily clinical practice based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This guideline is mainly focused on the following 4 topics: (1) evaluation of patients with dyspepsia, (2) management, (3) special issues (overlapping gastroesophageal reflux disease/ irritable bowel syndrome and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug/aspirin use), and (4) long-term follow-up and management to provide guidance for physicians in Thailand and other limited-resource areas managing such patients. ? 2019 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility","acetylsalicylic acid; cytoprotective agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; prokinetic agent; proton pump inhibitor; tricyclic antidepressant agent; clinical evaluation; consensus; disease classification; dyspepsia; follow up; gastroesophageal reflux; GRADE approach; Helicobacter infection; human; irritable colon; long term care; practice guideline; Review; Thailand"
"Differentiation between persistent infection/colonization and re-infection/re-colonization of Mycobacterium abscessus isolated from patients in Northeast Thailand",2019,"Mycobacterium abscessus can cause true infection or be present in the host as a harmless colonist. The ability of M. abscessus to cause disease and develop drug resistance is known to have a genetic basis. We aimed to differentiate between persistent infection and reinfection using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and to study the genetic diversity of M. abscessus relative to multi-organ infection and drug resistance in Northeast Thailand. DNA was extracted from 62 M. abscessus isolates (24 cases). The following genes were sequenced: argH, cya, glpK, gnd, murC, pta, purH and rpoB. Drug susceptibility tests were performed using broth microdilution. Subspecies classification and phylogeny were determined. Among the 24 cases (62 isolates), 19 cases (49 isolates) were of true NTM infection and 5 cases (13 isolates) examples of colonization. Two subspecies, M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (12 cases, 32 isolates) and M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (12 cases, 30 isolates) were identified. The major sequence type (ST) was ST227. Two clonal groups among patients were found; clonal cluster I (5 cases, 8 isolates) and clonal cluster II (2 cases, 4 isolates) but no epidemiological link was apparent. Reinfection (2 cases with different clones of M. abscessus strains; >9 SNPs different) and persistent infection (14 cases with the same clone; <6 SNPs) were distinguished based on a phylogeny. Based on these SNP cutoff values, 3 cases of persistent colonization (same strain through time) and 2 cases of re-colonization (different strains through time) were identified. M. abscessus subsp. abscessus was significantly associated with clarithromycin resistance (p <.001) and multi-organ infection (p =.03). Molecular epidemiology based on MLST can be used to differentiate between reinfection vs persistent infection, persistent colonization vs re-colonization. ST227 was the main epidemic strain in Northeast Thailand. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","amikacin; cefoxitin; ciprofloxacin; clarithromycin; cotrimoxazole; doxycycline; imipenem; linezolid; minocycline; moxifloxacin; tobramycin; tuberculostatic agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; argH gene; Article; atypical mycobacteriosis; bacterial colonization; bacterial gene; bacterium isolate; broth dilution; clinical article; controlled study; cya gene; DNA extraction; gene sequence; genetic variability; genotype; glpK gene; gnd gene; human; infection; molecular epidemiology; multilocus sequence typing; multiorgan infection; murC gene; Mycobacterium abscessus; Mycobacterium massiliense; persistent infection; phylogeny; priority journal; pta gene; purH gene; recolonization; reinfection; rpoB gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; Thailand; atypical mycobacteriosis; classification; drug effect; genetic variation; genetics; health survey; isolation and purification; medical geography; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; Antitubercular Agents; Genes, Bacterial; Genetic Variation; Geography, Medical; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Epidemiology; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Mycobacterium abscessus; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Phylogeny; Public Health Surveillance; Thailand"
"Chemical composition, antioxidant and cytotoxicity activities of leaves, bark, twigs and oleo-resin of dipterocarpus alatus",2019,"Dipterocarpus alatus (Dipterocarpaceae) is a medicinal plant whose use is well known for the treatment of genito-urinary diseases. However, there is no report of its cytotoxic potential. In this study, the chemical composition, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of extracts of the leaves, bark, twigs and oleo-resin from D. alatus are investigated. Cytotoxicity was measured by the neutral red (NR) assay against HCT116, SKLU1, SK-MEL2, SiHa and U937 cancer cell lines and antioxidant capacity was evaluated by DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The chemical composition was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Leaf, bark and twig extracts exhibited stronger antioxidant activity than oleo-resin, with bark extract showing the highest antioxidant activity and the highest total phenolic content. All samples showed more cytotoxic activity against the U937 cell line than HCT116, SKLU1, SK-MEL2 and SiHa cells with oleo-resin being more cytotoxic than melphalan against U937 cells. Chemical composition analysis of oleo-resin by GC-MS showed that the major components were sesquiterpenes, namely α-gurjunene (30.31%), (-)-isoledene (13.69%), alloaromadendrene (3.28%), β-caryophyllene (3.14%), γ-gurjunene (3.14%) and spathulenol (1.11%). The cytotoxic activity of oleo-resin can be attributed to the sesquiterpene content, whereas the cytotoxic and antioxidant activities of leaf, bark and twig extracts correlated to total phenolic content. ? 2019 by the authors.","antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; phytochemical; plant extract; plant resin; bark; chemistry; Dipterocarpaceae; fractionation; human; mass fragmentography; medicinal plant; plant leaf; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Antioxidants; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemical Fractionation; Dipterocarpaceae; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Phytochemicals; Plant Bark; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Plants, Medicinal; Resins, Plant"
"Disease- and Treatment-related Morbidity in Adolescents with Perinatal HIV Infection in Asia",2019,"Background: Perinatally HIV-infected adolescents (PHIVA) are exposed to a chronic systemic infection and long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART), leaving them susceptible to morbidities associated with inflammation, immunodeficiency and drug toxicity. Methods: Data collected 2001 to 2016 from PHIVA 10-19 years of age within a regional Asian cohort were analyzed using competing risk time-to-event and Poisson regression analyses to describe the nature and incidence of morbidity events and hospitalizations and identify factors associated with disease-related, treatment-related and overall morbidity. Morbidity was defined according to World Health Organization clinical staging criteria and U.S. National Institutes of Health Division of AIDS criteria. Results: A total 3,448 PHIVA contributed 17,778 person-years. Median age at HIV diagnosis was 5.5 years, and ART initiation was 6.9 years. There were 2,562 morbidity events and 307 hospitalizations. Cumulative incidence for any morbidity was 51.7%, and hospitalization was 10.0%. Early adolescence was dominated by disease-related infectious morbidity, with a trend toward noninfectious and treatment-related morbidity in later adolescence. Higher overall morbidity rates were associated with a CD4 count <350 cells/μL, HIV viral load ?10,000 copies/mL and experiencing prior morbidity at age <10 years. Lower overall morbidity rates were found for those 15-19 years of age compared with 10-14 years and those who initiated ART at age 5-9 years compared with <5 or ?10 years. Conclusions: Half of our PHIVA cohort experienced a morbidity event, with a trend from disease-related infectious events to treatment-related and noninfectious events as PHIVA age. ART initiation to prevent immune system damage, optimize virologic control and minimize childhood morbidity are key to limiting adolescent morbidity. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Lower Systolic Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Event Risk Stratified by Renal Resistive Index in Hospitalized Cardiovascular Patients: J-VAS Study",2019,"BACKGROUND The threshold of blood pressure (BP) reduction in cardiovascular patients is debatable due to the J-shaped curve phenomenon, which is particularly observed in patients with increased arterial stiffness. The renal resistive index (RRI) correlates well with systemic arterial stiffness; therefore, we aimed to demonstrate the role of RRI in guiding the choice of optimal BP. METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of the hospitalized cardiovascular patients at Jichi Medical University Hospital. All patients had the RRI measurement performed and were assigned to a higher (RRI ? 0.8) or lower RRI group. Each group was subdivided by quartiles of the BP at discharge. The primary endpoints were fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, including heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, acute aortic disease, acute arterial occlusion, and stroke. RESULTS The mean follow-up period was 1.9 years (3,365 person-years), n = 1,777 (mean age 64.7 years). There were 252 cardiovascular events occurred, 24.0% and 12.2% in the higher and lower RRI populations, P < 0.001. In the higher RRI group, the lowest systolic BP (SBP) quartile (<105 mm Hg) was a risk factor for cardiovascular events when compared with the highest SBP quartile (?130 mm Hg; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-5.03; P = 0.017). A 1 SD decrease of SBP (17.5 mm Hg) was associated with a 25% increase in the risk of cardiovascular events. In the lower RRI group, these associations were not observed. CONCLUSIONS Lower SBP at discharge was associated with a risk of cardiovascular events in the hospitalized cardiovascular patients with RRI ? 0.8. ? 2019 The Author(s).","acute heart failure; adult; aortic disease; arterial stiffness; artery occlusion; Article; cardiac patient; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; female; follow up; heart muscle ischemia; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; renal resistive index; resistive index; retrospective study; risk assessment; systolic blood pressure"
"Diverse cutaneous manifestation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis: a 10-year retrospective cohort study",2019,"Cutaneous manifestation is a common presentation of LCH and is usually a leading clue for the disease diagnosis. Having cutaneous lesions did not show a significantly early age onset at diagnosis compared to those without skin lesions, P value = 0.71. In the present study, cutaneous findings were found as 77.7%. Seborrheic dermatitis-like lesions were the most common cutaneous type (42.8%), followed by papules/nodules/masses (28.5%), petechiae/hemorrhagic lesions (17.8%), and eczematous lesions (10.7%). Time to diagnosis of LCH presented with seborrheic dermatitis-like lesions was significantly longer than other cutaneous presentations, P value = 0.0011. Conclusion: Patients with LCH who had the manifestations of seborrheic dermatitis-like lesions can have diagnosis delayed due to the difficulty in distinguishing these lesions from normal seborrheic dermatitis lesions. Petechiae/hemorrhagic cutaneous signs in addition to the normal seborrheic dermatitis is the clue for early detection of the disease. To improve early detection of LCH, general pediatricians should be alerted to be aware of these skin symptoms, and if they persist, a dermatologist, pediatric if available, should be immediately consulted.What is Known??

"Multi-institutional evaluation using the end-to-end test for implementation of dynamic techniques of radiation therapy in Thailand",2019,"Aim: In this study, an accuracy survey of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric arc radiation therapy (VMAT) implementation in radiotherapy centers in Thailand was conducted. Background: It is well recognized that there is a need for radiotherapy centers to evaluate the accuracy levels of their current practices, and use the related information to identify opportunities for future development. Materials and methods: An end-to-end test using a CIRS thorax phantom was carried out at 8 participating centers. Based on each center's protocol for simulation and planning, linac-based IMRT or VMAT plans were generated following the IAEA (CRP E24017) guidelines. Point doses in the region of PTVs and OARs were obtained from 5 ionization chamber readings and the dose distribution from the radiochromic films. The global gamma indices of the measurement doses and the treatment planning system calculation doses were compared. Results: The large majority of the RT centers (6/8) fulfilled the dosimetric goals, with the measured and calculated doses at the specification points agreeing within ±3% for PTV and ±5% for OARS. At 2 centers, TPS underestimated the lung doses by about 6% and spinal cord doses by 8%. The mean percentage gamma pass rates for the 8 centers were 98.29 ± 0.67% (for the 3%/3 mm criterion) and 96.72 ± 0.84% (for the 2%/2 mm criterion). Conclusions: The 8 participating RT centers achieved a satisfactory quality level of IMRT/VMAT clinical implementation. ? 2018 Greater Poland Cancer Centre","Article; comparative study; health care planning; health survey; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; optical density; practice guideline; radiation dose; radiation dose distribution; Thailand; treatment planning; volumetric modulated arc therapy"
"Scleroderma renal crisis after steroid therapy in interstitial lung disease, as initial presentation in a limited cutaneous scleroderma patient: Case report",2019,"This case report of a 70-year-old Thai female with type 2 diabetes and essential hypertension who presented with dyspnea, rapidly declining of kidney function, malignant hypertension, and thrombotic microangiopathy after a two-week course of high-dose corticosteroid administration for interstitial lung disease (ILD). A physical examination revealed characteristics compatible with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc). However, SSc was not diagnosed at the time the patient’s ILD discovered. Laboratory investigations showed proteinuria with microscopic hematuria, the presence of anti-topoisomerase I antibodies, high titer of antinuclear antibodies, and low serum of complement C3 and C4. The diagnosis required differentiation between severe proliferative type of lupus nephritis and scleroderma renal crisis, as treatment for these two diseases differs greatly. Thus, the patient underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy, and the renal pathology revealed an onion-skin appearance with fibrinoid necrosis at the arterioles and arteries. The final diagnosis was lcSSc with scleroderma renal crisis. ?

"Investigation of anticancer activity of Lindernia crustacea (L.) F. Muell. var. crustacean",2019,"Lindernia crustacea (L.) F. Muell. var. crustacean or “Ya Kap Hoi: YKH” was misunderstood as “Ya Yad Nam Kang” and cancer curative. This study aimed to investigate anticancer activity by the analysis of chemical constituent in extracts and in vitro screening of biological activities of the extract in several aspects such as cancer cell lines cytotoxic activity, immune cell proliferating activity, reducing power activity, alkylation activity. The HPLC analysis showed the absence of plumbagin peak observed in the HPLC chromatograms of both YKH aqueous and YKH ethanolic extracts. The YKH ethanolic extract yielded more chemical constituents than that of the YKH aqueous extract. The YKH aqueous extract was inactive against all cancer cells tested. Interestingly, YKH ethanolic extract caused cancer cell death in HCT116 colon cancer, HepG2 liver cancer, and Jurkat leukemic cancer cell lines in the concentration dependent manner. The following IC50 concentrations of the YKH ethanolic extract that possessed 50 % cell death after 24 h exposure in HCT116, HepG2, and Jurkat cell line were 195.4 ± 12, 171.7 ± 8.7, and 48.8 ± 5.7 ?g/mL, respectively. Both aqueous and ethanolic extracts of YKH showed high antioxidant activity based on reducing power activity but did not have alkylation activity. At high concentration (250 ?g/mL), YKH ethanolic extract can inhibit immune cells proliferation activity more than the YKH aqueous extract. An unexpected but critical outcome of our studies was the finding that anticancer activity is promised by selecting the plant extraction solvent with less polarity. Potential anticancer constituents were extracted from YKH using ethanol and these constituents cannot be found in aqueous solution of YKH. ? 2019, Walailak University. All rights reserved.",""
"Mapping abnormal subcortical neurodevelopment in a cohort of Thai children with HIV",2019,"Alterations in subcortical brain structures have been reported in adults with HIV and, to a lesser extent, pediatric cohorts. The extent of longitudinal structural abnormalities in children with perinatal HIV infection (PaHIV) remains unclear. We modeled subcortical morphometry from whole brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T) scans of 43 Thai children with PaHIV (baseline age = 11.09±2.36 years) and 50 HIV? children (11.26±2.80 years) using volumetric and surface-based shape analyses. The PaHIV sample were randomized to initiate combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) when CD4 counts were 15–24% (immediate: n = 22) or when CD4 < 15% (deferred: n = 21). Follow-up scans were acquired approximately 52 weeks after baseline. Volumetric and shape descriptors capturing local thickness and surface area dilation were defined for the bilateral accumbens, amygdala, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, caudate, and hippocampus. Regression models adjusting for clinical and demographic variables examined between and within group differences in morphometry associated with HIV. We assessed whether baseline CD4 count and cART status or timing associated with brain maturation within the PaHIV group. All models were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. A pallidal subregion was significantly thinner in children with PaHIV. Regional thickness, surface area, and volume of the pallidum was associated with CD4 count in children with PaHIV. Longitudinal morphometry was not associated with HIV or cART status or timing, however, the trajectory of the left pallidum volume was positively associated with baseline CD4 count. Our findings corroborate reports in adult cohorts demonstrating a high predilection for HIV-mediated abnormalities in the basal ganglia, but suggest the effect of stable PaHIV infection on morphological aspects of brain development may be subtle. ? 2019","amygdala; Article; basal ganglion; brain mapping; brain maturation; caudate nucleus; CD4 lymphocyte count; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; female; follow up; globus pallidus; hippocampus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; longitudinal study; male; morphometry; nerve cell differentiation; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleus accumbens; perinatal period; priority journal; putamen; school child; surface area; Thailand; thalamus"
"Association of Genetic Variations in NRF2, NQO1, HMOX1, and MT with Severity of Coronary Artery Disease and Related Risk Factors",2020,"NRF2 is a transcription factor which, during oxidative stress, activates transcription of its target antioxidant genes. Polymorphisms in NRF2 and its target antioxidant genes: HMOX-1, NQO1, and MT, have been associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes in various ethnic groups, however, with variable results. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of NRF2, HMOX-1, NQO1, and MT gene polymorphisms with CVD risk factors in Thais. The study was conducted in two groups: group with high-risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and health check-up group. Polymorphisms in NRF2 (rs6721961), NQO1 (rs1800566), MT1A (rs11640851), and HMOX-1 (rs2071746) were genotyped. Expressions of NRF2, HMOX-1, and NQO1 were also determined. In high-risk group, NRF2 rs6721961-TT was associated with CAD [OR (95% CI) 5.07 (1.42–18.10)] and severity of coronary atherosclerosis [Gensini score > 32, OR (95% CI) 4.31 (1.67–11.09)]; rs6721961 GT and TT revealed significant association with lower mRNA expression than GG (p = 0.021). NQO1 rs1800566 also revealed association with CAD, only in female. Combined effect of NQO1-rs1800566, HMOX1-rs2071746, and MT1A-rs11640851 was evaluated on the risks of DM and hypertension. With a combination of risk alleles as genetic risk score (GRS), the highest GRS (score 6) increased risk for hypertension, comparing with GRS 0–2 [OR (95% CI) 1.89 (1.02–3.49)]; group with score 5–6 revealed association with risk of DM [OR (95% CI) 1.481 (1.08–2.04)]. In conclusion, NRF2 rs6721961 associated with CAD and severity of coronary atherosclerosis. NQO1 rs1800566 also associated with CAD, only in female. Combined polymorphisms of three NRF2-regulated genes increased risk of DM and hypertension. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Programmed genome editing of the omega-1 ribonuclease of the blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni",2019,"CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has yet to be reported in species of the Platyhelminthes. We tested this approach by targeting omega-1 (ω1) of Schistosoma mansoni as proof of principle. This secreted ribonuclease is crucial for Th2 polarization and granuloma formation. Schistosome eggs were exposed to Cas9 complexed with guide RNA complementary to ω1 by electroporation or by transduction with lentiviral particles. Some eggs were also transfected with a single stranded donor template. Sequences of amplicons from gene-edited parasites exhibited Cas9-catalyzed mutations including homology directed repaired alleles, and other analyses revealed depletion of ω1 transcripts and the ribonuclease. Gene-edited eggs failed to polarize Th2 cytokine responses in macrophage/T-cell co-cultures, while the volume of pulmonary granulomas surrounding ω1-mutated eggs following tail-vein injection into mice was vastly reduced. Knock-out of ω1 and the diminished levels of these cytokines following exposure showcase the novel application of programmed gene editing for functional genomics in schistosomes.",""
"Analysis of xanthyletin and secondary metabolites from Pseudomonas stutzeri ST1302 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ST2501 against Pythium insidiosum",2019,"Background: Pythium insidiosum is a member of the oomycetes class of aquatic fungus-like microorganisms. It can infect humans and animals through skin wounds and the eyes, causing pythiosis, an infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. Antifungal agents are ineffective as pythiosis treatments because ergosterol, the target site of most antifungal agents, is not found in the P. insidiosum cytoplasmic membrane. The best choice for treatment is surgical removal of the infected organ. While natural plant products or secretory substances from bacterial flora have exhibited in vitro anti-P. insidiosum activity, their mechanism of action remains unknown. Therefore, this study hypothesized that the mechanism of action could be related to changes in P. insidiosum biochemical composition (such as lipid, carbohydrate, protein or nucleic acid) following exposure to the inhibitory substances. The biochemical composition of P. insidiosum was investigated by Synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy. Results: Fraction No.6 from the crude extract of P. stutzeri ST1302, fraction No.1 from the crude extract of K. pneumoniae ST2501 and xanthyletin were used as anti-P. insidiosum substances, with MFCs at 3.125, 1.57-1.91, 0.003 mg/ml, respectively. The synchrotron FTIR results show that the deconvoluted peak distributions in the amide I, amide II, and mixed regions were significantly different between the treatment and control groups. Conclusions: Xanthyletin and the secondary metabolites from P. stutzeri ST1302 and K. pneumoniae ST2501 exerted anti-P. insidiosum activity that clearly changed the proteins in P. insidiosum. Further study, including proteomics analysis and in vivo susceptibility testing, should be undertaken to develop a better understanding of the mechanism of anti-P. insidiosum activity. ? 2019 The Author(s).","amide; amide I; amide II; fatty acid; polysaccharide; unclassified drug; xanthyletin; antifungal agent; coumarin derivative; xanthyletine; antifungal activity; Article; biochemical composition; controlled study; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Klebsiella pneumoniae; lipid membrane; metabolite; minimum fungicidal concentration; nonhuman; Pseudomonas stutzeri; Pythium insidiosum; drug effect; infrared spectroscopy; Klebsiella pneumoniae; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; Pseudomonas stutzeri; Pythium; secondary metabolism; Antifungal Agents; Coumarins; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Pseudomonas stutzeri; Pythium; Secondary Metabolism; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"
"Budget impact analysis of the new reimbursement policy for day surgery in Thailand",2019,"Introduction: In 2017 the Thai Ministry of Public Health proposed a new financing mechanism to promote day surgery under the Universal Coverage Scheme the main public insurance arrangement for Thais. The key feature of the policy is health facilities performing day surgery can claim the treatment expense based on relative weight (RW) instead of adjusted RW (adjRW). Procedures for 12 diseases (so-called “candidate procedures”) are eligible for the new reimbursement. The objective of this study was to assess the current day surgery situation in Thailand and analyze potential budget impact from the new policy. Methods: A quantitative cross-section design was employed. Individual inpatient records of the Universal Coverage Scheme during 2014-2016 were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and simulation analyses were applied. The analyses were divided into three subtopics: 1) case volume and expense claim, 2) utilization across facilities, and 3) case mix index and budget impact. Results: Overall, day surgery accounted for 4.8% of admissions with candidate procedures. Inguinal hernias, hemorrhoids, and common bile duct stones caused the largest sum of admission numbers and admission days. Currently, the annual reimbursement for candidate procedures treated as inpatient cases is around 290.8 million Baht (US$ 8.8 million), with about 12.4 million Baht (US$ 0.38 million) for day surgery cases. If all candidate procedures were performed as day surgery and diagnostic-related groups (DRG) version 6 was applied, the incremental budget would amount to 1.9 million Baht (US$ 58,903). Conclusions: The new reimbursement policy will likely lead to minimal budget burden. Even in the case of maximal uptake of the policy, the needed budget would increase by just 15%. The marginal budget increment was explained by the infinitesimal RW-adjRW difference. Apart from the financial measure, other qualitative aspects of the policy, such as infrastructure and health staff readiness, should be explored. ? 2019 Suphanchaimat et al.","Article; budget; common bile duct stone; cross-sectional study; health care policy; health care utilization; hemorrhoid; hospital admission; human; inguinal hernia; length of stay; major clinical study; quantitative study; reimbursement; surgery; Thailand"
"Myricetin ameliorates cytokine-induced migration and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells via suppression of STAT3 pathway",2019,"Aim of Study: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive cancer with considerable metastatic potential. Various cytokines secreted by tumor cells or cells in the tumor environment can promote the metastasis of CCA. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of myricetin on the inhibition of cytokine-induced migration and invasion and the associated cellular mechanisms in human CCA cells. Materials and Methods: CCA KKU-100 cells were treated with a pro-inflammatory cytokine mixture consisting of interleukin-6, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α. The migratory and invasive ability of KKU-100 cells were determined using a wound-healing assay and transwell invasion assay. The effect of myricetin on cytokine-induced STAT3 activation in CCA cells was determined using Western blot analysis. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine messenger RNA expression. Results: Myricetin significantly inhibited cytokine-induced migration and invasion of KKU-100 cells. Detailed molecular analyses revealed that myricetin suppressed the activation of the STAT3 pathway, evidently by a decrease of the active phospho-STAT3 protein expression after myricetin treatment. The cytokine-mediated upregulation of metastasis- and inflammatory-associated genes, which are downstream genes of STAT3 including the intercellular adhesion molecule-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2), were also significantly abolished by myricetin treatment. Moreover, the anti-migratory and anti-invasive activities of a widely prescribed COX inhibitor, indomethacin, were also revealed. Conclusion: This finding reveals the anti-metastatic effect of myricetin against CCA cells which is mediated partly through suppression of the STAT3 pathway. This compound could be potentially useful as a therapeutic agent against CCA. ? 2019 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","cytokine; gamma interferon; gelatinase B; indometacin; inducible nitric oxide synthase; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; myricetin; prostaglandin synthase; STAT3 protein; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; flavonoid; indometacin; myricetin; STAT3 protein; STAT3 protein, human; Article; cell invasion; cell migration; cell viability; cholangiocarcinoma cell line; human; human cell; KKU-100 cell line; metastasis potential; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; Western blotting; bile duct cancer; bile duct carcinoma; cell motion; drug effect; drug screening; metabolism; pathology; prevention and control; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cholangiocarcinoma; Cytokines; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Flavonoids; Humans; Indomethacin; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor"
"Individual and combined cytotoxicity of major trichothecenes type B, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and fusarenon-X on Jurkat human T cells",2019,"Food and feed commodities are often contaminated by more than one mycotoxin. Among the several combinations that frequently occur, fusariotoxins are often mentioned. The multi-mycotoxins contamination is a serious threat for health. In the present study we investigated the toxic interactions between deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), and fusarenon-X (FX) in Jurkat T cells by using the MTT assay. The tested mycotoxins alone or in combination had a dose dependent effect on proliferating lymphocytes. According to IC 50 , it could be classified in decreasing order of toxicity: FX &gt; NIV &gt; DON &gt; DON + FX &gt; NIV + FX &gt; DON + NIV &gt; DON + NIV + FX. The type of mycotoxin interactions was assessed by calculating the combination index (CI) and the dose reduction index (DRI). Our data indicate that an antagonistic effect was strongly observed in binary combination between DON and NIV at higher concentrations and ternary mixtures. Meanwhile, the DON and FX mixtures generated moderate antagonism, while NIV and FX provoked different interactions. The effects of tested mycotoxins on apoptosis were also determined using a FACScan flow cytometer. At IC 75 , the percentages of apoptotic cells in all treatment groups were significantly different when compared to control group but no significant differences among treatment groups was observed. Taken together, our data suggest that immunotoxicity among multi-mycotoxins contamination cannot be predicted based on individual effects but depends on the mixtures, ratio and/or concentrations in the product, as well as type of target cells. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CD4 antigen; fusarenon X; interleukin 2 receptor alpha; interleukin 8; mycotoxin; nivalenol; transcription factor FOXP3; trichothecene; tumor necrosis factor; vomitoxin; fusarenon-X; nivalenol; trichothecene derivative; vomitoxin; apoptosis; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; Fusarium culmorum; Fusarium graminearum; human; human cell; IC50; immune system; immunotoxicity; Jurkat cell line; metabolite; MTT assay; priority journal; target cell; bioassay; cell survival; dose response; drug effect; drug potentiation; flow cytometry; procedures; Apoptosis; Biological Assay; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Synergism; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Jurkat Cells; Trichothecenes"
"Access to and price trends of antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antilipidemic drugs in outpatient settings of the Universal Coverage Scheme in Thailand",2019,"Under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) with payment per capita for outpatient (OP) services, hospitals’ financial risks will rise if access to essential drugs increases. This study examined trends in access to and price of essential drugs for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and an overall purchasing price index (PPI) for an OP drug basket from public hospitals. To examine drug access, OP prescription data from 2010–2012 were obtained from the UCS. Access to thirteen drugs for diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was examined for trend using a time-series analysis. To calculate the PPI, drugs in the same dataset in 2010 that each contributed at least 0.2% of the total OP drug expenditure (N = 118 items) were selected together with drugs expected for near future growth (N = 48 items). The PPI was constructed from purchasing prices in 16 hospitals using a standard method developed by the International Labour Organization. Based on 166 drug items accounting for 75% of OP drug expenditures, the overall PPI continually declined by 6.8% from 2010 to 2012. Access to the 13 selected NCD drugs, accounting for 22% of the total OP drug expenditure increased from 22 to 30 per 1,000 population for antidiabetics, 27 to 47 for antihypertensive agents, and 32 to 53 for antilipidemics from 2010–2012. Growth in the study drug recipients was relatively higher than that in the population and diagnosed patients. Due to generic market competition, metformin, glipizide, amlodipine, losartan, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and fenofibrate prices decreased by 6–22%. Antiretrovirals and risperidone prices decreased by more than 10% due to price negotiation by the UCS. Access to essential drugs for diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia has increased. A decline in the PPI could contain essential drug expenditure when the demand for the drugs increased. Generic market competition and price negotiation by the UCS led to price reduction. ? 2019 Limwattananon, Waleekhachonloet.

"Development and evaluation of user-tested Thai patient information leaflets for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Effect on patients' knowledge",2019,"Introduction: Thai patients do not routinely receive patient information leaflets (PILs) with medicines, so awareness of safety issues is low. This study aimed: i) to develop Thai PILs for NSAIDs and subject these to user-testing, and ii) to assess the potential value of PILs from the patient perspective and effect on patient knowledge. Methods: Four PILs for NSAIDs were developed and subjected to multiple rounds of user-testing by the general public. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to orthopaedic outpatients prescribed one of these NSAIDs, assessing knowledge before and after providing a PIL. The follow-up questionnaire also sought use of and views on the PILs using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: 1,240 baseline questionnaires were completed; only 13.5% of patients had good knowledge. 688 patients returned follow-up questionnaires (55.5%), of whom75% had good knowledge. In patients completing both questionnaires, mean knowledge score increased from 6.22±1.40 to 8.42±1.41 (p<0.001). Patients with high educational levels had high baseline scores (OR = 2.728) and showed greatest improvement in knowledge (OR = 5.628). 90% (625) of follow-up respondents indicated they read all information in the PILs. All also agreed that these PILs should distributed to all patients taking NSAIDs. The median VAS score for usefulness was 9.3 (IQR 8.6-10.0). Conclusions: User-testing of PILs was feasible in a Thai population and enabled the development of acceptable and desirable PILs. PILs could improve patients' knowledge about their medicine, particularly among those with higher educational level. User-tested PILS could meet the need for more written medicine information.

"Blocking of methionine aminopeptidase-2 by TNP-470 induces apoptosis and increases chemosensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma",2019,"Context: Resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major pitfall of the failure of chemotherapy treatment for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). A new therapeutic strategy that can improve treatment efficacy is mandatory for CCA patients. Our previous findings demonstrated the overexpression of methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP2) in CCA patients. In addition, supplementation of TNP-470, a MetAP2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited the growth and metastatic activities of CCA cell lines. However, the molecular mechanism of antitumor activity of TNP-470 and the synergistic antitumor activity of TNP-470 combined with chemotherapeutic drugs are still unknown. Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the molecular mechanism of anticancer activity and the potential use of TNP-470 as a chemosensitizing agent in CCA cell lines. Materials and Methods: Cell cycle and apoptosis of CCA cell lines were evaluated using flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. Expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins was measured by Western blotting. The chemosensitizing effect of TNP-470 was determined using combination index. Results: TNP-470 inhibited the growth of CCA cells via induction of apoptosis through activation of the p38-phosphorylation and up- and down-regulation of Bax and Bcl-xL, respectively. Furthermore, TNP-470 significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, doxorubicin, and gemcitabine.

"Prevalence, clinical and psychosocial variables of depression, anxiety and suicidality in geriatric tertiary care settings",2019,"Objective: The study investigated the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders and suicide risk in geriatric outpatients in tertiary care hospitals. Materials and methods: An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted with 803 participants aged 60 and above attending geriatric outpatient clinics in tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. Participants were assessed using DSM-IV-TR criteria to calculate the prevalence of deressive and anxiety disorders, and their suicide risk. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Core Symptom Index (CSI), 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), Neuroticism Inventory (NI) and the Revised Experience of Close Relationships Questionnaire (ECR-R) were administered. Quality of life was assessed using the EuroQoL (EQ-5D). Results: The prevalence rate for depressive disorders was 23.7%, anxiety disorders was 6.4%, and current suicide risk was 20.4%. PSS, MSPSS, GDS, CSI, and NI scores were significantly higher in all clinical disorders and a suicide group compared with nonclinical subjects. MoCA and ECR-R did not differentiate between clinical disorder and nonclinical samples. Comparing all four outcomes, the EQ-5D differed most in the mixed depressive-anxiety disorder and nonclinical groups (t = 12.20, p <.001). Conclusion: The present findings revealed a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and suicidality among elderly patients attending tertiary care hospitals. Perceived stress, perceived social support, and neuroticism scores were significantly higher in this group. Role of sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables as risk factors for these clinical disorders should be further examined. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","aged; anxiety disorder; Article; Core Symptom Index; cross-sectional study; depression; DSM-IV-TR; female; Geriatric Depression Scale; geriatric patient; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease assessment; Montreal cognitive assessment; Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support; Neuroticism Inventory; observational study; outpatient; Perceived Stress Scale; prevalence; priority journal; quality of life assessment; Revised Experience of Close Relationships Questionnaire; social support assessment; suicidal behavior; tertiary care center; Thailand; very elderly; anxiety disorder; clinical trial; depression; middle aged; multicenter study; prevalence; prospective study; statistics and numerical data; suicide; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety Disorders; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Suicide; Tertiary Care Centers; Thailand"
"An ecological study of eosinophilic meningitis caused by the nematode, Angiostrongylus cantonensis (Chen, 1935) (Nematoda: Metastrongylidae)",2019,"Climate change and other weather factors are associated with several infectious diseases, but are rarely reported as being associated with nematode infection. Eosinophilic meningitis (EOM) is an emerging disease worldwide caused by the nematode, Angiostrongylus cantonensis. It is transmitted through various agents such as snails and slugs. Temperature and rainfall are associated with snail population. There have been no previous studies on the relationship between weather and EOM. This was an ecological study. Numbers of EOM patients and weather data in Thailand's Loei province from 2006 to 2017 were obtained using a national database. A Spearman correlation was used to explore the relationship between EOM and weather variables. We developed a Poisson time series model combined with a distributed lag model (DLM) for estimating the effects of weather on EOM. We also created an autoregressive integrated moving average with exogeneous variable (ARIMAX) model for predicting future EOM cases over the following 12 months. There were 1126 EOM patients in the study. Among several weather factors, wind was significantly negatively correlated with the number of EOM patients (rs: ?0.204, 95% CI: ?0.361 to ?0.058; p value: 0.014). The ARIMAX(3, 0, 0) model with wind speed as a variable was appropriate for predicting the number of EOM patients. The predicted and actual numbers of EOM patients in 2018 were highly concordant. In conclusion, wind speed is significantly negatively correlated with the number of EOM patients. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","rain; Angiostrongylus cantonensis; Article; eosinophilic meningitis; epidemic; evaporation; forecasting; human; humidity; major clinical study; pressure; priority journal; risk factor; sunlight; temperature; Thailand; weather; wind speed; Angiostrongylus cantonensis; animal; climate change; complication; ecosystem; eosinophilia; isolation and purification; meningitis; parasitology; Poisson distribution; snail; strongyle infection; weather; wind; Angiostrongylus cantonensis; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Eosinophilia; Humans; Meningitis; Poisson Distribution; Snails; Strongylida Infections; Temperature; Thailand; Weather; Wind"
"Cloning and expression of enterovirus 71 capsid protein 1 in a probiotic Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum",2019,"This study investigated cloning and expression of enterovirus 71 viral capsid protein 1 (EV71-VP1) in Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (B.?pseudocatenulatum) M115. To achieve this, a codon-optimized gene coding for EV71-VP1 was analysed, designed, synthesized and cloned into a plasmid vector flanked by a transcriptional promoter and terminator sequences. The promoter was based on that of P919, a constitutive promoter of the gene encoding the large ribosomal protein of B.?bifidum BGN4, while the terminator was based on that of the peptidase N gene of Lactococcus lactis. The construct was amplified in Escherichia coli XL1-blue and then transferred into B.?pseudocatenulatum M115 by electrotransformation. Western blot analysis revealed that the EV71-VP1 was intracellularly expressed in B.?pseudocatenulatum M115 under the control of the selected heterologous promoter. In addition, plasmid stability analysis showed the construct was maintained stably for more than 160 generations, enough for most future applications. The results derived from this study open the possibility to utilize the bacterium carrying a specific expression plasmid as cell factory for the production of proteins with high commercial and health-promoting value. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study demonstrated the first successful expression of a codon-optimized gene coding for enterovirus 71 viral capsid protein 1 (EV71-VP1) in Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum M115, a novel probiotic strain isolated from human intestines. The EV71-VP1 was constitutively expressed under the control of P919 promoter derived from B.?bifidum BGN4 in the cytoplasm of bacterial cells supporting the use of heterologous promoter and terminator sequences for viral gene expression in Bifidobacterium species. ? 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology","capsid protein; Enterovirus 71 viral capsid protein 1; plasmid vector; probiotic agent; unclassified drug; aminopeptidase; capsid protein; peptidase N; bacterium; clone; cytoplasm; foot and mouth disease; gene expression; peptide; plasmid; probiotics; protein; virus; Article; Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum; cloning; codon; controlled study; electrotransformation; Enterovirus A71; Escherichia coli; gene amplification; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plasmid; promoter region; protein expression; stop codon; Western blotting; animal; Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum; Enterovirus A; gene vector; genetics; human; isolation and purification; Lactococcus lactis; molecular cloning; procedures; regulator gene; virus capsid; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bifidobacterium; Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum; Escherichia coli; Human enterovirus 71; Lactococcus lactis; Miridae; Aminopeptidases; Animals; Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum; Capsid; Capsid Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Enterovirus A, Human; Escherichia coli; Genetic Vectors; Humans; Lactococcus lactis; Plasmids; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Terminator Regions, Genetic"
"Global, regional, and national estimates of levels of preterm birth in 2014: a systematic review and modelling analysis",2019,"Background: Preterm birth is the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years worldwide. Although preterm survival rates have increased in high-income countries, preterm newborns still die because of a lack of adequate newborn care in many low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated global, regional, and national rates of preterm birth in 2014, with trends over time for some selected countries. Methods: We systematically searched for data on preterm birth for 194 WHO Member States from 1990 to 2014 in databases of national civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS). We also searched for population-representative surveys and research studies for countries with no or limited CRVS data. For 38 countries with high-quality data for preterm births in 2014, data are reported directly. For countries with at least three data points between 1990 and 2014, we used a linear mixed regression model to estimate preterm birth rates. We also calculated regional and global estimates of preterm birth for 2014. Findings: We identified 1241 data points across 107 countries. The estimated global preterm birth rate for 2014 was 10·6% (uncertainty interval 9·0–12·0), equating to an estimated 14·84 million (12·65 million–16·73 million) live preterm births in 2014. 12· 0 million (81·1%) of these preterm births occurred in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Regional preterm birth rates for 2014 ranged from 13·4% (6·3–30·9) in North Africa to 8·7% (6·3–13·3) in Europe. India, China, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Indonesia accounted for 57·9 million (41×4%) of 139·9 million livebirths and 6·6 million (44×6%) of preterm births globally in 2014. Of the 38 countries with high-quality data, preterm birth rates have increased since 2000 in 26 countries and decreased in 12 countries. Globally, we estimated that the preterm birth rate was 9×8% (8×3–10×9) in 2000, and 10×6% (9×0–12×0) in 2014. Interpretation: Preterm birth remains a crucial issue in child mortality and improving quality of maternal and newborn care. To better understand the epidemiology of preterm birth, the quality and volume of data needs to be improved, including standardisation of definitions, measurement, and reporting.

"Evaluation of a short term effect of praziquantel treatment in opisthorchiasis-induced hepatobiliary inflammation by urinary 8-oxodG",2019,"Inflammation of the hepatobiliary system in chronic opisthorchiasis is associated with an elevated level of urinary 8-oxo-7,8 dihydro-2′deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) during active as well as past exposure to Opisthorchis viverrini infection. In this study, we evaluated the short-term effect of praziquantel treatment on hepatobiliary disease (HBD) using urinary 8-oxodG as an inflammatory marker in a cohort of residents in endemic areas of opisthorchiasis in Khon Kaen, Thailand. The HBD status in terms of periductal fibrosis (PDF) was determined by abdominal ultrasonography and O. viverrini infection was monitored at baseline and 2–4 weeks after curative treatment by praziquantel. Analysis of O. viverrini-infected participants who were PDF-ve revealed that there was a significant reduction of urinary 8-oxodG after treatment compared with the baseline levels (p < 0.001). By contrast, in PDF+ve individuals, the levels of urinary 8-oxodG were similar between baseline and those post-treatment. Although confirmation by using a larger sample size is needed, the positive association between HBD and urinary 8-oxodG level after worm clearance suggests that chronic hepatobiliary inflammation is neither affected nor interrupted by short-term praziquantel treatment. Individuals with persistent PDF at pre- and post-treatment who have a high risk of cholangiocarcinoma, could be identified within 2–4 weeks after parasite removal by drug treatment. Thus, urinary 8-oxodG is a useful biomarker for predicting persistent PDF in individuals with a recent drug treatment history who require further clinical investigation, management and treatment. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine; biological marker; praziquantel; 8-oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine; anthelmintic agent; biological marker; deoxyguanosine; praziquantel; disease treatment; oxidative stress; parasitic disease; urine; abdominal ultrasonography; adult; antiinflammatory activity; area under the curve; Article; bile duct carcinoma; clinical article; cohort analysis; conformation; controlled study; disease association; echography; endemic disease; female; health status; hepatobiliary system inflammation; high risk patient; human; inflammation; male; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis viverrini; pathogenesis; periductal fibrosis; receiver operating characteristic; residential area; sample size; sensitivity and specificity; short course therapy; single drug dose; Thailand; treatment duration; urine level; analogs and derivatives; animal; biliary tract disease; complication; liver disease; middle aged; opisthorchiasis; parasitology; urine; Khon Kaen [Northeastern Region]; Northeastern Region; Thailand; Opisthorchis viverrini; Animals; Anthelmintics; Biliary Tract Diseases; Biomarkers; Deoxyguanosine; Female; Humans; Liver Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Opisthorchiasis; Praziquantel"
"Clonorchis sinensis omega-class glutathione transferases are reliable biomarkers for serodiagnosis of clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis",2019,"Objectives: To determine the potential for immunodiagnostic application of two recombinant forms of Clonorchis sinensis omega-class glutathione transferases (rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2) against human small liver-fluke C. sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini infections. Methods: Specific antibody levels against rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2 in patients’ sera of egg-positive opisthorchiasis (n = 87) and clonorchiasis (n = 120), as well as those in sera from patients with other helminthic infections (n = 252) and healthy controls (n = 40) were retrospectively analysed by ELISA. Results: We observed highly positive correlation coefficients between specific antibody levels against rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2 and egg counts per gramme of faeces (EPG) of patients with opisthorchiasis (n = 87; r = 0.88 for rCsGSTo1 and r = 0.90 for rCsGSTo2). Sera from opisthorchiasis patients whose EPG counts >100 (n = 43) revealed high antibody titres against both antigens. Patients’ sera with low EPG counts (<100, n = 44) also exhibited reliable sensitivities of 93.2% and 97.7% for rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2, respectively. Sera from clonorchiasis patients showed sensitivities of 90% (108/120 samples) and 89.2% (107/120 sera) for rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2. Overall diagnostic sensitivities for liver-fluke infections were 92.3% for rCsGSTo1 (191/207 samples) and 93.2% for rCsGSTo2 (193/207 samples). Specificities were 89.7% (rCsGSTo1) and 97.6% (rCsGSTo2). Conclusions: Detection of specific antibody levels against rCsGSTo1 or rCsGSTo2 might be promising for the serodiagnosis of patients infected with these two phylogenetically close carcinogenic liver-flukes. ? 2018 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","biological marker; glutathione transferase; omega class glutathione transferase 1; omega class glutathione transferase 2; protozoal protein; recombinant enzyme; unclassified drug; biological marker; glutathione transferase; helminth antibody; adolescent; adult; aged; antibody detection; antibody titer; Article; child; clonorchiasis; Clonorchis sinensis; controlled study; cross reaction; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fascioliasis; female; human; major clinical study; male; metagonimiasis; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; parasite serodiagnosis; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; schistosomiasis; sensitivity and specificity; animal; blood; clonorchiasis; Clonorchis sinensis; enzymology; feces; middle aged; opisthorchiasis; parasite egg count; parasitology; procedures; serology; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Antibodies, Helminth; Biomarkers; Child; Clonorchiasis; Clonorchis sinensis; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Feces; Female; Glutathione Transferase; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Opisthorchiasis; Parasite Egg Count; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests; Young Adult"
"First molecular identification of Strongyloides fuelleborni in long-tailed macaques in Thailand and Lao People's Democratic Republic reveals considerable genetic diversity",2019,"Strongyloides fuelleborni is a soil-transmitted nematode parasite of non-human primates. The worm is prevalent also in human populations in Africa and South-East Asia. In this study, we amplified and sequenced a portion of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) and of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene of Strongyloides adult males recovered from faecal samples from long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Thailand and Lao PDR. The prevalence in Thailand was 31.1% (55/177) and in Lao PDR it was 62.1% (41/66), with an overall prevalence of 39.5% (96/243). All 18S rRNA sequences that we obtained (n = 96) showed 100% identity with published S. fuelleborni sequences. The 96 cox1 sequences that we obtained represented 32 new haplotypes. When included with the 17 previously known haplotypes from S. fuelleborni, the cox1 sequences fell into four clusters, which had clear geographical structure. This is the first molecular confirmation of S. fuelleborni in long-tailed macaques in Thailand and Lao PDR. Clearly, awareness needs to be raised of the zoonotic potential of S. fuelleborni. A monitoring programme should be organized, taking into account the role of reservoir hosts (i.e. monkeys) in the natural background of human strongyloidiasis caused by S. fuelleborni.

"Pain experiences and intrapersonal change among patients with chronic non-cancer pain after using a pain diary: A mixed-methods study",2019,"Objective: Pain diaries are a valuable self-assessment tool; however, their use in chronic non-cancer pain has received limited attention. In this study, we examined the effect of pain diary use on pain intensity, interference, and intrapersonal change in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Method: A convergent mixed-methods design was used to prospectively evaluate a cohort of 72 patients. Daily pain intensity and weekly pain-interference were self-reported using pain diaries for a 4-week period. Outcomes were assessed by examining changes in pain scores (primary outcome) as well as the Brief Pain Inventory and Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2. In addition, qualitative data obtained from pain diary entries and focus-group interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: Pain intensity and average pain scores were significantly lower after using the diaries. Participants reported less pain interference in mood, walking ability, normal work, and enjoyment of life. No differences were found in SF-MPQ-2 scores. Qualitative analysis indicated that better pain recognition and more effective communication with care providers led to improved self-management and more effectual treatment plans. Conclusion: Use of a pain diary in patients with chronic non-cancer pain was associated with reduced pain intensity and improved mood as well as function. Further controlled trials examining the long-term effects of pain diaries are warranted. ? 2019 Charoenpol et al.","adult; Article; Brief Pain Inventory; chronic pain; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; group therapy; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; McGill Pain Questionnaire; McGill Pain Questionnaire 2; methodology; mood; pain assessment; pain diary; pain intensity; personal experience; prospective study; qualitative analysis; quality of life; scoring system; self care; self report; Thailand; therapy effect; treatment outcome; walking; work; written communication"
"Assessment of small airway function and reversibility in symptom-controlled asthma in pediatric patients",2019,"Background: The goals of asthma management aim to control the symptoms and minimize future risk. There is, however, an option to stop controller medication if the patient has been well-controlled for at least 6-12 months. To assess control, both clinical symptom assessment and lung function should be monitored periodically. In practical clinical practice of pediatric patients, lung function is not available at all health centers. Objectives: To determine lung function with a focus on small airway function and the risk of reversibility among children who have been symptom-controlled. Methods: Our participants were symptom-controlled asthmatic children according to GINA Guideline for at least 6 months with low dose inhaled corticosteroid. Written informed-consent was given by the parents and the children. They performed a self-evaluated symptom-controlled test (C-ACT) and a spirometric assessment. Abnormal lung function was defined as FEV1 &lt; 80%, FEV1/FVC &lt; 80%, and FEF25-75 &lt; 65% predicted. Airway reversibility was determined by the change of FEV1 &gt; 12% and FEF25-75 &gt; 30% post bronchodilator. Results: Forty children (65% male) were enrolled. Age ranged between 6.7 and 15.0 years. The mean C-ACT score was 25.2 ± 1.7. Spirometry results were: Mean FEV1 84.0%, FEV1/FVC 87.8%, and FEF25-75 85.5% predicted. Normal FEV1 was found among 72.5% of participants compared to normal FEF25-75 in 87.5%. Among the abnormal FEV1 and FEF25-75, all were of mild severity as 10% retained airway reversibility. Conclusion: Children with well-controlled asthma, based on their symptom assessment, may have persistent abnormal lung function. Spirometry should be performed before considering cessation of controller medication. ? 2019, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

"The cationic cell-penetrating KT2 peptide promotes cell membrane defects and apoptosis with autophagy inhibition in human HCT 116 colon cancer cells",2019,"The anticancer activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has become more interesting because some AMPs have selective recognition against cancer cells. However, their antitumor properties and underlying mechanisms in cancer cells have not been clearly understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of KT2 (lysine/tryptophan-rich AMP) on the cellular uptake and internalization mechanism, cell viability, surface charge of the cell membrane, membrane integrity, apoptotic cell death, and autophagy in human HCT 116 colon cancer cells. We found that KT2 interacted with the cell membrane of HCT 116 cells and was internalized into HCT 116 cells via clathrin-mediated and caveolae-mediated endocytosis mechanisms. The interaction of KT2 with cells caused cell membrane structure change, elevated membrane permeability, and KT2 also affected the lipid component. The results of atomic force microscopy showed cellular membrane defects of KT2-treated cells. The internalized KT2 induced nuclear condensation and apoptotic cell death. It elevated the apoptotic factor levels including those of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. Furthermore, KT2 inhibited autophagy by the suppression of autophagy-related 5, autophagy-related 7, autophagy-related 16 like 1, and Beclin-1 proteins. In conclusion, these results revealed the cytotoxicity of cationic KT2 against HCT 116 cells and may help to clarify the interactions between cationic AMPs and cancer cells. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","apoptosis inducing factor; atg16l1 protein; autophagy related protein 5; autophagy related protein 7; beclin 1; cell penetrating peptide; clathrin; cytochrome c; cytotoxic agent; DNA; kt2 peptide; lc3 i protein; lc3 ii protein; lipid; synthetic peptide; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; atomic force microscopy; autophagy; caveola; cell death; cell membrane; cell structure; cell surface; cell viability; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; endocytosis; extracellular matrix; flow cytometry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; internalization; membrane permeability; membrane structure; MTT assay; priority journal; protein expression; surface charge; Western blotting; zeta potential"
"Efficacy and safety of perampanel in generalized and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures: A comparative study of Asian and non-Asian populations",2019,"Perampanel is an approved adjunctive treatment for focal seizures with or without focal to bilateral tonic-clonic (FBTC) seizures and generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. We compared efficacy and safety of perampanel vs placebo in Asian and non-Asian populations in a post hoc analysis of pooled data from 5 randomized phase 3 studies. Patients (?12?years old) with focal?+?FBTC seizures received perampanel 2, 4, 8, or 12?mg or placebo; patients with GTC seizures received perampanel 8?mg or placebo (titration: 4-6?weeks; maintenance: 13?weeks). Efficacy endpoints included median percentage change in FBTC or GTC seizure frequency per 28?days and 50% responder rate relative to baseline. Median percentage change in FBTC seizure frequency was significantly greater for perampanel 8 and 12?mg than placebo in the Asian population (median difference from placebo: ?30.32%, P?=?0.0017; ?30.06%, P?=?0.0008, respectively) and perampanel 4, 8, and 12?mg in the non-Asian population (?35.07%, P?=?0.0001; ?37.78%, P?<?0.0001; ?34.53%, P?<?0.0001, respectively). In both populations, median percentage change in GTC seizure frequency was significantly greater for perampanel 8?mg than placebo (median difference from placebo: Asian, ?37.37%, P?=?0.0139; non-Asian, ?27.04%, P?=?0.0006). The 50% responder rates were significantly greater than placebo for perampanel 8 and 12?mg for FBTC seizures (Asian: 58.0%, P?=?0.0017 and 58.6%, P?=?0.0013, respectively; non-Asian: 59.3%, P?<?0.0001 and 54.3%, P?=?0.0050, respectively) and perampanel 8 mg for GTC seizures (Asian: 57.6%, P?=?0.0209; non-Asian: 68.8%, P?=?0.0329). Pooled FBTC/GTC seizure data showed generally similar patterns of response to perampanel in both populations. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, irritability, dizziness, somnolence, and headache.

"Prevalence of thyroid uptake in diagnostic I-131 MIBG scintigraphy in children",2019,"Background: I-123 or I-131 labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy is an important imaging modality for evaluating childhood neural crest tumors such as neuroblastoma. Protection of the thyroid from radiation from free radioactive iodine by premedication with stable iodine is essential but thyroid uptake has still been reported in a considerable proportion of patients undergoing diagnostic I-123 MIBG and post-therapeutic I-131 MIBG scintigraphy. Reports in diagnostic I-131 MIBG scintigraphy are few. Objective: To determine prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and factors associated with thyroid uptake in patients who underwent diagnostic I-131 MIBG scintigraphy. Materials and Methods: Diagnostic I-131 MIBG scintigrams were reviewed for presence or absence of thyroid uptake. Factors potentially affecting thyroid uptake including age, weight, height, and history of prior thyroid uptake were investigated. Results: Thyroid uptake was found in 23.6% of 161 I-131 MIBG scintigrams from 55 patients and was associated with older age (uptake 8.5±7.0 years, no uptake 5.4±3.3 years, p=0.007), and greater body weight (uptake 23.5±12.6 kg, no uptake 18.4±9.0 kg, p=0.014). Prior thyroid uptake increased odds of having thyroid uptake (OR 5.37, 95% CI 2.11 to 13.69, p<0.001). Five of nine patients who received thyroid function testing had subclinical hypothyroidism, which did not seem to relate to thyroid uptake. Overt hypothyroidism was not found. Conclusion: Thyroid uptake was found in 23.6% of diagnostic I-131 MIBG scintigrams. Scintigrams with thyroid uptake are of patients who were older and had greater body weight. Odds of having thyroid uptake were increased if prior thyroid uptake was present. Subclinical hypothyroidism was found but did not seem to relate to thyroid uptake. ?

"Relation between the ankle joint angle and the maximum isometric force of the toe flexor muscles",2019,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between the ankle joint angle and maximum isometric force of the toe flexor muscles. Toe flexor strength and electromyography activity of the foot muscles were measured in 12 healthy men at 6 different ankle joint angles with the knee joint at 90 deg in the sitting position. To measure the maximum isometric force of the toe flexor muscles, subjects exerted maximum force on a toe grip dynamometer while the activity levels of the intrinsic and extrinsic plantar muscles were measured. The relation between ankle joint angle and maximum isometric force of the toe flexor muscles was determined, and the isometric force exhibited a peak when the ankle joint was at 70–90 deg on average. From this optimal neutral position, the isometric force gradually decreased and reached its nadir in the plantar flexion position (i.e., 120 deg). The EMG activity of the abductor hallucis (intrinsic plantar muscle) and peroneus longus (extrinsic plantar muscle) did not differ at any ankle joint angles. The results of this study suggest that the force generation of toe flexor muscles is regulated at the ankle joint and that changes in the length-tension relations of the extrinsic plantar muscle could be a reason for the force-generating capacity at the metatarsophalangeal joint when the ankle joint angle is changed. ? 2018","Muscle; Ankle joint angles; Force generation; Generating capacity; Length-tension relations; Metatarsophalangeal joints; Multi-joint; Muscle strength; Sitting positions; Joints (anatomy); abductor hallucis muscle; adult; ankle; ankle joint angle; Article; body height; body mass; controlled study; dynamometry; electromyography; flexor muscle; foot muscle; grip strength; human; human experiment; limit of quantitation; male; maximum isometric force; metatarsophalangeal joint; muscle isometric contraction; musculoskeletal system parameters; normal human; peroneus longus muscle; priority journal; reproducibility; toe flexor muscle"
"The sensitivity and specificity of methylene blue spray to identify the parathyroid gland during thyroidectomy",2019,"Background: Hypocalcemia is a common complication of thyroidectomy resulting from an injury to the parathyroid gland. Methylene blue, which is a medication and dye that has been used for more than a century, is safe and readily available. The previous study has found that methylene blue spray on the surgical field is absorbed by the parathyroid gland faster than in the perithyroidal area. This study was aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of methylene blue spray to identify the parathyroid gland during thyroid lobectomy. Methods: Patients who underwent thyroid lobectomy were recruited. After the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified, methylene blue was sprayed onto the thyroid bed. After 5 min, the thyroid bed was inspected for areas in which the blue color had been rapidly absorbed. Biopsies were conducted for histopathology at both the stained area and the area in which the color had faded. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Results: A total of 47 patients participated in this study. The sensitivity of methylene blue spray to identify the parathyroid gland during thyroid lobectomy was 92.31% (95% CI [63.97-99.81]) and specificity was 56.79% (95% CI [45.31-67.76]). The PPV was 25.53% (95% CI [20.34-31.53]) and NPV was 97.87% (95% CI [87.39-99.67]). There were no patients with post-operative hypocalcemia, allergic reactions to the methylene blue, or methylene blue toxicity. Conclusion: The methylene blue spray could serve as a screening tool for identification of the parathyroid gland. ?

"Factors associated with acute kidney injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome",2019,"Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most frequent extra-pulmonary organ failure in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with the development and severity of AKI in patients with ARDS. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of ARDS patients without acute or chronic kidney disease prior to the onset of ARDS over a 7-year period (2010–2017). AKI and severity of AKI were defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2012 guidelines. Results: Of the 634 ARDS patients, 357 patients met study criteria. A total of 244 (68.3%) patients developed AKI after ARDS onset: 60 (24.6%) had stage I AKI, 66 (27%) had stage II AKI, and 118 (48.4%) had stage III AKI. The median time of AKI onset for stage I AKI was 2?days (interquartile range, 1.5–5.5) while stage II and III AKI was 4?days. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with development of AKI were age [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00–1.02], SOFA score (SHR 1.16, 95%CI 1.12–1.21), a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) (SHR 1.42, 95%CI 1.07–1.89), and arterial pH on day 1 of ARDS (SHR per 0.1 units decrease was 1.18, 95%CI 1.05–1.32). In severity of AKI, stage I AKI was associated with age (SHR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01–1.05) and serum bicarbonate on day 1 of ARDS (SHR 1.07, 95%CI 1.02–1.13). Stage II AKI was associated with age (SHR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01–1.05), serum bicarbonate on day 1 (SHR 1.12, 95%CI 1.06–1.18), SOFA score (SHR 1.19, 95%CI 1.10–1.30), history of heart failure (SHR 3.71, 95%CI 1.63–8.46), and peak airway pressure (SHR 1.04, 95%CI 1.00–1.07). Stage III AKI was associated with a higher BMI (SHR 1.02, 95%CI 1.00–1.03), a history of DM (SHR 1.79, 95%CI 1.18–2.72), SOFA score (SHR 1.29, 95%CI 1.22–1.36), and arterial pH on day 1 (SHR per 0.1 units decrease was 1.25, 95%CI 1.05–1.49). Conclusions: Age, a higher severity of illness, a history of diabetes, and acidosis were associated with development of AKI in ARDS patients. Severity of AKI was further associated with BMI, history of heart failure, and peak airway pressure. ? 2019, The Author(s).","antiinfective agent; bicarbonate; calcineurin inhibitor; contrast medium; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; neuromuscular blocking agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; vasodilator agent; acute kidney failure; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; age; airway pressure; APACHE; arterial carbon dioxide tension; arterial pH; Article; artificial ventilation; bicarbonate blood level; body mass; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease severity; female; heart failure; hospital mortality; human; hypervolemia; length of stay; lung gas exchange; lung minute volume; major clinical study; male; medical history; metabolic acidosis; middle aged; onset age; pneumonia; priority journal; renal replacement therapy; retrospective study; risk factor; septic shock; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; survival rate; tidal volume; treatment outcome"
"Predictors for obesity hypoventilation syndrome in Thai population",2019,"Background and Objective Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS), is a condition with high morbidity and mortality. Body Mass Index (BMI) of more than 30 kg/m2 is used, to diagnose OHS. As BMI for obesity for Thais is 25 kg/m2, BMI more than 25 kg/m2 is used in our institution, to diagnose OHS. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if BMI of 25 kg/m2 is appropriate criterion for OHS in Thai patients. Methods This study was a retrospective study conducted at Khon Kaen University. Inclusion criteria were adult patients diagnosed with OHS in 2016. Patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), were randomly selected as control subjects. The ratio of OHS:OSA, was 1:4. Clinical factors associated with OHS were examined, using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results During the study period, there were 25 OHS and 108 OSA patients. The OHS group had a significantly higher average BMI (48.9 kg/m2 vs. 29.2 kg/m2), than the OSA group. The OHS group also had higher proportions of patients with pulmonary hypertension (50% vs. 2%), and heart failure (76% vs. 6.5%). There were two independent predictors for OHS, including BMI and serum bicarbonate levels. Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for each of these factors was 1.08 (1.01, 1.17) and 1.96 (1.15, 3.34), respectively. Body mass index greater than 25 kg/m2 and serum bicarbonate more than 25 mEq/L, yielded 100% sensitivity for OHS. Conclusions Appropriate diagnostic criteria for OHS for the Thai population, may be different from those for populations in Western countries. ? 2019 The Korean Society of Sleep Medicine.","bicarbonate; adult; apnea hypopnea index; Article; bicarbonate blood level; body mass; controlled study; female; heart failure; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; obesity hypoventilation syndrome; population; prediction; pulmonary hypertension; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; systolic blood pressure; Thai (people)"
"Cost-effectiveness analysis of olanzapine-containing antiemetic therapy for managing highly emetogenic chemotherapy in Southeast Asia: a multinational study",2019,"Purpose: Recent studies suggested that olanzapine, together with dexamethasone and serotonin-3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA), is effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) following highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). This regimen is particularly useful in Southeast Asia (SEA) countries where resources are limited. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of incorporating olanzapine into standard antiemetic regimens for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving HEC among SEA countries. Methods: Using a decision tree model, clinical and economic outcomes associated with olanzapine-containing regimen and standard antiemetic regimen (doublet antiemetic regimen: dexamethasone+first generation 5HT3RA) in most SEA countries except in Singapore (triplet antiemetic regimen: dexamethasone+first generation 5HT3RA + aprepitant) for CINV prevention following HEC were evaluated. This analysis was performed in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore, using societal perspective method with 5-day time horizon. Input parameters were derived from literature, network meta-analysis, government documents, and hospital databases. Outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in USD/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of sensitivity analyses including probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also performed. Results: Compared to doublet antiemetic regimen, addition of olanzapine resulted in incremental QALY of 0.0022–0.0026 with cost saving of USD 2.98, USD 27.71, and USD 52.20 in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, respectively. Compared to triplet antiemetic regimen, switching aprepitant to olanzapine yields additional 0.0005 QALY with cost saving of USD 60.91 in Singapore. The probability of being cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 1 GDP/capita varies from 14.7 to 85.2% across countries. Conclusion: The use of olanzapine as part of standard antiemetic regimen is cost-effective for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving HEC in multiple SEA countries. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","aprepitant; cyclophosphamide; dexamethasone; doxorubicin; granisetron; lorazepam; metoclopramide; olanzapine; ondansetron; palonosetron; serotonin 3 antagonist; antiemetic agent; antineoplastic agent; aprepitant; dexamethasone; emetic agent; olanzapine; serotonin 3 antagonist; Article; cancer chemotherapy; chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting; cost effectiveness analysis; drug efficacy; health care cost; health care utilization; human; Indonesia; Malaysia; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; Singapore; Thailand; treatment response; chemically induced; combination drug therapy; cost benefit analysis; economics; nausea; Southeast Asia; vomiting; Antiemetics; Antineoplastic Agents; Aprepitant; Asia, Southeastern; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dexamethasone; Drug Therapy, Combination; Emetics; Humans; Indonesia; Malaysia; Nausea; Olanzapine; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Serotonin 5-HT3 Receptor Antagonists; Singapore; Vomiting"
"Programmed knockout mutation of liver fluke granulin attenuates virulence of infection-induced hepatobiliary morbidity",2019,"Infection with the food-borne liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini is the principal risk factor (IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, 2012) for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the Lower Mekong River Basin countries including Thailand, Lao PDR, Vietnam and Cambodia. We exploited this link to explore the role of the secreted growth factor termed liver fluke granulin (Ov-GRN-1) in pre-malignant lesions by undertaking programmed CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the Ov-GRN-1 gene from the liver fluke genome. Deep sequencing of amplicon libraries from genomic DNA of gene-edited parasites revealed Cas9-catalyzed mutations within Ov-GRN-1. Gene editing resulted in rapid depletion of Ov-GRN-1 transcripts and the encoded Ov-GRN-1 protein. Gene-edited parasites colonized the biliary tract of hamsters and developed into adult flukes, but the infection resulted in reduced pathology as evidenced by attenuated biliary hyperplasia and fibrosis. Not only does this report pioneer programmed gene-editing in parasitic flatworms, but also the striking, clinically-relevant pathophysiological phenotype confirms the role for Ov-GRN-1 in virulence morbidity during opisthorchiasis. ? 2019, Arunsan et al.",""
"Molecular characterisation of haemoglobin E-Udon Thani (HBB:c.[79G>A;92+7A>G]): A novel form of Hb E-β-thalassaemia syndrome",2019,"Interaction of β E-globin gene with an in trans β-thalassaemia gene leads to thalassaemia syndrome, known as haemoglobin (Hb) E-β-thalassaemia disease, with variable clinical and haematological severity. Here, we reported for the first time the Hb E-β-thalassaemia syndrome caused alternatively by an in cis interaction of β E and a novel IVSI#7;A>G mutation, namely the Hb E-Udon Thani (HBB:c.[79G>A;92+7 A>G]). The syndrome was found in an adult Thai man (32) who was generally healthy but had an unexplained hypochromic microcytosis. Hb analysis identified heterozygous Hb E with very low Hb E expression (3.1%) and elevated Hb A 2 (5.7%). Final diagnosis was made on DNA analysis, which confirmed a double mutation in a single β-globin gene of the patient. A multiplex allele-specific PCR assay was developed for use in the screening of this novel form of Hb E-β-thalassaemia in the population. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

"Concept mapping to reach consensus on a 6-month exclusive breastfeeding strategy model to improve the rate in Northeast Thailand",2019,"Background: In implementation research, it is essential to involve all stakeholders in the development of complex interventions to ensure that the proposed intervention strategy is relevant and acceptable to the target area and group. The aim of this study was to involve stakeholders in conceptualising, developing, and prioritising a feasible intervention strategy to improve the 6-month exclusive breastfeeding rate in North-east Thailand. Concept mapping was used in a purposive sample including health care volunteers, health care professionals, and community leaders. During the first meeting, stakeholders (n?=?22) expressed the generation of feasible interventions. During the second meeting, participants (n?=?21) were asked to individually rate the feasibility of each intervention and to group them into relevant categories to enable multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. The outputs of analysis included the intervention list, cluster list, point map, point rating map, cluster map, and cluster rating map. All of these were shared with stakeholders (n?=?17) during the third meeting to reach consensus on an intervention model. The final proposed intervention strategy included 15 feasible interventions in five clusters: health care services, community services, and education packages for parents, family members, and communities. These interventions were prioritised for implementation over a 3-year period. Once the feasibility of each intervention is established, the proposed model could be implemented and incorporated into local health policy. After assessing intervention effectiveness, each intervention could be scaled up to other middle-income countries to help improve overall maternal and child survival. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","article; breast feeding; child; clinical article; cluster analysis; comparative effectiveness; concept mapping; consensus; education; feasibility study; female; health care policy; human; human experiment; human tissue; leadership; middle income country; multidimensional scaling; purposive sample; social welfare; Thailand; volunteer"
"Histopathology of women with ""atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion"" (ASC-H) smears",2019,"Objectives: To evaluate prevalence of underlying significant pathologies among women with cervical smears rated as 'atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H)', as well as associated risk factors. Methods: Medical records were reviewed of all consecutive women with ASC-H smears who had undergone colposcopy at Srinagarind Hospital from January 2008 to July 2016. Significant pathology results included cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2-3, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), endometrial hyperplasia, and cancer of any original site. Result: During the study period, 133 women with ASC-H were reviewed. The mean age was 45.3 years (range 21-72). The histopathologic results for the 133 women were as follows: no lesions (58; 43.6%), CIN 1 (34; 25.6%), CIN 2-3 (33; 24.8%), AIS (2; 1.5%), and cervical cancer (6; 4.5%). The overall rate of significant pathology was 30.8% (95% confidence interval, 22.9%-38.8%). Women younger than 40 years old carried a higher risk of harboring significant lesions when compared to older women (41.7% versus 27.8%, respectively). There was no significant impact of parity and menopausal status on the risk of significant pathology results. Conclusion: The rate of significant histopathologies among women with ASC-H smears in this study was approximately 31% and the associated risk factor was patient age. ? 2017 Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention.","adult; aged; cancer grading; female; follow up; human; middle aged; pathology; procedures; risk factor; squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix; uterine cervix carcinoma in situ; uterine cervix dysplasia; uterine cervix tumor; vagina smear; young adult; Adult; Aged; Atypical Squamous Cells of the Cervix; Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Risk Factors; Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions of the Cervix; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaginal Smears; Young Adult"
"Outcome of late extracardiac fontan completion in functional single ventricle patients",2019,"Objective: To determine the clinical outcomes and factors influencing the results of late Fontan completion in functional single ventricle patients.

"Electrocautery on sleeve gastrectomy staple line: A histological study on extracted specimens",2019,"Background: Sleeve gastrectomy has become the most common procedure to treat patients with morbid obesity. Hemostasis on the staple line is essential to prevent bleeding complication. Electrocautery on the staple line must be applied carefully and precisely. The electrocautery effect on postoperative leakage is still controversial. The present study was designed to demonstrate histological changes on the extracted specimens after applying electrocautery that may help addressing this question. Materials and Methods: After sleeve gastrectomy was performed, the divided part of the stomach was immediately used as a surgical specimen. Different spots on the staple line of each specimen were electrocauterized by a monopolar hook for different length of time such as one second, two seconds, three seconds, four seconds, and five seconds. A systematic study was conducted. Each electrocauterized spot on the staple line was studied in three dimensions, two lateral sides, two longitudinal sides, and thermal injury in depth to evaluate tissue injury on the staple line. Results: Eighty-five pieces of tissue, five on each of seventeen slides, were studied macroscopically and microscopically. Macroscopically, the tissue injury did not exceed the staple line. Microscopically, submucosa, and intramuscular hemorrhage and cellular swelling were found in both electrocauterized and non-electrocauterized areas. Nevertheless, neither cell death nor structural change was found. Conclusion: Precisely and carefully performed electrocautery on sleeve gastrectomy staple line is effective for hemostasis and has been proven to be safe in the present histological study. ?

"Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy compared to standard radical hysterectomy for women with early stage cervical cancer (stage Ia2 to IIa)",2019,"Radical hysterectomy is one of the standard treatments for stage Ia2 to IIa cervical cancer. Bladder dysfunction caused by disruption of the pelvic autonomic nerves is a common complication following standard radical hysterectomy and can affect quality of life significantly. Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy is a modified radical hysterectomy, developed to permit resection of oncologically relevant tissues surrounding the cervical lesion, while preserving the pelvic autonomic nerves. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy in women with stage Ia2 to IIa cervical cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 4), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to May week 2, 2018), and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2018, week 21). We also checked registers of clinical trials, grey literature, reports of conferences, citation lists of included studies, and key textbooks for potentially relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy compared to standard radical hysterectomy for women with early stage cervical cancer (stage Ia2 to IIa).

"In vitro effect of recombinant feline interferon-Ω (rFeIFN-Ω) on the primary caninetransmissible venereal tumor culture",2019,"Background: Interferons (IFNs), signaling proteins produced by host cells, are secreted in response to pathogen activity as well as to tumor cells, and display antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory effects. Recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-ω) has in vitro growth inhibition activities on various canine and feline tumor cell lines. Canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is used as an animal model for immunotherapy due to its specific growth phase. Previous studies have usually focused on the interaction between tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and CTVT cells. However, the specific effects of rFeIFN-ω on CTVT cells remains poorly defined. Aims: The aims of this study, therefore, were to evaluate the in vitro effect of rFeIFN-ω on primary CTVT cells and to study the mRNA expression of apoptotic genes and drug resistance genes. Materials and Methods: Purified CTVT cells were treated with various concentrations of rFeIFN-ω and the viability of the cultured cells was ascertained at 24, 48, and 72 h post treatment (hpt) and a dose-response curve plotted. The mRNA expression of apoptotic (BAX and BCL-2) and drug resistance (ABCB1 and ABCG2) genes was performed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR at 72 hpt. Results: rFeIFN-ω displayed an effect against CTVT cell viability, which decreasing viability in a dose-dependent manner within 72 hpt. The relative mRNA expression of BCL-2 was upregulated only at a rFeIFN-ω concentration of 104 IU/100 μl. However, higher concentrations of rFeIFN-ω gave a higher level of relative mRNA expression of ABCB1 transporter gene. Conclusion: This study provided the information of in vitro effect of rFeIFN-ω on CTVT cell viability in a dose dependent manner, as well as, the alteration of BCL-2 and ABCB1 gene expression after treatment. These results encourage future in vivo studies to evaluate the potential efficacy of this treatment in CTVT cases. ? 2019 Setthawongsin, Tangkawattana, Rungsipipat and Techangamsuwan.","breast cancer resistance protein; multidrug resistance protein 1; omega interferon; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; recombinant feline omega interferon; recombinant interferon; unclassified drug; vincristine sulfate; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; animal venereal tumor; anorexia; Article; body weight loss; cancer immunotherapy; cancer resistance; canine model; canine transmissible venereal tumor; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; drug efficacy; in vitro study; lethargy; leukopenia; male; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor biopsy; tumor cell culture"
"Opiorphin level in unstimulated whole saliva of burning mouth syndrome patients",2019,"Background: Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by intense burning sensation of the tongue or other regions of the oral mucosa with no known medical or dental cause. BMS is poorly understood condition which requires multidisciplinary management. Opiorphin is a natural antinociceptor, previously identified from human saliva and demonstrated analgesic properties. It has been reported to involve in pain pathways and could potentially be a biomarker for different types of physiological disorders. Objective: Because of its abundance in the oral cavity, we aimed to measure the level of opiorphin in unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) of patients with BMS. Materials and Methods: Demographic data, history taking, oral examination and UWS samples were obtained from 20 BMS patients before starting the drug treatment. Opiorphin levels were measured with a quantitative assay using commercially immunoenzymatic competitive ELISA kit (cat No. E1779h, Wuhan, China) and compared to those of healthy control. Results: UWS of 20 BMS patients (3 males and 17 females, average age 60.2 years old) were collected. The average concentration of opiorphin in UWS of BMS patients was 1.25+0.79 ng/ml. The result demonstrated that opiorphin in BMS patients’ UWS was significantly lower, compared to 4.16+0.82 ng/ml in the healthy control group (n = 3, 3 females, average age 50.6 years old). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the decreased levels of opiorphin in UWS of patients with BMS may be associated with the inhibition of analgesic property of encephalin, thereby causing chronic pain. To dates, knowledge on opiorphin’s involvement in pain pathways has been controversial. Further study remains significant to understand the mechanistic role of opiorphin in chronic orofacial pain. ?

"Acute toxicity and protective effect against diabetic nephropathy of the combination extract of magifera indica and polygonum odorontum in streptozotocin-diabetic rats",2019,"Background: The prevention against diabetic nephropathy is still required due to the limitation of the current therapeutic strategy. Based on the effect of antioxidants on the restoration of renal dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy, we hypothesized that the combination extract of seed of Mangifera indica or mango var. Namdokmai and aerial part of Polygonum odoratum or Vietnamese coriander (MPO) which possessed antioxidant activity might prevent diabetic nephropathy and be safe for consumption. Objective: To test this hypothesis, we aimed to determined acute toxicity and renoprotective effect of MPO in STZ-diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: Acute toxicity was assessed in Wistar rats. Single administration of MPO at dose of 5,000 mg.kg-1 BW failed to produce mortality and related toxicity signs. To test renoprotective effect, diabetic rats were induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ). STZ-diabetic rats were orally given MPO at doses of 2, 10 and 50 mg.kg-1 BW for 10 weeks. Then, they were determined body weight, kidney weight, urine volume, urine specific gravity and blood biochemical parameters at the end of experiment. In addition, kidneys were collected and determined histomorphology, nitric oxide synthase (NO), NF-kappa B (NF-kB), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aldose reductase (AR) and oxidative stress status. Results: Low dose of MPO significantly improved creatinine clearance while medium and high doses of MPO significantly improved albuminuria. MPO also improved Bowman space, glomerular tuft, eNOS, oxidative stress status and NF-kB but no significant change of VEGF and AR were observed in kidney. Therefore, the possible underlying mechanism of MPO might be partly associated with the improvement of kidney structures, oxidative stress status, eNOS and NF-kB in kidney. Conclusion: Our data suggest that MPO is the potential candidate of renoprotectant against diabetic nephropathy but sub chronic toxicity and clinical trial are still essential. ?

Materials and methods In this study, we determined the prevalence of and risk factors associated with gonococcal infections by three anatomical sites among MSM. We have conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a sexually transmitted disease (STD), gonorrhea among MSM attending two STD clinics in Khon Kaen, Thailand. We included 358 MSM over 18 years of age. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaire. In each participant, an oropharyngeal, anorectal, and endourethral swab were tested with culture and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). However, 267 urine samples were tested by both methods. Factors associated with gonorrhea infections were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results One hundred and ninety-five out of 358 (54.47%) MSM tested were found to be positive for gonorrhea using a porA gene targeted NAAT by Real-time PCR with TaqMan probes, but there was no positive result by culture. The gonorrheal prevalence for male genital site, anal, and oropharyngeal, were 34.73% (95%CI 33.07, 45.08), 29.01% (95%CI 24.61, 34.33), and 27.93% (95%CI 23.35, 32.89), respectively, while 5.9% (21/355) were positive for gonococcal infection in all anatomic sites (oropharynx + anus + urethra) of one participant. Previous history of diagnosed STDs was a significant factor associated urethral gonorrhea (odds ratio = 3.52, 95%CI 1.87–6.66, P Value< 0.001). In addition, having more than one partner was increased urethral gonorrhea (adjusted odds ratio = 2.26, 95%CI 1.10–4.68, P Value = 0.026). 100% of condom use was found decreasing urethral infection (adjusted odds ratio = 0.39, 95%CI 0.15–0.99, P Value = 0.046). Conclusions The most common anatomic site of gonorrhea infection was male genital site, and the independent risk factors were having history of diagnosed STDs and having more than one partner in the past 3 months, but 100% condom use was a protective factor of this infection. ? 2019 Budkaew et al.

"Roles of zinc finger protein 423 in proliferation and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma through oxidative stress",2019,"Zinc finger protein 423 (ZNF423) is a transcriptional factor involved in the development and progression of cancers but has not yet been examined in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), an oxidative stress-driven cancer of biliary epithelium. In this study, we hypothesized that oxidative stress mediated ZNF423 expression regulates its downstream genes resulting in CCA genesis. ZNF423 protein expression patterns and 8-oxodG (an oxidative stress marker) formation in CCA tissues were investigated using immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that ZNF423 was overexpressed in CCA cells compared to normal bile duct cells adjacent of the tumor. Notably, ZNF423 expression was positively correlated with 8-oxodG formation. Moreover, ZNF423 expression in an immortalized cholangiocyte cell line (MMNK1) was increased by hydrogen peroxide-treatment, suggesting that oxidative stress induces ZNF423 expression. To investigate the roles of ZNF423 in CCA progression, ZNF423 mRNA was silenced using specific siRNA in CCA cell lines, KKU-100 and KKU-213. Silencing of ZNF423 significantly inhibits cell proliferation and invasion of both CCA cell lines. Taking all these results together, the present study denoted that ZNF423 is an oxidative stress-responsive gene with an oncogenic property contributing to the regulation of CCA genesis. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Vitamin D-binding protein gene polymorphism predicts pegylated interferon-related HBsAg seroclearance in HBeAg-negative Thai chronic hepatitis B patients: A multicentre study",2019,"Background: Vitamin D deficiency is related to poor clinical outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Methods: We aimed to investigate the association between the genetic variants in the vitamin D metabolic pathway and the response to pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) therapy in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection. One hundred seven patients treated with Peg-IFN for 48 weeks were selected from 13 specialty hospitals. Eight genotypes of vitamin D cascade genes, including CYP27B1 (rs10877012), DHCR7 (rs12785878), CYP2R1 (rs2060793, rs12794714) and GC (rs4588, rs7041, rs222020, rs2282679), were found. Results: Eighty-two patients (83.7%) were infected with HBV genotype C. Eight patients had compensated liver cirrhosis (8.7%). At 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation, 41 patients (42.3%) achieved sustained treatment response, 53 (55.2%) obtained HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/ml, 6 (5.6%) gained HBsAg seroclearance, 2 (1.9%) had HBsAg seroconversion and 69 (64.5%) exhibited alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization. Multivariate analysis revealed that baseline HBsAg level (OR =0.06, 95% CI: 0.08-0.49, p=0.008) and the GC rs222020 TT genotype (OR=17.72, 95% CI: 1.07-294.38, p=0.04) independently predicted sustained HBsAg seroclearance. In addition, this genotype was a predictor for normalization of ALT (OR=4.61, 95%CI: 1.59-13.40, p=0.005) after therapy. The HBsAg levels at baseline and during and post-treatment tended to be reduced with the GC rs222020 TT compared with the non-TT genotypes. The other studied polymorphisms were not associated with treatment response. Conclusions: The GC rs222020 TT genotype, which is a variant in the vitamin D-binding protein gene, could identify HBeAg-negative patients who have a high probability to achieve HBsAg clearance and ALT normalization after treatment with Peg-IFN. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.","alpha interferon; antivirus agent; hepatitis B(e) antigen; macrogol; peginterferon alpha2a; recombinant protein; vitamin D binding protein; blood; chronic hepatitis B; clinical trial; female; follow up; genetic polymorphism; genetics; Hepatitis B virus; human; immunology; male; middle aged; multicenter study; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; seroconversion; Antiviral Agents; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Male; Middle Aged; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymorphism, Genetic; Prognosis; Recombinant Proteins; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Seroconversion; Vitamin D-Binding Protein"
"Aberrant mRNA splicing generates oncogenic RNA isoforms and contributes to the development and progression of cholangiocarcinoma (Review)",2019,"Cholangiocarcinoma is a lethal biliary cancer, with an unclear molecular pathogenesis. Alternative splicing is a post?transcriptional modification that generates mature mRNAs, which are subsequently translated into proteins. Aberrant alternative splicing has been reported to serve a role in tumor initiation, maintenance and metastasis in several types of human cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma. In this review, the aberrant splicing of genes and the functional contributions of the spliced genes, in the carcinogenesis, progression and aggressiveness of cholangiocarcinoma are summarized. In addition, factors that influence this aberrant splicing that may be relevant as therapeutic targets or prognosis markers for cholangiocarcinoma are discussed. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"Quality of working life (QoWL) among doctors in the university hospitals in the northeastern Thailand",2019,"Objective: (1) To assess the quality of working life among doctors in the university hospitals in the northeastern Thailand. (2) To analyse the strength of association between personal and working factors and good quality of working life (QoWL). Materials and Methods: A descriptive study was performed. The study population was 910 university doctors in 2 university hospitals. The self-administration Work-related Quality of Life Scale-2 Online Website (THQWL) questionnaire was used for collecting data. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression with stratified analysis were used. Results: There were 339 of 910 (37.3%) completed questionnaires. Majority of doctors (58.6%) rated their QoWL at average. As these were 7 dimensions of QoWL scales, the doctors rated employee engagement (EET), general well-being (GWB), job career satisfaction (JCS), and overall (OVL) as good down to average. Control at work (CAW) and working condition (WCS) were rated as average to good. Stress at work (SAW) was rated as average down to lower. Working hours and financial status were associated to good QoWL. Limitation of hours of work per week at 50, 60, 70, or 80 was all related to good QoWL. Limitation at 70 hours per week had the highest strength of association (AOR 3.84, 95% CI: 2.22, 6.62, p<0.001). The AOR of financial status of having savings was 2.12, 95% CI: 1.27, 3.56, p = 0.004 and the AOR of not having health hazards was 2.04, 95% CI: 1.08, 3.85, p = 0.028. Conclusion: The university doctors had average to good QoWL. Factors positively affecting were their satisfaction with the training the doctors receive in order to perform their present job and the opportunity to use their abilities at work in JCS dimension. Factors negatively affecting were stress from being unable to achieve the deadlines and feeling of being under pressure at work in SAW dimension. In addition, limitation of working hours per week and having savings might be related to good QoWL. ?

"Cholangiocarcinoma trends, incidence, and relative survival in Khon Kaen, Thailand from 1989 through 2013: A population-based cancer registry study",2019,"Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a common malignancy in northeastern Thailand. Over the last 4 decades, several policies have been implemented for its prevention, but there has been no update on the trends and relative survival (RS). Our aim was (a) to perform a statistical assessment of the incidence trends of CCA and project future trends, and (b) to estimate relative survival. Methods: All cases of CCA diagnosed from 1989 through 2013 were abstracted from the Khon Kaen Cancer Registry (KKCR). A jointpoint regression model was used to estimate the annual percentage change (APC) and to project future trends. We also calculated RS. Results: There were 11,711 cases of CCA. The incidence rate increased with an APC of 1.79% (95% confidence interval [CI], ?0.2 to 3.8) from 1989 through 2002, and decreased with an APC of ?6.09% (95% CI, ?8.2 to ?3.9) from 2002 through 2013. The projected incidence of CCA should stable over the next 10 years, albeit higher than the world rate. The respective 5-year RS for both sexes for age groups of 30–40, 41–45, 51–60, and 61–98 years was 22.3% (95% CI, 16.8–29.5), 14.3% (95% CI, 12.0–17.0), 8.6% (95% CI, 7.8–10.0), and 7.2% (95% CI, 6.4–8.0). Conclusion: The incidence rate of CCA has decreased since 2002, representing a real decline in the risk of CCA. The incidence of CCA is projected to stabilize by 2025. The survival of patients with CCA remains poor.

"Frailty syndrome in biliary tract cancer patients: Prevalence and associated factors",2019,"Background: Frailty, a risk of unfavorable outcomes from disability to adapt to stressors, is common in the elderly but could occur in younger patients with cancer. This study focused on the prevalence of frailty in biliary tract cancer (BTC) and associated factors. Methods: A total of 75 BTC patients receiving chemotherapy from January 2016 to September 2017 were enrolled. Frailty was diagnosed by the FRAIL (Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, and Loss of weight) scale. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to analyze factors associated with frailty. Results: The prevalence rates of frailty and pre-frailty were 12% (9 cases) and 60% (45 cases). According to multivariate logistic analysis, three factors were associated with frailty, including old age, high body mass index (BMI), and history of liver surgery. The adjusted odds ratios of the factors were 1.12 (95%CI: 1.01, 1.24), 1.28 (95%CI: 1.01, 1.64), and 6.16 (95%CI: 1.11, 34.16), respectively. Conclusion: Frailty is not uncommon in BTC patients. Old age, high BMI, and history of liver surgery are important risk factors for frailty. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention.","biliary tract tumor; body mass; fatigue; female; frailty; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; odds ratio; prevalence; prospective study; risk factor; statistical model; Biliary Tract Neoplasms; Body Mass Index; Fatigue; Female; Frailty; Hospitalization; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors"
"Arginine, glutamine, and fish oil supplementation in cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy: A randomized control study",2020,"We evaluated the effectiveness of arginine, glutamine, and fish oil supplementation in patients’ ability to adhere to the planned regimen and associated toxicities in patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Eighty-eight cancer patients were randomized into 2 groups, A; regular diet and B; regular diet plus nutritional supplementation during their CCRT course. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between toxicity and the study groups. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare between the 2 groups. Among 88 patients, 45%, 32%, and 23% were head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, and cervical cancer patients, respectively. Significantly higher grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities were found in group A than in group B (23% vs 5%, P= 0.03). The CCRT completion rate was lower in group A than in group B (75% vs 91%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P= 0.09). Adjusted for type of cancer and age, group B patients were associated with lower hematologic toxicities of CCRT, P= 0.03. Two-year overall survival was 47% for group A, and 61% for group B, P= 0.22. In conclusion, incidence of severe hematologic toxicities were significantly lower in patients with arginine, glutamine, and fish oil supplementation during CCRT. These findings, therefore, need further studies on the isocaloric design. ? 2019 The Authors","arginine; carboplatin; cisplatin; fish oil; fluorouracil; glutamine; adult; Article; blood toxicity; brachytherapy; cancer localization; cancer patient; chemoradiotherapy; controlled study; diet supplementation; esophagus cancer; febrile neutropenia; female; head and neck cancer; hospital admission; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mucosa inflammation; multicenter study; oral mucositis; overall survival; patient compliance; pneumonia; quality of life; radiation dermatitis; radiation dose fractionation; randomized controlled trial; uterine cervix cancer; volumetric modulated arc therapy"
"Hypolipidemic effect of methoxyflavone-enriched extract of Kaempferia parviflora in cholesterol-induced dyslipidemic rats",2019,"Kaempferia parviflora is a Zingiberaceae plant that has been used as traditional medicine in Asia. The pharmacological effects have been widely reported such as anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy, anti-obesity and suppression of adipocyte hypertrophy. This study aimed to examine the hypolipidemic effect of methoxyflavone-enriched extract of K. parviflora rhizome (MKE) in cholesterol-induced dyslipidemic rats. To develop the hypercholesteroremic condition, the rats were fed with cholesterol (2 g/kg) twice a day for 6 weeks. Dyslipidemic rats were divided into 6 groups including three control vehicle groups, two doses of MKE treatment groups, and a simvastatin positive control group. Oral administration of MKE at daily doses of 150 or 300 mg/kg for 12 weeks significantly decreased in the levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL. The MKE and simvastatin treated groups significantly increased the levels of HDL. These results suggest that MKE and its active components exhibit hypolipidemic effects in dyslipidemic rats. ? 2019, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.",""
"Pre- and post-radical prostatectomy testosterone levels in prostate cancer patients",2019,"Radical prostatectomy is one of the treatment of choices for localized prostate cancer. Published data show that radical prostatectomy is associated with both an increase and decrease in testosterone levels. This study aimed to document the changes in pre- and postoperative serum testosterone levels after radical prostatectomy along with the associations between serum testosterone levels and prostate cancer profiles in Thai population. Localized and locally advanced prostate cancer patients who elected to have radical prostatectomy without prior androgen deprivation therapy were included in the study. Patients’ demographic data, pre- and postoperative serum testosterone levels, sex hormone binding globulin, albumin, prostate-specific antigen, and final pathologic reports were collected. Eighty-five prostate cancer patients were included in this study. Mean age was 67.32 years. Mean pre- and postoperative serum testosterone levels were 424.95 ng/dL and 371.94 ng/dL, respectively (p-value < 0.001). There was a greater testosterone reduction in patients with a final pathologic report of Gleason 4 + 3 and above compared with those with a Gleason 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 (p-value = 0.001). No significant association between preoperative testosterone levels and final Gleason scores was observed. This study documented significant postoperative testosterone reductions in prostate cancer patients after a radical prostatectomy. Patients with high Gleason grades had greater testosterone reductions. These findings may have clinical implications for the prediction of postoperative hypogonadal states in prostate cancer patients. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","albumin; prostate specific antigen; sex hormone; sex hormone binding globulin; prostate specific antigen; testosterone; adult; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; brachytherapy; cancer staging; computer assisted tomography; Gleason score; human; hypogonadism; hysterectomy; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; sexual dysfunction; testosterone blood level; thyroidectomy; blood; comparative study; middle aged; pathology; postoperative period; preoperative period; prostate; prostate tumor; severity of illness index; Aged; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Postoperative Period; Preoperative Period; Prospective Studies; Prostate; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Severity of Illness Index; Testosterone"
"GLIM criteria for the diagnosis of malnutrition – A consensus report from the global clinical nutrition community",2019,"Rationale: This initiative is focused on building a global consensus around core diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults in clinical settings. Methods: In January 2016, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was convened by several of the major global clinical nutrition societies. GLIM appointed a core leadership committee and a supporting working group with representatives bringing additional global diversity and expertise. Empirical consensus was reached through a series of face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, and e-mail communications. Results: A two-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis was selected, i.e., first screening to identify “at risk” status by the use of any validated screening tool, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition. The malnutrition criteria for consideration were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among the GLIM core and supporting working group members. The top five ranked criteria included three phenotypic criteria (non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition at least one phenotypic criterion and one etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity as Stage 1 (moderate) and Stage 2 (severe) malnutrition are proposed. It is recommended that the etiologic criteria be used to guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories. Conclusion: A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed. Next steps are to secure further collaboration and endorsements from leading nutrition professional societies, to identify overlaps with syndromes like cachexia and sarcopenia, and to promote dissemination, validation studies, and feedback. The diagnostic construct should be re-considered every 3–5 years. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd, European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition","Article; body mass; body weight loss; cachexia; consensus development; disease burden; disease classification; disease severity; food intake; human; malnutrition; muscle mass; risk assessment; sarcopenia; screening test"
"Sibling Similarity in Metabolic Syndrome: The Portuguese Sibling Study on Growth, Fitness, Lifestyle and Health",2019,"This study aims to estimate sibling resemblance in metabolic syndrome (MS) markers, and to investigate the associations of biological and behavioral characteristics with MS. The sample comprises 679 biological siblings (363 females; 316 males) aged 9–20?years. MS markers included waist circumference (WC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TRI), fasting glucose (GLU) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Body mass index (BMI), biological maturation, muscular, and cardiorespiratory fitness were also assessed. Behavioral characteristics, including dietary intake and physical activity, were self-reported by questionnaire. Multilevel models were used, and sibling resemblance was estimated using the intraclass correlation (ρ). In general, same-sex siblings showed higher resemblance in MS markers than opposite-sex siblings. However, variability in sibling resemblance in MS markers was evident with the inclusion of covariates. Biological characteristics including age, BMI and maturity offset influenced all MS markers except for TRI. Importantly, behavioral characteristics diversely influenced MS markers: fruit and vegetables only influenced SBP, whereas physical activity affected HDL-C. Additionally, muscular fitness impacted significantly on MS Z-score, WC, SBP and GLU, whilst cardiorespiratory fitness only affected WC. In conclusion, biological and behavioral characteristics influenced the expression of MS markers. These results confirmed the importance of considering individual characteristics when designing individualized programs for diminishing the adverse effects of specific MS markers. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adolescent; adult; age; Article; body mass; child; dietary intake; female; fitness; gender; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; maturation; metabolic syndrome X; physical activity; Portuguese (citizen); questionnaire; scoring system; sibling; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; blood pressure; epidemiology; exercise; genetics; glucose blood level; health; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; obesity; physiology; Portugal; risk factor; sibling; young adult; Adolescent; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Child; Cholesterol, HDL; Exercise; Female; Health; Humans; Life Style; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Obesity; Physical Fitness; Portugal; Risk Factors; Siblings; Triglycerides; Waist Circumference; Young Adult"

"In a hospital setting, is there any benefit in prioritizing risk following exposure to tuberculosis? - A preliminary report",2019,"Objective: To study a program of post-exposure management for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in the hospital setting. Materials and Methods: A study was conducted among hospital personnel (HP) from March 2016 to June 2017. A program of postexposure management for pulmonary TB in the hospital setting was instituted which followed the “Guidelines for the Investigation of Contacts of Persons with Infectious Tuberculosis: Recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC” using the QuantiFERON?-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-GIT), an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA), as a screening test. Results: Three hundreds and twelve HP were classified as the contact persons and 15 TB patients were confirmed as the index cases. Among 312 HP, 134 (42.9%) was classified as high or medium priority contacts, and 30 of them (22.4%) were investigated by QFTGIT after being exposed. Two HP (6.7%) revealed positive result and were confirmed as having latent tuberculosis infection, but only one HP accepted INH preventive treatment. Twenty six (8.3%) HP could not be prioritized due to their incomplete information. Conclusion: This program was unable to statistically identify the post-exposed HP with infectious tuberculosis due to limited numbers. The appropriate guidelines need to be developed more clearly with definition of a ‘close contact’. This will be more useful for Thailand hospital settings. ?

"Liver flukes: Clonorchis and opisthorchis",2019,"Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini, and O. felineus are liver flukes of human and animal pathogens occurring across much of Europe and Asia. Nevertheless, they are often underestimated compared to other, better known neglected diseases in spite of the fact that many millions of people are infected and hundreds of millions are at risk. This is possibly because of the chronic nature of the infection and disease and that it takes several decades prior to a life-threatening pathology to develop. Several studies in the past decade have provided more information on the molecular biology of the liver flukes which clearly lead to better understanding of parasite biology, systematics, and population genetics. Clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis are characterized by a chronic infection that induces hepatobiliary inflammation, especially periductal fibrosis, which can be detected by ultrasonography. These chronic inflammations eventually lead to cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a usually fatal bile duct cancer that develops in some infected individuals. In Thailand alone, opisthorchiasis-associated CCA kills up to 20,000 people every year and is therefore of substantial public health importance. Its socioeconomic impacts on impoverished families and communities are considerable. To reduce hepatobiliary morbidity and CCA, the primary intervention measures focus on control and elimination of the liver fluke. Accurate diagnosis of liver fluke infections in both human and other mammalian, snail and fish intermediate hosts, are important for achieving these goals. While the short-term goal of liver fluke control can be achieved by praziquantel chemotherapy, a comprehensive health education package targeting school children is believed to be more beneficial for a long-term goal/solution. It is recommended that a transdisciplinary research or multisectoral control approach including one health and/or eco health intervention strategy should be applied to combat the liver flukes, and hence contribute to reduction of cholangiocarcinoma in endemic areas. ?

"High macrophage activities are associated with advanced periductal fibrosis in chronic Opisthorchis viverrini infection",2019,"Liver fluke infection caused by Opisthorchis viverrini induces several hepatobiliary conditions including advanced periductal fibrosis (APF) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), but >25% of the infected population develops APF and 1% develop CCA. The innate immune response is the first line of defence, and macrophages are critical regulators of fibrosis. We hypothesized that macrophages from infected individuals have different capacities to either promote or suppress periductal fibrosis. We compared phagocytic activities of macrophages of healthy individuals and O?viverrini-infected individuals?±?APF, and found that macrophages from infected individuals with APF ingested significantly higher numbers of beads compared with healthy controls and O?viverrini-infected individuals without APF. To further investigate proteolytic activity, we monitored real-time phagosomal proteolysis of beads conjugated to DQ-BODIPY-BSA using live cell imaging. We show that macrophages from O?viverrini-infected individuals with APF also have elevated phagosomal proteolysis activity, which is consistent with their increased phagocytic activity. Additionally, stimulated ROS production by blood monocytes was higher in individuals with APF compared with healthy controls and infected individuals without APF. These results suggest that during O?viverrini infection, macrophages with high phagocytic and proteolytic activities together with elevated ROS production are the phenotypes that can promote tissue damage, which results in periductal fibrosis. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","reactive oxygen metabolite; biological marker; advanced periductal fibrosis; Article; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; fibrosis; high risk population; human; human cell; live cell imaging; macrophage; major clinical study; male; monocyte; opisthorchiasis; phagosome; population based case control study; primary prevention; priority journal; protein degradation; adult; animal; fibrosis; immunology; liver cirrhosis; macrophage; macrophage activation; middle aged; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; parasitology; pathology; young adult; Adult; Animals; Biomarkers; Female; Fibrosis; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Macrophage Activation; Macrophages; Male; Middle Aged; Opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; Young Adult"
