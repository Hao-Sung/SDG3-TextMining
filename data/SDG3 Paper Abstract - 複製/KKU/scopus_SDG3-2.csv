To consolidate the results from all available reports in scientific databases, systematic review and meta-analysis techniques were used to quantify these associations. Studies investigating associations between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity were systematically searched in PubMed, Human Genome Epidemiology Network, and the Cochrane Library. Primary outcomes were the associations between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity. Overall odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95%CIs were calculated using a random-effect model to determine the associations between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity. A clear association between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity was identified in our analyses. The summary OR was 6.23 (95%CI = 4.11–9.45). Similar associations were also found in the subgroup analyses by lapatinib treatment regimens. ORs were 10.04 (95%CI = 6.15–16.39), 8.65 (95%CI = 4.52–16.58), and 3.88 (95%CI = 2.20–6.82) in the lapatinib group, lapatinib + trastuzumab group, and lapatinib + chemotherapy or lapatinib + trastuzumab + chemotherapy group, respectively. Since HLA-DRB1*07:01 is associated with lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity, genetic screening of HLA-DRB1*07:01 in breast cancer patients prior to lapatinib therapy is warranted for patient safety. In addition, further studies should define the risk of HLA-DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity in specific ethnicities. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",,alanine aminotransferase; antineoplastic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; carboplatin; HLA DRB1 antigen; lapatinib; paclitaxel; tenascin; trastuzumab; adjuvant therapy; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; breast cancer; disease association; gene linkage disequilibrium; human; meta analysis; odds ratio; priority journal; quantitative analysis; systematic review; toxic hepatitis,2-s2.0-85070340203

Chronic infection is associated with a fatal complication, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a late-presenting and aggressive malignancy. Currently, annual mortality rates from CCA mirror trends in incidence, due in part to limited availability of efficient prognostic and early diagnostic biomarkers. With ability to detect thousands of urinary metabolites using metabonomics, the urine metabolome holds great potential in providing an insight into system-level alterations in carcinogenesis and in identifying metabolic markers altered in response to disturbed homoeostasis. Methods: Global molecular profiling using reversed-phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was utilised to acquire the urinary spectral profile of 137 Thai subjects (48 at high risk of infection, 41 with O. viverrini infection, 34 periportal fibrosis and 14 CCA) from Khon Kaen, Thailand. Results: Multivariate statistical analysis identified perturbation in several molecular classes related to purine metabolism and lipid metabolism in the CCA urine metabolome. These markers mainly reflect changes in energy metabolism to support proliferation (increased fatty acid oxidation and purine recycling), DNA methylation and hepatic injury. Conclusions: Several metabolites of biological interest were discovered from this proof-of-principle dataset. Augmenting these findings is essential to accelerate the development of urinary metabolic markers in CCA. ? 2019 The Authors",bile duct cancer; mass spectrometry; metabonomics; Opisthorchis viverrini,"1 methylhypoxanthine; 2 naphthoic acid derivative; 2 trans,4 decadienoylcarnitine; 2,6 dimethylheptanoylcarnitine; 3 amino 2 naphthoic acid; 7 methylguanine; acylcarnitine; benzoic acid derivative; betaine derivative; butyrylcarnitine; carnitine derivative; citric acid; creatinine; glycocholic acid; hippuric acid; hypoxanthine; hypoxanthine derivative; isocitric acid; leucyl proline; levacecarnine; n methyluric acid; n sulfooxybenzoate; phenylalanine; proline; proline betaine; proline derivative; purine; unclassified drug; uric acid; uric acid derivative; valerylcarnitine; adult; aged; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; DNA methylation; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; female; human; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver injury; major clinical study; male; metabolomics; opisthorchiasis; priority journal; purine metabolism; reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography; Thailand; urinalysis",2-s2.0-85070929880

We aimed to investigate whether Fe status and inherited Hb disorders (IHbD) modify the impact of MNP on growth and diarrhoea among young Lao children. In a double-blind controlled trial, 1704 children of age 6-23 months were randomised to daily MNP (with 6 mg Fe plus fourteen micronutrients) or placebo for about 36 weeks. IHbD, and baseline and final Hb, Fe status and anthropometrics were assessed. Caregivers provided weekly morbidity reports. At enrolment, 55·6 % were anaemic; only 39·3 % had no sign of clinically significant IHbD. MNP had no overall impact on growth and longitudinal diarrhoea prevalence. Baseline Hb modified the effect of MNP on length-for-age (LAZ) (P for interaction = 0·082). Among children who were initially non-anaemic, the final mean LAZ in the MNP group was slightly lower (-1·93 (95 % CI -1·88, -1·97)) v. placebo (-1·88 (95 % CI -1·83, -1·92)), and the opposite occurred among initially anaemic children (final mean LAZ -1·90 (95 % CI -1·86, -1·94) in MNP v. -1·92 (95 % CI -1·88, -1·96) in placebo). IHbD modified the effect on diarrhoea prevalence (P = 0·095). Among children with IHbD, the MNP group had higher diarrhoea prevalence (1·37 (95 % CI 1·17, 1·59) v. 1·21 (95 % CI 1·04, 1·41)), while it was lower among children without IHbD who received MNP (1·15 (95 % CI 0·95, 1·39) v. 1·37 (95 % CI 1·13, 1·64)). In conclusion, there was a small adverse effect of MNP on growth among non-anaemic children and on diarrhoea prevalence among children with IHbD. ? 2019 The Authors.",Anaemia; Diarrhoea; Growth; Inherited Hb disorder; Iron status; Micronutrient powder; Young children,alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; colecalciferol; copper sulfate; cyanocobalamin; ferrous fumarate; folic acid; gluconate zinc; hemoglobin; iron; nicotinic acid; potassium iodate; pyridoxine; retinol; riboflavin; selenium; thiamine; tocopherol; trace element; age; anemia; anthropometry; Article; body height; caregiver; child; child growth; controlled study; diarrhea; dietary supplement; double blind procedure; female; human; infant; inherited hemoglobin disorder; Laos; major clinical study; male; morbidity; powder; prevalence; protein defect; randomized controlled trial,2-s2.0-85069519934

The aim of this study was to involve stakeholders in conceptualising, developing, and prioritising a feasible intervention strategy to improve the 6-month exclusive breastfeeding rate in North-east Thailand. Concept mapping was used in a purposive sample including health care volunteers, health care professionals, and community leaders. During the first meeting, stakeholders (n?=?22) expressed the generation of feasible interventions. During the second meeting, participants (n?=?21) were asked to individually rate the feasibility of each intervention and to group them into relevant categories to enable multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. The outputs of analysis included the intervention list, cluster list, point map, point rating map, cluster map, and cluster rating map. All of these were shared with stakeholders (n?=?17) during the third meeting to reach consensus on an intervention model. The final proposed intervention strategy included 15 feasible interventions in five clusters: health care services, community services, and education packages for parents, family members, and communities. These interventions were prioritised for implementation over a 3-year period. Once the feasibility of each intervention is established, the proposed model could be implemented and incorporated into local health policy. After assessing intervention effectiveness, each intervention could be scaled up to other middle-income countries to help improve overall maternal and child survival. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",6-month exclusive breastfeeding; concept mapping; intervention; North-east Thailand; policy,article; breast feeding; child; clinical article; cluster analysis; comparative effectiveness; concept mapping; consensus; education; feasibility study; female; health care policy; human; human experiment; human tissue; leadership; middle income country; multidimensional scaling; purposive sample; social welfare; Thailand; volunteer,2-s2.0-85065794159

Climate variables are potential predictors of dengue transmission. Associations between climate variables and dengue have usually been performed on large-scale first-level national administrative divisions, i.e. provinces. Here we analyze data on a finer spatial resolution in one province, which is often more relevant for effective disease control design. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of seasonal variations, monthly climate variability, and to identify local clusters of symptomatic disease at the sub-district level based on reported dengue cases. Methods: Data on dengue cases were retrieved from the national communicable disease surveillance system in Thailand. Between 2006 and 2016, 15,167 cases were recorded in 199 sub-districts of Khon Kaen Province, northeastern Thailand. Descriptive analyses included demographic characteristics and temporal patterns of disease and climate variables. The association between monthly disease incidence and climate variations was analyzed at the sub-district level using Bayesian Poisson spatial regression. A hotspot analysis was used to assess the spatial patterns (clustered/dispersed/random) of dengue incidence. Results: Dengue was predominant in the 5-14 year-old age group (51.1%). However, over time, dengue incidence in the older age groups (> 15 years) gradually increased and was the most affected group in 2013. Dengue outbreaks coincide with the rainy season. In the spatial regression model, maximum temperature was associated with higher incidence. The hotspot analysis showed clustering of cases around the urbanized area of Khon Kaen city and in rural areas in the southwestern portion of the province. Conclusions: There was an increase in the number of reported dengue cases in older age groups over the study period. Dengue incidence was highly seasonal and positively associated with maximum ambient temperature. However, climatic variables did not explain all the spatial variation of dengue in the province. Further analyses are needed to clarify the detailed effects of urbanization and other potential environmental risk factors. These results provide useful information for ongoing prediction modeling and developing of dengue early warning systems to guide vector control operations. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Climate; Dengue; Rainfall; Seasonal; Temperature; Thailand,"rain; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; climate change; dengue; disease association; disease severity; environmental temperature; epidemic; female; groups by age; human; incidence; infant; major clinical study; male; middle aged; physical parameters; rural area; seasonal variation; sex difference; spatial pattern; symptomatology; temporal pattern; Thailand; urban area; animal; Bayes theorem; city; cluster analysis; dengue; incidence; preschool child; season; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Cities; Cluster Analysis; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Rain; Seasons; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Temperature; Thailand",2-s2.0-85071427093

Despite extensive research on opisthorchiasis, the eradication of this disease has yet to be achieved. One of the major reasons for this failure is due to the multi-host life cycle of the parasite, which requires complex medical and public health interventions to eradicate. Another reason is due to a lack of knowledge of not only the interactions between the parasite and the human immune system, but also the interactions between the parasite and its various hosts during its complicated life cycle. Recent advances in various high-throughput omics technologies has allowed for the identification of key biomolecules crucial to the processes of parasitic transmission, and the identification of novel drug and/or vaccine targets. In this paper, omics studies dealing with O. viverrini host-parasite biology will be reviewed. In particular, there will be a focus on the strategies O. viverrini uses to trigger, evade, and manipulate the host's defense systems. Recently-identified biological molecules with potential as targets for interventions will also be reviewed. The results obtained from these omics approaches to analyzing O. viverrini and host interactions will be of great importance in the future when developing effective and sustainable medical and public health models for the prevention and control of opisthorchiasis and opisthorchiasis-induced CCA. ? 2019",Cholangiocarcinoma; Food-borne trematode; Omics; Opisthorchis viverrini; Prevention and control,praziquantel; cancer; disease; disease control; flatworm; host-parasite interaction; immune system; life cycle; public health; bile duct carcinoma; drug development; gene function; genetic transcription; high throughput screening; host parasite interaction; host resistance; human; infection control; intermediate host; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; parasite transmission; prevalence; proteomics; public health; Review; sensitivity and specificity; snail; transcriptomics; animal; bile duct cancer; bile duct carcinoma; genomics; metabolomics; opisthorchiasis; parasitology; Cambodia; Laos; Thailand; Viet Nam; Opisthorchis viverrini; Trematoda; Animals; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Cholangiocarcinoma; Genomics; Humans; Metabolomics; Opisthorchiasis; Proteomics,2-s2.0-85065817559

The aim of the study was to investigate the potential role of naringin from Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr and sericin from Bombyx mori combination in the treatment of psoriasis. Inhibitory effects on the expression of mRNA and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-23, and IL-12p40) were investigated. Methods: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were isolated from 10 healthy subjects and 10 patients with psoriasis. The hPBMCs from each group were exposed to naringin or sericin alone, and the combination of naringin and sericin. The expression levels of mRNA and the production of all cytokines were determined using quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Results: Naringin/sericin combination significantly decreased the expression of mRNA and the production of all pro-inflammatory cytokines in hPBMCs from patients with psoriasis. The potency of inhibitory activity was markedly higher than naringin or sericin alone. Conclusion: The activity of naringin/sericin combination on down-regulation of these pro-inflammatory cytokines suggested its potential clinical use in psoriasis as well as other inflammation-associated diseases.

ZNF423 protein expression patterns and 8-oxodG (an oxidative stress marker) formation in CCA tissues were investigated using immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that ZNF423 was overexpressed in CCA cells compared to normal bile duct cells adjacent of the tumor. Notably, ZNF423 expression was positively correlated with 8-oxodG formation. Moreover, ZNF423 expression in an immortalized cholangiocyte cell line (MMNK1) was increased by hydrogen peroxide-treatment, suggesting that oxidative stress induces ZNF423 expression. To investigate the roles of ZNF423 in CCA progression, ZNF423 mRNA was silenced using specific siRNA in CCA cell lines, KKU-100 and KKU-213. Silencing of ZNF423 significantly inhibits cell proliferation and invasion of both CCA cell lines. Taking all these results together, the present study denoted that ZNF423 is an oxidative stress-responsive gene with an oncogenic property contributing to the regulation of CCA genesis. ? 2019 by the authors.

Objectives: To demonstrate and compare the wishes cancer patients and the perceptions of their relatives regarding end-of-life care, and to identify factors associated with patients' preferences regarding place of death. Methods: A sample of cancer patients and their relatives who attended the Srinagarind Hospital (Thailand) oncology clinic or day chemotherapy from September 2017 to August 2018 were enrolled. Questionnaires were given to the participants, in which the patients were asked to respond based on their own end-of-life preferences, and relatives were asked to imagine how the patients would respond to the questions. Results: One hundred eighty pairs of patients and relatives were recruited. Respondents in both groups placed importance on place of death, relationship with family, physical and psychological comfort, and relationship with the medical staff. Both groups generally agreed with the statements on the questionnaire (10/13 statements). Relatives underestimated the preferences of the patients in 3 areas: “not being a burden to others,” “preparation for death,” and “physical and psychological comfort.” Being married (adjusted odds ratio (AOD) 6.4, 95%confidence interval (CI) 1.1,36.5), having had more than 6 years of education (AOD 6.5, 95%CI 1.8,23.7), having lung cancer compared to colon cancer (AOD 12, 95%CI 1.2,118.7), duration after cancer diagnosis (AOD 0.9, 95%CI 0.93,0.99), previous hospital admission (AOD 5.7, 95%CI 1.5,21.2), and life satisfaction (AOD 17.6, 95%CI 2.9,104.9) were factors associated with preference for home death. Conclusion: Thai cancer patients and their relatives indicated similar preferences with regard to what constitutes a good death and patients' wishes for their end-of-life period. However, the patients' relatives underestimated the importance patients placed on statements in three domains. Factors that influenced a preference for a home death were identified. ? 2019 The Author(s)",Advance care planning; End-of-life care; Good death; Home death; Palliative care; Psychology,,2-s2.0-85068746508

Body Mass Index (BMI) of more than 30 kg/m2 is used, to diagnose OHS. As BMI for obesity for Thais is 25 kg/m2, BMI more than 25 kg/m2 is used in our institution, to diagnose OHS. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if BMI of 25 kg/m2 is appropriate criterion for OHS in Thai patients. Methods This study was a retrospective study conducted at Khon Kaen University. Inclusion criteria were adult patients diagnosed with OHS in 2016. Patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), were randomly selected as control subjects. The ratio of OHS:OSA, was 1:4. Clinical factors associated with OHS were examined, using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results During the study period, there were 25 OHS and 108 OSA patients. The OHS group had a significantly higher average BMI (48.9 kg/m2 vs. 29.2 kg/m2), than the OSA group. The OHS group also had higher proportions of patients with pulmonary hypertension (50% vs. 2%), and heart failure (76% vs. 6.5%). There were two independent predictors for OHS, including BMI and serum bicarbonate levels. Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for each of these factors was 1.08 (1.01, 1.17) and 1.96 (1.15, 3.34), respectively. Body mass index greater than 25 kg/m2 and serum bicarbonate more than 25 mEq/L, yielded 100% sensitivity for OHS. Conclusions Appropriate diagnostic criteria for OHS for the Thai population, may be different from those for populations in Western countries. ? 2019 The Korean Society of Sleep Medicine.",Diagnosis; Obesity; Obstructive sleep apnea; Sensitivity; Serum bicarbonate,bicarbonate; adult; apnea hypopnea index; Article; bicarbonate blood level; body mass; controlled study; female; heart failure; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; obesity hypoventilation syndrome; population; prediction; pulmonary hypertension; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; systolic blood pressure; Thai (people),2-s2.0-85069760975

This study aimed to determine the impact of annual versus semi-annual pVL monitoring on treatment outcomes in Asian CLWH. Methods: Data on children with perinatally acquired HIV aged &lt;18?years on first-line, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based cART with viral suppression (two consecutive pVL &lt;400?copies/mL over a six-month period) were included from a regional cohort study; those exposed to prior mono- or dual antiretroviral treatment were excluded. Frequency of pVL monitoring was determined at the site-level based on the median rate of pVL measurement: annual 0.75 to 1.5, and semi-annual &gt;1.5 tests/patient/year. Treatment failure was defined as virologic failure (two consecutive pVL &gt;1000?copies/mL), change of antiretroviral drug class, or death. Baseline was the date of the second consecutive pVL &lt;400?copies/mL. Competing risk regression models were used to identify predictors of treatment failure. Results: During January 2008 to March 2015, there were 1220 eligible children from 10 sites that performed at least annual pVL monitoring, 1042 (85%) and 178 (15%) were from sites performing annual (n?=?6) and semi-annual pVL monitoring (n?=?4) respectively. Pre-cART, 675 children (55%) had World Health Organization clinical stage 3 or 4, the median nadir CD4 percentage was 9%, and the median pVL was 5.2 log10 copies/mL. At baseline, the median age was 9.2?years, 64% were on nevirapine-based regimens, the median cART duration was 1.6?years, and the median CD4 percentage was 26%. Over the follow-up period, 258 (25%) CLWH with annual and 40 (23%) with semi-annual pVL monitoring developed treatment failure, corresponding to incidence rates of 5.4 (95% CI: 4.8 to 6.1) and 4.3 (95% CI: 3.1 to 5.8) per 100 patient-years of follow-up respectively (p?=?0.27). In multivariable analyses, the frequency of pVL monitoring was not associated with treatment failure (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.59). Conclusions: Annual compared to semi-annual pVL monitoring was not associated with an increased risk of treatment failure in our cohort of virally suppressed children with perinatally acquired HIV on first-line NNRTI-based cART. ? 2019 The Authors.

Mixed metal compounds may have different dissolution kinetics and plant uptake than single metal compounds. In this study, mixed Fe(II)/Zn(II) phosphates (0–100 at% Zn) were prepared by aqueous precipitation and their structural characteristics and dissolution kinetics in a sand column were measured as model for divalent metal and phosphate release in soil. Three minerals were identified, namely vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O) at 0–20 at% Zn, phosphophyllite (Zn2Fe(PO4)2·4H2O) at 20–79 at% Zn, and hopeite (Zn3(PO4)2·4H2O) at 79–100 at% Zn. The Fe-rich materials had high SSA of 42–64 m2 g?1, which decreased to ?4 m2 g?1 for ?79 at% Zn. The Fe K-edge and Zn K-edge XANES spectroscopy measurements show that the samples had comparable local structure and contained 13–72% of Fe as Fe(III) due to partial oxidation. In the sand column, Zn(II) and Fe(II) phosphates dissolved near-congruently at steady state (&gt;7 h), whereas mixed Fe(II)/Zn(II) phosphates showed preferential release of Zn over P and Fe, likely due to reprecipitation of Fe. Pot experiments demonstrate that Zn from Fe(II)/Zn(II) phosphates is absorbed by bird's eye chili plants (C. annuum), in agreement with the preferential dissolution of Zn(II). These results may provide insight into the dissolution of other divalent metals, which not only aids in the growth of plants and resulting foodstuff but ultimately leads to reductions in environmental contamination. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Contamination; Dissolution; Ferrous phosphate; Plant uptake; Remediation; Zinc phosphate,"Contamination; Dissolution; Environmental impact; Iron compounds; Kinetics; Metals; Phosphate minerals; Precipitation (chemical); Remediation; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; Aqueous precipitation; Environmental contamination; Plant uptake; Preferential dissolution; Slow release fertilizers; Spectroscopy measurements; Structural characteristics; Zinc phosphates; Zinc compounds; ferrous ion; zinc phosphate; divalent cation; ferrous ion; ferrous phosphate; mineral; phosphate; zinc derivative; zinc phosphate; chemical compound; detection method; dicotyledon; dissolution; environmental impact; experimental study; growth; inorganic compound; phosphate; precipitation (chemistry); reaction kinetics; Article; atomic absorption spectrometry; Capsicum annuum; chemical structure; controlled study; dissolution; nonhuman; particle size; plant growth; precipitation; sand; scanning electron microscopy; steady state; surface area; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray powder diffraction; chemistry; kinetics; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; solubility; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Aves; Cations, Divalent; Chemical Precipitation; Ferrous Compounds; Kinetics; Minerals; Oxidation-Reduction; Phosphates; Soil; Solubility; X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy; Zinc Compounds",2-s2.0-85061605269

It can infect humans and animals through skin wounds and the eyes, causing pythiosis, an infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. Antifungal agents are ineffective as pythiosis treatments because ergosterol, the target site of most antifungal agents, is not found in the P. insidiosum cytoplasmic membrane. The best choice for treatment is surgical removal of the infected organ. While natural plant products or secretory substances from bacterial flora have exhibited in vitro anti-P. insidiosum activity, their mechanism of action remains unknown. Therefore, this study hypothesized that the mechanism of action could be related to changes in P. insidiosum biochemical composition (such as lipid, carbohydrate, protein or nucleic acid) following exposure to the inhibitory substances. The biochemical composition of P. insidiosum was investigated by Synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy. Results: Fraction No.6 from the crude extract of P. stutzeri ST1302, fraction No.1 from the crude extract of K. pneumoniae ST2501 and xanthyletin were used as anti-P. insidiosum substances, with MFCs at 3.125, 1.57-1.91, 0.003 mg/ml, respectively. The synchrotron FTIR results show that the deconvoluted peak distributions in the amide I, amide II, and mixed regions were significantly different between the treatment and control groups. Conclusions: Xanthyletin and the secondary metabolites from P. stutzeri ST1302 and K. pneumoniae ST2501 exerted anti-P. insidiosum activity that clearly changed the proteins in P. insidiosum. Further study, including proteomics analysis and in vivo susceptibility testing, should be undertaken to develop a better understanding of the mechanism of anti-P. insidiosum activity. ? 2019 The Author(s).",K. pneumoniae ST2501; P. insidiosum; P. stutzeri ST1302; Synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy; Xanthyletin,"amide; amide I; amide II; fatty acid; polysaccharide; unclassified drug; xanthyletin; antifungal agent; coumarin derivative; xanthyletine; antifungal activity; Article; biochemical composition; controlled study; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Klebsiella pneumoniae; lipid membrane; metabolite; minimum fungicidal concentration; nonhuman; Pseudomonas stutzeri; Pythium insidiosum; drug effect; infrared spectroscopy; Klebsiella pneumoniae; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; Pseudomonas stutzeri; Pythium; secondary metabolism; Antifungal Agents; Coumarins; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Pseudomonas stutzeri; Pythium; Secondary Metabolism; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared",2-s2.0-85064403661

Based on the effect of antioxidants on the restoration of renal dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy, we hypothesized that the combination extract of seed of Mangifera indica or mango var. Namdokmai and aerial part of Polygonum odoratum or Vietnamese coriander (MPO) which possessed antioxidant activity might prevent diabetic nephropathy and be safe for consumption. Objective: To test this hypothesis, we aimed to determined acute toxicity and renoprotective effect of MPO in STZ-diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: Acute toxicity was assessed in Wistar rats. Single administration of MPO at dose of 5,000 mg.kg-1 BW failed to produce mortality and related toxicity signs. To test renoprotective effect, diabetic rats were induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ). STZ-diabetic rats were orally given MPO at doses of 2, 10 and 50 mg.kg-1 BW for 10 weeks. Then, they were determined body weight, kidney weight, urine volume, urine specific gravity and blood biochemical parameters at the end of experiment. In addition, kidneys were collected and determined histomorphology, nitric oxide synthase (NO), NF-kappa B (NF-kB), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aldose reductase (AR) and oxidative stress status. Results: Low dose of MPO significantly improved creatinine clearance while medium and high doses of MPO significantly improved albuminuria. MPO also improved Bowman space, glomerular tuft, eNOS, oxidative stress status and NF-kB but no significant change of VEGF and AR were observed in kidney. Therefore, the possible underlying mechanism of MPO might be partly associated with the improvement of kidney structures, oxidative stress status, eNOS and NF-kB in kidney. Conclusion: Our data suggest that MPO is the potential candidate of renoprotectant against diabetic nephropathy but sub chronic toxicity and clinical trial are still essential. ?

Methods We used a large, insurance-based database including all stroke admissions in the public health sector in Thailand between 2004 and 2015. Logistic and Royston-Parmar regressions were used to quantify the effect of HF on in-hospital and long-Term outcomes, respectively. All models were adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities and stratified by stroke type: Acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) or intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Multistate models were constructed using flexible survival techniques to predict the impact of HF on the disease course of a patient with stroke (baseline-[recurrence]-death). Only first-ever cases of AIS or ICH were included in the multistate analysis. Results 608 890 patients (mean age 64.29±13.72 years, 55.07% men) were hospitalised (370 527 AIS, 173 236 ICH and 65 127 undetermined pathology). There were 398 663 patients with first-ever AIS and ICH. Patients were followed up for a median (95% CI) of 4.47 years (4.45 to 4.49). HF was associated with an increase in postdischarge mortality in AIS (HR [99% CI] 1.69 [1.64 to 1.74]) and ICH (2.59 [2.07 to 3.26]). HF was not associated with AIS recurrence, while ICH recurrence was only significantly increased within the first 3 years after discharge (1.79 [1.18 to 2.73]). Conclusions HF increases the risk of mortality in both AIS and ICH. We are the first to report on high-risk periods of stroke recurrence in patients with HF with ICH. Specific targeted risk reduction strategies may have significant clinical impact for mortality and recurrence in stroke. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after solid organ transplantation (SOT) requires a functional immune system. We assessed the association between quantitation and function of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells and CMV infection in SOT recipients. Methods. During a 10-year period, selected kidney, heart, lung, pancreas, liver, and composite tissue recipients were tested for CMV-specific CD8+ T cells immune competence (CMV-CD8+), as measured by enumeration, interferon-gamma production, and CD107a/b degranulation. Quantitative and functional data were used to assemble T-cell immune competence (TIC) score. CMV infection was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction in blood and other samples or histopathology. Results. Of 130 patients tested, 59 had CMV infection or disease. The median onset to CMV infection was 10.5 months (interquartile range [IQR], 5.5-18.7). Gastrointestinal disease (28.8%), pneumonia (20.3%), and CMV syndrome (17%) were most common presentation. An impaired nonspecific or CMV-CD8+ TIC score was associated with tissue-invasive disease (hazard risk, 2.84, 95% confidence interval, 1.03-11.81; P = 0.04). Patients with impaired CMV-CD8+ TIC score had longer viremia duration (42.4 days vs 18.8 d; P &lt; 0.001). Patients with impaired nonspecific or CMV-CD8+ TIC score had higher risk of relapse (68.8% vs 27.9%; hazard risk, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-5.89; P = 0.03). Patients with CMV infection or disease had lower median absolute lymphocyte count (380 [IQR, 240-540] vs 940 [IQR, 551-1210] cells/mm3; P &lt; 0.0001) and CD4+ T cell count (29 cells/mm3 [IQR, 1.3-116.0] vs 325.5 cells/mm3 [IQR, 151.5-589.8]; P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions. Nonspecific and CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell function correlated with the course of CMV after SOT, and measuring these has the potential to assist in its clinical management. ?2018.",,gamma interferon; lysosome associated membrane protein 1; lysosome associated membrane protein 2; adult; Article; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cytokine production; cytomegalovirus infection; degranulation; disease association; disease duration; female; gastrointestinal disease; graft recipient; heart transplantation; histopathology; human; immunocompetence; infection control; kidney transplantation; liver transplantation; lung transplantation; lymphocyte count; lymphocyte function; lymphocyte subpopulation; major clinical study; male; organ transplantation; pancreas transplantation; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; viremia; CD8+ T lymphocyte; Cytomegalovirus; cytomegalovirus infection; immunology; lymphocyte subpopulation; middle aged; organ transplantation; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Female; Humans; Immunocompetence; Lymphocyte Subsets; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Transplantation,2-s2.0-85063711949

This liver fluke is classified as a carcinogen due to its causal links with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) development. Although treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) effectively cures O. viverrini infection, the prevalence remains high due to the traditional consumption of raw fish. Therefore, re-infection is common in the endemic community, leading to severe hepato-biliary morbidities including the fatal CCA. In this study, we evaluate the association between the frequency of previous PZQ treatment and current O. viverrini infections among Thai adults living in the endemic area of northeast Thailand. Methods: This study includes all participants who were screened for O. viverrini infection in the Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care Program (CASCAP), northeast Thailand. History of PZQ treatment was recorded using a health questionnaire. O. viverrini infections were diagnosed using urine antigen detection. Associations between PZQ and O. viverrini were determined by adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using multiple logistic regression. Results: Among participants, 27.7% had previously been treated once with PZQ, 8.2% twice, 2.8% three times, and 3.5% more than three times. Current O. viverrini prevalence was 17% (n = 524). Compared with participants who never used PZQ, the aOR for infection among those who used the drug once was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.88-1.37), twice was 1.19 (95% CI: 0.85-1.68), three times was 1.28 (95% CI: 0.74-2.21), and more than three times was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.18-2.93; P = 0.007). Conclusions: The population with a frequent history of PZQ use and still continued raw fish consumption showed high levels of repeated reinfection with O. viverrini. They were infected, treated and re-infected repeatedly. These findings suggest that certain participants continue raw fish consumption even after previous infection. This is a particular problem in highly endemic areas for O. viverrini and increases the risk of CCA. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Opisthorchis viverrini; Praziquantel; Screening; Thailand; Urine,"praziquantel; anthelmintic agent; praziquantel; adult; aged; antigen detection; Article; cholangiocarcinoma screening and care program; cross-sectional study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; freshwater fish; health program; human; major clinical study; male; microscopy; middle aged; opisthorchiasis; priority journal; public health; questionnaire; screening; sensitivity and specificity; tertiary care center; ultrasound; animal; bile duct cancer; bile duct carcinoma; complication; feces; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; parasitology; raw food; recurrent disease; risk factor; sentinel surveillance; statistical model; Thailand; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Anthelmintics; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Cholangiocarcinoma; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feces; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; Praziquantel; Raw Foods; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Sentinel Surveillance; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thailand; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85063189010

Methods: Among 52 patients with surgically proven IE in our database, 24 underwent contrast-enhanced ECG cardiac CTA and were included in the study and all of them also underwent TTE. Results: For the detection of pseudoaneurysm/abscess in both native and prosthetic valves, cardiac CTA demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (91.5% vs. 15.8%, p < 0.0001) with similar specificity (81.25). Cardiac CTA demonstrated similar sensitivity and specificity in identifying vegetation and valvular dehiscence in all patients. Conclusions: Preoperative cardiac CTA can be seen as complementary to TTE in assessing complications such as pseudoaneurysm or abscess of the patients with IE. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cardiac compute tomography; Computed tomography angiography; Infective endocarditis; Valvular heart disease,computed tomographic angiography; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; endocarditis; female; human; male; middle aged; postoperative complication; preoperative care; procedures; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; Computed Tomography Angiography; Echocardiography; Endocarditis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Preoperative Care; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity,2-s2.0-85062841622

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features, radiographic findings and species of NTM among patients with NTM pulmonary infection or colonization at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand, from January 2012 to December 2016 in order to inform future efforts for early diagnosis of NTM. The criteria used to diagnose NTM infection and colonization were the Amercican Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America (ATS/IDSA) 2007 criteria. The medical records of 263 patients diagnosed at the study hospital during the study period with NTM in the respiratory system were reviewed. Thirty-six subjects had a definite pulmonary NTM infection, 17 had a probable pulmonary NTM infection and 210 had NTM colonization. HIV antibody testing was performed on 32 of the definite/probable pulmonary NTM patients: 2 tested positive. Eight definite/probable pulmonary NTM patients had a positive interferon gamma antibody test, of whom 6 had disseminated NTM infections. The most common co-morbidities seen among subjects with definite/probably NTM infection were having a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and having current bronchiectasis. The most common co-morbidities seen among subjects with NTM colonization were cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. The chest radiographic patterns seen most among subjects with definite/probable pulmonary NTM infection were a reticular infiltration (n=31, 58.5%), bronchiectasis (n=29, 54.7%) and nodular lesions (n=24, 45.3%). The areas on the chest radiograph where infiltrations most commonly seen were in the right upper lobe (n=26, 49.1%), right middle lobe (n=19, 35.8%), lingular lobe (n=17, 32.1%) and left upper lobe (n=17, 32.1%). The most common NTM organisms isolated on culture in the subjects with definite/ probable pulmonary NTM infection were: Mycobacterium abscessus (n=21, 39.6%), M. avium complex (n=19, 35.8%), M. fortuitum (n=3, 5.7%), M. scrofulaceum (n= 3, 5.7%), rapid-growing mycobacteria (RGM) (n=3, 5.7%), M. kansasii (n=2, 3.8%) and M. gordonae (n=2, 3.8%). Five factors were significantly associated with definite/ probable pulmonary NTM infection: patient age < 60 years [adjusted OR=2.47; 95% CI: 1.20-5.10], female sex (adjusted OR=2.13; 95% CI: 1.00-4.55), duration of symptoms > 28 days (adjusted OR=3.95, 95% CI: 1.91-8.20), having a bronchiectasis pattern on chest X-ray (adjusted OR=2.56; 95% CI: 1.18-5.53) and isolating M. abscessus on culture (adjusted OR=3.25; 95% CI: 1.50-7.02). In conclusion, isolated NTM from respiratory specimens does not necessarily imply infection or require treatment. In our study only twenty percent were denifite/probable pulmonary NTM infection. Early diagnosis and treatment denifite/probable pulmonary NTM subjects will decrease morbidity and mortality. However, treatment subjects with NTM colonization may increase drug toxicity because of long term of treatment. ? 2019, SEAMEO TROPMED Network.

Its etiologies include idiopathy, distal obstruction, high acidity with local ischemia, and iatrogenesis. Moreover, there have been some reports of Kalimate (a potassium-lowering agent) possibly being irritated, obstructed, and necrotized the gastric mucosa. This article reports on the risk of gastric necrosis and perforation while using this potassium-lowering agent, as well as management of this complication. Methodology: Case report. Patient information: A female infant was born at 38 weeks gestation, weighting 3180 g. She had undergone a central shunt on the 13th day of life due to complex heart disease. The first day after the operation, the infant was found to have an acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia. After successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest, she was administered intravenous calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and oral calcium polystyrene sulfonate (Kalimate ? ). The infant's abdomen became distended and abdominal radiography showed pneumoperitoneum and an opaque particle at the upper-left quadrant of the abdomen. The patient was then referred to our hospital, where an exploratory laparotomy was immediately performed. We found a large area of necrosis and a rupture along the greater curvature of the stomach that extended to the fundus with impaction of the medical bezoars inside and generalized contamination of the abdominal cavity. After the operation, the infant clinically improved. Conclusion: These findings suggest that physicians should be aware of potentially serious complications while using this potassium-lowering agent and point to the importance of early surgical intervention in cases of neonatal gastric perforation. ? 2018 The Authors",Kalimate; Necrosis; Neonate; Perforation; Stomach,bicarbonate; gluconate calcium; meropenem; polystyrenesulfonic acid; abdominal radiography; acute kidney failure; aortopulmonary shunt; Article; artificial ventilation; bezoar; case report; clinical article; female; gastrostomy; heart arrest; heart disease; human; hyperkalemia; laparotomy; length of stay; necrosis; newborn; newborn disease; pneumoperitoneum; priority journal; resuscitation; stomach disease; stomach mucosa; stomach perforation; stomach rupture; stomach wall; vaccination,2-s2.0-85059172159

The ability of M. abscessus to cause disease and develop drug resistance is known to have a genetic basis. We aimed to differentiate between persistent infection and reinfection using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and to study the genetic diversity of M. abscessus relative to multi-organ infection and drug resistance in Northeast Thailand. DNA was extracted from 62 M. abscessus isolates (24 cases). The following genes were sequenced: argH, cya, glpK, gnd, murC, pta, purH and rpoB. Drug susceptibility tests were performed using broth microdilution. Subspecies classification and phylogeny were determined. Among the 24 cases (62 isolates), 19 cases (49 isolates) were of true NTM infection and 5 cases (13 isolates) examples of colonization. Two subspecies, M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (12 cases, 32 isolates) and M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (12 cases, 30 isolates) were identified. The major sequence type (ST) was ST227. Two clonal groups among patients were found; clonal cluster I (5 cases, 8 isolates) and clonal cluster II (2 cases, 4 isolates) but no epidemiological link was apparent. Reinfection (2 cases with different clones of M. abscessus strains; >9 SNPs different) and persistent infection (14 cases with the same clone; <6 SNPs) were distinguished based on a phylogeny. Based on these SNP cutoff values, 3 cases of persistent colonization (same strain through time) and 2 cases of re-colonization (different strains through time) were identified. M. abscessus subsp. abscessus was significantly associated with clarithromycin resistance (p <.001) and multi-organ infection (p =.03). Molecular epidemiology based on MLST can be used to differentiate between reinfection vs persistent infection, persistent colonization vs re-colonization.

Thirty healthy subjects, aged 18–24 yr, ate a test lunch at their habitual speed until they felt satiated. The activities of masseter and suprahyoid muscles were recorded to determine the number of chews and the moment of swallowing. The weight of meal intake was recorded along with body mass index (BMI), chewing rate, number of chews per mouthful, meal duration, ingestion rate, hunger, and food preference levels. The mean weight (±SD) of meal intake, chewing rate, and number of chews per mouthful were 261.4 ± 78.9 g, 94.4 ± 13.5 chews min?1, 19.2 ± 6.4 chews per mouthful, respectively. Chewing rate was not correlated with the number of chews per mouthful. The multivariable linear regression showed that meal intake was significantly positively associated with chewing rate, meal duration, and BMI, but inversely associated with the number of chews per mouthful (adjusted R2 = 0.42). It was concluded that the number of chews was not associated with chewing rate but meal intake was explained by both reduced number of chews and increased chewing rate. ? 2018 Eur J Oral Sci",chewing frequency; eating speed; food consumption; obesity,adolescent; body mass; caloric intake; feeding behavior; female; human; male; mastication; physiology; statistical model; young adult; Adolescent; Body Mass Index; Energy Intake; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Mastication; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85055896429

Methods: Records were reviewed of women who underwent cervical cancer screening and were found to be infected with high-risk HPV. The genotypes of high-risk HPV were categorized as HPV 16, HPV 18, and other than 16 or 18. Early sexual intercourse was defined as first sexual intercourse at the age of 19 years or younger. Multiple sexual partners was defined as having more than three lifetime sexual partners. Associations between sexual behavior and HPV 16/18 infection were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Of the 349 women included in the study, 72 (20.6%) and 30 (8.6%) were infected by HPV 16 and 18, respectively. Eighty-two women (26.0%) reported having engaged in early sexual intercourse, and 33 (10.4%) reported having had multiple sexual partners. After adjustment for age, parity, and smoking habits, we found that women who had engaged in early sexual intercourse tended to have a higher risk of HPV 16 (OR 1.74; 95% CI 0.93–3.29), and those who had had multiple sexual partners were found to be at a significantly higher risk for HPV 18 (OR 4.58; 95% CI 1.44–14.58). Conclusion: Sexual behavior was associated with an increased risk of HPV 16/18 infection. Engaging in early sexual intercourse increased the risk of HPV 16 infection, and having had multiple sexual partners increased that of HPV 18. ? 2019 Itarat et al.",Cervical neoplasia; Human papillomavirus; Sexual behavior; Sexual partner,adolescent sexual behavior; adult; Article; cancer screening; concurrent sexual partnership; controlled study; female; high risk patient; human; Human papillomavirus type 16; Human papillomavirus type 18; infection risk; major clinical study; middle aged; nonhuman; papillomavirus infection; parity; retrospective study; sexual behavior; sexual intercourse; smoking habit; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix disease; young adult,2-s2.0-85071886638

Diagnostics has remained an active field of research in order to develop tools that are appropriate for each stage from the first efforts until attempts to block transmission. For example, with regard to schistosomiasis, chemotherapy has excellent impact on morbidity, while better diagnostics and vaccine research have been promoted to complement the other components of the control programme. The need for surveillance in areas where the prevalence has been brought down to very low levels necessitated development of spatio-temporal tools and ecological models based on geographical information systems (GIS) to produce risk and distribution maps for monitoring and evaluation of programme success. New knowledge and experiences in management of the diseases contribute to the formulation of new schemes in management and treatment. Ways of drawing attention to the disease, such as determining disability weights for use in computation of burden of disease, updating epidemiological profile and unravelling new aspects of the disease provide bases for modifying the operation of control programmes as we move forward. Programme evaluation based on reports of actual implementation of activities brought to the fore problems related to the distribution of chemotherapy as well as social, cultural and behavioural aspects of endemic communities. Importantly, this highlighted the necessity of adapting control activities to specific situations of the endemic areas.

In breast cancer, many genes are used as biomarkers. Since, several SNP variations of hallmark - related genes have been reported to be of value in risk prediction in various cancers and populations, some genetic polymorphism loci were combined and reported as biomarkers for use in the risk assessment of breast cancer in Thai people. Methods: Twelve cancer gene hallmarks (15 polymorphic loci) were selected and genotyped in 184 breast cancer patients and 176 healthy individuals in Phitsanulok, Thailand. Results: AA genotype of CD44 rs187116 (c.67+4883G > A), the C allele of CD133 rs2240688 (c.*667A > C), the *2 allele (4 bp deletion) of NF-κB1 rs28362491 and the homozygous null allele genotype of GSTM1 were significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (p < 0.05). A combination of these 4 significant loci showed that AA-AA-*1*1-homozygous null allele genotype has the greatest correlation with increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 21.00; 95% CI: 1.77 to 248.11; p = 0.015), followed by GA-AA-*2*2- homozygous null allele genotype (p = 0.037) and GG-AC-*1*2- homozygous null allele genotype (p = 0.028). Conclusion: These findings suggest that the polymorphisms of CD44 rs187116 (c.67+4883G > A), CD133 rs2240688 (c.*667A > C), NF-κB1 rs28362491 and GSTM1 homozygous null allele genotype might be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and this gene combination could possibly be used as biomarkers for risk prediction, which would be of benefit in planning health surveillance and cancer prevention. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.",Breast cancer; Cancer surveillance; Genetic biomarker; Polymorphism,"CD133 antigen; CD44 protein, human; glutathione S-transferase M1; glutathione transferase; hyaluronic acid binding protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; NFKB1 protein, human; PROM1 protein, human; tumor marker; breast tumor; case control study; female; gene deletion; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; human; incidence; pathology; prognosis; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Thailand; AC133 Antigen; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Female; Gene Deletion; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Glutathione Transferase; Humans; Hyaluronan Receptors; Incidence; NF-kappa B p50 Subunit; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Thailand",2-s2.0-85071735754

The key feature of the policy is health facilities performing day surgery can claim the treatment expense based on relative weight (RW) instead of adjusted RW (adjRW). Procedures for 12 diseases (so-called “candidate procedures”) are eligible for the new reimbursement. The objective of this study was to assess the current day surgery situation in Thailand and analyze potential budget impact from the new policy. Methods: A quantitative cross-section design was employed. Individual inpatient records of the Universal Coverage Scheme during 2014-2016 were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and simulation analyses were applied. The analyses were divided into three subtopics: 1) case volume and expense claim, 2) utilization across facilities, and 3) case mix index and budget impact. Results: Overall, day surgery accounted for 4.8% of admissions with candidate procedures. Inguinal hernias, hemorrhoids, and common bile duct stones caused the largest sum of admission numbers and admission days. Currently, the annual reimbursement for candidate procedures treated as inpatient cases is around 290.8 million Baht (US$ 8.8 million), with about 12.4 million Baht (US$ 0.38 million) for day surgery cases. If all candidate procedures were performed as day surgery and diagnostic-related groups (DRG) version 6 was applied, the incremental budget would amount to 1.9 million Baht (US$ 58,903). Conclusions: The new reimbursement policy will likely lead to minimal budget burden. Even in the case of maximal uptake of the policy, the needed budget would increase by just 15%. The marginal budget increment was explained by the infinitesimal RW-adjRW difference. Apart from the financial measure, other qualitative aspects of the policy, such as infrastructure and health staff readiness, should be explored. ? 2019 Suphanchaimat et al.",Budget impact; Case mix index; Day surgery; Inpatient; Thailand,Article; budget; common bile duct stone; cross-sectional study; health care policy; health care utilization; hemorrhoid; hospital admission; human; inguinal hernia; length of stay; major clinical study; quantitative study; reimbursement; surgery; Thailand,2-s2.0-85067564504

Over the last 4 decades, several policies have been implemented for its prevention, but there has been no update on the trends and relative survival (RS). Our aim was (a) to perform a statistical assessment of the incidence trends of CCA and project future trends, and (b) to estimate relative survival. Methods: All cases of CCA diagnosed from 1989 through 2013 were abstracted from the Khon Kaen Cancer Registry (KKCR). A jointpoint regression model was used to estimate the annual percentage change (APC) and to project future trends. We also calculated RS. Results: There were 11,711 cases of CCA. The incidence rate increased with an APC of 1.79% (95% confidence interval [CI], ?0.2 to 3.8) from 1989 through 2002, and decreased with an APC of ?6.09% (95% CI, ?8.2 to ?3.9) from 2002 through 2013.

The respective 5-year RS for both sexes for age groups of 30–40, 41–45, 51–60, and 61–98 years was 22.3% (95% CI, 16.8–29.5), 14.3% (95% CI, 12.0–17.0), 8.6% (95% CI, 7.8–10.0), and 7.2% (95% CI, 6.4–8.0). Conclusion: The incidence rate of CCA has decreased since 2002, representing a real decline in the risk of CCA. The incidence of CCA is projected to stabilize by 2025. The survival of patients with CCA remains poor.

However, their antitumor properties and underlying mechanisms in cancer cells have not been clearly understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of KT2 (lysine/tryptophan-rich AMP) on the cellular uptake and internalization mechanism, cell viability, surface charge of the cell membrane, membrane integrity, apoptotic cell death, and autophagy in human HCT 116 colon cancer cells. We found that KT2 interacted with the cell membrane of HCT 116 cells and was internalized into HCT 116 cells via clathrin-mediated and caveolae-mediated endocytosis mechanisms. The interaction of KT2 with cells caused cell membrane structure change, elevated membrane permeability, and KT2 also affected the lipid component. The results of atomic force microscopy showed cellular membrane defects of KT2-treated cells. The internalized KT2 induced nuclear condensation and apoptotic cell death. It elevated the apoptotic factor levels including those of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. Furthermore, KT2 inhibited autophagy by the suppression of autophagy-related 5, autophagy-related 7, autophagy-related 16 like 1, and Beclin-1 proteins.

Methods: We aimed to investigate the association between the genetic variants in the vitamin D metabolic pathway and the response to pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) therapy in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection. One hundred seven patients treated with Peg-IFN for 48 weeks were selected from 13 specialty hospitals. Eight genotypes of vitamin D cascade genes, including CYP27B1 (rs10877012), DHCR7 (rs12785878), CYP2R1 (rs2060793, rs12794714) and GC (rs4588, rs7041, rs222020, rs2282679), were found. Results: Eighty-two patients (83.7%) were infected with HBV genotype C. Eight patients had compensated liver cirrhosis (8.7%). At 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation, 41 patients (42.3%) achieved sustained treatment response, 53 (55.2%) obtained HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/ml, 6 (5.6%) gained HBsAg seroclearance, 2 (1.9%) had HBsAg seroconversion and 69 (64.5%) exhibited alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization. Multivariate analysis revealed that baseline HBsAg level (OR =0.06, 95% CI: 0.08-0.49, p=0.008) and the GC rs222020 TT genotype (OR=17.72, 95% CI: 1.07-294.38, p=0.04) independently predicted sustained HBsAg seroclearance. In addition, this genotype was a predictor for normalization of ALT (OR=4.61, 95%CI: 1.59-13.40, p=0.005) after therapy. The HBsAg levels at baseline and during and post-treatment tended to be reduced with the GC rs222020 TT compared with the non-TT genotypes. The other studied polymorphisms were not associated with treatment response. Conclusions: The GC rs222020 TT genotype, which is a variant in the vitamin D-binding protein gene, could identify HBeAg-negative patients who have a high probability to achieve HBsAg clearance and ALT normalization after treatment with Peg-IFN. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.",HBeAg-negative; Hepatitis B virus infection; Pegylated-interferon; Polymorphisms; Response; Vitamin D,"alpha interferon; antivirus agent; hepatitis B(e) antigen; macrogol; peginterferon alpha2a; recombinant protein; vitamin D binding protein; blood; chronic hepatitis B; clinical trial; female; follow up; genetic polymorphism; genetics; Hepatitis B virus; human; immunology; male; middle aged; multicenter study; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; seroconversion; Antiviral Agents; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Male; Middle Aged; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymorphism, Genetic; Prognosis; Recombinant Proteins; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Seroconversion; Vitamin D-Binding Protein",2-s2.0-85065450321

Consumption of raw meat or freshwater fishes in endemic areas is the major risk factor. Throughout Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar, freshwater fish are often consumed raw or undercooked. The risk of this practice for gnathostomiasis infection in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar has never been evaluated. Here, we identified larvae of Gnathostoma species contaminating freshwater fishes sold at local markets in these three countries. Public health authorities should advise people living in, or travelling to, these areas to avoid eating raw or undercooked freshwater fishes. Identification of larvae was done using molecular methods: DNA was sequenced from Gnathostoma advanced third-stage larvae recovered from snakehead fishes (Channa striata) and freshwater swamp eels (Monopterus albus). Phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene showed that the G. spinigerum sequences recovered from southern Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar samples had high similarity to those of G. spinigerum from China. Sequences of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 region closely resembled sequences of G. spinigerum from Thailand, Indonesia, the USA, and central Lao PDR.

Raising awareness of breast cancer is particularly important to help at risk women seek medical treatment for this disease. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the Indonesian women's level of knowledge about breast cancer risk factors, barriers, attitude and breast cancer screening. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study administered the breast cancer awareness Indonesian scale (BCAS-I) to 856 Indonesian women. Samples were selected in rural and urban combinations from three provinces by stratified random sampling. The ordinal logistic model was used to investigate the clustering effect of the participant's characteristics in this study. Results: Of the women, 62% lived in rural areas and 38% lived in urban areas. Living in an urban area was significantly associated with a lower knowledge of the risk factors. However, living in an urban area was significantly associated with better attitudes and healthier behaviours related to breast cancer awareness. Women with higher education levels had 70% worse attitudes toward breast cancer awareness. Women living South of Sumatera, women living in Yogyakarta, and unmarried women were 5.03, 3.84, and 1.56 times as likely to have higher perceived barriers, respectively. Conclusion: Urban women had a poorer level of knowledge of breast cancer risk factors compared to women living in more rural areas. The result of this study may reflect inadequate breast cancer awareness campaigns or a lack of breast cancer awareness campaigns. These findings suggest that additional education programs aiming to increase awareness and educate the public are needed. ? 2019.",Breast cancer; Breast cancer screening; Indonesian women,"adolescent; adult; aged; attitude to health; breast self examination; breast tumor; cross-sectional study; early cancer diagnosis; female; follow up; health behavior; human; Indonesia; middle aged; perception; prognosis; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Health; Breast Neoplasms; Breast Self-Examination; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Indonesia; Middle Aged; Perception; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85063425418

A program of postexposure management for pulmonary TB in the hospital setting was instituted which followed the “Guidelines for the Investigation of Contacts of Persons with Infectious Tuberculosis: Recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC” using the QuantiFERON?-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-GIT), an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA), as a screening test. Results: Three hundreds and twelve HP were classified as the contact persons and 15 TB patients were confirmed as the index cases. Among 312 HP, 134 (42.9%) was classified as high or medium priority contacts, and 30 of them (22.4%) were investigated by QFTGIT after being exposed. Two HP (6.7%) revealed positive result and were confirmed as having latent tuberculosis infection, but only one HP accepted INH preventive treatment. Twenty six (8.3%) HP could not be prioritized due to their incomplete information. Conclusion: This program was unable to statistically identify the post-exposed HP with infectious tuberculosis due to limited numbers.

Background: It is well recognized that there is a need for radiotherapy centers to evaluate the accuracy levels of their current practices, and use the related information to identify opportunities for future development. Materials and methods: An end-to-end test using a CIRS thorax phantom was carried out at 8 participating centers. Based on each center's protocol for simulation and planning, linac-based IMRT or VMAT plans were generated following the IAEA (CRP E24017) guidelines. Point doses in the region of PTVs and OARs were obtained from 5 ionization chamber readings and the dose distribution from the radiochromic films. The global gamma indices of the measurement doses and the treatment planning system calculation doses were compared. Results: The large majority of the RT centers (6/8) fulfilled the dosimetric goals, with the measured and calculated doses at the specification points agreeing within ±3% for PTV and ±5% for OARS. At 2 centers, TPS underestimated the lung doses by about 6% and spinal cord doses by 8%. The mean percentage gamma pass rates for the 8 centers were 98.29 ± 0.67% (for the 3%/3 mm criterion) and 96.72 ± 0.84% (for the 2%/2 mm criterion).

Increased prevalence of co-infection with these high-risk types has been observed in pre-cancerous and cancerous tissues. The determination of physical status and copy numbers of viruses is therefore useful in clinical settings. A simple multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for HPV16/HPV18 co-infection in one tube reaction was established in the present study using TaqMan?-based PCR for E2 and E6 viral DNA. The detection range was up to 106 copies with 100% specificity and high precision (CV of cycle time &lt;0.5%). The analytical accuracy and robustness were verified by competitive assay using an unequal mixture of HPV16/HPV18 DNA. No significant effect was demonstrated when compared with the simplex qPCR. The detection of physical status was evaluated in cervical samples, including 5 pre-cancerous and 15 cancerous samples. No significant difference was observed between simplex and multiplex qPCR (P=0.372). In conclusion, the developed multiplex qPCR method successfully demonstrated the viral status of the common HPV types in one tube. This assay will facilitate viral assessment and monitoring of cervical cancer associated with HPV16 and HPV18 co-infection. ?

The occiput-wall distance (OWD) is a practical measure that is commonly used to screen and monitor thoracic hyperkyphosis in epidemiologic studies. However, there was no clear evidence to support the clinical utility of the tool as compared to the data from direct standard measures. Objectives: To investigate psychometric properties—including validity, reliability, and appropriate cut-off point—of the OWD to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis, as compared to a standard Cobb's method. Design: Observational study. Methods: This study was conducted in ninety-nine participants, aged 10 years and above who had different degrees of thoracic hyperkyphosis from several communities. All participants were assessed for their severity of thoracic hyperkyphosis using the OWD, and 14 participants were involved in a reliability study. Within 7 days later, all participants were at a hospital to complete a radiographic examination. Results: Outcomes from OWD had good concurrent validity with the Cobb angles (r = 0.683, P < 0.001) and excellent rater reliability when assessed by well-trained health professionals (ICCs > 0.9, P < 0.001). The OWD of at least 6.5 cm had the best diagnostic properties to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis (sensitivity = 71.4%, specificity = 76.6%, and area under the curve = 0.846).

However, there are some unsuccessful suicides. These individuals might try to repeatedly commit suicide attempts. In this paper, the aims of this research are to compare ID3, C4.5 and na?ve Bayes and predict the characteristics of individuals who have suicidal ideation to repeatedly commit suicide attempts by using data mining techniques. After data preprocessing, three data mining techniques were selected to compare the efficiency of the single of classification models and the ensemble models. The researchers also adopted synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to balance the suicidal ideation of reattempt and no attempt classes. The researchers used 57 attributes from self-harm surveillance report (RP.506S) of Khon Kaen Rajanagarindra Psychiatric hospital. The experimental results of the single method showed that C4.5 is the best model with the highest percentage of correctly classified instances rate of 90.69%, while the ensemble model, voting method showed the best results of 91.26.

Mitochondrial ferritin, encoded by the FTMT gene is an iron-storage protein in the mitochondria. The aim of this work was to investigate the expression levels of FTMT in the reticulocytes of patients with alpha-thalassaemia who were regularly transfused and rarely transfused compared with healthy controls and to evaluate the relationships of the levels of FTMT mRNA with malondialdehyde (MDA) and ferritin in these patients. Methods: The levels of FTMT mRNA in the reticulocytes of patients (30 regularly transfused and 30 rarely transfused) and 30 healthy individuals were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The levels of ferritin and MDA were analysed by ELISA and by a thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay, respectively. Results: The levels of FTMT mRNA, ferritin and MDA in both groups of patients were significantly increased compared with those in the healthy controls. In addition, the levels of FTMT mRNA, ferritin and MDA in the regularly transfused patients were significantly higher than those in the rarely transfused patients. Furthermore, the relative expression levels of FTMT in patients correlated with those of MDA and ferritin. Conclusion: These results suggest that the elevation of expression levels of FTMT in the reticulocytes of patients with alpha-thalassaemia may be associated with iron loading and oxidative stress. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",iron overload; Mitochondrial ferritin; oxidative stress; thalassaemia,"ferritin; hemoglobin; messenger RNA; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; ferritin; messenger RNA; mitochondrial ferritin, human; mitochondrial protein; adult; alpha thalassemia; Article; blood transfusion; child; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; erythroid cell; female; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein expression; reticulocyte; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; school child; young adult; adolescent; alpha thalassemia; biosynthesis; blood; clinical trial; gene expression regulation; metabolism; pathology; Adolescent; Adult; alpha-Thalassemia; Child; Female; Ferritins; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Male; Mitochondrial Proteins; Reticulocytes; RNA, Messenger",2-s2.0-85049810943

Oxytocin is the standard therapy for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage, but it requires cold storage,which is not available in many countries, and has unsatisfactory real-world efficacy as a result of heat sensitivity and quality issues such as insufficient active ingredient or impurities. Heat-stable carbetocin, an oxytocin analogue, does not require cold-chain transport and storage; it has been shown to maintain stability over a period of 36 months at 30°C and 75% relative humidity. Although there have been trials of carbetocin, most of the trials involved women undergoing cesarean delivery, were small, were of varied quality, and used an intravenous route of administration. The researchers conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled noninferiority trial comparing the effects of heat-stable carbetocin with those of oxytocin on postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal birth at 23 hospitals (sites) in 10 countries between July 2015 and January 2018. Women who expected to give birth vaginally and who had a singleton pregnancy and cervical dilatation of 6 cm or less were eligible.Women were randomly assigned to receive a single intramuscular injection of either heat-stable carbetocin at a dose of 100 μg or oxytocin at a dose of 10 IU. Immediately after delivery, the drugwas administered and the management of the third stage of labor was conducted as recommended in theWorldHealth Organization guidelines. A total of 29,645 women underwent randomization. The frequency of blood loss of at least 500 mL or the use of additional uterotonic agents was 14.5% in the carbetocin group and 14.4% in the oxytocin group (relative risk, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.06), a finding that was consistent with noninferiority. The frequency of blood loss of at least 1000 mL was 1.51% in the carbetocin group and 1.45% in the oxytocin group (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.87-1.25), with the CI crossing the margin of noninferiority. The use of additional uterotonic agents, interventions to stop bleeding, and adverse effects did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Heat-stable carbetocinwas noninferior to oxytocin for the prevention of blood loss of at least 500 mL or the use of additional uterotonic agents. Low event rates for blood loss of at least 1000 mL limited the power of the trial to investigate that outcome. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, most developing countries with resource constrained setting, like Indonesia, encounter several difficulties to implement mass screening for breast cancer. Aim: To investigate knowledge, barriers, and behaviours of women regarding breast cancer screening among rural and urban Indonesian women. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 864 Indonesian women aged ?18 years. A self-administered questionnaire using a validated instrument was administered from March to May 2016. The ordered logistic regression model analysis was performed to further evaluate five domains of awareness regarding breast cancer screening and its determinants. A p-value under 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Overall, 864 women participated in this study (response rate of 98.28%). The mean age of women was 30.01±11.01 years. Ordinal logistics regression analysis showed that urban women demonstrated better knowledge of risk factors for breast cancer, while they had poorer behaviours for the breast cancer screening method. A higher level of education (relative to no formal education) was associated with better behaviours for the breast cancer screening method, whereas being married and women living in East Nusa Tenggara were significantly related to barriers for breast cancer screening. Conclusion: Urban Indonesian women had poor breast cancer screening practice, whereas they were highly educated. Participant’s characteristics like marital status and locality were found as barriers to breast cancer screening. It is likely to provide valuable insight among women in general for breast cancer screening behaviours, which in turn, will improve targeted breast health promotion. ? 2018, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

At the present, there is no approved drug with a proven disease-modifying effect. Sesame seed (Sesame indicum) has long been known as a healthy food in Southeast Asian countries. Sesame lignans obtained from sesame seed possess antioxidant property that exhibit a variety of beneficial effects in various models. The objective of this study was to investigate the protective effects of sesame lignans including sesamin, sesamolin, and sesamol against Aβ toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model of Aβ toxicity and to address whether these sesame lignans have a positive effect on lifespan extension. A transgenic C. elegans expressing human Aβ was used to investigate protective effects of sesame lignans against Aβ toxicity. Sesamin and sesamolin significantly alleviated Aβ-induced paralysis. The real-time PCR revealed that both sesamin and sesamolin did not affect the expression of Aβ transgene. However, we found that only sesamin inhibited Aβ oligomerization. These findings demonstrated that, among three sesame lignans tested, sesamin protected against Aβ toxicity by reducing toxic Aβ oligomers. Sesamin and sesamolin also significantly improved Aβ-induced defect in chemotaxis behavior and reversed the defect to normal. Moreover, sesamin prolonged median and mean lifespan of the wild type worm. On the other hand, sesamolin and sesamol failed to extend lifespan. These results offer valuable evidence for the future use of sesamin in the development of agents for the treatment of AD. It is also worth investigating the structure-activity relationship of lignan-related structures and their anti-Aβ toxicity activities in the future. ? 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Alzheimer's disease; Caenorhabditis elegans; Sesame lignans; Sesamin; Sesamol; Sesamolin; β-Amyloid,"amyloid beta protein; dimethyl sulfoxide; Ginkgo biloba extract; lignan derivative; oligomer; sesamin; sesamol; sesamolin; unclassified drug; 1,3 benzodioxole derivative; 1,3 dioxolane derivative; amyloid beta protein; lignan; phenol derivative; sesamin; sesamol; sesamolin; animal experiment; Article; Caenorhabditis elegans; chemotaxis; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; gene expression; life extension; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oligomerization; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; transgene; transgenic microorganism; wild type; animal; Caenorhabditis elegans; chemistry; cytology; genetics; longevity; metabolism; nerve cell; paralysis; protein multimerization; transgenic animal; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Benzodioxoles; Caenorhabditis elegans; Chemotaxis; Dioxoles; Lignans; Longevity; Neurons; Paralysis; Phenols; Protein Multimerization; Transgenes",2-s2.0-85051392264

Fifty-four-point-six-percent of the participating students had used any type of drug, including tobacco and alcohol, 59.5% (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82, p<0.001) were males, 61.9% were aged 15 to 19 years (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.90, p<0.001), and 62.1% (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.92, p<0.001) were senior secondary school students. The types of drug use included alcohol (48.6%), tobacco (27.0%), cannabis (6.2%), inhalants (6.2%), and methamphetamine and other amphetamine-type stimulants [ATS] (3.5%). The lifetime prevalence rate of drug users was 54.6% and in the past three months, the prevalence rate of drug users was 24.0%. Most students who had never used the drugs had drug literacy for 85.1% (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.60, p<0.001). The literacy was associated with tobacco (AOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.54, p<0.001) and cannabis (AOR 0.24, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.38, p<0.001). During the previous three months, the proportion of drug use had declined, but the use was in a high-risk level. Drug literacy was significantly related to the risk level in tobacco and alcohol use (p<0.01). The factors associated with drug use were age, gender, educational level, and drug literacy (p<0.01). Conclusion: There is evidence of drug use in the secondary school students and the use is in a high-risk level for all types of drug. The types of drug use varied in different age groups. The students who have never used the drug have drug literacy higher than those who used the drugs. Therefore, knowledge about drug use should be given appropriately to the students’ age, gender, and educational level. ? 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

Thus, early diagnosis and proper management are very important.Objectives To report the clinical presentation and management of melioidosis in the head and neck.Method A retrospective study was conducted from 1 January 2013 to 31 October 2016 in Mukdahan Hospital, Thailand. Case records of patients who had presented with culture-positive melioidosis were analysed.Results Medical records of 49 patients (23 males and 26 females) were analysed. Patients ranged in age from 1 to 75 years. Clinical presentations included 22 parotid abscesses, 16 neck abscesses and 11 suppurative lymphadenitis cases. Only 35 patients (71 per cent) had high indirect haemagglutination assay titres of ? 1:160 (95 per cent confidence interval = 45.35-88.28). Almost half of the patients received intravenous ceftazidime and subsequently oral co-trimoxazole. Oral antibiotic regimens were prescribed for mild localised melioidosis. Overall, 95.65 per cent of patients were in remission and no relapses were observed (95 per cent confidence interval = 85.47-98.80).Conclusion Careful clinical correlation and proper investigation are required to establish an early diagnosis of melioidosis and to initiate appropriate treatment.

We reported here the flow-pressure relationships and the safety and suitability of the device when used by healthy young and older subjects. METHODS: The flow-pressure relationships were determined for a range of resistors with different orifice diameters and cone lengths. A 1-cm conical-PEP device with a 6-or 7-mm orifice was used during a cycle exercise test (60% heart rate reserve) in 15 young (mean = SD, 24.3 = 3.9 y) and 12 older (mean = SD, 64.4 = 3.5 y) adults. Cardiopulmonary function and dyspnea were monitored for up to 10 min of exercise. RESULTS: For a given flow, pressure decreased as the cone length and orifice size increased. A 1-cm cone with a 6 mm orifice generated pressures of 5.24 = 0.17 cm H2 O and 18.29 = 0.34 cm H2 O at flows of 0.5 and 0.9 L/s, while for a 7 mm orifice, pressures were 4.88 = 0.13 cm H2 O and 19.14 = 0.10 cm H2 O at flows of 0.5 and 1.1 L/s, such as might occur during exercise. The choice of orifice size for a subject depended on his or her estimated expiratory flow; larger flows required the larger orifice to generate an expiratory pressure of between 5 and 20 cm H2 O. Breathing with the conical-PEP device did not affect exercise time, dyspnea, minute ventilation, heart rate, or blood pressure. The SpO2 was slightly lower and PETCO2 was somewhat higher than during control exercise, but the differences were not significant. There were no adverse physiological consequences. CONCLUSIONS: A conical-PEP device of 1-cm length with an orifice of 6 or 7 mm generates effective expiratory pressure for most subjects during exercise. There were no adverse effects in healthy young and older subjects, and the device is suitable for trials with patients with COPD. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT 02788370.)

About half of stroke patients in Thailand live in rural areas where accessing to health care services and information is difficult. To reduce the incidence of stroke, public stroke awareness is critical. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the factors affecting stroke knowledge in Thai rural people. Materials and Methods: A study was conducted among 579 people who live in a rural area (Khao Suan Kwang District, Khon Kaen, Thailand). All participants were asked to complete the questionnaire which consisted of (1) demographic data (2) 19 items regarding stroke risk factors (3) 11 items of signs and symptoms of stroke including warning signs and (4) management after a stroke attack. Results: The majority of participants (79%) were females, with a mean age 49 (SD 16) years. Most participants recognized stroke risk factors, signs and symptoms and warning signs. Of these participants, 70% had excellent stroke knowledge. Only 16% knew to call 1669, the emergency call number in response to stroke symptoms. In multivariate analysis, age (more than 40 years old), females, working status and incomes showed a positive association with excellent stroke knowledge. Conclusion: The present study suggested young, male, and unemployed participants were associated with a deficit in stroke knowledge in rural areas. Therefore, an education campaign should be conducted in rural areas particularly among males and young people. ? 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

However, the availability of drug monitoring and its cost are problematic. The goal of this study was to study the MTX clearance in adult Thai patients and propose the simplified guideline. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study examined osteosarcoma patients treated with multi-agent chemotherapy including HDMTX (12 g/m 2 ) during 2011 to 2013. MTX serum levels were obtained every 24 h until the concentration fell below the threshold concentration of 0.1 mM. Leucovorin was given per standard protocol. Results: A total of 326 MTX serum levels in 76 HDMTX courses were analyzed. The mean MTX serum peak values were 1,300 (980 to 1,618) mM. MTX serum level fell rapidly in the first 72 hours then gradually decreased over time. In 45% of the cases, leucovorin could be stopped at 96 hours after the infusion of MTX. Conclusion: MTX serum level monitoring is mandatory in HDMTX regimen. Drug monitoring should start at 72 hours after HDMTX infusion and every 24 hours until the level is below 0.1 mM. ? 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

Objective: To examine the association between liver enzymes and metabolic risk factors, including diabetes mellitus [DM] and dyslipidemia, in Thai adults. Materials and Methods: A total of 4,317 adults were recruited from a health check-up clinic at Srinagarind Hospital, a tertiary care setting. After excluding previous history of all metabolic risk factors, liver disorder, vital hepatitis, and moderate to heavy alcohol drinking, body weight [BW], blood pressure [BP], fasting plasma glucose [FPG], total cholesterol [TC], triglyceride [TG], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] were measured. The liver enzyme levels were categorized into quartiles and their associations with FPG, TC, TG, and prevalence of metabolic risk factors (including DM and dyslipidemia) were tested using multinomial logistic regression. Logistic regression was performed to calculate the odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [95% CI] of the relationship between liver enzymes and prevalence of each metabolic risk factor. Results: Prevalence rates of elevated ALT and AST levels, defined as being more than twice of upper normal limit [UNL], in the entire cohort were 5.3 and 2.8%, respectively. After categorizing ALT and AST into quartiles, we found that the prevalence of DM, IFG, and hypertriglyceridemia were higher in the higher ALT and AST quartiles, but the magnitude of association was higher in ALT. After adjusting for age and BMI, every twofold elevation in ALT and AST was found to be associated with an increased risk for DM (OR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.63 vs. 1.35, 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.57), IFG (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.69 vs. 1.40, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.62) and hypertriglyceridemia (OR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.29 to 1.56 vs. 1.22, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.36), respectively). However, the elevations of ALT and AST were not associated with increased risk of hypertension or hypercholesterolemia in the present study. Conclusion: Elevations in ALT and AST levels independently predict DM, IFG, and hypertriglyceridemia in Thai adults. ? 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

Educating people about strokes should be a good way to prevent or decrease the incidence of the diseases, or, if the diseases occur, it should assist in lessening both economic and social impact. The present study aimed to study the effect of educating campaign on the knowledge of cerebrovascular diseases to people in rural areas. Material and Methods: The study was conducted in people who lived in Na-ngew Sub-district, Khao Suan Kwang District, Khon Kaen Province during November to December 2010. The participants were assessed in their knowledge of stroke using questionnaire twice, before and after the training. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: the personal data and the knowledge assessment part. The latter was composed of 38 questions on the knowledge and practices of stroke. 19 questions out of these were related to risk factors, 11 were related to the symptoms and warning signs, and 8 were related to knowledge on transient ischemic attack [TIA] and practices. Results: Of the 579 participants, 79 percent were females. The average age was 49±16 years, and 92 percent had not had previous stroke. Participants’ knowledge related to stroke increased significantly after the training at the p<0.001 level, on risk factors, symptoms and warning signs, transient ischemic attack [TIA] and practices. Although the scores increased; when considering each question item, it was found that the knowledge for risk factors in sex, life style, and dyslipidemia were still low, i.e., 13.8, 31.8, and 51.3 percent respectively and 90 percent understood that chest pain is a symptom of stroke. Only 30.4% called the emergency number 1669 in case of a stroke patient showing symptoms.

There is limited data on CPAP compliance in Thai or oriental OSA patients particularly on personal experiences on CPAP use. The present study aimed to evaluate personal experience factors associated with CPAP adherence and duration of use in Thai OSA patients. The present study enrolled OSA patients who had their own CPAP machine. All eligible patients were requested to fill out a self-reported questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of eight parts; baseline characters, co-morbid diseases, CPAP features, feeling during CPAP use, side effects from CPAP, CPAP salesperson, knowledge on CPAP advantages, and overall CPAP experience evaluation. There were 44 OSA patients met the study criteria. There were three independent factors associated with CPAP adherence including feeling annoyed, fearing of mask off during the night, and high price. The adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of these three factors were 0.168 (0.029, 0.965), 0.137 (0.028, 0.983), and 10.032 (1.062, 94.757).

Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients using home-based PD was carried out. The prescribed regimen of glucose-based PD solution for all patients, determined on the basis of their individual conditions, was extracted from their medical chart records. The primary outcome was death. The treatment regimens were categorized into 3 groups according to the type of PD solution used: original PD (1.5% glucose), shufe PD (1.5 and 2.5% glucose), and serialized PD (2.5 and 4.5% glucose). Multivariate analysis (using the Weibull model) was applied to comprehensively examine survival probabilities related to the explanatory variable, while adjusting for other potential confounders. Results: Of 300 consecutive patients, 38% died over a median follow-up time of 30 months (interquartile range: 15-46 months). Multivariate analysis showed that a treatment regimen with continued higher-strength PD solution (serialized PD) resulted in a lower survival rate than when the conventional strength solution was used (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% confdence interval, 1.6 to 4.6, p<0.01).

Materials and Methods: Paraffin embedded blocks of osteosarcoma tissues of thirty-two patients were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand, were analyzed for protein Ki-67, CD99, P53 and S100 expressions by immunohistochemical technique. The clinical data were collected from pathological record forms, medical record forms, and database of Tumor Registration Unit. The correlations of protein expressions and survival time were analyzed and evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis with log rank test and Cox’s proportional hazards model. Results: The Ki-67, CD99, P53 and S100 proteins were immunohistochemistrical expressed in osteosarcoma tissues in 93.75%, 68.75%, 37.5% and 12.5% of the cases, respectively. The Ki-67 was statistic significantly correlated with survival time (p = 0.0116). The osteosarcoma tissue with Ki-67 signal <0.4 showed better prognosis than those with Ki-67 ?0.4 (p = 0.016, adjust HR = 0.156, 95% CI = 0.035 to 0.704), while negatively-stained P53 yielded poor prognostic value when compared to those with positively-stained P53 (p = 0.027, adjust HR = 5.332, 95% CI = 1.214 to 23.406). Conclusion: The ki-67 and P53 proteins are likely to be feasible prognostic factors of osteosarcoma.

However, the liver stiffness value is confounded by food intake. Previous studies have yielded little data regarding the cutoff point for liver stiffness as measured after fasting, and there are no studies available regarding chronic hepatitis C [HCV] in Thai patients. The present study aimed to demonstrate the cutoff liver stiffness value to predict significant fibrosis (METAVIR stage >F2) using TE compared with that found through liver biopsy. Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled 84 chronic HCV patients, who underwent liver biopsy to assess liver fibrosis before treatment at Srinagarind hospital from March 2016 to February 2017. On the day of the liver biopsy, liver stiffness was assessed using TE after fasting for at least three hours. Liver histology was evaluated using the METAVIR scoring system. Optimal cutoff values for liver stiffness were chosen and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] was also calculated in order to identify the best cutoff values for detection of patients with METAVIR fibrosis >F2. Results: The AUROC was 0.79 for patients with significant fibrosis (>F2). There was a cutoff value of 8.1 to detect significant fibrosis with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 84.4%, 61.5%, 71.7%, and 77.4%, respectively. Age, sex, body mass index, history of alcohol consumption, and ALT did not significantly affect the cutoff value. Conclusion: A liver stiffness measurement >8.1 kPa was a predictor of the significant fibrosis (F2) in Thai chronic HCV patients. This result may be useful in identifying patients for priority treatment. ? 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

However, only phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Akt pathway has been reported in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Therefore, we aimed to determine both post-translational modifications in OSCC tissues and in oral cancer cells compared to normal tissues and oral keratinocytes and to find correlations of these modifications with histological grading. Methods: Thirty-two OSCC and ten normal formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections were probed with the anti-O-GlcNAc, anti-O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), anti-phosphorylated-EGFRtyr1173, and anti-phosphorylated-Aktser473 antibodies following standard immunohistochemistry. The immunohistochemical (IHC) score was determined using the Fromowitz standard. Whole cell lysates of oral cancer cells and normal oral keratinocytes were immunoblotted with the anti-O-GlcNAc antibody. Results: The median IHC scores of O-GlcNAc or OGT between OSCC and normal tissues were not different, whereas those of phosphorylated-EGFRtyr1173 and phosphorylated-Aktser473 were significantly higher in OSCC than normal tissues (P?&lt;.001 and P?&lt;.01, respectively). Similarly, expression of O-GlcNAcylated proteins in oral cancer cells and normal oral keratinocytes did not differ. In the OSCC group, the median IHC scores of O-GlcNAc and OGT were significantly lower than those of phosphorylated-EGFRtyr1173 and phosphorylated-Aktser473 (P?&lt;.01 and P?&lt;.001, respectively). The IHC scores of O-GlcNAc or OGT were not determined to correlate with histological grading. Conclusion: Unlike other types of cancers, our findings demonstrate that the levels of O-GlcNAcylation are not significantly increased in OSCC tissues or in oral cancer cells and are not associated with the histological grading of OSCC. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This study was to reduce and control growth of S. aureus and E. coli and the spoilage bacteria in fresh ground pork stored at 5 and 15°C using sodium diacetate (SD) alone and in combination with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Microbial and physical qualities of ground pork (inoculated with S. aureus and E. coli 4log cfu/g) added 0.25%SD, 1.25%SD and 0.16%SD in combination with 0.16%PEG were investigated. The results showed that the adding 1.25%SD and 0.16%SD in combination with 0.16%PEG could significantly (p < 0.05) reduce S. aureus, E. coli, aerobic plate count (APC) and psychrotrophic bacteria population in ground pork. The both treatments could control growth of both pathogenic bacteria in ground pork stored at 5°C for 14 days. In addition, these treatments could control growth of S. aureus and E. coli stored at 15°C for 4 and 6 days, respectively. The adding both treatments could control growth of APC and extend shelf life of ground pork stored at 5 and 15 °C for 12 and 8 days, respectively. However, the low pH of high concentration SD alone caused the highest weight loss and discoloration. No adverse effect of low concentration SD in combination with PEG in ground pork was observed. Its weight loss and color was not significantly different from those of non-treated at both storage temperatures (p > 0.05). Hence, this study suggests that 0.16%SD in combination with 0.16%PEG has great potential to be used as a good preservative for fresh chilled ground pork. ?

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of lung volume therapy with the Voldyne? device with the SDBT and FDBT on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, oxidative stress, cytokines, walking capacity, and quality of life (QoL) in people with COPD. Methods: A total of 30 COPD patient volunteers with mild (stage I) to moderate (stage II) severity were randomized into two groups: SDBT (n=15) and FDBT (n=15). Pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC), maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (PImax), oxidative stress status (total antioxidant capacity [TAC], glutathione [GSH], malondialdehyde [MDA], and nitric oxide [NO]), inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α] and IL-6), 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), and total clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) score were evaluated before and after 4 weeks of training. Results: All the parameters had no statistical difference between the groups before training. The PImax, TAC, IL-6, total QoL score, and 6MWD changed significantly in the SDBT group after the 4-week experiment as compared to those in the pre-experimental period, whereas FVC, FEV1, FEV1%, FEV1/FVC%, PImax, TAC, MDA, NO, TNF-α, IL-6, 6MWD, and total CCQ score changed significantly in the FDBT group as compared to those in the pre-experimental period. The FEV1%, PImax, TNF-α, IL-6, and total CCQ score differed significantly in the FDBT group in the post-experimental period as compared to those in the SDBT group. Conclusion: This preliminary study concluded that the application of incentive spirometry with the Voldyne? device via fast deep breathing possibly improved respiratory muscle strength and QoL and reduced inflammatory cytokines, MDA, and NO better than that via slow deep breathing among people with COPD. ? 2018 Leelarungrayub et al.",6-minute walking distance; COPD; Cytokines; Incentive spirometry; Oxidative stress; Quality of life,"cytokine; glutathione; interleukin 6; malonaldehyde; nitric oxide; tumor necrosis factor; autacoid; biological marker; cytokine; adult; Article; breathing exercise; breathing muscle; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; controlled study; COPD questionnaire; disease severity; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; intermethod comparison; lung function; lung volume; lung volume therapy; male; maximal inspiratory mouth pressure; muscle strength; oxidative stress; quality of life; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract parameters; six minute walk test; Thailand; therapy effect; treatment duration; volunteer; aged; blood; breathing exercise; breathing muscle; chronic obstructive lung disease; comparative study; convalescence; devices; equipment design; exercise tolerance; lung; metabolism; middle aged; pathophysiology; predictive value; preliminary data; procedures; spirometry; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; vital capacity; walk test; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Breathing Exercises; Cytokines; Equipment Design; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Lung; Lung Volume Measurements; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Oxidative Stress; Predictive Value of Tests; Preliminary Data; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Quality of Life; Recovery of Function; Respiratory Muscles; Spirometry; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thailand; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Vital Capacity; Walk Test",2-s2.0-85058464861

However, low levels of vitamin D are commonly encountered in pregnant women. Low vitamin D levels during pregnancy have been observed to be potentially related to some adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birth weight, preterm birth, neonatal hypocalcemia, poor postnatal growth, and bone fragility. Objective: To determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and associated risk factors among pregnant Thai women. Materials and Methods: Pregnant Thai women attending the antenatal care clinic at Srinagarind Hospital between August and September 2015 were recruited. Trained interviewers used standardized questionnaires to elicit information of baseline characteristics and factors potentially associated with vitamin D levels. Levels of vitamin D were measured the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and were classified as deficiency (<20 ng/ml), insufficiency (20 to 34.99 ng/ml), and sufficiency (?35 ng/ml). Results: The present study recruited seventy-five pregnant women. The mean age was 29.1 years (SD 6.0, range 13 to 42 years). Forty-three women were found to have vitamin D deficiency (57.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 45.4 to 68.7). Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more likely among primigravida women (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 7.26, 95% CI 2.23 to 23.67), pregnant women that are 35 years old or older (adjusted OR 7.59, 95% CI 1.56 to 36.90), and those who had a sunlight exposure of less than 30 minutes per day (adjusted OR 4.26, 95% CI 1.22 to 14.90).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of four weeks of banana consumption on physical strength, metabolic response, oxidative stress status, lipid profiles, and interleukin-23 in healthy men. Methods: Thirty healthy men were included in two week control and four week consumption periods. The parameters were evaluated by physical strength (back-leg strength, hand grip, and quadriceps strength), metabolic response to a cycling exercise test ((directed oxygen consumption (VO2), exercise time, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), ventilatory threshold (VT)), blood antioxidant status ((total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA)), lipid profiles ((triglyceride, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)), and plasma interleukin-23 (IL-23). These measures were evaluated in two times for 2 weeks before the continuous consumption of pulp from two ripe bananas, morning and evening for 4 weeks. Results: The results showed no statistical difference in parameters over the two week control period. After four weeks of banana consumption, the back strength, exercise time, RER, and VT were significantly improved. TAC and GSH levels were increased and MDA, triglyceride, cholesterol, and IL-23 were reduced significantly when compared to the control period. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that banana supplementation involves some physical strength, oxidative stress, lipid profile, and IL-23 levels in healthy human. ? 2017 Leelarungrayub et al.",Banana; IL-23; Lipid profiles; Metabolic; Oxidative stress; Physical strength,,2-s2.0-85032729956

Generally, radiography is used as the first choice for finding the fishbone. Objective The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of digital radiography for diagnosis of fishbone foreign body in the throat Methods This descriptive experimental study design has three phases. In the first phase, we assessed subject contrast and visibility of fishbone on a homogeneous background; as for the second phase, we evaluated the embedded fishbone in the fresh cadaver's throat. In the last phase, we studied the accuracy of radiography in diagnosing the fishbone foreign body at any site of the cadaver's throat. Results The subject contrast of 15 fishbones ranged from 0.94 to 0.99. All types of fishbone were obvious in the first phase, whereas, in the second phase, visibility of fishbone was varied. The subject contrast and diameter of fishbone did not show statistically significant correlation with visibility (p = 0.09 and p = 0.24, respectively). In the third phase, embedded fishbone in the base of tongue was detected with the highest accuracy (sensitivity of 1.00 (95%CI: 0.44-1.00) and specificity of 0.92 (95%CI: 0.65-0.99)); whereas, the tonsil was of difficult interpretation with poorest diagnostic value (sensitivity of 0.00 (95%CI: 0.00-0.56) and specificity of 1.00 (95%CI: 0.76-1.00)). Conclusion The digital radiography provides the highest accuracy and benefit to the diagnosis of a fishbone foreign body at the base of the tongue; whereas, the tonsil was of difficult interpretation. ? 2017 by Thieme Revinter Publica??es Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",Fishbone; Foreign body; Radiography; Sensitivity; Specificity,Article; descriptive research; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; digital radiography; experimental study; fish; fishbone; foreign body; human; human tissue; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; throat disease; throat foreign body,2-s2.0-85008343581

To control this disease, research in rodent models that closely mimic the MS in humans is essential. In this study, a rat model of MS has been developed in male Sprague-Dawley rats by feeding a high-carbohydrate, high-fat (HCHF) diet with 15% fructose solution added to the drinking water. Rats in control group were fed with standard chow diet. During 10 weeks on HCHF diet, rats had developed signs of MS, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. These alterations were progressively increased throughout 16 weeks of the feeding period. The abdominal fat pads and organ wet weights (heart, liver and kidneys) were significantly increased. Moreover, a significant decrease in hepatic and renal functions was also observed in HCHF diet-fed rats. Overall results suggest that chronic consumption of a HCHF diet by normal rodents provides an adequate rodent model to mimic the human metabolic syndrome. This rat model of MS may be useful for studying the pathophysiological basis of MS in humans and for testing potential therapeutic interventions. ? 2018, Khon Kaen University,Research and Technology Transfer Affairs Division.

There is still high-risk for preventable death during pre-hospital care and transfer. Telegraphic medicine is a promising strategy to solve this problem. Objective: To determine the efficacy of telegraphic medicine systems in EMS during responses by advanced life support teams. Material and Method: This was a pilot study in a tertiary care setting. Telegraphic medicine systems were used in conjunction with advanced life support teams. These systems included video and audio signals, electrocardiograms, and vital signs transmitted from the pre-hospital scene and ambulance to a monitoring room in the hospital. We divided efficacy of telegraphic medicine into four categories, primary diagnosis, proper airway management, proper circulatory management, and proper neurological management. Experienced emergency physicians evaluated appropriateness of treatment in each category. Results: There were 100 pre-hospital emergency patients enrolled in the present study. Twenty-seven patients were randomly assigned to the telegraphic medicine group. Telegraphic medicine systems significantly increased the percentage of cases with primary diagnosis. They also increased the percentages of patients receiving appropriate airway, circulatory, and neurological management, but was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Telegraphic medicine was shown to increase the percentage of patients who received a primary diagnosis, as well as the percentages of those who received appropriate diagnoses, airway, circulatory, and neurological management. Thus, it is a promising system for EMS in Thailand. ? 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

A common postoperative complication with this procedure is forearm swelling. Distal vein ligation is believed to reduce postoperative venous hypertension and forearm swelling. There have been no previous randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of AVGs with and without distal vein ligation. Methods A pilot study was performed as a randomized controlled trial. End-stage renal disease patients who required AVG construction were recruited and randomly assigned to either the distal vein ligation group or the nondistal vein ligation group. Forearm swelling, graft patency, and graft thrombosis were recorded and compared. Results The nonligation and ligation groups consisted of 30 and 31 patients, respectively. Forearm swelling at both the proximal and distal areas was nonsignificantly higher in the nonligation group than in the ligation group. The success rate of cannulation of the graft was 77% in both groups. The first cannulation time was somewhat shorter in the ligation group than in the nonligation group (57 vs 63 days; P =.282). There was no difference in graft thrombosis between the 2 groups (8 and 6 patients, respectively, in the nonligation and ligation groups).

Compared with the reference clopidogrel product, most commercially available generic clopidogrel products contain different crystalline forms of clopidogrel. This study was aimed to compare the pharmacodynamics of a commonly used generic clopidogrel product in Thailand with the reference clopidogrel product under steady state conditions. Methods: A multiple-dose, randomized 2-way crossover study was conducted in 32 healthy male Thai volunteers. The subjects were assigned to receive 75 mg once daily of the test or the reference product for 7 days with a 2-week wash out period. Blood samples were collected on days 1, 5, 6, and 7 prior to drug administration and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the last dose administered. The antiplatelet aggregation effects of clopidogrel were determined by using two different ex-vivo platelet aggregation tests including the whole blood impedance assay (WBA) and the VerifyNow? P2Y12 assay. Both pharmacodynamic parameters, the maximal antiplatelet effect (Emax) and the areas under the antiplatelet effect-time curve (AUEC0-24h), were calculated. Results: Neither the mean values of Emax (90.70 ± 15.15 vs. 89.50 ± 10.71% inhibition) nor of AUEC0-24h (1,892.84 ± 657.22 vs. 1,853.58 ± 673.95% inhibition × h) under steady-state conditions obtained using the WBA method of these two clopidogrel products were significantly different. The results obtained using the VerifyNow? P2Y12 assay were consistent with those of the WBA assay. Conclusion: This study clearly demonstrated that ex-vivo antiplatelet aggregation effect under steady-state conditions of the test product was not significantly different from the reference product. ? 2017 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

Arg.) are generally found in tropical forests used as commercial products of juice and wine in Thailand. It is very rich source of phenolic compounds, flavonoids and other antioxidants with their beneficial effects on human health. In the present study, spectrophotometric methods concerning ferric reducing antioxidant power, Folin-Ciocalteu assay and aluminum chloride colorimetric procedure were performed to estimate antioxidant activity and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids in five popular brand-products of 100 % juice sampling from different local sources. From the results, the highest values of antioxidant activity (183.46 ± 1.01 mM Fe2+), total phenolic compounds (643.75 ± 7.33 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 mL) and flavonoids (1,989.98 ± 5.32 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/100 mL) were found. While the lowest ones of antioxidant activity (102.42 ± 7.23 mM Fe2+), total phenolics (273.11 ± 14.75 mg GAE/100 mL) and flavonoids (879.10 ± 5.32 mg CE/100 mL) were comparable. The differences in the observed antioxidant activities of these juice samples may relate to their abundant of phenolics and flavonoid contents. Therefore, source of the Mao fruits as raw materials would be a factor providing pronounced antioxidant activity, particularly phenolic compounds and flavonoids in the fruit juices. ? 2014, Chemical Publishing Co.

Most existing instruments that measure attitudes towards calcium consumption are not appropriate for use in the Thai population because they focus on attitudes towards the consumption of dairy products, which are not a common source of calcium for Thais. Objectives: To develop and validate an instrument for measuring attitudes towards calcium consumption among Thai adults. Methods: An initial attitudinal scale (25 items) was developed and administered to 250 Thais (age e20 years) living in Khon Kaen, the largest province in the northeast Thailand, to assess its dimensions using exploratory factor analysis. Three factors were identified. The scale was reduced to 15 items and administered to 733 subjects to validate the identified factor structure and optimize the length of the scale. Results: A three-factor model (10 items) was validated and interpreted as (1) a negative effect of calcium consumption on the body (4 items, reliability = 0.90), (2) the health benefits of calcium consumption for the body (3 items, reliability = 0.78), and (3) the need to take calcium on a regular basis (3 items, reliability = 0.86). The model fitted the data well (relative ?2 = 1.43, adjusted goodness-of-fit index = 0.98, confirmatory fit index = 0.997, root mean square error of approximation = 0.024). Conclusion: The developed scale is a reliable and useful instrument for measuring attitudes towards calcium consumption.

Data on echocardiographic features are lacking. The aim of this study was to describe echocardiographic features of this disease. Methods: We enrolled 150 patients with suspected endocarditis according to the modified Duke Criteria. Blood was tested by molecular and serologic assays. Tissue obtained during cardiac surgery was cultured and tested by PCR. Results: Five patients were identified, all were male, mean age 57.4 years, had preexisting heart valve disease. Most of vegetations are small with valves calcification(3/5). The transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography(TEE) are useful in detecting small vegetations(4/5) and calcified valves. TTE and TEE were not able to identify small vegetation in heavy aortic calcification in one patient. Conclusion: Vegetations in Q fever endocarditis usually are small and are detected by echocardiography. TEE is more sensitive than TTE in detecting a small vegetation.

One way of value added concept for rice production is to germinate paddy rice grain to increase nutritional quality before selling. Typical method of soaking paddy grain in stagnant water for 1 to 2 days has been employed for germination. Water flowing through rice grains instead of stagnant may increase its nutritional quality. The objective of this study was to compare 2 methods of grain watering, i.e. soaking in stagnant water and circulating water through grains, on gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) content and some other properties. The appropriate proportion of water used was also to be evaluated. The Khoa Dok Mali 105 rice variety was chosen for germination tests. The soaking and circulation methods were compared at 8 levels of water quantity i.e. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 times of paddy rice by weight. The results showed GABA content of paddy rice under circulation method was higher for all water quantities. The higher the amount of water, the higher the GABA content in both watering methods. ?
