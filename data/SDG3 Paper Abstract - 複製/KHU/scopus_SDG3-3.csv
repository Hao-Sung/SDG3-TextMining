Radiation therapy can induce malignant transformation of FD; however, reports have indicated a few cases of malignant transformation of FD in the absence of radiation therapy. Angiosarcoma is a particularly rare type of cancer in the oral region, which accounts for less than 1% of all soft-tissue sarcomas. Herein, we reported a case of a 62-year-old man with monostotic FD of the left maxilla of over 50?years’ duration that underwent malignant transformation into an epithelioid-type angiosarcoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such case. ? 2019, Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Angiosarcoma; Fibrous dysplasia; Malignancy; Maxilla,fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; gadolinium; adult; angiosarcoma; Article; case report; clinical article; clinical examination; computer assisted tomography; fibrous dysplasia; histology; human; human tissue; inflammation; male; malignant transformation; maxillary sinus; maximum standardized uptake value; middle aged; panoramic radiography; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; tooth extraction; wound healing impairment,2-s2.0-85070102441

Gintonin present in ginseng acts as a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand that activates six LPA receptor subtypes. The LPA6 subtype plays a key role in normal hair growth, and mutations in the LPA6 receptor impair normal human hair growth. Currently, human hair loss and alopecia are concerning issues that affect peoples' social and day-to-day lives. Objective: We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of a gintonin-enriched fraction (GEF) on mouse hair growth. Methods: Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) and six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were used. The mice were divided into the four groups: control, 1% minoxidil, 0.75% GEF, and 1.5% GEF. The dorsal hair was removed to synchronize the telogen phase. Each group was treated topically, once a day, for 15 days. We analyzed hair growth activity and histological changes. Results: GEF induced transient [Ca2+]i, which stimulated HFDPC proliferation and caused 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner. GEF-mediated HFDPC proliferation was blocked by the LPA receptor antagonist and Ca2+ chelator. HFDPC treatment with GEF stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor release. Topical application of GEF and minoxidil promoted hair growth in a dose-dependent manner. Histological analysis showed that GEF and minoxidil increased the number of hair follicles and hair weight. Conclusion: Topical application of GEF promotes mouse hair growth through HFDPC proliferation. GEF could be one of the main components of ginseng that promote hair growth and could be used to treat human alopecia. ? 2019",Ginseng; Gintonin-enriched fraction; Hair growth; Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells; Mouse,"1,2 bis(2 aminophenoxy)ethane n,n,n',n' tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); broxuridine; calcium chelating agent; ginseng saponin; gintonin enriched fraction; ki 16425; lysophosphatidic acid receptor; lysophospholipid receptor antagonist; minoxidil; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; animal experiment; anthropometric parameters; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; cell proliferation; controlled study; cutaneous parameters; drug effect; hair follicle; hair follicle cell; hair growth; hair weight; histopathology; human; human cell; human hair follicle dermal papilla cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal",2-s2.0-85068081880

In order to solve these problems, researchers continue to develop therapeutic agents, increase the efficacy of developed therapeutic agents, and reduce side effects. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are widely used in tissue engineering applications as biosensors, drug delivery carriers, and bioactive materials. Their special surface property enables easy conjugation with ligands including functional groups such as thiols, phosphines, and amines. This creates an attractive advantage to GNPs for use in the bone tissue engineering field. However, GNPs alone are limited in their biological effects. In this study, we used thiol-PEG-vitamin D (SPVD) to conjugate vitamin D, an essential nutrient critical for maintaining normal skeletal homeostasis, to GNPs. To characterize vitamin D-conjugated GNPs (VGNPs), field emission transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and ultraviolet/visible absorption analysis were carried out. The developed VGNPs were well bound through the thiol groups between GNPs and vitamin D, and were fabricated in size of 60?nm. Moreover, to demonstrate VGNPs osteogenic differentiation effect, various assays were carried out through cell viability test, alkaline phosphatase assay, calcium deposition assay, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence staining. As a result, the fabricated VGNPs were found to effectively enhance osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) in vitro. Based on these results, VGNPs can be utilized as functional nanomaterials for bone regeneration in the tissue engineering field. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

We fabricated Cu-doped superoxide dismutase (SOD)-loaded calcium carbonate (CaCO3)-mineralized nanoparticles (Cu/SOD-MNPs) that could simultaneously release hydrogen peroxide-generating SOD and Fenton-like reaction-inducing copper ions within cancer cells. The CaCO3 core of the Cu/SOD-MNPs effectively inhibited the release of the entrapped SOD and copper ions in physiological pH (7.4). In contrast, in acidic pH (5.0), the release of SOD and copper ions was facilitated by CaCO3 dissolution. We demonstrated that the Cu/SOD-MNPs elevated the level of highly toxic apoptosis-inducing hydroxyl radicals in the cancer cells. The Cu/SOD-MNPs showed specific toxicity for cancer cells (MCF-7 cells), whereas no or negligible toxicity was found for normal cells (NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells). This mineralized oxidative stress amplifying nanoparticle may serve as a novel cancer-specific anticancer agent. ? 2019 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",Calcium carbonate; Fenton reaction; Hydroxyl radical; Oxidative stress; Superoxide dismutase,Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Cell death; Diseases; Enzymes; Metal ions; Nanoparticles; Oxidation; Oxidative stress; pH; Toxicity; Anti-cancer agents; Fenton reactions; Fenton-like reactions; Hydroxyl radicals; Nano-carriers; Physiological pH; Super oxide dismutase; Superoxide dismutases; Copper compounds,2-s2.0-85069748436

Methods: A Web-based questionnaire survey was conceived by representative members of each country's urological oncology society and was open from June 2016 to February 2017 to each society's members. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used. Results: A total of 2334 urologists were invited and 701 responded to the survey with a response rate of 30.0%. Instruments used during transurethral resection of bladder cancer varied significantly between countries and depended on their availability. The re-transurethral resection rate for pT1 or high-grade disease >50% of the time was significantly higher in Japan than in the other two countries, but the collective rate was just 49%. The frequency of intravesical therapy in intermediate- to high-risk disease was generally consistent across countries. However, the choice of agent between chemotherapy and bacillus Calmette–Gu?rin was significantly different between countries. Maintenance bacillus Calmette–Gu?rin was used <10% of the time by 45% of respondents, the most important reasons being fear of side-effects, followed by a lack of efficacy and shortage of drug supply. Conclusions: There are significant differences between Japan, Korea and Taiwan in the management of intermediate- to high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The results of this survey can serve as the basis for joint efforts to develop common clinical guidelines. ? 2019 The Japanese Urological Association",bladder cancer; clinical practice pattern; East Asia; practice guideline; survey,cisplatin; doxorubicin; epirubicin; mitomycin; pirarubicin; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer therapy; health survey; high risk patient; human; Japan; Korea; major clinical study; multiple choice test; Mycobacterium bovis BCG; non muscle invasive bladder cancer; priority journal; questionnaire; Taiwan; transurethral resection; urologist; web browser,2-s2.0-85072155412

Methods: A literature search was undertaken using a relevant database by three investigators. Only full economic evaluations with results in the form of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were included. Costs were adjusted to 2016 US dollars using the Gross Domestic Product deflator and purchasing power parities. The British Medical Journal checklist was utilized to appraise the methodological quality of the included studies. Results: Nine articles were ultimately selected. The inpatient smoking cessation programs appeared to be a highly cost-effective intervention according to the recommended cost-effectiveness thresholds by the World Health Organization or individual studies. The highest ICERs among the selected studies were $5593 per additional quit, $10,550 per life year gained, and $5680 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Conclusions: This study provides robust evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation programs for hospitalized patients. In addition, the results indicated that the degree of cost-effectiveness of the inpatient smoking cessation program might not be related to either the components of the program or methodological variations in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Policymakers should provide hospitals with resources and strong incentives to promote wider implementation of the smoking cessation program. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Cost-effectiveness analysis; Hospitalized patients; Smoking cessation; Systematic review,adult; article; checklist; cost effectiveness analysis; female; gross national product; hospital patient; human; male; medical literature; parity; purchasing; quality adjusted life year; smoking cessation program; systematic review; World Health Organization,2-s2.0-85071459539

An autotrophic bioelectrochemical denitrification (BED) process was evaluated at various conditions for enhanced treatment of synthetic wastewater (SW) and ammonium-rich leachate.

BMP-4 enhanced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell properties in both mammary epithelial cell line and breast carcinoma cell line. BMP-4 increased the expression of EMT biomarkers, such as fibronectin, laminin, N-cadherin, and Slug. BMP-4 also activated Notch signaling in these cells and increased the sphere forming efficiency of the non-transformed mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. In addition, BMP-4 upregulated the sphere forming efficiency, colony formation efficiency, and the expression of cancer stem cell markers, such as Nanog and CD44, in the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. Inhibition of Notch signaling downregulated EMT and stem cell properties induced by BMP-4. Down-regulation of Smad4 using siRNA impaired the BMP-4-induced activation of Notch signaling, as well as the BMP-4-mediated EMT. These results suggest that EMT and stem cell properties are increased in mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells through the activation of Notch signaling in a Smad4-dependent manner in response to BMP-4. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85070783783

Oral administration of NK46 (1 × 109 CFU/mouse/day for 1 and 2 months in aged and Tg mice, respectively) shifted gut microbiota composition, particularly Proteobacteria, reduced fecal and blood LPS levels, suppressed NF-κB activation and TNF-α expression, and increased tight junction protein expression in the colon of 5XFAD-Tg and aged mice. NK46 treatment also alleviated cognitive decline in 5XFAD-Tg and aged mice. Furthermore, NK46 treatment suppressed amyloid-β, β/γ-secretases, and caspase-3 expression and amyloid-β accumulation in the hippocampus of 5XFAD-Tg mice. NK46 treatment also reduced Iba1+, LPS+/CD11b+, and caspase-3+/NeuN+ cell populations and suppressed NF-κB activation in the hippocampus of 5XFAD-Tg and aged mice, while BDNF expression was increased. These findings suggest that the suppression of gut dysbiosis and LPS production by NK46 can mitigate cognitive decline through the regulation of microbiota LPS-mediated NF-κB activation. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85070776765

Here, we report that MgtC targets PhoR histidine kinase and activates phosphate transport independently of the available phosphate concentration. A single amino acid substitution in PhoR prevents its binding to MgtC, thus abrogating MgtC-mediated phosphate transport. Surprisingly, the removal of MgtC’s effect on the ability to transport phosphate renders Salmonella hypervirulent and decreases a non-replicating population inside macrophages, indicating that MgtC-mediated phosphate transport is required for normal Salmonella pathogenesis.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study involved 40 eyes presenting with no DR or mild non-proliferative DR at baseline, and 30 healthy controls were included. All participants underwent spectral-domain OCT and OCTA at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24?months. Change of mGCIPL thickness and OCTA metrics including foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area and FAZ circularity, vessel density (VD), and perfusion index (PI) was measured. Correlations between mGCIPL thickness and OCTA metrics were explored using regression models. Results: Average progressive mGCIPL loss was 0.45??m per year. Three microvascular parameters were significantly impaired at 24?months compared to baseline (FAZ area: 0.34–0.36?mm2, VD: 18.9–18.5/mm, PI: 0.35–0.34). A strong positive correlation was found between loss of mGCIPL and VD from baseline to 24?months (r = 0.817, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed that thinner baseline mGCIPL and greater loss of mGCIPL thickness (B = 0.658, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with change of VD. Conclusions: In the early stage of DR, progressive structural retinal neurodegeneration and parafoveal microvascular change seem to be highly linked.

The ipsilateral hemisphere with MBD grossly showed vascular networks between the extra- and intra-cranial spaces 2 weeks after the MBD procedure. It also showed significantly increased vessels in the intracranial vasculature adjacent to the MBD region (p = 0.0006). The levels of pro-angiogenic and inflammatory factors with prominent markers of vessel permeability were also significantly increased (MBD-only vs. control; Tnf-α, p = 0.0007; Vegf, p = 0.0206). In the EPO-administered group, such elevations in inflammation were significantly mitigated (combined vs. MBD-only; Tnf-α, p = 0.0008). The ipsilateral hemisphere with MBD-EPO (vs. MBD-only) showed significantly increased vessels (RECA-1, p = 0.0182) and their maturation (RECA-1/α-SMA, p = 0.0046), with upregulation of tumor growth factor-β1 (Tgf-β1, p = 0.037) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp-2, p = 0.0488). These findings were completely blocked by minocycline (MIC) administration during in vivo (Tgf-β1, p = 0.0009; Mmp-2, p < 0.0001) and in vitro experiments (tube formation, p < 0.0001). Our data suggest that the MBD procedure (for angiogenic routes) and EPO administration (for an arteriogenic booster) are complimentary and can facilitate successfully “reverse arteriogenesis” in subjects with intracranial perfusion insufficiency. ? 2019",Angiogenesis; Arteriogenesis; Cranial burr hole; Erythropoietin; Ischemic stroke,alpha smooth muscle actin; erythropoietin; gelatinase A; minocycline; adult; artery formation (physiology); artery ligation; Article; brain blood flow; cerebral revascularization; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; human; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; internal carotid artery; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; minimum inhibitory concentration; moyamoya disease; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; right hemisphere; synaptogenesis,2-s2.0-85070003661

A consensus on which of the two procedures is preferable is necessary. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the differences between LADG and TLDG in terms of surgical outcomes, postoperative recovery, pain, and complications. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were explored up to 2017 to evaluate TLDG and LADG. Parameters including surgical outcomes, postoperative recovery, and postoperative complications were subjected to meta-analysis to calculate the odds ratio and weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (c.i.). Results: Twenty-five studies (24 non-RCT and 1 RCT) with a total of 4562 gastric cancer patients were included in the meta-analysis. Under reconstruction-matched analysis, overall complications and anastomotic complications were similar for TLDG and LADG. Nevertheless, short-term outcomes such as blood loss, time to first soft diet, hospital stay, analgesic use, and CRP level were favourable for TLDG, while all other surgical outcomes showed no difference. Conclusions: TLDG and LADG did not show significant differences in surgical outcomes and postoperative complications, including anastomotic-related morbidity. Therefore, decisive factors in selecting surgical procedures, which previously consisted of surgical outcomes, have been superseded by extra-surgical values such as cosmesis, economics, and patient's quality of life. These factors will be explored in a future multicentre prospective study (KLASS07 trial). ? 2019",Anastomosis; Gastric cancer; Laparoscopically assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG); Meta-analysis; Postoperative complications; Totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG),analgesic agent; C reactive protein; abdominal abscess; abdominal bleeding; anastomosis leakage; anastomosis stenosis; cancer patient; cancer surgery; clinical outcome; duodenal stump leakage; flatulence; gastrectomy; gastrectomy Billroth I; gastrectomy Billroth II; gastric stasis; hospitalization; human; intermethod comparison; intestine obstruction; intra abdominal fluid collection; laparoscopic assisted distal gastrectomy; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; lung hemorrhage; lymph node metastasis; meta analysis; multicenter study (topic); operation duration; operative blood loss; pancreas hemorrhage; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative ileus; postoperative pain; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; soft diet; stomach cancer; stomach emptying; systematic review; totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy,2-s2.0-85068049021

There is an urgent need to develop antivirals that can effectively reduce dengue virus (DENV) replication and decrease viral load. Niclosamide, an antiparasitic drug approved for human use, has been recently identified as an effective antiviral agent against a number of pH-dependent viruses, including flaviviruses. Here, we reveal that neutralization of low-pH intracellular compartments by niclosamide affects multiple steps of the DENV infectious cycle. Specifically, niclosamide-induced endosomal neutralization not only prevents viral RNA replication but also affects the maturation of DENV particles, rendering them non-infectious. We found that niclosamide-induced endosomal neutralization prevented E glycoprotein conformational changes on the virion surface of flaviviruses, resulting in the release of non-infectious immature virus particles with uncleaved pr peptide from host cells. Collectively, our findings support the potential application of niclosamide as an antiviral agent against flavivirus infection and highlight a previously uncharacterized mechanism of action of the drug. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85067606050

The recent development of highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has revolutionized the treatment of HCV patients. However, these DAAs are exorbitantly expensive for the majority of HCV patients worldwide. Moreover, these drugs still show genotypic difference in cure rate and have some resistant-associated variants. Tylophorine, a natural compound derived from Tylophora indica plants, is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerous growth activities. In the present study, we showed that two tylophorine intermediates, 5-Oxo-1-[(2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9-phenanthrenyl) methyl]-L-proline (O859585) and 2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9-phenanthrenecarboxylic acid (T298875), displayed anti-HCV activity with an EC 50 of 38.25 ?M for T298875 and 29.11~35.3 ?M for O859585 in various HCV genotypes. We demonstrated that O859585 efficiently blocked HCV attachment by neutralizing free viral particles without affecting other stages of the HCV life cycle and interferon stimulation. O859585 interrupted binding between HCV E2 and CD81. Of note, co-treatment of O859585 with either interferon alpha (IFNα) or sofosbuvir exerted either an additive or synergistic antiviral activity in HCV-infected cells with no measurable effect on cell viability. Most importantly, O859585 in combination with IFNα and sofosbuvir exhibited synergistic effects on anti-HCV activity in primary human hepatocytes.

In this study, we developed and evaluated a new method, DISH (direct imputing summary association statistics of HLA variants), for imputing summary association statistics of HLA variants from SNP summary association statistics based on linkage disequilibria in Asian and European populations. Disease association Z scores in DISH were highly correlated with those from imputed HLA genotypes in null model datasets (r = 0.934 in Asians; r = 0.960 in Europeans). We applied DISH to two previous GWAS datasets in Asian systemic lupus erythematosus and European rheumatoid arthritis populations. There was a high correlation between Z scores in the DISH and HLA genotype imputations, showing the same disease-susceptible and protective alleles. This study illustrated the usefulness of the DISH method in understanding and identifying disease-associated HLA variants in human diseases while maintaining individual-level data security. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85061055342

A prospective cohort study was designed using the Ansan–Ansung data of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (n = 7,358; age ?40 years at baseline). Participants with the T allele of rs11207997, particularly TT homozygotes, had lower triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol levels than those with CC. There was no association with fasting blood glucose or other biochemical parameters. ANGPTL3 mRNA was positively associated with circulating TG levels and blood pressure (all p < 0.05). Cox proportional hazard models showed that the rs11207997 T allele is associated with a lower risk of DM after adjusting for covariates (hazard ratio: 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.812–0.998, p = 0.046). Furthermore, the association between rs11207997 and the risk of DM was modified by dietary factors. These associations were no longer statistically significant when additionally adjusted for baseline TG, a potential mediator. Our data suggest that genetic variation of rs11207997 in the ANGPTL3 gene is associated with risk of DM, possibly through contributing to a lifelong set point of TG. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85060546707

Finally, we compared the concentration of Trp in human NS samples of AR patients (n = 6) pre-processed by the new device with that by centrifuge as a standard method.

Patients with PAD had poor 3-month functional outcome than those without (modified-Rankin Scale score: 3 [interquartile range, 1-4] versus 2 [1-3], respectively, P = .003). Diabetes, high-stroke severity, and the presence of PADP (odds ratio, 3.893; 95% confidence interval, 1.454-10.425; P = .007) were independently associated with poor functional outcome at 3 months. Patients with PADP showed higher prevalence of extracranial stenosis than those with PADD (41.9% versus 23.1%; P = .038). Conclusions: Our study suggests that subclinical PAD, especially PADP, is associated with poor functional outcome at 3 months after stroke onset. Interestingly, the location of cerebral atherosclerosis differed according to the location of PAD. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",acute stroke; atherosclerosis; Peripheral artery disease; ultrasonography,"aged; artery; Article; atherosclerosis; brain artery; brain atherosclerosis; brain ischemia; carotid artery obstruction; clinical outcome; controlled study; echography; female; human; lower limb; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; peripheral occlusive artery disease; popliteal artery; prevalence; priority journal; Rankin scale; stenosis; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; comparative study; complication; convalescence; diagnostic imaging; disability; factual database; lower limb; middle aged; pathophysiology; peripheral occlusive artery disease; predictive value; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; stroke rehabilitation; time factor; treatment outcome; vascularization; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Ischemia; Databases, Factual; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Predictive Value of Tests; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-85072037876

We previously reported that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) efficiently synthesizes DNA even at low dNTP concentrations because HIV-1 RT displays faster pre-steady state kpol values than SAMHD1 counteracting lentiviral RTs. Here, since the kpol step consists of two sequential sub-steps post dNTP binding, conformational change and chemistry, we investigated which of the two sub-steps RTs from SAMHD1 non-counteracting viruses accelerate in order to complete reverse transcription in the limited dNTP pools found in macrophages. Our study demonstrates that RTs of SAMHD1 non-counteracting lentiviruses have a faster conformational change rate during dNTP incorporation, supporting that these lentiviruses may have evolved to harbor RTs that can efficiently execute the conformational change step in order to circumvent SAMHD1 restriction and dNTP depletion in macrophages. ? 2019 The Authors",Conformational change; dNTPs; Lentiviruses; Macrophages; Reverse transcriptase; SAMHD1; Vpr; Vpx,deoxynucleoside triphosphate; deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1; nucleoside triphosphate; phosphorothioic acid; RNA directed DNA polymerase; unclassified drug; viral protein; Vpr protein; Vpx protein; Article; conformational transition; controlled study; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; nonhuman; Primate lentivirus; priority journal; protein degradation; reverse transcription; Simian immunodeficiency virus,2-s2.0-85070918713

In this paper, human respiration is measured by using the triboelectric effect that converts the ambient mechanical energy into electrical energy by using a three-dimensional printed triboelectric respiration sensor (TRS). This TRS has a willow-like fluorinated ethylene propylene film between the right and left electrode plates; it generates electricity using a simple contact-separation motion. A 10 wt% solution of polyethylenimine, which enables carbon dioxide capturing, is coated and evaporated only on the right electrode of the TRS to distinguish the inspiration and expiration conditions. The distances between the adjacent electrodes, the air gap between the electrodes, and the top of the container in the TRS were systematically optimized by using the finite element method. The sensitivity to the air flow rate is characterized by different gradients of the output voltage. Analyzing the output voltage allows the TRS to identify four types of respirations: strong, weak, long, and short. This portable and self-powered respiration sensor will open new horizons for portable TRS devices because of its low cost and facile fabrication that uses three-dimensional printing technology. This device will also reduce the distress experienced by patients who are recovering from their respiratory disorders. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Energy harvesting; Polyethylenimine; Pulmonary rehabilitation; Respiration sensor; Triboelectric nanogenerator,Carbon dioxide; Electrodes; Energy harvesting; Ethylene; Patient rehabilitation; Signal processing; Triboelectricity; Contact separation; Fluorinated ethylene propylene; Mechanical energies; Nanogenerator; Physiological signals; Polyethylenimines; Pulmonary rehabilitations; Respiratory disorders; 3D printers,2-s2.0-85070856785

Our previous experience demonstrated that depending upon the genetic/biochemical background of cancer cells, rottlerin is able to induce both apoptotic and autophagic cell death, or dramatically disturb protein homeostasis leading to lethal cellular atrophy. In the current study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects and mechanisms of rottlerin against human amelanotic A375 melanoma cells. In this cell line, rottlerin exhibits its main and newest cytotoxic properties, that is, growth arrest, apoptosis induction, and translation shutoff. In fact, the drug, time-, and dose-dependently, markedly inhibited cell proliferation through cyclin D1 downregulation and induced apoptotic cell death as early as after 18 h treatment. Mechanistically, rottlerin triggered apoptosis by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Both pathways are likely activated by the downregulation of the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein, which simultaneously affects mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes stability. Concomitantly to extrinsic apoptosis induction, the rottlerin-activated ER stress/eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) α axis blocked the translational apparatus.

Objective: To investigate the association between presbycusis and cognitive disorder. Subjects and Methods: A retrospective review of patient medical records was conducted at a single tertiary university hospital. This study enrolled 399 patients aged ?65 years who were prescribed hearing aids for the chief complaint of hearing loss. For main outcomes and measures we used audiograms, the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). Results: Of the 399 patients who were prescribed hearing aids for presbycusis, 45 (11.3%) had dementia and 354 (88.7%) did not have dementia. When the cognitive disorder group was divided into mild (1-4) and severe (5-7) subgroups based on the GDS scores, the threshold of hearing loss was significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild group (p < 0.05).

In this study, we investigated detailed topological and biomechanical properties of RBCs infected with malaria Plasmodium berghei ANKA using atomic force microscopy. Mouse (BALB/c) RBCs were obtained on Days 4, 10, and 14 after infection. We found that malaria-infected RBCs changed significantly in shape. The RBCs maintained a biconcave disk shape until Day 4 after infection and then became lopsided on Day 7 after infection. The central region of RBCs began to swell beginning on Day 10 after infection. More schizont stages were present on Days 10 and 14 compared with on Day 4. The malaria-infected RBCs also showed changes in mechanical properties and the cytoskeleton. The stiffness of infected RBCs increased 4.4–4.6-fold and their cytoskeletal F-actin level increased 18.99–67.85% compared with the control cells. The increase in F-actin depending on infection time was in good agreement with the increased stiffness of infected RBCs. Because more schizont stages were found at a late period of infection at Days 10 and 14, the significant changes in biomechanical properties might contribute to the destruction of RBCs, possibly resulting in the release of merozoites into the blood circulation. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",atomic force microscopy; F-actin; malaria; Plasmodium berghei; red blood cells; stiffness,F actin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; atomic force microscopy; circulation; comparative study; controlled study; cytoskeleton; elasticity; erythrocyte; erythrocyte deformability; erythrocyte function and characteristics; erythrocyte membrane; erythrocyte structure; mouse; nonhuman; Plasmodium berghei infection; priority journal; schizont,2-s2.0-85069689895

The ESRD risk of CKD in patients with T1D was compared with that of CKD in patients without diabetes and with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also evaluated the predictive value of metabolic syndrome (MetS) for ESRD development in CKD patients with T1D. Materials and Methods: The Korean National Health Insurance Service datasets of preventive health check-ups from 2009 to 2016 were used. The risk of incident ESRD was analysed according to the presence and type of diabetes in CKD (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate?&lt;?60?mL/min/1.73?m2) patients aged 20?years or older. Incident ESRD risk according to the presence of MetS was calculated among adult patients with CKD and T1D. Results: During 10?701?375.84 person-years of follow-up, 43?693 cases of ESRD developed. Hazard ratios (HRs) for incident ESRD from CKD in the T1D group were 2.580 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.336-2.849) and 9.267 (95% CI, 8.378-10.251) compared with T2D and nondiabetes groups, respectively. In CKD patients with T1D, the presence of MetS increased incident ESRD risk by an HR of 2.023 (95% CI, 1.501-2.727). Conclusions: The presence of diabetes increases the risk for ESRD development from CKD. Furthermore, patients with T1D have a higher risk for ESRD incidence from CKD than do patients with T2D in a Korean population.

Here, we identified a role for thymidylate synthase (TS), a NM enzyme and established drug target, in cancer cell de-differentiation and investigated its clinical significance in breast cancer (BC). In vitro, TS knockdown increased the population of CD24+ differentiated cells, and attenuated migration and sphere-formation. RNA-seq profiling indicated repression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature genes upon TS knockdown, and TS-deficient cells showed an increased ability to invade and metastasize in vivo, consistent with the occurrence of a partial EMT phenotype. Mechanistically, TS enzymatic activity was found essential for maintenance of the EMT/stem-like state by fueling a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase—dependent pyrimidine catabolism. In patient tissues, TS levels were found significantly higher in poorly differentiated and in triple negative BC, and strongly correlated with worse prognosis. The present study provides the rationale to study in-depth the role of NM at the crossroads of proliferation and differentiation, and depicts new avenues for the design of novel drug combinations for the treatment of BC. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase; pyrimidine; thymidylate synthase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; BT-549 cell line; cancer prognosis; catabolism; cell differentiation; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme activity; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung metastasis; major clinical study; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; RNA sequence; T-47D cell line; triple negative breast cancer,2-s2.0-85061344133

Systemic injection of PEG-SP led to a marked increase in therapeutic efficacy and angiogenesis in diabetic hindlimb ischemia, as evident from the remarkable improvement in salvage of ischemic limb and recovery of blood perfusion in diabetic mice with limb ischemia. These formulations increased endogenous stem cell mobilization to the injured site and modulated the immune system to increase microvessel formation and reduce systemic inflammation. Importantly, PEGylation efficiently reduced the injection doses of SP while still maintaining its therapeutic efficacy. To conclude, our study demonstrated that PEG-SP formulations exhibited an improved in vivo pharmacokinetic profile with enhanced efficacy and clinically acceptable treatment regimens, thus acting as a potent therapeutic for diabetic ischemia and inflammation. ? 2019 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",Diabetic limb ischemia; PEGylation; Substance P; Therapeutic angiogenesis,Mammals; Pathology; Stem cells; Diabetic limb ischemia; Endogenous stem cells; PEgylation; Substance-P; Systemic administration; Systemic inflammation; Therapeutic angiogenesis; Therapeutic peptides; Tissue regeneration,2-s2.0-85066612730

However, there is only limited information about the influence of body fat percentage (BF%) on incident hypertension. In a cohort of Korean genome epidemiology study (KoGES), 4864 non-hypertensive participants were divided into 5 quintile groups, and followed-up for 10?years to monitor incident hypertension. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for hypertension (adjusted HRs [95% CI]) according to BF% quintile groups. Subgroup analysis was conducted by low or high level of BF% (cutoff: 22.5% in men and 32.5% in women) and low or high level of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). In adjusted model, compared with BF% quintile 1, the risk of incident hypertension significantly increased over BF% quintile 3 (BF% ?19.9%) in men (quintile 3:1.42 [1.10-1.85], quintile 4:1.58 [1.22-2.05], quintile 5:1.82 [1.40-2.36]), and quintile 4 (BF% ?32.5%) in women (quintile 4:1.48 [1.12-1.94], quintile 5:1.56 [1.20-2.04]). Subgroup analysis showed that individuals with high BF% were significantly associated with the increased risk of hypertension even in individuals with low BMI, WC, and WHR. The risk of hypertension increased proportionally to BF% over the specific level of BF% in Koreans. Even in non-obese individuals, increase in BF% was significantly associated with the increased risk of hypertension. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",body fat; body mass index; hypertension; obesity; waist circumference,C reactive protein; creatinine; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; body composition; body fat percentage; body mass; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; female; follow up; glucose blood level; high risk population; hip circumference; homeostasis model assessment; human; hypertension; lipid blood level; major clinical study; male; morbidity; obesity; priority journal; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; waist hip ratio,2-s2.0-85072045007

Among Gynostemma species, G. pentaphyllum has more active chemical components and better therapeutic effect. It is used to cure depression, diabetes, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, fatigue, immunity, cancer, and oxidative stress. Overexploitation of G. pentaphyllum for its medicinal benefits has been on a rise, due to which they are adulterated or mistakenly identified with other members of Gynostemma species. Hence, we used chloroplast universal regions such as ycf3, accD, petD, psbB and their polymorphism to distinguish G. pentaphyllum from other Gynostemma species. By using the species-specific primers derived from the above regions, we established a multiplex allele-specific PCR for the authentication of G. pentaphyllum from other species. Thus the PCR reaction produced unique amplicons of size 244 bp and 438 bp for G. pentaphyllum amplified by the primers flanking ycf3, and accD regions respectively. While a 607 bp, and 787 bp amplicons from the primers targeting psbB, and petD regions distinguished G. longipes, G. burmanicum, and G. pubescens species. Moreover, these primers were successful to analyze the dried tea samples of Gynostemma as well. Thus, the developed molecular markers could authenticate different Gynostemma species as well as its products thereby preventing the mistaken-identity of this medicinal herb. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Chloroplast DNA; Gynostemma; Herbal tea; Jiaogulan; Multiplex PCR; SNP marker,"accd gene; amplicon; Article; chloroplast; chloroplast genome; DNA polymorphism; gene; Gynostemma; Gynostemma burmanicum; Gynostemma longipes; Gynostemma pentaphyllum; Gynostemma pubescens; haplotype; indel mutation; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; petd gene; phenotype; phylogeny; plant leaf; plant seed; priority journal; psbb gene; South Korea; species difference; ycf3 gene; chloroplast; chloroplast gene; classification; genetics; medicinal plant; nucleotide sequence; plant gene; quality control; species difference; biological marker; primer DNA; Base Sequence; Biomarkers; Chloroplasts; DNA Primers; Genes, Chloroplast; Genes, Plant; Gynostemma; Phylogeny; Plants, Medicinal; Quality Control; Republic of Korea; Species Specificity",2-s2.0-85071162589

Despite extensive studies, few effective oncogenic signals have been described. Therefore, it is crucial to exploit novel pathognomonic factors and targetable biomarkers for ES patients. Based on previous studies, we speculate that insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), which is upregulated by early growth response 1 (EGR1), may play a pivotal role in strengthening the downward transmission of IGF1 cascades. Therefore, in this study, we concentrated on determining the pathogenetic contribution of EGR1 in diverse ES cells. This report is the first to study the pathogenic role of EGR1 in ES. ES cells were cultured and transfected with Stealth RNAi human EGR1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or negative control. Cell proliferation and invasion potential were measured. mRNA and protein expression of EGR1, IGF1R, and EWS-FLI1 also were assessed. In all EGR1 siRNA-transfected cells (SK-ES-1, RD-ES, and HS863.T), cell proliferation and invasive potential decreased significantly in EGR1 siRNA-transfected ES cells. mRNA and protein expression for EGR1, IGF1R, and EWS-FLI1 were also significantly reduced. In conclusion, EGR1 upregulated IGF1R expression and enhanced the expression of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. The EWS-FLI1/EGR1/IGF1R cascade combined with the previously confirmed pathways can form a speculative circuit, implicating positive feedback for tumourigenesis in ES. Therefore, EGR1 inhibitors are expected to be useful for the treatment of ES by preventing oncogenic IGF1/IGF1R expression. ? 2019 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia",EGR1; Ewing sarcoma; EWS-FLI1; IGF1R,"early growth response factor 1; fusion protein; messenger RNA; small interfering RNA; early growth response factor 1; EGR1 protein, human; IGF1R protein, human; somatomedin C receptor; Article; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell proliferation; controlled study; embryonic stem cell; Ewing sarcoma; Ewing sarcoma cell line; genetic transfection; HS863.T cell line; priority journal; protein expression; RD-ES cell line; SK-ES-1 cell line; upregulation; bone tumor; cell motion; cell survival; Ewing sarcoma; female; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; human; male; metabolism; pathology; physiology; tumor cell line; Bone Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Female; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Receptor, IGF Type 1; Sarcoma, Ewing",2-s2.0-85071134124

While balancing out any adverse effect of the major herb, the complementary herbs could dilute the efficacy of the major herb, resulting in a suboptimal therapeutic effect of an herbal remedy. Here, we formulated Chung-Sang (CS) by collating five major herbs, which are used against inflammatory diseases, and tested whether an experimental formula composed of only major herbs is effective in suppressing inflammation without significant side effects. Methods: The 50% ethanol extract of CS (eCS) was fingerprinted by HPLC. Cytotoxicity to RAW 264.7 cells was determined by an MTT assay and a flow cytometer. Nuclear NF-κB and Nrf2 were analyzed by western blot. Ubiquitinated Nrf2 was similarly analyzed following immunoprecipitation of Nrf2. Acute lung inflammation and sepsis were induced in C57BL/6 mice. The effects of eCS on lung disease were measured by HE staining of lung sections, a differential cell counting of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay, a real-time qPCR, and Kaplan-Meier survival of mice. Results: eCS neither elicited cytotoxicity nor reactive oxygen species. While not suppressing NF-κB, eCS activated Nrf2, reduced the ubiquitination of Nrf2, and consequently induced the expression of Nrf2-dependent genes. In an acute lung inflammation mouse model, an intratracheal (i.t.) eCS suppressed neutrophil infiltration, the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes, and MPO activity. In a sepsis mouse model, a single i.t. eCS was sufficient to significantly decrease mouse mortality. Conclusions: eCS could suppress severe lung inflammation in mice. This effect seemed to associate with eCS activating Nrf2. Our findings suggest that herbal remedies consisting of only major herbs are worth considering. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Asian traditional medicine; Formulation of herbal remedies; Lung inflammation; NF-κB; Nrf2,"alcohol; chung sang; Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide; herbaceous agent; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; myeloperoxidase; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; plant extract; transcription factor Nrf2; acute lung injury; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; Asarum; Asarum sieboldii; clove; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; embryo; enzyme activity; gene expression; human; human cell; Magnolia; Magnolia biondii; Mentha; Mentha haplocalyx; mouse; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; sepsis; single drug dose; ubiquitination; Xanthium; Xanthium sibiricum; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; drug effect; drug formulation; genetics; immunology; isolation and purification; lung; pneumonia; RAW 264.7 cell line; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Drug Compounding; Humans; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neutrophil Infiltration; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; NF-kappa B; Plant Extracts; Pneumonia; RAW 264.7 Cells",2-s2.0-85059823949

We aimed to investigate whether a simple calculation of conventional risk factors, PARADOCS (Pressure of ARtery elevAtion, Diabetes, Obesity, Cholesterol, Smoking) score, would improve the ability to predict major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in post-MI patients. Between November 2011 and December 2015, 13,104 patients with diagnosis of AMI were analyzed in this study from Korean AMI Registry – National Institute of Health database. PARADOCS score was calculated as follows: (number of nonparadoxical risk factors ? number of paradoxical risk factors) + 3 where nonparadoxical risk factors are hypertension and diabetes, and paradoxical risk factors are hyperlipidemia, smoking, and obesity. PARADOCS score was significantly greater in patients with 1-year MACCEs compared with those without MACCEs (3.43 ± 1.03 vs 2.88 ± 1.11, p <0.001). In Cox proportional hazards model, PARADOCS score was an independent predictor of 1-year MACCEs (hazards ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.30; p <0.001) after adjusting for confounding variables. In Kaplan-Meier survival curve, patients with greater PARADOCS score had worse clinical outcome. In conclusion, although it needs more validation, a simple calculation of risk factors, PARADOCS score, could provide useful prognostic information of MI patients to clinicians. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,angiotensin receptor antagonist; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; cholesterol; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; arterial pressure; Article; cardiovascular risk; diabetes mellitus; female; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; obesity; observational study; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; smoking; adverse event; clinical trial; complication; follow up; heart infarction; incidence; middle aged; multicenter study; procedures; register; risk assessment; risk factor; South Korea; survival rate; time factor; Aged; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Hypertension; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Obesity; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Registries; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Smoking; Survival Rate; Time Factors,2-s2.0-85069177922

Both VBPs did not have significant effect on cell viability. In order to demonstrate the anti-adipogenic effects of VBP blood plasma, the expressions of several adipogenic transcription factors and enzymes were investigated by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction. VBP blood plasma down-regulated the expressions of transcription factors; PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, SREBP1, and FAS, but did not have significant effects on the expressions of lipolytic enzymes; HSL and LPL. Both the crude and purified VBPs significantly increased the mRNA levels of Wnt10b, FZ1, LRP6, and β-catenin, while decreased the expression of GSK-3β. Hence, VBP blood plasma inhibited adipogenesis by activating WNT/β-catenin pathway via the activation of Wnt10b. Based on the findings, VBP blood plasma decreased lipid accumulation which was mediated by decreasing adipogenesis, not by lipolysis. Therefore, VBP blood plasma could be used to treat obesity. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",3T3-L1 cells; Adipogenesis; Sea squirt; Vanadium-binding proteins,Chemical activation; Enzymes; Purification; Transcription; Transcription factors; Vanadium; Adipogenesis; Binding proteins; Dose-dependent manner; Halocynthia roretzi; Lipid accumulations; Lipolytic enzymes; Reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction; Sea squirt; Polymerase chain reaction; antiobesity agent; beta catenin; binding protein; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6; unclassified drug; vanadium binding protein; Wnt10b protein; beta catenin; protein; vanadium; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipogenesis; antiobesity activity; Article; Ascidiacea; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; down regulation; halocynthia roretzi; lipid storage; lipolysis; nonhuman; proadipocyte; protein expression; protein purification; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Wnt signaling; adipocyte; animal; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mouse; Urochordata; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; beta Catenin; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Proteins; Urochordata; Vanadium; Wnt Signaling Pathway,2-s2.0-85062968020

Previous studies have shown that several plants of the genus Prunus have vasodilatory and antihypertensive effects; we hypothesized that P. mume branches may have a vasorelaxant effect. In this study, we evaluated the effects and action mechanism of 70% ethanol extract of P. mume branch (PMB) on isolated rat aortic rings. Inhibitors such as NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, methylene blue, indomethacin, atropine, tetraethylammonium chloride, glibenclamide, 4-aminopyridine and BaCl2 were used to investigate the mechanism of vasodilation responsible for the vascular relaxation. PMB (2–30 ?g/mL) induced vasorelaxation in the presence of vascular endothelium, and all inhibitors used in this study affected the degree of relaxation. These results suggest that the vasorelaxant effect of PMB is endothelium-dependent and affects the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, prostacyclin pathway, muscarinic receptor pathway, and potassium channels. Our study explains that PMB may be another approach to hypertension treatment to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease. ? 2019 by the authors.",Cardiovascular disease; Endothelium-dependent; Hypertension; Korean plum; Prunus mume (Siebold) Siebold & Zucc; Vasorelaxation,"phytochemical; vasodilator agent; animal; aorta; chemistry; drug effect; high performance liquid chromatography; male; physiology; Prunus; rat; signal transduction; vascular endothelium; Animals; Aorta; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Endothelium, Vascular; Male; Phytochemicals; Prunus; Rats; Signal Transduction; Vasodilator Agents",2-s2.0-85072202549

However, its importance in the evolution of these systems in higher vertebrates, such as birds and mammals, has not been well defined since nearly all of them exhibit some form of parental care. Avian brood parasites thus provide a unique opportunity to explore the effect of a lack of parental care in higher vertebrates because they shift care for their progeny onto other species. We investigated the social system of an avian brood parasite, the lesser cuckoo (Cuculus poliocephalus), by using a comprehensive approach that included field observation, radio-tracking, and genetic analyses. We found that genetically unrelated, multiple males and females coexist in a single area; radio-tracking confirmed that this co-occurrence was neither temporary nor arbitrary. Instead, sympatric cuckoos appeared to share their home ranges and often chased each other for mating without antagonistic physical interaction. We conclude that the lesser cuckoo may employ a scramble competition mating system without territoriality, and that this mating system, which is unusual in higher vertebrates, may have arisen due to the absence of parental care. Future studies assessing the parentage of nestlings are needed to establish the genetic basis of this social system. ? 2019, Japan Ethological Society.",Breeding system; Mating system; Parental care; Radio-tracking; Scramble competition,,2-s2.0-85065191967

We measured cortical thickness using a surface-based analysis. We analyzed the associations of cardiometabolic risk factors with cortical thickness using multivariate linear regression models after adjusting for possible confounders and interactions with age.ResultAmong women, hypertension (β =-1.119 to-0.024, p &lt; 0.05) and diabetes mellitus (β =-0.920, p = 0.03) were independently associated with lower mean cortical thickness. In addition, there was an interaction effect between obesity (body mass index [BMI] ?27.5 kg/m2) and age on cortical thickness in women (β =-0.324 to-0.010, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that age-related differences in cortical thickness were more prominent in obese women compared to women with normal weight.

Despite the greater capability of peripheral nerves to regenerate compared with those in the brain or spinal cord, chronic oxidative stress leads to irreversible neurodegeneration in peripheral nerves. Thus, many efforts have been made to defend against irreversible peripheral nerve degeneration and oxidative stress. Numerous phytochemicals have been revealed as antioxidants which neutralize free radicals and reduce peripheral neurocellular damage. Among them, polyphenols alleviate neurodegeneration by interacting with reactive oxygen species. Apigenin is a polyphenol found in plant-derived foods, including parsley, thyme, celery, and chamomile tea. Apigenin has been reported to exert antioxidative effects by scavenging free radicals. In particular, apigenin has a neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress in neurological disorders, such as cerebral ischemia. However, to date, no studies have shown an association of the inhibitory effect of apigenin with peripheral nerve degeneration. In this work, we showed that apigenin has a neuroprotective effect against peripheral nerve degeneration according to four key phenotypes: axonal degradation, myelin fragmentation, trans-dedifferentiation, and proliferation of Schwann cells via Krox20- and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-independent processes.

By using augmented reality and virtual reality technologies they have the potential to overcome such loss and limitations, and to eventually improve their quality of life. However, this group is often excluded in augmented reality and virtual reality deployment. Further, limited studies address their challenges when using augmented reality and virtual reality. Therefore, for a critical review of augmented reality and virtual reality for older adults, we developed a framework to evaluate related factors, including physical, social, and psychological wellbeing. Through the critical review, we identified that most augmented reality and virtual reality studies focus on physical wellbeing of older adults but also make substantial efforts to increase their psychological wellbeing. Fun factors that would motivate them are also extensively considered. Further, social isolation continues to be a significant issue for older adults, but the appropriate content to increase their social wellbeing is insufficient, although many commercial products have been developed. The contribution of the present study is to provide a contextual framework and an evaluation framework for the critical review of augmented reality and virtual reality technologies to promote wellbeing in older adults. This study also suggests the augmented reality and virtual reality research direction for studies on this group by identifying the research gap through the critical review process.

Among the various studies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors, groups that had only lymph node metastasis showed better outcomes than those with distant metastasis. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink the treatment strategy for lymph node-positive bladder cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the treatment outcomes of chemotherapy, surgery, and combination therapy in patients with lymph node-positive bladder cancer. From 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2015, patients with bladder cancer presenting local lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis were treated with a single treatment strategy, with either radical cystectomy or chemotherapy or with a combined strategy using both. Treatment outcomes were retrospectively analyzed on the basis of clinical indices and survival time. Out of 230 patients with bladder cancer, 44 (19.1%) were treated with palliative chemotherapy, 30 (13.0%) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cystectomy, 129 (56.1%) with cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, and 27 (11.7%) with cystectomy alone. Median survival among all groups was 30.4?months. For each group, median overall survival was 19.3, 49.1, 42.6, and 11.2?months, respectively.

Batsch is a deciduous fruit tree cultivated worldwide. The flower of P. persica (PPF), commonly called the peach blossom, is currently consumed as a tea for weight loss in East Asia; however, its anti-obesity effects have yet to be demonstrated in vitro or in vivo. Since PPF is rich in phytochemicals with anti-obesity properties, we aimed to investigate the effects of PPF on obesity and its underlying mechanism using a diet-induced obesity model. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), or HFD containing 0.2% or 0.6% PPF water extract for 8 weeks. PPF significantly reduced body weight, abdominal fat mass, serum glucose, alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and spleen weights compared to the HFD control group. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that PPF suppressed lipogenic gene expression, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and -2 and fatty acid synthase, and up-regulated the fatty acid β-oxidation gene, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, in the liver. Our results suggest that PPF exerts anti-obesity effects in obese mice and these beneficial effects might be mediated through improved hepatic lipid metabolism by reducing lipogenesis and increasing fatty acid oxidation. ? 2019 by the authors.

To evaluate the thermogenic activity, BRWE was orally administered for 2 weeks, and then, the mice were placed in a 4 °C environment. As a result, BRWE treatment increased rectal temperature and inguinalWAT (iWAT) thermogenesis by inducing the expression of beige fat specific markers such as PR domain zinc-finger protein 16 (PRDM16), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), and t-box protein 1 (TBX1) in cold-exposed mice. Furthermore, ellagic acid (EA), a constituent of BRWE, markedly promoted beige specific markers: UCP1, PGC1α, TBX1, and nuclear respiratory factor 1 in beige differentiation media (DM)-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our findings indicate that BRWE can promote beige differentiation/activation, and EA is the active compound responsible for such effect.

In this study, we analyzed the effect of DPP-4i on bone fracture risk in a Korean population. Methods: We extracted subjects (n = 11,164) aged 50 years or older from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort 2.0 from 2009 to 2014. Our control group included subjects without diabetes (n = 5,582), and our treatment groups with diabetes included DPP-4i users (n = 1,410) and DPP-4i non-users (n = 4,172). The primary endpoint was the incidence of a composite outcome consisting of osteoporosis diagnosis, osteoporotic fractures, vertebral fractures, non-vertebral fractures, and femoral fractures. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of each individual component of the composite outcome. Survival analysis was performed with adjustment for age, gender, diabetes complications severity index, Charlson comorbidity index, hypertension medication, and dyslipidemia treatment. Results: The incidence of the composite outcome per 1,000 person-years was 0.089 in DPP-4i users, 0.099 in DPP-4i non-users, and 0.095 in controls. There was no significant difference in fracture risk between DPP-4i users and DPP-4i non-users or controls after the adjustments (P > 0.05).

We evaluated whether clinical parameters, clarithromycin resistance, and CYP2C19 genotype can affect the eradication failure. Methods: A total of 203 patients with H. pylori-positive chronic gastritis were consecutively enrolled. They received clarithromycin-based triple therapy for 7 days. A clarithromycin resistance test was performed by detection of A2142G and A2143G point mutations in H. pylori 23S rRNA. The CYP2C19 genotype was examined for polymorphism G681A of exon 5 and G636A of exon 4 by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. Eradication was assessed by a 13C-urea breath test 4 weeks after treatment. Results: Of 203 patients, 190 completed the study. The eradication rate was 64.0% according to intention-to-treat analysis and 68.4% by per-protocol analysis. CYP2C19 genotypes were identified as follows: 75 poor metabolizers, 75 intermediate metabolizers, and 40 rapid metabolizers. Nonetheless, this polymorphism was not significantly associated with eradication failure (p = 0.682).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether addition of the collateral grade on computed tomography angiography to previously published prediction scores could increase accuracy of clinical outcome prediction in endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for AIS. METHODS: This study used a retrospective multicenter registry for patients undergoing EVT for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Three previously published outcome prediction scores (Houston intra-Arterial therapy 2, HIAT2; totaled health risks in vascular events, THRIVE; and Pittsburgh response to endovascular therapy, PRE scores) were tested in this study. Using 482 deprivation cohorts, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC-ROCs) were compared between prediction scores with/without collateral grades in predicting the poor outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 4-6 at 3-mo follow-up) after EVT. We developed modified prediction scores by adding the collateral grade, and their advancement of outcome prediction was validated using 208 independent validation cohorts. RESULTS: AUC-ROCs of HIAT2, THRIVE, and PRE scores that incorporated with collateral grade were superior in predicting poor outcomes when compared to that of the unmodified scores (P < 0.001). In modified prediction models, 3, 3, and 10 points were added for poor collateral grade to HIAT2, THRIVE, and PRE score. Modified models outperformed unmodified models in testing of the validation cohorts (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The addition of the collateral grade to outcome prediction scores resulted in better prediction of poor outcome after EVT for AIS compared to the prediction scores alone. ?

The objective of this study was to systematically analyze the effectiveness and safety of HM for insomnia in the hypertensive elderly. Methods: Thirteen databases were comprehensively searched from their inception dates to August 28, 2018, to identify relevant randomized control trials (RCTs). The results of meta-analyses were presented as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals. The quality of evidence (QoE) was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Results: Eight RCTs were included in this review. Based on routine antihypertensive therapies in most cases, compared to the hypnotics group, HM group had a significantly higher total effective rate (TER) for improvement of insomnia (RR 1.24 [1.12, 1.39]). Compared to no intervention group, HM group showed a significantly higher TER for improving insomnia (RR 1.70 [1.25, 2.33]), and lowering systolic (MD -5.63 mmHg [-7.18, -4.09]) and diastolic blood pressures (MD -4.40 mmHg [-5.63, -3.18]). Pittsburgh sleep quality index (MD -4.11 [-5.72, -2.50]), Zung self-rating anxiety scale (MD -6.60 [-7.79, -5.41]), and Zung self-rating depression scale (MD -6.15 [-7.43, -4.87]). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the HM and no intervention groups. The QoE ranged from “Very low” to “Moderate.” Conclusion: HM might have some beneficial effects including improving insomnia, blood pressure, and mental health, for the hypertensive elderly with insomnia. Since the methodological quality of the included studies and QoE were not high, well-designed RCTs are important to confirm these results. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH",Aged; Herbal medicine; Hypertension; Insomnia; Polypharmacy; Systematic review,antihypertensive agent; herbaceous agent; antihypertensive activity; Article; clinical practice; diastolic blood pressure; drug efficacy; drug safety; GRADE approach; herbal medicine; human; hypertension; insomnia; Insomnia Severity Index; meta analysis; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; polypharmacy; priority journal; Self-rating Anxiety Scale; Self-rating Depression Scale; senescence; systematic review,2-s2.0-85071112386

However, the issue of whether pattern differentiation is appropriately applied in TCM interventional trials, including Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) interventions and non-herbal TCM interventions, is unclear. The aim of this study was to i) systematically review the current status of pattern differentiation used in WHO-registered clinical trials for different types of TCM interventions; and ii) provide suggestions for improving the use of pattern differentiation in future clinical trial design. Methods: The World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) database was searched for all TCM interventional trials registered up to 31 December 2017. In this systematic review trials with a TCM pattern differentiation in their design were included. Descriptive statistics were collated to demonstrate the characteristics of pattern differentiation applied for different TCM interventional trials. Results: Among 2955 TCM interventional trials registered during 1999–2017, 376 (12.7%) trials included pattern differentiation. Of 376 trials, the use of pattern differentiation was identified in; –the title (30.6%), objective (50.5%), participants inclusion (100%), outcomes (43.6%) and study background (12.5%). Further, 85.4% reported the specific name of the TCM intervention, 10.6% provided the intervention's targeted pattern, 83.8% reported the specific name of the TCM pattern, 7.2% presented diagnostic criteria for the pattern studied, and 19.1% adopted a pattern-related outcome as primary outcome for evaluation. Conclusion: The reporting and application of pattern differentiation in TCM trials were inadequate and confusing, which was mainly due to lack of clarity regarding study design, objectives, diagnostic criteria and outcomes. ? 2019",Chinese medicine interventions; Clinical trial registration; Pattern differentiation; Systematic review; Traditional Chinese medicine; WHO registries,adult; article; Chinese medicine; clinical trial (topic); diagnostic test accuracy study; differentiation; female; human; human experiment; intervention study; male; outcome assessment; statistics; systematic review; World Health Organization,2-s2.0-85069939205

Nonsurgical managements are considered as first line treatment before surgical treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is intended to provide physicians who treat patients diagnosed with LDH with a guideline supported by scientific evidence to assist in decision-making for appropriate and reasonable treatments. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A systematic review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Studies of human subjects written in Korean or English that met the following criteria were selected: patients aged ?18 years, clinical presentation of low back and radicular leg pain, diagnosis of LDH on radiological evaluation including computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Pain and functional evaluation scales such as visual analogue scale, numeric rating scale, and Oswestry disability index METHODS: The MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Review, and KoreaMed databases were searched for articles regarding non-surgical treatments for LDH published up to July 2017. Of the studies fulfilling these criteria, those investigating clinical results after non-surgical treatment including physical and behavioral therapy, medication, and interventional treatment in terms of pain control and functional improvements were chosen for this study. RESULTS: Nonsurgical treatments were determined to be clinically effective with regards to pain reduction and functional improvement in patients with LDH. Nevertheless, the evidence level was generally not evaluated as high degree, which might be attributed to the paucity of well-designed randomized controlled trials. Exercise and traction were strongly recommended despite moderate level of evidence. Epidural injection was strongly recommended with high degree of evidence and transforaminal approach was more strongly recommended than caudal approach. CONCLUSIONS: This CPG provides new and updated evidence-based recommendations for treatment of the patients with LDH, which suggested that, despite an absence of high degrees of evidence level, non-surgical treatments were clinically effective. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Disc herniation; Function; Lumbosacral; Nonsurgical; Pain; Treatment,antidepressant agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; bed rest; behavior therapy; clinical outcome; Cochrane Library; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; conservative treatment; Embase; human; intervertebral disk hernia; lumbosacral spine; manipulative medicine; medical decision making; Medline; neuromodulation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; numeric rating scale; Oswestry Disability Index; practice guideline; priority journal; radicular pain; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; thermotherapy; visual analog scale,2-s2.0-85068450596

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) can be easily obtained from patients with lung cancers. The aim is to develop a novel proteomic method of the molecule-based sensitive detection of biomarkers from BALF. Experimental Design: BALF samples are collected from segmental bronchus of 14 patients with lung cancers from Kyung Hee University Hospital. First, BALF proteome is depleted using a depletion column, and then peptides are prepared from the enriched low abundant proteins and fractionated by high pH reverse phase liquid chromatography prior to LC-MS/MS. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD012645. Results: A novel method is developed for in-depth proteomic analysis of BALF by combining antibody-based depletion of high abundant proteins from BALF with high pH peptide fractionation. Peptides are analyzed on a high resolution Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. MaxQuant search result in the identification of 4615 protein groups mapped to 4534 genes. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: It is found that the method outperformed conventional BALF proteomic methods and it is believed that this method will facilitate the biomarker research for lung cancer. In addition, it is shown that BALF will be a great source of biomarkers of lung diseases. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This brings several challenges as processing the documents on a large scale takes a toll on the infrastructure. The complexity of these documents compounds the issue of handling them which is why applying big data techniques is necessary. The nature of big data techniques can trigger accuracy/semantic loss in health documents when they are partitioned for processing. This semantic loss is critical with respect to clinical use as well as insurance, or medical education. Methods: In this paper we propose a novel technique to avoid any semantic loss that happens during the conventional partitioning of healthcare documents in big data through a constraint model based on the conformance of clinical document standard and user based use cases. We used clinical document architecture (CDAR) datasets on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) through uniquely configured setup. We identified the affected documents with respect to semantic loss after partitioning and separated them into two sets: conflict free documents and conflicted documents. The resolution for conflicted documents was done based on different resolution strategies that were mapped according to CDAR specification. The first part of the technique is focused in identifying the type of conflict in the blocks that arises after partitioning. The second part focuses on the resolution mapping of the conflicts based on the constraints applied depending on the validation and user scenario. Results: We used a publicly available dataset of CDAR documents, identified all conflicted documents and resolved all the them successfully to avoid any semantic loss. In our experiment we tested up to 87,000 CDAR documents and successfully identified the conflicts and resolved the semantic issues. Conclusion: We have presented a novel study that focuses on the semantics of big data which did not compromise the performance and resolved the semantic issues risen during the processing of clinical documents. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Big data; CDA? documents; Clinical documents; Document handling; Semantics,Big data; File organization; Health care; Medical education; Clinical document architectures; Clinical documents; Different resolutions; Document handling; Document standards; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); Novel techniques; Semantic preservation; Semantics; article; big data; human; human experiment; insurance; medical education; semantics; validation process; health care delivery; Big Data; Delivery of Health Care; Semantics,2-s2.0-85067240269

Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine whether RFG can ameliorate obesity and the mechanism of lipid accumulation regulated by RFG. Study design: In in vitro experiments, we confirmed the anti-adipogenic effect of RFG using 3T3-L1 cells and human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). To confirm the anti-obesity effect, High-Fat Diet (HFD)-induced obese mice were selected as a model. Methods: We investigated anti-adipogenic effects of RFG using MTS assay, Oil Red O Staining, real-time RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence staining. The anti-obesity effect of RFG was confirmed in HFD-induced mice model using hematoxylin and eosin staining and serum analysis. Results: RFG inhibited lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells and hAMSCs by reducing expression of mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)α. RFG phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in a liver kinase B (LKB) 1-independent manner. Moreover, the anti-adipogenic effect of RFG was blocked by AMPK inhibitor. These results suggest that RFG inhibits lipid accumulation via AMPK signaling. Furthermore, RFG reduced the body weight, size of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), and fatty liver in the mice. RFG also suppressed levels of adipogenic factors PPARγ, C/EBPα, FAS, LPL, and aP2) by activating AMPK in the eWAT and liver. Conclusion: RFG can ameliorate obesity, and thus, could be used as a therapeutic agent for treating obesity. ? 2019 The Authors",3T3-L1; AMPK; Cassiae tora seed; Human adipose mesenchymal stem cells; mTOR; Rubrofusarin-6-β-gentiobioside,"adenylate kinase; adiponectin; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; complementary DNA; creatinine; fat droplet; fatty acid; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; leptin; lipid; liver kinase beta; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; mammalian target of rapamycin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; rubrofusarin 6 beta gentiobioside; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; antiobesity agent; chromone derivative; glucoside; rubrofusarin gentiobioside; target of rapamycin kinase; adipogenesis; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiobesity activity; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body weight gain; controlled study; creatinine blood level; enzyme phosphorylation; fatty acid oxidation; fatty liver; glucose blood level; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipogenesis; male; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; mTOR signaling; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; triacylglycerol blood level; urea nitrogen blood level; Western blotting; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; adverse event; animal; body weight; body weight gain; drug effect; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mouse mutant; obesity; physiology; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Weight; Chromones; Diet, High-Fat; Glucosides; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Obese; Obesity; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Weight Gain",2-s2.0-85066030576

This study investigated the early renal effects associated with exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and heavy metals using general Korean population data. We used data from the Second Korean National Environmental Health Survey (2012–2014). As exposure markers, the concentrations of EDCs, such as triclosan (TCS), bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalate metabolites (DEHP, MnBP and MBzP), and heavy metals, such as cadmium, lead and mercury were analyzed. As an early kidney injury marker, the urinary concentration of β2-microglobulin (β2M) was measured. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between environmental pollutants and β2M. A total of 5489 people (male: 2538, female: 2951) aged 19 years and older were enrolled. The geometric mean (GM) concentration of β2M in the total population was 1.88 μg/g creatinine (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85–1.91). The β2M concentrations were significantly higher in cases of female, old age, low income, and presence of a history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension. The GM concentrations of urinary TCS and cadmium were 1.16 μg/g creatinine (95% CI 1.11–1.21) and 0.57 μg/g creatinine (95% CI 0.57–0.59), respectively. TCS, DEHP, cadmium, lead, and mercury exposure was significantly positively related to urinary β2M in the multiple regression analysis. β2M levels increased significantly with increases in the cadmium, mercury, and lead levels (p for trend &lt;0.0001). The higher the DEHP, MnBP, and TCS concentrations, the higher the β2M level (p for trend &lt;0.01). Environmental pollutants exposure significantly increased urinary β2M levels in the general Korean population. To prevent the development of early kidney injury and CKD, it is important to reduce environmental pollutants exposure through regulatory measures, and cooperation between related bodies in both developing and developed countries. ? 2019",Chronic kidney diseases; Early kidney injury; Endocrine disrupter; Environmental pollutants; Heavy metal,"Cadmium; Endocrine disrupters; Heavy metals; Linear regression; Manganese compounds; Mercury (metal); Population statistics; Surveys; Chronic kidney disease; Cross-sectional study; Early kidney injury; End stage renal disease; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Environmental pollutants; Multiple linear regressions; Multiple regression analysis; Pollution; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; beta 2 microglobulin; biological marker; cadmium; creatinine; endocrine disruptor; lead; mercury; mono benzyl phthalate; mono(n butyl)phthalate; phthalic acid; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; triclosan; unclassified drug; biological marker; concentration (composition); endocrine disruptor; health care; health risk; health survey; heavy metal; injury; low income population; pollution exposure; adult; aged; Article; concentration (parameter); diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; female; health survey; human; hypertension; kidney injury; limit of detection; male; nephrotoxicity; pollutant; priority journal; analysis; environmental exposure; kidney; metabolism; pollutant; questionnaire; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Korea; Adult; Biomarkers; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Kidney; Male; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85065621004

In addition, aggregates are potentially useful building blocks for tissue engineering. However, control over the interior aggregate microenvironment is challenging due to inherent barriers for diffusion of biological mediators (e.g. growth factors) throughout the multicellular aggregates. Previous studies have shown that incorporation of biomaterials into multicellular aggregates can support cell survival and control differentiation of stem cell aggregates by delivering morphogens from within the 3D construct. In this study, we developed a highly efficient microparticle-based gene delivery approach to uniformly transfect human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) within multicellular aggregates and cell sheets. We hypothesized that release of plasmid DNA (pDNA) lipoplexes from mineral-coated microparticles (MCMs) within 3D hMSC constructs would improve transfection in comparison to standard free pDNA lipoplex delivery in the media. Our approach increased transfection efficiency 5-fold over delivery of free pDNA lipoplexes in the media and resulted in homogenous distribution of transfected cells throughout the 3D constructs. Additionally, we found that MCMs improved hMSC transfection by specifically increasing macropinocytosis-mediated uptake of pDNA. Finally, we showed up to a three-fold increase of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression and enhanced calcium deposition within 3D hMSC constructs following MCM-mediated delivery of a BMP-2 encoding plasmid and culture in osteogenic medium. The technology described here provides a valuable tool for achieving efficient and homogenous transfection of 3D cell constructs and is therefore of particular value in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Statement of Significance: This original research describes a materials-based approach, whereby use of mineral-coated microparticles improves the efficiency of non-viral gene delivery in three-dimensional human mesenchymal stromal cell constructs. Specifically, it demonstrates the use of mineral-coated microparticles to enable highly efficient transfection of human mesenchymal stromal cells in large, 3D culture formats. The manuscript also identifies specific endocytosis pathways that interact with the mineral coating to afford the improved transfection efficiency, as well as demonstrates the utility of this approach toward improving differentiation of large cell constructs. We feel that this manuscript will impact the current understanding and near-term development of materials for non-viral gene delivery in broad tissue engineering and biofabrication applications, and therefore be of interest to a diverse biomaterials audience. ? 2019",,biomaterial; bone morphogenetic protein 2; calcium; lipoplex; nanoparticle; plasmid DNA; Article; cell aggregation; cell culture technique; cell interaction; cell survival; comparative study; extracellular matrix; genetic transfection; human; human cell; macropinocytosis; mesenchymal stroma cell; microenvironment; monolayer culture; nonviral gene delivery system; priority journal; protein expression; stem cell; three dimensional multicellular aggregate; tissue engineering,2-s2.0-85064564155

However, data are equivocal on the association of echocardiographic parameters of LV geometry with incident hypertension. Thus, we were to investigate the risk of hypertension according to the baseline echocardiographic parameters of LV geometry. Methods Study participants were 12 562 Koreans without hypertension who received echocardiography as an item of health check-up. They were divided into normotensive or prehypertensive group according to baseline blood pressure. In each group, study subjects were classified by quintiles of baseline echocardiographic parameters including left ventricular mass index (LVMI), relative wall thickness (RWT), interventricular septal thickness (IVST), posterior wall thickness (PWT) and IVST plus PWT and followed up for 5 years. Cox proportional hazards model was used in calculating adjusted HRs and their 95% CI for hypertension according to each quintile group. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis (AUC [95% CI]) was performed to compare the predictability of LVMI, RWT, IVST, PWT, IVST plus PWT for hypertension. Results Prehypertensive group had the worse clinical and echocardiographic parameters in baseline analysis than normotensive group. The risk of hypertension significantly increased proportionally to baseline LVMI, RWT, IVST, PWI and IVST plus PWT above specific quintile levels, which was identified in both normotensive and prehypertensive group. In AUC analysis, IVST, PWT and IVST plus PWT showed a significantly increased AUC, compared with LVMI. Conclusion LV geometry change was significantly associated with the increased risk for hypertension in non-hypertensive individuals. ? 2019 Author(s).",echocardiography; hypertension; left ventricular geometry,adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cardiovascular parameters; cohort analysis; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; echocardiography; female; follow up; geometry; heart left ventricle; human; hypertension; interventricular septal thickness; Korean (people); left ventricular mass index; major clinical study; male; posterior wall thickness; prehypertension; priority journal; proportional hazards model; relative wall thickness; South Korea; systolic blood pressure,2-s2.0-85064525323

Mosquitoes were collected from villages in an area where zoonotic malaria is prevalent. PCR analysis confirmed Anopheles balabacensis as the main vector for macaque parasites, moreover nearly 60% of the mosquitoes harboured more than one Plasmodium species. Fragments of the A-type small subunit ribosomal RNA (SS rRNA) amplified from salivary gland sporozoites, and equivalent sequences obtained from GenBank were used to construct haplotype networks. The patterns were consistent with the presence of geographically distinct populations for P. inui and P. cynomolgi, and with three discrete P. knowlesi populations. This study provides a preliminary snapshot of the structure of these populations, that was insufficient to answer our aim. Thus, collection of parasites from their various hosts and over time, associated with a systematic analysis of a set of genetical loci is strongly advocated in order to obtain a clear picture of the parasite population and the flow between different hosts. This is important to devise measures that will minimise the risk of transmission to humans, because zoonotic malaria impedes malaria elimination. ? 2019",Anopheles balabacensis; Haplotype; Human; Macaque; Simian malaria parasites,small subunit ribosomal RNA; adult; Anopheles; Anopheles balabacensis; Article; controlled study; disease transmission; DNA sequence; genetic variability; haplotype; host parasite interaction; nested polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Plasmodium; Plasmodium cynomolgi; Plasmodium inui; Plasmodium knowlesi; population structure; priority journal; salivary gland; sporozoite,2-s2.0-85064322688

The purpose of this study was to investigate blood loss in patients who underwent RTSA for massive irreparable rotator cuff tear (MIRCT) using the hemoglobin (Hb) balance method and total Hemovac amount and to identify predictors of blood transfusion in these patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 121 patients who underwent RTSA for MIRCT. The mean age was 71.2 ± 6.9 years, and 75 were women. Age, sex, body mass index, use of anticoagulants, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score, comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident), preoperative Hb level, preoperative hematocrit level, preoperative prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, use of cement, and operative time were evaluated as values predicting blood transfusion. Results: The overall blood loss was 846.6 ± 527.6 mL, which included 346 ± 231.2 mL of intraoperative blood loss and 500.3 ± 196.4 mL of postoperative blood loss. Values predicting blood transfusion were a lower preoperative Hb level (P <.001), hematocrit level (P <.001), hypertension (P =.018), and cerebrovascular accident (P =.008). Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified the following cutoff values for predicting transfusion: preoperative Hb level of 13.5 g/dL (90.3% sensitivity) and hematocrit of 40% (90.3% sensitivity). Conclusions: RTSA for MIRCT is associated with blood loss during and after surgery. The amount of blood loss should be noted, and blood transfusion could be predicted by calculating the blood loss and predictive values. Lower preoperative Hb level, hematocrit, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident are predictors of blood transfusion. Blood transfusion should be considered if a patient with preoperative Hb level <13.5 g/dL and hematocrit <40% has a history of hypertension or cerebrovascular accident. ? 2019 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Blood loss; blood transfusion; Case Series; Level IV; massive irreparable rotator cuff tear; predictive values; reverse total shoulder arthroplasty; Treatment Study,"anticoagulant agent; hemoglobin; hemoglobin; aged; Article; blood transfusion; blood volume; body mass; cerebrovascular accident; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; hematocrit; human; hypertension; international normalized ratio; major clinical study; male; massive irreparable rotator cuff tear; operation duration; patient selection; postoperative care; postoperative hemorrhage; preoperative evaluation; preoperative period; priority journal; prothrombin time; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; reverse shoulder arthroplasty; rotator cuff rupture; sex difference; cerebrovascular accident; hypertension; operative blood loss; procedures; rotator cuff injury; shoulder replacement; Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Shoulder; Blood Loss, Surgical; Blood Transfusion; Female; Hematocrit; Hemoglobins; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Retrospective Studies; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Stroke",2-s2.0-85064094547

This study profiled genome-wide CNVs in Korean patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to investigate the efficacy of treatment with TNF-α blockers. Methods: A total of 357 Korean patients with RA were examined for the efficacy of TNF-α blocker treatment. Disease activity indexes were measured at baseline and 6 months after the treatment. The patients were classified as responders and non-responders based on the change in disease activity indexes according to the EULAR response criteria. CNVs in the same patients were profiled using fluorescence signal intensity data generated by a genome-wide SNP array. The association of CNVs with response to TNF-α blockers was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression accounting for genetic background and clinical factors including body mass index, gender, baseline disease activity, TNF-α blocker used, and methotrexate treatment. Results: The study subjects varied in their responses to TNF-α blockers and had 286 common CNVs in autosomes. We identified that the 3.8-kb deletion at 2q14.3 in 5% of the subjects was associated with response to TNF-α blockers (1.37 × 10- 5 ? P ? 4.07 × 10- 4) at a false discovery rate threshold of 5%. The deletion in the identified CNV was significantly more frequent in the non-responders than in the responders, indicating worse response to TNF-α blockers in the deletion carriers. The 3.8-kb deletion at 2q14.3 is located in an intergenic region with the binding sites of two transcription factors, MAFF and MAFK. Conclusions: This study obtained the CNV landscape of Korean patients with RA and identified the common regional deletion associated with poor response to treatment with TNF-α blockers. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Copy number variations; Drug efficacy; Rheumatoid arthritis; TNF-α blockers,adalimumab; biological marker; etanercept; golimumab; infliximab; methotrexate; spacer DNA; transcription factor MafF; transcription factor MafK; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; Article; autosome; binding site; body mass; chromosome 2q; comparative study; copy number variation; disease activity; drug efficacy; drug response; gender; gene deletion; gene duplication; gene identification; genetic association; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; high risk population; human; Korean (people); major clinical study; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism,2-s2.0-85071637541

FCN can exhibit a plethora of anti-neoplastic effects although its precise mode of action still remains to be deciphered. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) can closely regulate carcinogenesis and thus we analyzed the possible action of FCN may have on these two signaling cascades in tumor cells. The effect of FCN on NF-κB and AP-1 signaling cascades and its downstream functions was deciphered using diverse assays in both human chronic myeloid leukemia (KBM5) and multiple myeloma (U266). FCN attenuated growth of both leukemic and multiple myeloma cells and repressed NF-κB, and AP-1 activation through diverse mechanisms, including attenuation of phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) and p65. Furthermore, FCN could also cause significant enhancement in TNFα-driven apoptosis as studied by various molecular techniques.

We searched in the PubMed and Web of Science databases through March 8, 2019, and conducted meta-analysis including linear and non-linear dose–response analyses. We identified 40 studies including 3,852,651 subjects and 450,256 all-cause and cause-specific deaths. Non-linear inverse associations between coffee consumption and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancers were found.

Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and diabetic retinopathy are one of the most severe retinal disorders, which are mostly attributed to impairment of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Thus, restoration of RPE is the main therapeutic approach to prevent the development of ocular diseases, such as ARMD. In this study, we have investigated the role of substance P (SP) on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-mediated RPE regeneration in vitro. The MSCs were primed with SP followed by the addition of conditioned medium (MSCSP?CM) to RPE. The effects of MSCSP?CM on RPE activity was evaluated by assessing viability, proliferation rate, and migration of RPE. Ex vivo long-term culture led to altered cellular characteristics of MSCs by weakening cell viability, cytokine secretion, and differentiation potential. The conditioned medium of early passage MSC (E-MSCCM) enhanced the RPE viability and migration, whereas the late passage MSC (L-MSCCM) hardly influenced the RPE activity. SP priming, however, facilitated the inductive effects of MSC, and SP effect was more distinct in the late passage than in the early passage. Moreover, it was revealed that SP could exert its effects by modulating PDGF-BB secretion in the MSCs. Taken together, these results suggested that SP could restore the therapeutic effects of MSCs on retinal diseases by elevating their proliferative and paracrine activities through PDGF-PDGFR signaling in ex vivo culture. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Mesenchymal stem cells; PDGF-BB; Retinal pigmented epithelial cells; Substance P,platelet derived growth factor BB; substance P; adult; ARPE-19 cell line; Article; bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell; cell differentiation; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; cytokine release; human; human cell; in vitro study; priority journal; retinal pigment epithelium; signal transduction; tissue regeneration,2-s2.0-85066472634

Here, the antitumor mechanisms of Pyrogallol were elucidated in Hep3B and Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). Pyrogallol showed significant cytotoxicity and reduced the number of colonies in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Interestingly, Pyrogallol induced S-phase arrest and attenuated the protein expression of CyclinD1, Cyclin E, Cyclin A, c-Myc, S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), p-AKT, PI3K, increased the protein expression of p27, and also reduced the fluorescent expression of Cyclin E in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Furthermore, Pyrogallol disturbed the interaction between Skp2, p27, and c-Myc in Huh7 cells. Notably, Pyrogallol upregulated miRNA levels of miR-134, and conversely, miR-134 inhibition rescued the decreased expression levels of c-Myc, Cyclin E, and Cyclin D1 and increased the expression of p27 by Pyrogallol in Huh7 cells. Taken together, our findings provide insight that Pyrogallol exerts antitumor effects in HCCs via miR-134 activation-mediated S-phase arrest and inhibition of PI3K/AKT/Skp2/cMyc signaling as a potent anticancer candidate. ? 2019 by the authors.

This open and single-arm pilot trial investigated the effects of the additional use of fiber on glycemic parameters, insulin, incretins, and microbiota in patients with T2DM who had been treated with metformin and sulfonylurea. Methods: Participants took fiber for 4 weeks and stopped for the next 4 weeks. Glycemic parameters, insulin, incretins during mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level, and fecal microbiota were analyzed at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The first tertile of difference in glucose area under the curve during MMTT between weeks 0 and 4 was defined as ‘responders’ and the third as ‘nonresponders,’ respectively. Results: In all 10 participants, the peak incretin levels during MMTT were higher and LPS were lower at week 4 as compared with at baseline. While the insulin sensitivity of the ‘responders’ increased at week 4, that of the ‘nonresponders’ showed opposite results. However, the results were not statistically significant. In all participants, metabolically unfavorable microbiota decreased at week 4 and were restored at week 8. At baseline, metabolically hostile bacteria were more abundant in the ‘nonresponders.’ In ‘responders,’ Roseburia intestinalis increased at week 4. Conclusion: While dietary fiber did not induce additional changes in glycemic parameters, it showed a trend of improvement in insulin sensitivity in ‘responders.’ Even if patients are already receiving diabetes treatment, the additional administration of fiber can lead to additional benefits in the treatment of diabetes.

Factors predictive of the severity of and recovery from Bell’s palsy remain unclear. This study evaluated the association between neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the severity of and recovery from Bell’s palsy. Methods. This retrospective study included 51 patients who were hospitalized with Bell’s palsy from 2015 to 2017. Degree of paralysis was assessed by House-Brackmann (H-B) grade. Patients with H-B grades 2–4 were classified as having mild to moderate palsy and patients with H-B grade 5 or 6 were classified as having severe palsy. Patients were evaluated for obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and blood tests were performed to determine NLR and platelet to lymphocyte ratio. Patients were treated with steroids and antiviral agents. H-B grade was assessed 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment. Results. NLR was significantly higher in patients with severe than with mild to moderate palsy (P=0.048). Recovery time was significantly longer in patients with high NLR than low NLR (P=0.045). Conclusion. Higher NLR in patients with Bell’s palsy was associated with longer recovery time. NLR may be prognostic of recovery time in patients with Bell’s palsy. ? 2019 by Korean Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.",Bell Palsy; Facial Paralysis; Lymphocytes; Neutrophils,,2-s2.0-85071279573

To gain insight, we investigated whether phospholipids rich in eggs (EPL) interfere with intestinal cholesterol absorption in vivo. MATERIALS/METHODS: To investigate the acute effect of EPL on intestinal cholesterol absorption, male C57BL/6J mice were orally administered with 6, 11, or 19 mg of EPL for three days. We also tested the effect of chronic EPL consumption on cholesterol metabolism in the small intestine and the liver in mice with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high fat/high cholesterol (HF/HC; 35% fat, 0.25% cholesterol, w/w) diet for 4 weeks to induce hypercholesterolemia, and subsequently the mice were either fed 0, 0.4 or 0.8% (w/w) of EPL for 6 weeks. RESULTS: Intestinal cholesterol absorption was significantly decreased by the highest dose of acute EPL administration compared to control. Chronic EPL supplementation did not significantly alter intestinal cholesterol absorption nor plasma levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In the small intestine and the liver, EPL supplementation minimally altered the expression of genes which regulate cellular cholesterol levels. CONCLUSION: Although chronic EPL consumption was not able to counteract hypercholesterolemia in HF/HC-fed mice, acute EPL administration decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption. This study provides in vivo evidence that acute administration of PLs in eggs prevent cholesterol absorption in the intestine, suggesting a mechanism for a minimal effect of egg consumption on circulating cholesterol levels.

Design We conducted semistructured interviews to examine the experiences of study subjects regarding early career choices, employment, job performance and career moves, as well as future career aspirations, from the perspective of gender. The transcription was analysed using the Strauss and Corbin constant comparative analysis method. Setting The interview was conducted at a quiet and comfortable place selected by the participants in South Korea. Participants Ten female KM doctors in their 30s participated in the study. Results This study reveals that, initially, the participating female KM doctors were unaware of their gender affecting career decisions. However, after graduation and during employment, female doctors experienced direct discrimination or gender segregation while selecting areas of treatment and specialty; they found that they were preferred to work in paediatrics and dermatology departments than in departments treating musculoskeletal health problems. Furthermore, after entering the workforce, female KM doctors found that their gender significantly affects patient-doctor relationships and life events, such as pregnancy and childbirth require temporary career breaks. In addition, female KM doctors assumed stereotypical gender roles both in the workplace and at home, as well as becoming the main nurturer of their children. Conclusion Gender and stereotyped gender roles affect the overall career planning, career moves and even patient-doctor relationships of female KM doctors. Female doctors were also more likely to experience specific gender roles in the workplace and at home, including both childbirth and childrearing. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, surgical treatment, customized for individual patient's need, is increasingly done. With regard to the surgery of the clavicle fracture, pneumothorax is a possible, but rare complication.Patient concerns:We report the case of a 32-year-old healthy female patient who underwent minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) due to a clavicle fracture. To avoid direct exposure of fracture site, the pre-contoured plate was inserted through the lateral incisional port to reach the medial incisional port. There was no problem during the surgery, but the patient complained of dyspnea in the post-anesthesia care unit.Diagnoses:A chest radiograph was taken immediately, and a definitive finding of pneumothorax was revealed.Interventions:A tube was inserted at the right chest.Outcomes:The patient's dyspnea was resolved. On the 6th day after the surgery, the chest radiograph revealed that pneumothorax was nearly resolved, enabling to remove the chest tube. On the 9th day after the surgery, the patient was discharged without complication.Lessons:After clavicle surgery requiring strong dissection like MIPO, the possibility of pneumothorax is suspected and the patient should be carefully observed. ? 2019 the Author(s).

Surgical intervention is a standard treatment for LSS; however, the steep increase in the surgical rate, post-operative complications, and comparatively low long-term satisfaction are considered to be limitations of this surgical approach. Conversely, acupotomy is a minimally invasive technique that combines the effects of conventional acupuncture with micro-incision, which may offer an alternative to surgery for the treatment of LSS. This review was conducted to investigate and critically review the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of acupotomy for LSS.Methods:Eleven databases were searched from their respective inception dates to December 28, 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupotomy and wait-list, sham treatment, or active controls were included. The quality of the included studies was assessed using risk-of-bias tool.Results:Seven RCTs were included in this review and meta-analysis. The methodological quality of the included studies was generally poor. The acupotomy treatment group was associated with significantly lower visual analogue scale scores (range 0?10) (5 RCTs; mean difference [MD] -1.55, 95% confidence interval [CIs] -2.60 to -0.50; I2 = 94%) and higher Japanese Orthopedic Association Score (3 RCTs; MD 4.70, 95% CI 3.73 to 5.68; I2 = 0%) compared to the active control group. In subgroup analysis based on the type of active controls, acupotomy retained significant benefits over lumbar traction and acupuncture, as well as over lumbar traction, spinal decompression, and acupuncture. Safety data were reported in only 1 study, and no adverse events occurred in either the acupotomy or the acupuncture control group.Conclusion:According to current evidence, acupotomy might be beneficial for treating LSS. Acupotomy showed consistent superiority over lumbar traction, but the results were mixed in comparisons with other interventions, such as spinal decompression and acupuncture. However, the findings should be interpreted cautiously, given the poor methodological quality of the included studies, and potential small-study effects. Further larger, high-quality, rigorous RCTs should be conducted on this topic and rigorous reporting of acupotomy procedures and safety data should be encouraged. ? 2019 the Author(s).

Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness and safety of TEA to those of physical therapy (PT) for the treatment of patients with CNP.Methods/design:This study is planned as a parallel design, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded, clinical study. One hundred twenty-eight patients diagnosed with CNP will be randomly assigned to either the TEA group or the PT group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the TEA group will receive 4 sessions of TEA treatment, while those in the PT group will receive 8 sessions of PT treatment over 4 weeks.

On the contrary, fermented food products have been introduced to improve human health by modulating immune response and energy metabolism. To maximize health benefit, we applied fermentation processing to green tea. Fermented green tea extract (FGT) inhibited adipogenesis and lipogenesis in cultured adipocytes, whereas it augmented mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes in differentiated myocytes. In diet-induced obese mice, FGT blunted body weight and fat mass gain by 69.7% and 56.7%, respectively. FGT also improved circulating triglyceride concentrations by 32.6%. Similar to in vitro results, FGT suppressed lipogenesis and promoted lipid catabolism in peripheral tissues. In addition, FGT administration modulated the composition of certain gut microbiota which are associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders. Among the various components of FGT, gallocatechin gallate is suggested to mediate the effect of FGT on lipid metabolism.

Seventy-seven patients (age 18-65) who had unilateral neck pain, symptom duration of 3 months to 1 year, and who were diagnosed with unilateral 6th cervical radiculopathy by electrodiagnostic testing, were included in study. The CSA of cervical multifidus muscles was measured at the midpoint between the lower margin of the upper vertebra and upper margin of the lower vertebra on axial MRI. Relative CSA (rCSA), which is the ratio of the CSA of muscles to that of the lower margin of C5 vertebra was also obtained.At the C4-5 and C6-7 levels, CSA and rCSA of cervical multifidus muscles showed no statistically difference between the affected and unaffected sides. At the C5-6 level, multifidus muscles were significantly smaller in the affected side (at the C5-6 level, P value of CSA.007 and P value of rCSA.102).The atrophy of multifidus muscles ipsilateral to cervical radiculopathy was observed in patients who had chronic unilateral cervical radiculopathy. ? 2019 the Author(s).

The majority of the past studies tend to cover few minor factors— including stress and occupation professionality or insufficient scale of respondents in particular regions—thus leading to restricted explanations on job satisfaction of the overall physician pool in Korea. This study examines the level of job satisfaction of physicians in Korea and factors affecting their satisfaction by using the ‘2016 Korean Physician Survey (KPS)’ data which included all physicians in Korea. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted in this study in order to identify the factors affecting job satisfaction of physicians in terms of care environment attributes. These attributes included autonomy for care delivery, colleagues/staff/patient relations, income, healthcare resources, social reputation, personal leisure time, administration, restrictions and regulations, and work hours and loads. For the ordinal logistic regression analysis, general socio-demographic attributes, such as gender, age, specialty, job position, type of affiliated healthcare organization, working region, and length of service were controlled beforehand. The result of our measures, the affecting factors of job satisfaction for physicians, include being able to; maintain positive relations with patients through adequate time for consultation and necessary healthcare, have the autonomy to make clinical decisions, have healthy relations with peers and staff, obtain respect from family and society, work in an environment with desirable income and have adequate health resources, and have appropriate work hours and loads for those who facilitate high-quality care. Creating an environment in which physicians can focus on patient-oriented healthcare will contribute to promoting national healthcare. ? 2019 by the authors.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Reviews databases were searched through April 2019. Eligibility criteria: We included case-control or cohort studies investigating an association between NAT2, CYP2E1, GST or SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and the ATDILI risk in patients with tuberculosis. Data extraction and synthesis: Three authors screened articles, extracted data and assessed study quality. The strength of association was evaluated for each gene using the pooled OR with a 95% CI based on the fixed-effects or random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm the reliability and robustness of the results. Results: Fifty-four studies were included in this analysis (n=26 for CYP2E1, n=35 for NAT2, n=19 for GST, n=4 for SLCO1B1). The risk of ATDILI was significantly increased with the following genotypes: CYP2E1 RsaI/PstI c1/c1 (OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.83), NAT2 slow acetylator (OR=3.30, 95% CI 2.65 to 4.11) and GSTM1 null (OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.52). No significant association with ATDILI was found for the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2E1 DraI, GSTT1, GSTM1/GSTT1, SLCO1B1 388A>G and SLCO1B1 521T>C (p>0.05). Conclusions: ATDILI is more likely to occur in patients with NAT2 slow acetylator genotype, CYP2E1 RsaI/PstI c1/c1 genotype and GSTM1 null genotype. Close monitoring may be warranted for patients with these genotypes. ? 2019 Author(s).",anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury; drug transporter; drug-metabolizing enzyme; genetic polymorphisms; meta-analysis; tuberculosis,arylamine acetyltransferase; cytochrome P450 2E1; glutathione transferase; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1; tuberculostatic agent; acetylator genotype; case control study; chemotherapy; Cochrane Library; cohort analysis; data extraction; Embase; genetic association; genetic model; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk; genotype; high risk patient; human; Medline; quality control; reliability; Review; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; toxic hepatitis; tuberculosis; Web of Science,2-s2.0-85070213186

Methods: This study was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. A total of 394 patients were screened. After a 4-week run-in period, 219 of these patients with hypertension and primary hypercholesterolemia were randomized. Patients received 1 of 3 regimens for 8 weeks: (1) CND 32 mg/RSV 20 mg, (2) RSV 20 mg, or (3) CND 32 mg. The primary outcome variables were changes in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the percentage changes in LDL-C from baseline to the drug treatment at 8 weeks. The secondary outcome variables were percentage changes of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, non–HDL-C, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A-I, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and glucose metabolic indices, including percentage changes of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), adiponectin, and hemoglobin A1c. Tolerability of combination therapy was compared with other monotherapy groups. Findings: The percentage changes of LDL-C were ?48.6% (from 157.2 to 80.1 mg/dL) in the RSV group and ?49.8% (from 160.2 to 78.9 mg/dL) in the CND/RSV group from baseline to the end of 8 weeks of treatment. Mean SBP and DBP were significantly decreased in the CND/RSV and CND groups after 8 weeks (P &lt; 0.001 for all); however, no significant differences were found between the 2 groups. Total cholesterol levels, triglycerides, non–HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B were significantly reduced in the CND/RSV and RSV groups, with no significant differences between the groups compared with the CND group (P &lt; 0.001 for all). The percentage changes of HOMA-IR, adiponectin, and hemoglobin A1c had no significant differences between the combination groups and monotherapy groups. However, in a 2-sample t test, HOMA-IR was significantly decreased in the CND/RSV group compared with the RSV group in nondiabetic patients (mean [SD] percentage change of HOMA-IR, ?8.7% [37.6%] vs 17.1% [53.1%]; P = 0.048). There were no significant differences in metabolic indices between the diabetic groups. Adverse events in the CND/RSV group were similar to those in the monotherapy group. Implications: Once-daily fixed-dose combination therapy with CND/RSV is an effective, tolerable, convenient treatment option for patients with essential hypertension and hypercholesteremia.

This study reports results from India (N = 100) and East Asia (N = 134) subpopulations. Methods: Patients from India and East Asia (Korea and Taiwan) with T2DM who were insulin na?ve (glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ? 7.0% and ? 11.0%) or on basal insulin (HbA1c ? 11.0%) were randomized to receive LY IGlar or IGlar along with oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAMs) for 24?weeks. Patients were instructed to self-titrate from the starting dose by 1?unit/day until fasting blood glucose (FBG) ? 5.6?mmol/L (100?mg/dL) was achieved. The key outcome was HbA1c change from baseline to Week 24. Results: Within-group least-squares mean (LSM) decrease (baseline to Week 24) in HbA1c was similar between treatments. The upper limit of confidence interval (CI) for treatment difference was below the defined 0.4% noninferiority margin in India (LY IGlar: ? 0.83%; IGlar: ? 0.62%; difference [95% CI] ? 0.21 [? 0.70, 0.28]) and East Asia (LY IGlar: ? 1.28%; IGlar: ? 1.26%; difference [95% CI] ? 0.02 [? 0.34, 0.30]) subpopulations.

However, its success rate may depend on what the clue is for the repositioning. Recently, repositioning based on correction of unwarranted gene expression pattern has suggested the possibility of new drug development. Here, we designed a similar method for the repositioning of nutraceutical ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.Mey.), which is one of the most validated natural therapeutic products for various diseases. We analyzed ginseng-induced gene expression profiles using the connectivity map algorithm, which is a database that connects diseases, chemical drugs, and gene expression. Ginseng was predicted to show the same effects as those of topoisomerase I inhibitors. In a subsequent in vitro assay, ginseng extract unwound coiled or supercoiled DNA, an effect comparable to that of the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. Furthermore, ginseng extract induced synthetic lethality with suppression of the Werner syndrome gene. The collected data implicate ginseng as a candidate antitumor agent owing to its topoisomerase I inhibitory activity and further validate the usefulness of differentially expressed gene similarity-based repurposing of other natural products. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Connectivity map; Panax ginseng C.A.Mey Araliaceae; Repurposing; Topoisomerase I inhibitor,"DNA topoisomerase; DNA topoisomerase inhibitor; plant extract; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; comparative study; drug effect; drug repositioning; gene expression profiling; genetics; HCT 116 cell line; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; Panax; tumor cell culture; Cell Survival; DNA Topoisomerases, Type I; Drug Repositioning; Gene Expression Profiling; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Molecular Structure; Panax; Plant Extracts; Topoisomerase I Inhibitors; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-85066849934

Fluorescence imaging agents have also been used to monitor the microcirculation. Tracking microcirculation of the blood is vital to gain further insight into various vascular disease-related anomalies within the human body. As monitoring of vascular circulation is performed with visualization of both immune cells and pathogens, which are mainly labelled with red and green, the favorable color option for blood vessels could be blue. However, currently available blueish color-labeled agents for vascular monitoring is generally confronted with quick bleaching, because of its short excitation and emission wavelengths. Hereby, what we propose in this report is a newly generated bright blue fluorescent dextran, named HCD-70K that monitors the blood vessels using blue and inter-compatible typical fluorescent materials. DBCO-functionalized dextran-70K was fabricated with hydroxy-coumarin dye via metal-free bioorthogonal click chemistry, and generated HCD-70K, which can flow within the blood vessel and decipher the whole structure of the blood vessel successfully. The synthesis, spectroscopic analysis, and quantum chemical calculations were conducted. Using two-photon microscopy, efficient deep in vivo blood vessel imaging of a mouse model revealed exceptional bio-imaging capabilities of the HCD-70K and consequently it provided a promising opportunity for efficient vascular visualization in various research areas. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Blood vessel staining; Blue-emitting dextran; Fluorescent polymer; In vivo imaging; Two-photon imaging,coumarin derivative; dextran; fluorescent dye; heavy metal; animal experiment; animal model; Article; blood vessel; cell membrane permeability; click chemistry; confocal laser scanning microscopy; conformational transition; conjugation; controlled study; deprotonation; electron transport; endothelium cell; fluorescence; fluorescence imaging; fluorescence microscopy; in vivo study; incubation time; mass spectrometry; mouse; nonhuman; photon correlation spectroscopy; priority journal; quantum chemistry; ultraviolet radiation,2-s2.0-85066622408

It's widely been used by Indians and Africans. In our present study, Moringa oleifera leaf extract (MLE) has been explored for the ability to alleviate adipogenesis and promote apoptosis in 3T3-L1 cells. Iso-quercetin was a major component isolated from the leaves of M. oleifera. The anti-obesity and apoptotic effect of iso-quercetin was identified by performing molecular docking studies. The iso-quercetin and MLE showed anti-proliferative activity at the concentration of 4.95 ?g/mL and 280.5 ?g/mL respectively. The expression of adipogenesis related genes were downregulated with increased concentration of MLE treatment and caused the decreased accumulation of triglyceride content. Furthermore, MLE induced apoptosis in adipocyte cells were confirmed by TUNEL, Hoechst and PI staining. The apoptosis pathway related pathway genes such as BAX, BCL2 were also studied.

We organized a prospective, long-term, clinicopathologic cohort of patients without neurological diseases who received a radical operation for early gastric cancer (EGC) between ages 50 and 65 years. The participants will be followed for up to 10 years and screened for CPMs and motor symptoms by annual telephone interview. If a participant reports one or more positive answers to screening questions about motor symptoms, they will be regarded as having possible parkinsonism. A movement disorder specialist will then evaluate whether that participant has PD. The primary outcome is the development of PD during the 10-year follow-up. The recruitment period has been completed, and the baseline clinical characteristics are compared between participants with and without possible parkinsonism. A total of 718 participants (mean age: 60.1 ± 5.9) was recruited. The motor symptom screening questionnaire revealed 65 patients with possible parkinsonism (9.0%) at baseline. Patients with possible parkinsonism answered that they had subjective loss of smell more than those without parkinsonism at the time of recruitment (18.5% vs 8.3%) and operation (15.4% vs 6.3%). However, the objective odor discrimination test showed no difference between patients with and without possible parkinsonism. Baseline assessments revealed a sufficient number of patients with possible parkinsonism, which will be confirmed as PD or not in subsequent follow-up visits. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Alpha-synuclein; Cohort; Non-motor symptom; Observational; Parkinson disease; Prodromal; Prospective; Stomach,alpha synuclein; adult; Article; cohort analysis; constipation; controlled study; disease association; early cancer; female; gastrectomy; high risk patient; human; human tissue; hyposmia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; protein aggregation; protein function; risk assessment; risk factor; stomach cancer; aged; early cancer diagnosis; follow up; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; procedures; prodromal symptom; stomach tumor; Aged; Cohort Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Prodromal Symptoms; Prospective Studies; Stomach Neoplasms,2-s2.0-85066251009

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of the SCRT for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study of Korean adults with perennial allergic rhinitis. The trial consisted of a 4-week oral administration of SCRT or placebo, with two visits at 2-week intervals, and an 8-week follow-up period, with two visits at 4-week intervals. The primary outcome was a change in the total nasal symptoms score. The secondary outcomes included changes in the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score, total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), cytokines levels, and nasal endoscopy index. Results: SCRT improved nasal symptoms and quality of life in patients with PAR after 4 weeks medication, and these effects did not last 8 weeks after the end of medication. The level of serum IgE, eosinophil counts, and cytokines did not alter after medication. Nasal endoscopy index did not show significant difference. No serious AEs and safety assessment changes were observed in this trial. Conclusion: SCRT is an effective and safe medication for patients with chronic, perennial, and moderate to severe AR. A clinical study with a >4-week period of medication use, and more participants for immune material test is needed to investigate the long-term efficacy of SCRT in relieving the symptoms of nasal obstruction and identifying the underlying mechanisms of action and indications for traditional Korean medicine. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Allergic rhinitis; Allergy; Herbal medicine; So-Cheong-Ryong-Tang; Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; creatinine; cytokine; hemoglobin; immunoglobulin E; placebo; sho seiryu to; cytokine; herbaceous agent; sho seiryu to; adult; Article; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug safety; dyspepsia; endoscopy; eosinophil count; erythrocyte count; female; follow up; hematocrit; human; immunoglobulin blood level; leukocyte count; long term care; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nasal endoscopy index; nose obstruction; patient compliance; perennial rhinitis; platelet count; quality of life; quality of life assessment; randomized controlled trial; rash; respiratory tract disease assessment; Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire; short course therapy; side effect; total nasal symptoms score; urea nitrogen blood level; asthma; clinical trial; common cold; Korean medicine; metabolism; perennial rhinitis; phytotherapy; procedures; treatment outcome; Adult; Asthma; Common Cold; Cytokines; Double-Blind Method; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Male; Medicine, Korean Traditional; Phytotherapy; Quality of Life; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85066088459

We investigated the efficacy and safety of switching patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who had inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of other DPP-4 inhibitors to teneligliptin. Methods: Patients with T2DM whose glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were ? 7% despite taking DPP-4 inhibitors other than teneligliptin, with or without other hypoglycemic agents, for at least 3?months were enrolled. The DPP-4 inhibitors taken before participating in the study were switched to 20?mg qd teneligliptin, and this was to be maintained for 52?weeks. The primary end point was the change in HbA1c levels after 12?weeks. Metabolic parameters including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and blood lipids were assessed also. To assess safety, adverse and hypoglycemic events were monitored. The data from baseline to week 12 were used for analysis in this interim report. Results: The mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to week 12 was ? 0.44%. At week 12, the percentage of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0% was 31.6% and that of achieving HbA1c < 6.5% was 11.4%, respectively. In 41.2% of patients, the HbA1c levels decreased by at least 0.5% at 12?weeks. The mean change in FPG levels from baseline to week 12 was ? 11.5?mg/dl. No severe hypoglycemia was reported. Conclusion: After switching to teneligliptin, HbA1c levels decreased significantly in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with other DPP-4 inhibitors.

The tumor suppressor p27 negatively regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase. COP1 negatively regulates p27 stability by mediating its nuclear export and degradation. Objective: Even if COP1 and p27 are tightly related and have significant roles in tumor progression, the expression patterns and relationship of both proteins in cancer have not yet been studied. Method: We analyzed the expression patterns and relationship between COP1 and p27 using an ovarian cancer tissue microarray by dual immunofluorescence analysis. Results: The expression levels of COP1 and p27 proteins were not significantly different between ovarian cancer tissue and normal control tissue. Other clinical data including age, tumor type, tumor grade, and stage were not significantly related to expression of the two proteins. The co-relationship between COP1 and p27 proteins was significantly high (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.79, p = 8.65 × 10?22).

In addition, standardized treatment for uterine sarcoma has not yet been established due to its rarity and heterogeneity. Hypothesis/Purpose: We investigated the apoptotic cell death of uterine sarcoma cells (SK-UT-1B)induced by Gyejibokryunghwan (GBH). GBH, an herbal medicine, has been widely used for gynecological diseases in Koean medicine. Methods: SK-UT-1B cells were treated with GBH of varying concentrations from 0 to 500 ?g/ml. The mechanism of cell death was investigated through multiple analysis methods, including flow cytometry, cell cycle, and western blotting. Results: Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the number of apoptotic cells increased in a GBH dose-dependent manner. The cell populations of sub-G 1 and G 0 /G 1 phases were increased by GBH treatment, indicating apoptosisand cell arrest, while the population of S and G 2 /M phases decreased. With GBH, the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, -6, and -9 were upregulated, while the expression levels of pro-caspase-3, -6, and -9 were down-regulated in SK-UT-1B cells. Conclusion: These results are the first observation of uterine sarcoma cell death induced by GBH and confirmation of the mechanism of cell death, which occurred through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Clinically, uterine sarcoma has a poor prognosis with no appropriate treatment. GBH may become a new treatment modality for uterine sarcoma. ? 2018",Apoptosis; Gyejibokryunghwan; Herbal medicine; SK-UT-1B; Uterine sarcoma cells,"amygdalin; antineoplastic agent; caspase 3; caspase 6; caspase 9; cinnamic acid; Gyejibokryunghwan; herbaceous agent; natural product; pachymic acid; paeoniflorin; peonol; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; caspase; plant extract; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle M phase; cell cycle S phase; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug mechanism; flow cytometry; herbal medicine; high performance liquid chromatography; MTT assay; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; SK-UT-1B cell line; upregulation; uterine cancer cell line; uterine sarcoma cell; uterus sarcoma; Western blotting; apoptosis; cell cycle; chemistry; drug effect; drug screening; female; human; Korean medicine; medicinal plant; metabolism; pathology; sarcoma; tumor cell line; uterus cancer; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Caspases; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Female; Humans; Medicine, Korean Traditional; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Sarcoma; Uterine Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85064686026

The aim of this study was to investigate the angiographic features of plaque erosion in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). Methods: Patients with NSTE-ACS who underwent OCT of the culprit lesion were collected at 11 institutions from 6 countries. Patients were classified as erosion or non-erosion based on OCT images. Angiographic features of both groups were compared. Results: Among 494 cases with NSTE-ACS, 242 had plaque erosion and 252 had non-erosion. Compared to non-erosion group, erosion patients had less multivessel disease (28.5% vs. 49.6%, p < 0.001), lower Jeopardy score (4.2 vs. 5.0, p < 0.001), lower Gensini score (21.3 vs. 25.6, p = 0.014), and lower Syntax score (8.9 vs. 11.5, p < 0.001).

Methods: This study included a total of 180 consecutive OSA patients aged 45–80 years underwent polysomnography and airway CT between March 2014 and October 2016. The subjects were divided into three groups based on the results of the respiratory disturbance index (RDI): mild (RDI 5–14, n = 29), moderate (RDI 15–29, n = 50), and severe (RDI ? 30, n = 101). The extent of carotid arterial calcification on each airway CT scan was quantified according to the modified Agatston scoring method. Differences among the three groups in clinical characteristics including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), comorbid disease, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and carotid arterial calcification score (CarACS) were analyzed. Results: The severe OSA group showed significantly stronger predominance for male and smoker, higher prevalence of diabetes, and larger BMI than those of mild and moderate OSA groups. The mean CarACS was significantly different among the three groups (mild RDI: 4.3 ± 13.4, moderate RDI: 7.4 ± 28.8, severe RDI: 48.6 ± 121.6, P = 0.011). Univariate linear regression showed that RDI, age, hypertension, male sex and diabetes significantly influenced on the CarACS. In a multivariate linear regression model, the CarACS was related to age, male sex, and diabetes. Conclusions: The patients with severe OSA showed larger CarACS and a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors.

Methods: This study was based on the data acquired in the Sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VI; 2013-2015). A total of 17,583 participants (7,633 males and 9,950 females)) aged 19 years or older completed the KNHANES VI between 2013 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using socioeconomic characteristics (sex, age, level of education, individual income), personal health practice (smoking, toothbrushing, dental flossing, interdental brushing, dental clinic visiting), systematic medical factors (diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity) and the community periodontal index. We confirmed differences in the prevalence of periodontal disease with the use of an interdental brushes stratified according to individual income. Results: Three logistic regression models adjusted for covariates hierarchically. In all models, individuals who used an interdental brush were not significantly different from individuals who did not use an interdental brush. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for interdental brushing was 0.918 with a 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 0.797-1.057. When periodontal disease was the outcome of the model, the lowest income group had 1.266 (95% CIs 1.066 to 1.502) times the odds of having periodontal disease than the highest income group. In interdental brush nonusers, the lowest income group had 1.276 (95% CI 1.061-1.533) times the odds of having periodontal diseases than the highest income group. However, in the interdental brush users, there were no significant differences in periodontal disease prevalence among income groups.

TCDD accumulates in the food chain, mainly in the fatty tissues of the human body where it causes various toxic effects. Biochanin A is a natural organic compound in the class of phytochemicals known as flavonoids. We investigated whether biochanin A suppresses TCDD-induced loss of adipogenic action using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell culture model of wasting syndrome. In the present study, biochanin A suppressed TCDD-induced loss of lipid accumulation. Pretreating the cells with biochanin A increased the levels of the adipogenesis-associated factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and adiponectin, which were inhibited by TCDD. TCDD decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which was effectively restored by pretreatment with biochanin A. Biochanin A also inhibited the TCDD-driven decrease in production of insulin receptor substrate-1 and glucose transporter 4. These results suggest a preventive effect of biochanin A against TCDD in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. TCDD increased production of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), prostaglandin E2, cytosolic phospholipase A2, and cyclooxygenase-1, while reducing the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha.

From numerous clinical and animal studies focusing on specific lung functions, a consensus about how to use the EIT technique has been formed lately. We present an integrated EIT system implementing the functions proposed in the consensus. The integrated EIT system could improve the usefulness when monitoring of mechanical ventilation for lung protection so that it could facilitate the clinical acceptance of this new technique. Methods: Using a custom-designed 16-channel EIT system with 50 frames/s temporal resolution, the integrated EIT system software was developed to implement five functional images and six EIT measures that can be observed in real-time screen view and analysis screen view mode, respectively. We evaluated the performance of the integrated EIT system with ten mechanically ventilated porcine subjects in normal and disease models. Results: Quantitative and simultaneous imaging of tidal volume (TV), end-expiratory lung volume change (\triangle EELV), compliance, ventilation delay, and overdistension/collapse images were performed. Clinically useful parameters were successfully extracted including anterior/posterior ventilation ratio (A/P ratio), center of ventilation ({\mathrm{CoV}}{{x}} CoV x, {\mathrm{CoV}}{{y}} CoV y), global inhomogeneity (GI), coefficient of variation (CV), ventilation delay and percentile of overdistension/collapse. The integrated EIT system was demonstrated to suggest an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for lung protective ventilation in normal and in the disease model of an acute injury. Optimal PEEP for normal and disease model was 2.3 and 7.9 \, {\mathrm{cmH}}{2}\mathrm{O} 7.9 cmH 2 O, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed integrated approach for functional lung ventilation imaging could facilitate clinical acceptance of the bedside EIT imaging method in ICU. Future clinical studies of applying the proposed methods to human subjects are needed to show the clinical significance of the method for lung protective mechanical ventilation and mechanical ventilator weaning in ICU. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Electrical impedance tomography; Functional lung ventilation imaging; Integrated approach; Mechanical ventilation; Real-time bedside imaging,Cobalt alloys; Electric impedance; Electric impedance measurement; Electric impedance tomography; Integrated control; Intensive care units; Ventilation; Electrical impedance tomography; Integrated approach; Lung ventilation; Mechanical ventilation; Real time; Biological organs; animal experiment; animal model; Article; artificial ventilation; atelectasis; calibration; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; clinical practice; computer assisted impedance tomography; diagnostic imaging; human; intensive care unit; lung ventilation; nonhuman; pig; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; quantitative analysis; risk reduction; therapy delay; tidal volume; treatment planning; ventilator weaning; animal; impedance; lung; physiology; procedures; software; tomography; Animals; Electric Impedance; Lung; Pulmonary Ventilation; Software; Swine; Tidal Volume; Tomography,2-s2.0-85069906936

To investigate the association between phenotypic and microbiota-related changes in the gut and a raw starch-based diet, we fed mice with different starch substitutes (corn, wheat, rice, and potato) for 16 weeks. The potato starch-fed group showed the lowest weight gain and fat tissue accumulation of all the groups, as well as the highest insulin sensitivity. Taxonomic analysis indicated that the proportions of Akkermansia, Rikenellaceae, and Sutterella showed the greatest increase in the ceca of mice fed raw potato starch. In addition, the gut microbiota of the raw potato starch group showed the highest carbohydrate and energy metabolism of all the groups, as confirmed by cecal metabolite analysis. The raw potato starch group also produced the highest propionic acid content. Our results showed that the differences in the digestibility of each starch, differences in the phenotype in terms of digestibility, and changes in intestinal microbiota were connected, and it was confirmed that potato starch, which had the lowest digestibility, caused the greatest difference in intestinal microbe composition and metabolism. ? 2019",Gut microbiome; Potato starch; Propionic acid,bile acid; cholesterol; DNA 16S; potato starch; propionic acid; short chain fatty acid; starch; cholesterol; starch; adipose tissue; Akkermansia; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterium; bacterium detection; bile acid metabolism; bioinformatics; body weight gain; C57BL 6 mouse; carbohydrate metabolism; cecum mucosa; controlled study; digestion; energy metabolism; insulin sensitivity; intestine flora; lipid storage; maize; male; metabolome; metagenomics; microbial metabolism; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; raw food; rice; Rikenellaceae; species composition; Sutterella; taxonomy; wheat; animal; blood; cecum; chemistry; drug effect; feces; intestine flora; metabolism; metabolome; microbiology; potato; Animals; Cecum; Cholesterol; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Metabolome; Mice; Phenotype; Solanum tuberosum; Starch,2-s2.0-85064315474

Meta-analysis can detect phenotype associated variants that are failed to be detected in single studies. Especially, in biomedical sciences, meta-analysis is often necessary not only for improving statistical power, but also for reducing unavoidable limitation in data collection. As next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been developed, meta-analysis of rare variants is proceeding briskly along with meta-analysis of common variants in GWASs. However, meta-analysis on a single variant that is commonly used in common variant association test is improper for rare variants. A sparse signal of rare variant undermines the association signal and its large number causes multiple testing problem. To over-come these problems, we propose a meta-analysis method at the gene-level rather than variant level. Results: Among many methods that have been developed, we used the unified quadratic tests (Q-tests); Q-test is more powerful than or as powerful as other tests such as Sequence Kernel Association Tests (SKAT). Since there are three different versions of Q-test (QTest1, QTest2, QTest3), each assumes different relationships among multiple rare variants, we extended them into meta-study accordingly. For meta-analysis, we consider two types of approaches, the one is to combine regression coefficients and the other is to combine test statistics from each single study. We extend the Q-test for meta-analysis, proposing Meta Quadratic Test (Meta-Qtest). Meta Q-test avoids the limitations of MetaSKAT. It does not only consider genetic heterogeneity among studies as MetaSKAT but also reflects diverse real situations; since we extend three different Q-tests into meta-analysis respectively, flexible Meta Q-test suggests way to deal with gene-level rare variant meta-analysis efficiently From the results of real data analysis of blood pressure trait, our meta-analysis could successfully discovered genes, KCNA5 and CABIN1 that are already well known for relevance with hypertension disease and they are not detected in MetaSKAT. Conclusion: As exemplified by an application to T2D Genes projects data set, Meta-Qtest more effectively identified genes associated with hypertension disease than MetaSKAT did. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Exome sequencing; Meta-analysis; Meta-Qtest; Rare variant analysis,Article; blood pressure measurement; CABIN1 gene; data analysis; genetic association; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variability; human; hypertension; KCNA5 gene; meta analysis (topic); Meta Quadratic Test; multiple linear regression analysis; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; sequence analysis; Sequence Kernel Association Test; study design,2-s2.0-85069537566

The exact pathogenesis of DD remains unknown. Results: In this study, we identified co-expressed gene set (DD signature) consisting of 753 genes via weighted gene co-expression network analysis. To confirm the robustness of DD signature, module enrichment analysis and meta-analysis were performed. Moreover, this signature effectively classified DD disease samples. The DD signature were significantly enriched in unfolded protein response (UPR) related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Next, we conducted multiple-phenotype regression analysis to identify trans-regulatory hotspots regulating expression levels of DD signature using Genotype-Tissue Expression data. Finally, 10 trans-regulatory hotspots and 16 eGenes genes that are significantly associated with at least one cis-eQTL were identified. Conclusions: Among these eGenes, major histocompatibility complex class II genes and ZFP57 zinc finger protein were closely related to ER stress and UPR, suggesting that these genetic markers might be potential therapeutic targets for DD. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Dupuytren's disease; Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress; Major histocompatibility complex class II; Multiple-phenotype analysis; trans-regulatory hotspots; Unfolded protein response (UPR); ZFP57 zinc finger protein,HLA DQA1 antigen; HLA DQB1 antigen; HLA DRB1 antigen; HLA DRB5 antigen; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; Notch4 receptor; Article; ATF6B gene; controlled study; Dupuytren contracture; endoplasmic reticulum stress; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; gene locus; genetic marker; genomics; HLA DQA1 gene; HLA DQB1 gene; HLA DQB2 gene; HLA DRB1 gene; HLA DRB5 gene; HLA DRB56gene; human; microarray analysis; NOTCH4 gene; priority journal; transcriptomics; unfolded protein response; ZFP57 gene,2-s2.0-85069515994

However, the nonspecific release of toxic DNA-intercalating anticancer drugs from the nanoparticles has significant side effects on healthy cells surrounding the tumors. Herein, we report a tumor homing reactive oxygen species nanoparticle (THoR-NP) platform that is highly effective and selective for ablating malignant tumors. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) were selected as an exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator and a superoxide dismutase 1 inhibitor, respectively. DDC-loaded THoR-NP, in combination with SNP treatment, eliminated multiple cancer cell lines effectively by the generation of peroxynitrite in the cells (&gt;95% cell death), as compared to control drug treatments of the same concentration of DDC or SNP alone (0% cell death). Moreover, the magnetic core (ZnFe2O4) of the THoR-NP can specifically ablate tumor cells (breast cancer cells) via magnetic hyperthermia, in conjunction with DDC, even in the absence of any exogenous RS supplements. Finally, by incorporating iRGD peptide moieties in the THoR-NP, integrin-enriched cancer cells (malignant tumors, MDA-MB-231) were effectively and selectively killed, as opposed to nonmetastatic tumors (MCF-7), as confirmed in a mouse xenograft model. Hence, our strategy of using nanoparticles embedded with ROS-scavenger-inhibitor with an exogenous ROS supplement is highly selective and effective cancer therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.",cancer therapy; magnetic core-shell nanoparticles; nanotechnology; reactive species; tumor targeting,"Cell culture; Cell death; Controlled drug delivery; Core shell nanoparticles; Diseases; Drug interactions; Enzymes; Holmium compounds; Iron compounds; Magnetic cores; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Oncology; Oxygen; Tumors; Zinc compounds; Cancer therapy; Chemotherapeutic agents; Diethyldithiocarbamate; Multi-functional nanoparticles; Reactive oxygen species; Reactive species; Super oxide dismutase; Tumor targeting; Targeted drug delivery; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; diethyldithiocarbamic acid; nanoparticle; nitroprusside sodium; reactive oxygen metabolite; SOD1 protein, human; animal; Bagg albino mouse; chemistry; drug screening; economics; experimental neoplasm; female; human; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; Animals; Ditiocarb; Female; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms, Experimental; Nitroprusside; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase-1; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85068416069

Most common side effect of oxaliplatin is peripheral neuropathy, manifested in mechanical and cold allodynia. Although the analgesic effect of bee venom has been proven to be effective against oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy, the effect of its major component; melittin has not been studied yet. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether melittin has an analgesic effect on oxaliplatin-induced allodynia. Intraperitoneal single injection of oxaliplatin (6 mg/kg) induced mechanical and cold allodynia, resulting in increased withdrawal behavior in response to von Frey filaments and acetone drop on hind paw. Subcutaneous melittin injection on acupoint ST36 (0.5 mg/kg) alleviated oxaliplatin-induced mechanical and cold allodynia. In electrophysiological study, using spinal in vivo extracellular recording, it was shown that oxaliplatin-induced hyperexcitation of spinal wide dynamic range neurons in response to peripheral stimuli, and melittin administration inhibited this neuronal activity. In behavioral assessment, analgesic effect of melittin was blocked by intrathecal α1- and α2- adrenergic receptor antagonists administration. Based on these results, we suggest that melittin could be used as an analgesic on oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy, and that its effect is mediated by activating the spinal α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors. ? 2019 by the authors.",Chemotherapy; Cold allodynia;mechanical allodynia;melittin; Neuropathic pain; Oxaliplatin,adrenergic receptor blocking agent; adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; alpha 1B adrenergic receptor; melittin; oxaliplatin; tungsten; allodynia; analgesic activity; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; behavior assessment; Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale; controlled study; drug administration; dura mater; fungistatic activity; hind paw; laminectomy; mechanical allodynia; neuropathic pain; nonhuman; oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy; paw withdrawal latency; rat; spike,2-s2.0-85069554921

We thus wonder whether CUG2 also induces stemness, a characteristic of cancer stem cells (CSCs)and further examine the molecular mechanism of this phenotype. To test that CUG2 induces stemness, we examined expression of stemness-related factors. Overexpression of CUG2 enhanced expression levels of stemness-related factors in human lung carcinoma A549 and immortalized bronchial BEAS-2B cells. Consequently, CUG2 increased cellular spherical cluster forming ability. Overexpression of CUG2 also induced tumor formation in xenotransplanted nude mice whereas transplantation of control cells failed to, implying that CUG2 possesses malignant tumorigenic potential. We paid attention to nucleophosmin (NPM1)for its known interaction with CUG2. Suppression of NPM1 hindered the CUG2-mediated stemness-like phenotypes and diminished TGF-β transcriptional activity and signaling. TGF-β increased stemness-like phenotypes in the control cells whereas TGF-β inhibitor blocked induction of the phenotypes, indicating that NPM1 is required for CUG2-mediated stemness-like phenotypes through TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, the suppression of Smad- and non-Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling pathways also prevented CUG2 from inducing stemness-like phenotypes. Altogether, we suggest that the novel CUG2 oncogene promotes cellular transformation and stemness, mediated by nuclear NPM1 protein and TGF-β signaling. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Cancer stem cell; CUG2; NPM1; Stemness; TGF-β,nucleophosmin; Smad protein; transforming growth factor beta; A-549 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; BEAS-2B cell line; cancer stem cell; cancer upregulated gene 2; carcinogenesis; cell transformation; colony forming unit; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme repression; gene overexpression; human; human cell; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; protein interaction; TGF beta signaling; tumor xenograft,2-s2.0-85065759056

Results: Of 726 enrolled patients, 719 were included (55.6% male); 31.7% and 68.3% were on sulfonylurea monotherapy and sulfonylurea+metformin, respectively. Mean±standard deviation age was 65.9±10.0 years; mean HbA1c level was 7.0%±1.0%; 77.8% of patients had hypertension (89.4% used antihypertensive medication); 60.5% had lipid disorders (72.5% used lipid-lowering medication); and 52.0% had one or more micro- or macrovascular diseases. Among patients with A1c measurement (n=717), 56.4% achieved therapeutic goals (HbA1c < 7.0%); 42.4% (305/719) experienced hypoglycemia within 6 months of enrollment; and 38.8%, 12.9%, 12.7%, and 3.9% of patients experienced mild, moderate, severe, and very severe hypoglycemia symptoms, respectively. Several reported hypoglycemia frequency as 1-2 times over the last 6 months. The mean number of very severe hypoglycemia episodes was 3.5±5.5. Conclusion: Among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated with sulfonylurea-based regimens, glycemic levels were relatively well controlled but hypoglycemia remained a prevalent side effect. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Family Medicine.",Glycated hemoglobin A; Hypoglycemia; Metformin; Sulfonylurea; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,,2-s2.0-85069763308

This study aims to report the spontaneous regression of discal cyst achieved through nonsurgical integrative Korean Medicine treatment and the clinical epidemiological features of discal cyst cases collected from 4 institutions. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old woman had low back pain and radiating pain equivalent to a numeral rating scale (NRS) of 8 and had limitations in daily work and activities. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed as having discal cysts that compressed the left S1 based on findings of L-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at our hospital. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received nonsurgical Korean Medicine treatment and after 24 days of treatment in the hospital, she underwent 16 additional treatments as an outpatient. OUTCOMES: Spontaneous regression was confirmed in the L-spine MRI follow-up at 36 days and 99 days after the initial test, and the patient underwent once-a-week follow up to examine NRS, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), and fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ) after 4 weeks, and 2, 3, and 6-month follow-ups after that. The patient was discharged in a painless condition, and she was able to carry on for 5 months without increased pain. LESSONS: Discal cysts are more rapid progress than disc herniation, it seems valid to attempt nonsurgical treatment. Epidemiologically, this is the first study to present the clinical epidemiological characteristics of discal cysts, it would provide valuable information to clinicians who treat and study discal cysts.",,"acupuncture; adult; case report; cyst; diagnostic imaging; female; human; integrative medicine; lumbar vertebra; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oriental medicine; pain measurement; physiotherapy; procedures; retrospective study; South Korea; treatment outcome; Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Cysts; Female; Humans; Integrative Medicine; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Medicine, East Asian Traditional; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Physical Therapy Modalities; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85069267748

In total, 153 participants responded to the questionnaires, and 26.8% indicated that they have had separate educational programs. The workforce involved in the educational program included nurses, residents or fellows, dieticians, pharmacists, and clinical psychologists. Most education protocols addressed the characteristics and natural course of atopic dermatitis and environmental management. Overall, 96.7% of the participants replied that an additional charge is needed for education; moreover, additional assistance from an academic society or association, in the form of medical staff, organized data, and advertisement, is required to develop and provide a well-structured educational program.

Objectives The aims of this study were to investigate differences between psychosocial/spiritual variables and coping strategies in CRC patients of different age groups (younger vs older) and to identify the predictors of coping for both age groups. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted at 3 outpatient clinics in Korea. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Social Support Scale, and Self-Transcendence Scale were used to measure psychosocial and spiritual variables; the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale was used to assess cancer-specific coping strategies. Results Both younger and older patients who were psychologically distressed used more maladaptive coping. Individuals who received less social support from healthcare providers used more maladaptive coping strategies. For younger patients, self-transcendence was the only significant predictor of both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies; for older patients, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score was the only significant predictor of maladaptive coping. Conclusion Differences in psychological distress, social support, and self-transcendence due to age are important protective or risk factors for the use of coping strategies among CRC patients. Implications for Practice Considering our findings, we encourage healthcare professionals to be aware of patients' coping strategies and take them into account when planning age-specific interventions related to coping, before hospital discharge. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

It is unknown whether increasing or decreasing PA is associated with all-cause mortality. Objective The purpose of this study was to estimate the associations between PA and the risk of mortality. Methods MEDLINE and EMBASE were used to find eligible studies published from January 1970 to March 2017 for this meta-analysis. We included 24 studies, with a total of 144 224 patients and follow-up periods ranging from 1.9 to 12.7 years. We categorized the amount of PA as low (<300 min/wk), moderate (300-500 min/wk), and high (>500 min/wk). Results We found that high amounts of PA had an inverse relationship with breast-cancer-specific mortality and all-cause morality. Patients who decreased PA after diagnosis showed poorer all-cause mortality, whereas patients who increased PA postdiagnosis had a favorable association with all-cause mortality. Last, patients who met PA guidelines after diagnosis had a lower breast-cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Conclusion Physical activity may play a pivotal role in reducing the risk of death. Getting at least 300 min/wk of moderate-intensity PA will help improve the risk of breast cancer death. Implications for Practice Participating in PA is an essential factor in breast cancer care that extends throughout the life span of cancer survivors. Higher levels of PA than current PA guidelines should be recommended to cancer patients. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Fimasartan is a new non-peptide angiotensin II receptor blocker with a selective type I receptor blocking effect. The objective of this study is to confirm the safety and the non-inferiority of the blood pressure-lowering effect of fimasartan compared with those of perindopril, which has been proven safe and effective in elderly patients with hypertension. Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, two-parallel group, optional-titration, multicenter, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of fimasartan and perindopril arginine. The study population consists of individuals 70 years old or older with essential hypertension. The primary outcome will be a change in sitting systolic blood pressure from baseline after the administration of the investigational product for 8 weeks. The secondary outcomes will be a change in sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline and changes in sitting systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from baseline after the administration of the investigational product for 4, 16, and 24 weeks. The sample size will be 119 subjects for each group to confer enough power to test for the primary outcome. Discussion: Research to confirm the efficacy and safety of a new medicine compared with those of previously proven anti-hypertensive drugs is beneficial to guide physicians in the selection of therapeutic agents. If it is confirmed that the new drug is not inferior to the existing drug, the drug will be considered as an option in the treatment of hypertension in elderly patients.

This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of QOL as well as its prognostic value and utility.Materials and Methods:A prospective cohort of 300 HCC patients at various stages was recruited from 2015 to 2017 in Korea. The subjects answered the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) and QLQ-HCC18 and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) questionnaire. Prognostic nomograms including the QOL scales were developed. The prediction performance of the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems when they were incorporated with QOL was investigated.Results:The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 subscales showed higher reliability than FACT-Hep subscales. With regard to the validity, both questionnaires discriminated the patients by stages, treatment modalities, and performance status effectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that EORTC role functioning and EORTC appetite loss subscales were statistically associated with overall survival and disease progression. The developed nomograms accurately estimated the 1-year overall survival and disease progression-free rates. Incorporating the EORTC role functioning subscale or Hepatobiliary Cancer Subscale of FACT-Hep with the BCLC and AJCC systems improved the prognostic classification.

Methods: A total of 25 out of 1192 community-dwelling older people aged >70 years with cognitive frailty participated in the present cross-sectional study. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Physical function measures included calf circumference, Timed Up and Go (TUG) and usual walking speed. Interviews were carried out to assess Council on Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire (CNAQ); chronic diseases including hypertension, diabetes and falls; as well as physical frailty, defined as having three of five criteria: muscle weakness, slowness, exhaustion, low activity and weight loss. Results: The prevalence of cognitive frailty was 2.1%. Participants with cognitive frailty had significantly reduced Mini-Mental State Examination and calf circumference; and higher instrumental activities of daily living disability and falls. Old age (OR 1.151, 95% CI 1.053–1.257), fall history (OR 3.577, 95% CI 1.381–9.263), having four or more chronic diseases (OR 7.419, 95% CI 2.117–26.005) and slower TUG (OR 1.234, 95% CI 1.041–1.462) were significantly associated with cognitive frailty, whereas greater calf circumference (OR 0.748, 95% CI 0.625–0.895) and CNAQ (OR 0.736, 95% CI 0.628–0.8631) had protective effects.

In order to improve trial quality, dummy run studies among the participating institutions were designed. This work reported the results of two-step dummy run procedures of the KROG 17-06 study. Materials and Methods Two steps tested hippocampus contouring variability and radiation therapy planning compliance. In the first step, the variation of the hippocampus delineation was investigated for two representative cases using the Dice similarity coefficients. In the second step, the participating institutions were requested to generate a HS-WBRT with SIB treatment plan for another representative case. The compliance of the treatment plans to the planning protocol was evaluated. Results In the first step, the median Dice similarity coefficients of the hippocampus contours for two other dummy run cases changed from 0.669 (range, 0.073 to 0.712) to 0.690 (range, 0.522 to 0.750) and from 0.291 (range, 0.219 to 0.522) to 0.412 (range, 0.264 to 0.598) after providing the hippocampus contouring feedback. In the second step, with providing additional plan priority and extended dose constraints to the target volumes and normal structures, we observed the improved compliance of the treatment plans to the planning protocol. Conclusion The dummy run studies demonstrated the notable inter-institutional variability in delineating the hippocampus and treatment plan generation, which could be decreased through feedback from the trial center.

Chrysophanol, an anthraquinone from the AST2017-01 extract, showed a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect on activated human mast cells in our previous study. However, a regulatory effect of AST2017-01 and chrysophanol on mast cell proliferation induced by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) remains unclear. The present study determined the anti-proliferative effect and the fundamental mechanism of AST2017-01 and chrysophanol in mast cells. Methods: We evaluated an anti-proliferative effect of AST2017-01 and chrysophanol in TSLP-stimulated human mast cell line, HMC-1. Results: Without cytotoxicity, AST2017-01 and chrysophanol decreased mast cells growth and Ki67 mRNA expression increased by TSLP. AST2017-01 and chrysophanol enhanced expressions of p53 and Bax, whereas inhibited expression of Bcl-2. AST2017-01 and chrysophanol restored caspase-3 activity which was decreased by TSLP. AST2017-01 and chrysophanol suppressed expressions of murine double minute-2 protein and phosphorylated-signal transducer and activator of transcription six which are associated with the regulation of p53 protein. AST2017-01 and chrysophanol decreased levels of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, AST2017-01 and chrysophanol reduced mRNA expressions of TSLP receptor and IL-7 receptor α. Conclusions: Therefore, this study proposes that AST2017-01 and chrysophanol may be promising candidates for the development of potent anti-inflammatory or health functional foods. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Chrysophanol; Mast cell; Murine double minute-2; p53; Thymic stromal lymphopoietin,"anthraquinone; antineoplastic agent; ast 2017 01; caspase 3; chrysophanic acid; interleukin 13; interleukin 6; interleukin 7 receptor alpha; Ki 67 antigen; messenger RNA; protein Bax; protein p53; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; anthraquinone derivative; antiinflammatory agent; caspase 3; chrysophanic acid; cytokine; MDM2 protein, human; protein MDM2; protein p53; STAT6 protein; STAT6 protein, human; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; TP53 protein, human; antiproliferative activity; Article; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; enzyme activity; gene expression; HMC-1 cell line; human; human cell; mast cell; mast cell line; cell line; cell proliferation; chemistry; Cordyceps; drug effect; drug mixture; mast cell; metabolism; pharmacology; Rumex; Anthraquinones; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Caspase 3; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Complex Mixtures; Cordyceps; Cytokines; Humans; Mast Cells; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2; Rumex; STAT6 Transcription Factor; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",2-s2.0-85065222244

This study examined how national context and individual subjective well-being are associated with emerging adults’ marriage expectations in three Asian countries—South Korea, China, and Vietnam—which share the traditional Confucian marriage norms but differ in the degree of industrialization. Methods: Using convenience sampling, data came from 1,019 never-married college students living in the cities of Korea, China, and Vietnam. Results: The majority of the participants across the three countries had marriage intentions. The higher the subjective well-being, the more likely the participants were to have marriage intentions, and the earlier the expected marriage age. Cross-country difference was observed such that emerging adults from Korea were more likely to expect later marriage age than their counterparts from China and Vietnam. There was also gender difference in the association between subjective well-being and expected marriage age; the negative association between subjective well-being and expected marriage age was found for men, but not for women. Conclusions: The current study provides empirical evidence that national context and subjective well-being are associated with emerging adults’ expectations about future marriage. Given that higher subjective well-being was associated with more intentions to marry and an earlier expected marriage age beyond the national context, enhancing individual well-being through mental health promotions could be an effective pro-marriage policy. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Asian Confucian culture; Country differences; Emerging adults; Marriage expectation; Subjective well-being,adult; article; China; city; college student; Confucian; convenience sample; expectation; female; human; human experiment; industrialization; major clinical study; male; mental health; sex difference; single (marital status); South Korea; Viet Nam; wellbeing,2-s2.0-85064805806

Both EFAA and 4,5-diCQA were effective in improving cognitive function on HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction. In brain tissue analysis, it was confirmed that EFAA and 4,5-diCQA inhibited the reduction of neurotransmitters as well as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, they inhibited amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation by increasing the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme and consequently prevented apoptosis. In conclusion, it is presumed that Artemisia argyi may help to improve the cognitive impairment due to the HFD, and it is considered that this effect is closely related to the physiological activity of 4,5-diCQA. Practical applications: Artemisia argyi is used in traditional herbal medicine in Asia. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been proven by a variety of epidemiological studies to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer’s disease. This study confirmed that 4,5-diCQA is a bioactive compound of Artemisia argyi on improving HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with AML without visible fat and 50 patients with ccRCC of size ?4.5 cm who had also undergone preoperative four-phase CECT were included in this study. The histogram, grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and grey-level run length matrix (GLRLM)were evaluated. Sequential feature selection (SFS)and support vector machine (SVM)classifier with leave-one-out cross validation were used. RESULTS: Using the SFS and SVM classifiers, five texture features were selected; mean (unenhanced), standard deviation (unenhanced and excretory), cluster prominence (nephrographic), and long-run high grey-level emphasis (corticomedullary). Diagnostic performance of the five selected texture features for all CT phases was as follows: 82% sensitivity, 76% specificity, 85% accuracy, and 85 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). In the subgroup analysis, the AUCs of each phase were significantly >0.5 (p<0.05). In the pairwise comparison of AUCs between four phases, there were no significant differences between the four phases except the unenhanced and corticomedullary phases (p=0.015), i.e., the unenhanced phase showed slightly higher AUC than the corticomedullary phase. CONCLUSIONS: Texture analysis of small renal masses (?4.5 cm)on four-phase CECT can accurately differentiate AML without visible fat from ccRCC and showed good diagnostic performance for both the unenhanced and enhanced phases. ? 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists",,iobitridol; ioversol; adult; angiomyolipoma; area under the curve; Article; cancer surgery; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; female; human; kidney angiography; kidney tomography; male; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; nephrectomy; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; quantitative diagnosis; receiver operating characteristic; renal cell carcinoma; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; spiral computer assisted tomography; support vector machine; tumor biopsy; validation study,2-s2.0-85064379529

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of cohort study data. Hearing was measured using of Pure-tone audiometry. Hearing loss was determined based on the average of hearing thresholds at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz in the ear that had better hearing. Social frailty was defined based on the summation of the following 5 social components (1. Neighborhood meeting attendance 2. Talking to friend(s) sometimes 3.Someone gives you love and affection 4. Living alone 5. Meeting someone every day). Participants who had no correspondence to the components were considered non-social frailty; those with 1–2 components were considered social prefrailty; and those having 3 or more components were considered social frailty. Results: The prevalence of non-social frailty, social prefrailty, social frailty was 27.6%, 60.7% and 11.7% respectively. Of the five questions, two components (Neighborhood meeting attendance and Presence of someone who shows love and affection to the participants) were associated with hearing loss (p < 0.001). Compared to non-social frailty, the odds ratio of social frailty for hearing loss was 2.24 (95% CI 1.48–3.38) after adjusting for age, residential area, economic status, smoking, depressive disorder and MMSE, and 2.17 (95% CI 1.43–3.30) after further adjustments with physical frailty.

Individuals with particular osteoporosis risk factors such as smokers and heavy drinkers are overlooked for diagnosis. Further study is needed to identify and address the existing barriers and to promote osteoporosis management for women with these risk factors. Introduction: Despite the negative health consequences of osteoporosis and the availability of effective treatment, a pervasive and persistent prevention care gap for osteoporosis remains present throughout the world. We attempted to identify the factors affecting the willingness of patients to either undergo or avoid assessment and treatment for osteoporosis. Methods: A nationwide online survey was conducted in 926 Korean women over age 50. The survey included questions addressing three domains: (1) clinical and socio-demographic characteristics, (2) questions concerning the reasons for undergoing or avoiding osteoporosis assessment or treatment, and (3) knowledge of osteoporosis as measured using the modified Korean version of Facts on Osteoporosis Quiz. The assessed and non-assessed participants were compared in terms of their clinical and socioeconomic statuses, reasons for undergoing or avoiding osteoporosis management, and levels of knowledge of osteoporosis. Results: The highest-ranked reason for undergoing osteoporosis assessment was fear of osteoporotic fracture, while the highest-ranked reason for avoiding osteoporosis assessment was not feeling a need to get tested for osteoporosis. Participants who sought assessment for osteoporosis were older and more likely to be married, and had greater knowledge of osteoporosis than those who did not seek assessment. The two groups were found to be similar in terms of tobacco use and daily alcohol use. Patients who had been diagnosed with osteoporosis but either did not initiate or discontinued osteoporosis treatment within 1?year were younger and had lower levels of annual income than those who began and continued treatment. Conclusion: Individuals with poor knowledge of osteoporosis and those of lower socioeconomic status, including those who were single and had a lower level of annual income, were less likely to be assessed and treated for osteoporosis. Individuals with particular osteoporosis risk factors such as smokers and heavy drinkers are overlooked for diagnosis.

However, these cells display wide intra- and interindividual variations in gene expression, which makes distinguishing true-positive and false-positive phenotypes challenging. Data from hiPSC phenotypes and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) harbouring the same disease mutation are also lacking. Here, we report a comparison of the molecular, cellular and functional characteristics of three congruent patient-specific cell types—hiPSCs, hESCs and direct-lineage-converted cells—derived from currently available differentiation and direct-reprogramming technologies for use in the modelling of Charcot?Marie?Tooth 1A, a human genetic Schwann-cell disorder featuring a 1.4 Mb chromosomal duplication. We find that the chemokines C?X?C motif ligand chemokine-1 (CXCL1) and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) are commonly upregulated in all three congruent models and in clinical patient samples. The development of congruent models of a single genetic disease using somatic cells from a common patient will facilitate the search for convergent phenotypes. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,Gene expression; Neurons; Stem cells; Chemoattractants; Direct reprogramming; Functional characteristics; Genetic disease; Genetic disorders; Human embryonic stem cells; Human-induced pluripotent stem cells; Patient specific; Cytology; CXCL1 chemokine; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; octamer transcription factor 4; RNA; transcription factor Sox10; Article; cell differentiation; cell lineage; chromosome duplication; comparative study; embryo; false positive result; female; fluorescence activated cell sorting; gene expression; genetic disorder; hereditary motor sensory neuropathy; human; human cell; human embryonic stem cell; human tissue; immunocompetent cell; in vitro study; induced pluripotent stem cell; macrophage; nerve biopsy; neural crest; phenotype; RNA sequence; Schwann cell; somatic cell; upregulation,2-s2.0-85063996460

Methods: Our study included 100 healthy women aged between the early 20s and late 60s. Biophysical characteristics of skin such as color (brightness and spots), transparency, wrinkle on crow's feet, elasticity, hydration, sebum content, glossiness, and transepidermal water loss measured under controlled conditions. Results: This study performed in a Korean population demonstrated that aging significantly affects human skin in terms of parameters such as wrinkles, skin color, elasticity, and epidermal hydration. Age-related changes in skin hydration showed varying patterns between the epidermis and dermis. Skin color showed heterogeneous characteristics between the upper and lower epidermal layers associated with aging. Skin elasticity and wrinkles were observed to show and inversely proportional relationship in the early 40s. Conclusions: We confirmed the significant influence of aging on the biophysical properties of skin and determined the distinct age-related biophysical changes in the epidermal and dermal layers of skin using noninvasive method.

It can alleviate pathological symptoms, promote health, and prevent potential diseases via its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, homeostatic, and other positive effects on biological metabolism. Although many studies have determined effects of P. ginseng on various diseases, such as cardiovascular, neurological, and immunological diseases, little is known about the effect of P. ginseng on autoimmune diseases. Here, we review a few reports about effects of P. ginseng on autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis) and suggest the possibility of P. ginseng as a candidate herbal medicine to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases as well as the need to study it. ? 2018",Atopic dermatitis; Crohn's disease; Multiple sclerosis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Ulcerative colitis,herbaceous agent; atopic dermatitis; autoimmune disease; Crohn disease; drug effect; ginseng; herbal medicine; human; immunocompetent cell; multiple sclerosis; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; ulcerative colitis,2-s2.0-85056838775

These enzootic helminthiases invoke significant public health concerns and social burdens in endemic areas. The diseases are prevalent in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, while community-based epidemiological studies have been scarcely reported. We surveyed echinococcosis patients in the southeastern Qinghai Province, China, to better understand the concurrent epidemiological situation in this area. Methods: During July and August of 2013 and 2014, we screened echinococcosis patients at Yushu and Golog Prefectures, Qinghai Province, China, in a diagnostic campaign. A total of 2856 people (male:female ratio, 1:1.12; mean age, 34.6 years; age range, 6-88 years) were ultrasonographically examined for the presence of hepatic echinococcal cysts. We also collected serum samples from patients and analyzed antibody reactivity against recombinant forms of diverse E. granulosus antigen Bs (rEgAgB1-5) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: We detected 134 patients whose imaging scans were compatible with CE (115 cases) and AE (20 patients). One patient might have been infected with both CE and AE. The overall incidence was 4.7% (CE, 4.0%; AE, 0.7%). A large proportion (67.5%) of CE patients was diagnosed at active and transitional CE1-CE3 stages in their late 30s. The AE cases were generally detected at advanced stage in patients at early 20s (60%). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve and Youden's index indicated that rEgAgB2 was the most promising biomarker, followed by rEgAgB3 and rEgAgB1. Overall, sensitivity and specificity of rEgAgB1-3 were 84.5-92.7% and 91.9-94.6%, respectively. rEgAgB4 and 5 showed low sensitivity with high cross-reactivity. Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that disability-adjusted life years related to echinococcoses in Qinghai-Tibetan areas might be more serious than previously considered. Control and prevention strategy against CE and AE are highly required in these areas. In addition to ultrasonography, serological tests might provide supportive data. However, serological data should be carefully interpreted for differential diagnosis, especially in areas where both CE and AE are co-endemic. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Antigen B isoforms; E. multilocularis; Echinococcoses; Echinococcus granulosus; Immunoreactivity; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; Ultrasonography,"blood group B antigen; antigen B, Echinococcus granulosus; helminth antibody; isoprotein; lipoprotein; adolescent; adult; aged; antigen antibody reaction; antigen detection; Article; child; China; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disability-adjusted life year; echinococcosis; Echinococcus granulosus; echography; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; geographic distribution; health survey; human; immunoreactivity; major clinical study; male; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; serodiagnosis; Youden index; animal; blood; echinococcosis; Echinococcus granulosus; genetics; immunology; isolation and purification; middle aged; serology; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Antibodies, Helminth; Child; China; Echinococcosis; Echinococcus granulosus; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Lipoproteins; Male; Middle Aged; Protein Isoforms; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85068899239

The molecular structure of metallomacrocycle 8 was determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The anticancer activities of metallomacrocycles 5-8 were evaluated by cytotoxicity, cell cycle analysis, and related protein expression. Metallomacrocycle 7 showed the highest cytotoxicity in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, apoptotic HepG2 cells were analyzed when metallomacrocycle 7 was treated. Our results suggest that metallomacrocycle 7 induces liver cancer cell death by increasing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and that it has potential use as an agent for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.",,,2-s2.0-85067666884

Obesity-associated chronic low-grade systemic inflammation is considered a focal point and a therapeutic target in insulin resistance and metabolic diseases. We evaluate the effect of Poncirus fructus (PF) on insulin resistance and its mechanism based on inflammatory responses in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and then administered PF. Body weight, epididymal fat and liver weight, glucose, lipid, insulin, and histologic characteristics were evaluated to determine the erffect of PF on insulin resistance by analyzing the proportion of macrophages in epididymal fat and liver and measured inflammatory gene expression. PF administration significantly decreased the fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, total-cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The epididymal fat tissue and liver showed a significant decrease of fat accumulation in histological analysis. PF significantly reduced the number of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), F4/80+ Kupffer cells, and CD68+ Kupffer cells, increased the proportion of M2 phenotype macrophages, and decreased the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that PF could be used to improve insulin resistance through modulation of macrophage-mediated inflammation and enhance glucose and lipid metabolism. ? 2019 by the authors.

Therefore, a new strategy for CRC treatment is needed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of cannabidiol (CBD), one of the components of the cannabis plant, in overcoming oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells. We established oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines, DLD-1 R and colo205 R, in CRC DLD-1 and colo205 cells. Autophagic cell death was induced when oxaliplatin-resistant cells were treated with both oxaliplatin and CBD. Additionally, phosphorylation of nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) was increased in oxaliplatin-resistant cells compared to that in parent cells. Combined treatment with oxaliplatin and CBD reduced phospho-NOS3 levels and nitric oxide (NO) production and resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reducing the levels of superoxide dismutase 2, an antioxidant present in the mitochondria, causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, these results suggest that elevated phosphorylation of NOS3 is essential for oxaliplatin resistance. The combination of oxaliplatin and CBD decreased NOS3 phosphorylation, which resulted in autophagy, by inducing the overproduction of ROS through mitochondrial dysfunction, thus overcoming oxaliplatin resistance. ? 2019 by the authors.

Methods Twenty consecutive drug-na?ve RLS patients, 20 age- and sex-matched patients with PLMD and healthy controls were enrolled. Questionnaires evaluating sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Insomnia Severity Index), depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), and psychosomatic symptoms (SCL-90-R) were administered. Polysomnography was performed in the patients with PLMD or RLS. Results The mean age of the subjects was 57.5 ± 10.9 years, and half of the subjects were male. Compared with the patients with RLS, the patients with PLMD exhibited a reduced total sleep time (276.6 ± 41.3 vs. 322.4 ± 42.9, p = 0.04) and a decreased proportion of REM sleep (12.5 ± 6.6 vs. 17.8 ± 7.8, p = 0.009). The patients with RLS exhibited higher SCL-90-R T-scores on the somatization (post hoc p < 0.001), obsessive-compulsive (post hoc p < 0.001), interpersonal sensitivity (post hoc p = 0.003), anxiety (post hoc p = 0.005), and psychoticism (post hoc p = 0.004) domains than the controls. Compared to the controls, the patients with PLMD exhibited higher SCL-90-R scores only in hostility (post hoc p = 0.016). Somatization in the RLS patients was significantly worse than that in the PLMD patients (post hoc p = 0.003). Conclusions The results of our study demonstrate that psychosomatic distress is greater in RLS patients and lesser in PLMD patients.

Recently, we observed a higher incidence of coronary lesions in KD patients with high anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer. Therefore, we hypothesized that KD patients diagnosed with concurrent streptococcal infection have poor prognosis, with respect to treatment response and development of coronary artery lesions. Methods: A retrospective review was performed in 723 patients with KD who were admitted to 2 major hospitals between June 2010 and September 2017. Results: Among 723 patients with KD, 11 initially showed an elevated ASO titer (>320 IU/mL) or elevated follow-up ASO titer after treatment. Of these patients, 5 showed no response to the first intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, 3 had abnormalities of the coronary arteries. This is a significantly higher proportion of patients with a high ASO titer (n=3,27.3%) than those with a normal ASO titer (n=53 [7.4%], P=0.047). A severe clinical course was seen in 81.8% of patients in the high ASO group versus 14.5% of patients in the normal ASO group. Conclusion: It is not certain whether acute streptococcal infection may cause KD, but this study revealed that KD with high ASO titers showed higher rates of severe clinical course. It may be helpful to analyze concurrent streptococcal infection in patients with a severe clinical course. ? 2019 by The Korean Pediatric Society.",Antistreptolysin; Coronary disease; Kawasaki disease; Streptococcal infections,alanine aminotransferase; albumin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; antistreptolysin; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; cefotaxime; clarithromycin; creatinine; immunoglobulin; methylprednisolone; oseltamivir; Article; blood cell count; cervical lymphadenopathy; child; clinical feature; clinical outcome; coronary artery aneurysm; coronary artery disease; disease association; echocardiography; edema; erythema; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; fever; follow up; human; infant; leukocyte differential count; major clinical study; male; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; prognosis; rash; respiratory virus; retrospective study; school child; Streptococcus infection; Streptococcus pyogenes; streptolysin titer; treatment response; urinalysis,2-s2.0-85069716593

F-DNA vaccination induced CD8 T cells and RSV neutralizing Abs, whereas F-VLP elicited higher levels of IgG2a isotype and neutralizing Abs, and germinal center B cells, contributing to protection by controlling lung viral loads after RSV challenge. However, mice that were immunized with F-DNA displayed weight loss and pulmonary histopathology, and induced F specific CD8 T cell responses and recruitment of monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the lungs.

It was demonstrated that EFAD suppresses lipid accumulation and improves insulin resistance (IR) caused by Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in in-vitro experiments using the 3T3- L1 cell. In in-vivo tests, C57BL/6 mice were fed EFAD at 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight (BW) for four weeks after the mice were fed HFD for 15 weeks to induce obesity. EFAD significantly suppressed the elevation of BW and improved impaired glucose tolerance in obese mice. Additionally, this study showed that EFAD has an ameliorating effect on obesity-induced cognitive disorder with behavioral tests. The effect of EFAD on peripheral-IR improvement was confirmed by serum analysis and western blotting in peripheral tissues. Additionally, EFAD showed an ameliorating effect on HFD-induced oxidative stress, impaired cholinergic system and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are interrelated symptoms of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer’s disease and central nervous system (CNS)-IR in brain tissue. Furthermore, we confirmed that EFAD improves CNS-IR by confirming the IR-related factors in brain tissue.

We compared the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of voglibose plus metformin (vogmet) with metformin monotherapy in drug-na?ve newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: A total of 187 eligible patients aged 20 to 70 years, with a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.0% to 11.0%, were randomized into either vogmet or metformin treatments for 24 weeks. A change in the HbA1c level from baseline was measured at week 24. Results: The reduction in the levels of HbA1c was ?1.62%±0.07% in the vogmet group and ?1.31%±0.07% in the metformin group (P=0.003), and significantly more vogmet-treated patients achieved the target HbA1c levels of <6.5% (P=0.002) or <7% (P=0.039). Glycemic variability was also significantly improved with vogmet treatment, estimated by M-values (P=0.004). Gastrointestinal adverse events and hypoglycemia (%) were numerically lower in the vogmet-treated group. Moreover, a significant weight loss was observed with vogmet treatment compared with metformin (?1.63 kg vs. ?0.86 kg, P=0.039). Conclusion: Vogmet is a safe antihyperglycemic agent that controls blood glucose level effectively, yields weight loss, and is superior to metformin in terms of various key glycemic parameters without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

Given that cardiovascular disease is the second leading cause of death in Korea, it is urgent that CR programs be developed. In 2008, the Government of Korea implemented CR programs at 11 university hospitals as part of its Regional Cardio-Cerebrovascular Center Project, and three additional medical facilities will be added in 2019. In addition, owing to the promotion of CR nationwide and the introduction of CR insurance benefits, 40 medical institutions nationwide have begun CR programs even as a growing number of medical institutions are preparing to offer CR. The purpose of this research was to develop evidence-based CPGs to support CR implementation in Korea. Methods This study is based on an analysis of CPGs elsewhere in the world, an extensive literature search, a systematic analysis of multiple randomized control trials, and a CPG management, development, and assessment committee comprised of 33 authors-primarily rehabilitation specialists, cardiologists, and thoracic surgeons in 21 university hospitals and two general hospitals. Twelve consultants, primarily rehabilitation, sports medicine, and preventive medicine specialists, CPG experts, nurses, physical therapists, clinical nutritionists, and library and information experts participated in the research and development of these CPGs. After the draft guidelines were developed, three rounds of public hearings were held with staff members from relevant academic societies and stakeholders, after which the guidelines were further reviewed and modified. Principal Conclusions CR involves a more cost-effective use of healthcare resources relative to that of general treatments, and the exercise component of CR lowers cardiovascular mortality and readmission rates, regardless of the type of coronary heart disease and type and setting of CR. Individualized CR programs should be considered together with various factors, including differences in heart function and lifestyle, and doing so will boost participation and adherence with the CR program, ultimately meeting the final goals of the program, namely reducing the recurrence of myocardial infarction and mortality rates. ? 2019 by Korean Academy of Rehabilitation Medicine.",Acute coronary syndrome; Cardiac rehabilitation; Clinical practice guidelines; Mortality; Secondary prevention,,2-s2.0-85068346551

The pattern identification in this trial will be diagnosed from body constitution questionnaire (BCQ) with a more objective diagnosis of it but this method still needs a more concrete scientific basis. Glycoproteins are well-known to be associated with diseases (especially cancers) so glycoproteomics can be applied to differentiate pattern identification types of lung cancer patients. Thus, for the first time proteomics approach will be applied to the pattern identification by comparing BCQ assessment in order to establish a scientific basis with clinical proteomics for precision medicine.Methods:This observational trial will at first diagnose the pattern identification types of lung cancer patients with BCQ assessment and then elucidate their relationships with proteomics. Blood samples will be collected before surgery along with clinical information of participants. The patients' pattern identification in TKM will be diagnosed from BCQ assessment. Then, lung cancer patients will be divided and pooled into 3 lung cancer entire (LCE) groups according to their pattern identification types (Xu, Stasis, or Gentleness). Three lung cancer representative (LCR) groups will be selected and pooled from each LCE group by selecting those with the same control factors. The 3 LCE groups and the 3 LCR groups from lung cancer patients will be independently analyzed through the glycoproteomics approach based on the patients' pattern identification. Glycoproteins from the 6 groups will be identified through proteomics approach and then categorized for analysis.Discussion:This study intends to diagnose pattern identification of patients in TKM with BCQ assessment and proteomics approach. The identification of the glycoproteins in each group will lead to the scientific foundation of personalized medicine in TKM according to patients' pattern identification for lung cancer therapy. We intend to(1) diagnose the pattern identification types of lung cancer patients with BCQ under the framework of TKM;(2) evaluate BCQ assessment with glycoproteomics approach for precision medicine.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03384680.

Its gum created from white resin is known to have therapeutic effects. However, the study on the anti-cancer pathway is very limited in human pancreatic cancer cells. thus, we investigated the changes in overall oncologic gene expression when treated BC in AsPC-1 cells. In this paper, we aimed to see how BC can be used to decrease cell viability with full explanation of gene expression in AsPC-1. We used MTT, microarray, and qRT-PCR to confirm our thesis. Results showed that BC inhibited cell viability in AsPC-1 by more than two-fold, which implies that BC has cell cytotoxic effects. Also, BC induced early and late apoptosis when treated for 24h on the pancreatic cancer cells. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed by microarray for demonstrated apoptotic effects at the mRNA level. The number of genes were related to participation in the oxidation-reduction process or signaling pathways. The signal pathway was verified by western blotting mainly STAT3 but also JAK, Src, ERK, JNK, and Akt. The results prove that stress signaling such as cytokines were regulated by BC stimulation. Therefore, our findings support the show that differentially expressed genes in BC-treated represent anti- cancer effects in pancreatic cancer and this has the potential for further understanding of the entire mechanism of cancer and its treatment. ? 2019, The Korean BioChip Society and Springer.",Apoptosis; Boswellia carterii; Cytokines; Microarray; Pancreatic cancer,Cell death; Diseases; Functional polymers; Microarrays; Plants (botany); Anticancer activities; Boswellia carterii; Cytokines; Differentially expressed gene; Inflammatory disease; Oxidation reduction; Pancreatic cancers; Therapeutic effects; Gene expression; antineoplastic agent; boswellia sacra extract; fluorescein isothiocyanate; Janus kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase; plant extract; protein kinase B; protein tyrosine kinase; STAT3 protein; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; AsPC-1 cell line; bioassay; Boswellia sacra; BxPC-3 cell line; cell proliferation; cell stimulation; cell viability; cellular stress response; controlled study; cytotoxicity; fluorescein isothiocyanate assay; gene expression; gene ontology; human; human cell; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; MIA PaCa-2 cell line; microarray analysis; mRNA expression level; MTT assay; necrosis; oxidation reduction reaction; pancreas cancer; proapoptotic activity; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; stress; therapy effect; upregulation; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85067886497

Investigating region specific epidemiologic factors associated with NF is important for establishing appropriate treatment strategies. This multicenter study was done to provide an update of the microbial etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of NF in Korea. Materials and methods A retrospective cohort of adult patients with NF was established using patient data from 13 general hospitals between January 2012 and December 2015 in Korea. We evaluated microbial etiology and clinical characteristics to identify risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality; analyses were performed using binary logistic regression models. Results A total of 161 patients with NF were included. The most common underlying disease was diabetes mellitus (66 cases, 41.0%). A total of 148 organisms were isolated from 119 (73.9%) patients. Enteric Gram-negative organisms (36 patients) were the most common pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (30 patients) and streptococci (28 patients). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was identified in 6.2% (10/161) of patients. Of 37 enteric Gram-negative isolates tested, 26 (70.3%) isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. The in-hospital mortality rate was 22.4%. Intensive care unit admission, septic shock, and Gram-negative organism infections were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, and surgery was not a favorable prognostic factor. Conclusions As initial empirical antibiotics, glycopeptides against MRSA and broad-spectrum antibiotics against third-generation cephalosporin-resistant organisms should be considered for patients with community-onset NF in Korea. ? 2019 Kim et al.

Only a few cases that sporadically occurred have been reported worldwide. The research investigating the pathogenesis and patterns of CODAS inheritance is still ongoing. There is no satisfactory treatment for this rare genetic disease yet. Due to the lack of curative medical treatment, rehabilitation could play a major role in treatment for genetic disease.Patient concerns:To our best knowledge, the 2 children described in this study are the only CODAS syndromes siblings reported in the world so far. These Korean siblings show highly distinctive features consisting of developmental delay, cataracts, vulnerability to tooth decay, epiphyseal dysplasia, and anomalous ears.Diagnoses:CODAS syndrome.Interventions:Comprehensive long-term rehabilitation treatment during 5 years.Outcomes:We report on the progress of the comprehensive long-term rehabilitation treatment at 5-year follow-up. Their fine motor and language skills development improved similarly to that of same-aged children. We observed the positive effect of rehabilitation on the quality of life.Lessons:The therapy of genetic disorders is challenging for pediatric neurologists and pediatric physiatrists.

Moreover, it is easily misdiagnosed as malignant hepatic tumor in patients at risk of malignancy. Its key finding is the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland. When IAA from AHF is suspected, biopsy should be considered to avoid unnecessary surgery. Herein, we report 2 cases of IAA from AHF.Patient concerns:A 59-year-old woman was admitted due to a 1.5-cm hypoechoic nodule in the right hepatic lobe detected on ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance due to chronic hepatitis B. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to evaluate the hepatic mass. Another 75-year-old woman was admitted due to rectal adenocarcinoma detected on colonoscopy. Contrast-enhanced CT depicted a 2.5-cm mass in the right hepatic lobe.Diagnosis:In case 1, CT and MRI showed a 1.5-cm subcapsular mass in the right hepatic lobe with typical findings of HCC in a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The mass was confirmed as IAA from AHF after the laparoscopic surgery. In case 2, CT showed advanced rectal malignancy and a 2.5-cm poorly enhancing mass in the right hepatic lobe. The tentative diagnosis was hepatic metastasis. However, based on the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland during preoperative review, the presumed diagnosis was changed to IAA from AHF, which was confirmed on biopsy.Interventions:The hepatic mass connected with the right adrenal gland was laparoscopically resected in case 1. Laparoscopic lower anterior resection for rectal malignancy and percutaneous biopsy for the hepatic mass were performed in case 2.Outcomes:The first patient had an uneventful recovery, without recurrence on the 3-year follow-up CT. The second patient had an uneventful postoperative course and has been alive for 12 months postoperatively without pathologically proven IAA changes on follow-up CT.Lessons:When hepatic mass is found adjacent to the right adrenal gland on imaging, the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland should be investigated.

This study examined changes in doctors' behaviors in response to monetary incentives within health care payment systems in a ceteris paribus setting. Methods An online experiment was developed to analyze the effect of monetary incentives similar to fee-for-service (FFS) and capitation (CAP) on doctors' prescription patterns. In the first session, no monetary values were presented. In the second session conducted 1 week later, doctors were randomly assigned to one of two monetary incentive groups (FFS group: n = 25, CAP group: n = 25). In all sessions, doctors were presented with 10 cases and asked to determine the type and number of treatments. Results In the first session with no monetary incentives, there was no significant difference between the FFS and CAP groups in the number of treatments. When monetary incentives were provided, doctors in the CAP group prescribed fewer treatments than the FFS group. The perceived severity of the cases did not change significantly between sessions and between groups. linear mixed-effects regression model indicated the treatment choices were influenced by monetary incentives, but not by the perceived severity of the patient's symptoms. Conclusion The monetary values incentivized the doctors' treatment choices, but not their professional evaluation of patients. Monetary values designed within health care systems influence the doctor's decisions in the form of external rewards, in addition to occupational values, and can thus be adjusted by more effective incentives. ? 2019 Lee et al.",,acupuncture; adult; article; clinical article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; experimental study; female; health care system; health insurance; human; male; prescription; randomized controlled trial; reward,2-s2.0-85067086239

However, the results have been inconsistent. Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between this promoter polymorphism of the TNF-α gene and the risk of asthma. Methods: Fifty case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis which provided 17,937 controls and 9961 asthma patients. The pooled p-value, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to investigate the strength of the association of this polymorphism of the TNF-α gene with the risk of asthma. The meta-analysis was carried out by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Results: The results of our meta-analysis revealed that the TNF-α polymorphism (-308, G/A) was strongly associated with the risk of asthma (p < 0.05 in the allelic, dominant, and recessive models, respectively). In further analyses, based on age group and ethnicity, we observed this association for all subpopulations examined (p < 0.05 in allelic, dominant, and recessive models, respectively). Conclusion: This large-scale meta-analysis supports a strong association between the TNF-α gene promoter polymorphism (-308G/A) and the development to asthma in both children and adults. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",asthma; meta-analysis; polymorphism; TNF-α; tumor necrosis factor,"tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor; age; Article; asthma; case control study; controlled study; ethnicity; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk; human; meta analysis (topic); promoter region; risk assessment; adolescent; adult; asthma; child; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; male; meta analysis; metabolism; middle aged; odds ratio; promoter region; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adolescent; Adult; Asthma; Case-Control Studies; Child; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Risk Factors; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85066855606

The present study investigated the prognostic implications of pre-therapeutic expression of ABC transporters and CSC markers in patients with colon cancer (CC) who received adjuvant 5?fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin combination therapy (FOLFOX-4). The immunohistochemical expression of 3 ABC transporters, including ABC subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2), ABCC3 and ABC subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), and 3 CSC markers, including sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, were determined in 164 CC tissues from patients with stage III CC, who underwent postoperative FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy. The association between the protein expression and patients' prognoses was statistically analyzed. ABCG2 was associated with favorable overall survival rate (OS; P=0.001), and ABCC2, ABCG2 and SOX2 were associated with increased disease-free survival rate (DFS; P=0.001, 0.002 and 0.013, respectively). In multivariate analyses, ABCG2 was an independent prognostic factor for OS [hazard ratio (HR)=2.877; P=0.046], and ABCC2 and SOX2 were independent prognostic factors for DFS (HR=2.831; P=0.014; HR=2.558, P=0.020, respectively).

Methods: We evaluated all Koreans born between 1942 and 1946 who received a 66-year lifetime transition period health examination and regular biennial general and cancer screenings between 2008 and 2012. These patients were observed until December 31, 2015. The Lifetime Transition Period Health Examination version of the Korean Frailty Index (THE frailty index) was used to examine adverse geriatric outcomes based on levels of frailty. THE frailty index scores were used to classify participants as “robust” (0–2), “pre-frail” (3–4), or “frail” (more than 5). The main outcomes included the risks of all-cause mortality, long-term care facility institutionalization, and hip fracture. Results: Among 725,759 Korean men and women, the prevalence of frail and pre-frail conditions was 3.4% and 26.6%, respectively. After an average of 4.4?years of follow-up, frail older persons had significantly higher mortality rates [men: hazard ratio (HR) 2.031 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.894–2.178); women: HR 2.092 (95% CI 1.920–2.279)], long-term care facility institutionalization [men: HR 2.997 (95% CI 2.750–3.268); women: HR 3.057 (95% CI 2.866–3.261)], and hip fracture [men: HR 2.230 (95% CI 1.854–2.681); women: HR 2.356 (95% CI 2.086–2.660)] than those of robust older persons.

This study investigated whether the intake of lactobacillus fermented Saccharina japonica (FSJ) extract improved the cognitive function during working memory processing and whether biomarkers were associated with task performance. Methods: Eligible participants were assigned to either a control group or an experimental group by computerized randomization. Participants were asked to take either 2 capsules, once a day for 4 weeks of lactobacillus FSJ for the experimental group or placebo control capsules for the control group. The cognitive function was determined using the Beck depression inventory (BDI), Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS), operation-word span task and Raven's test-based quantitative EEG test. Levels of amyloid-β, superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the serum using the ELISA were also measured. Results: There was no significant difference between these two groups in all cognitive function tests using the independent sample t-test. However, the experimental group showed a significant difference in the correct answer percentage, concentration and left and right brain activity of space perception as assessed by the Raven test-based quantitative EEG test by a paired-sample t-test. Biochemical measurements showed, a slightly decreasing trend in amyloid-β, whereas SOD level was not significantly different between groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: These results suggest that FSJ may have the potential to improve cognitive function as evaluated by the Raven's test via, regulation of SOD antioxidant system. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of the safety of FSJ and its potential to improve memory. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH",Amyloid-β; Cognitive function; Lactobacillus fermented Saccharina japonica; Randomized controlled trial; Superoxide,amyloid beta protein; biological marker; placebo; plant extract; Saccharina japonica extract; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; biochemical analysis; brain function; clinical article; cognition; cognitive function test; controlled study; depth perception; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; Lactobacillus; male; microcapsule; nonhuman; parallel design; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; task performance; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; working memory,2-s2.0-85065098811

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and expenditure on complementary medicine in patients with breast cancer who experienced treatment-related side effects. Design and setting: Two datasets were analyzed: 1) a 2017 survey on direct and indirect costs for treatment-related side effects, which was completed by 100 patients with stage 0-IV breast cancer, and 2) a Korean representative cross-sectional survey (Patient Survey 2014) that examined the prevalence of integrative medicine in 41 patients with breast cancer. Main outcome measures: The direct and indirect costs for treatment-related side effects. Results: In the first dataset, the mean total direct medical cost for complementary medicine was US$1,584 and the mean indirect cost was US$6,988 per patient per year. Some patients (6%) visited non-medical institutions to utilize complementary medicine and additionally spent US$460 per patient per year. Approximately one-third of participants reported a substantial-to-heavy financial burden for using complementary medicine. However, only 17% of patients got information about complementary medicine through their physician. In the second dataset, 49% of patients with breast cancer who were discharged from Korean Medicine hospitals in Patient Survey 2014 data indicated that integrative medicine had been used. Conclusions: Despite some complementary medicine could be reimbursed by National Health Insurance in Korea, a considerable number of patients reported an economic burden associated with their use of complementary medicine. Strategies for guiding patients to receive evidence-based and cost-effective complementary medicine are needed. ? 2019",Breast cancer; Complementary medicine; Cost of illness; Drug-related side effects and adverse reactions; Productivity; Survey,acupuncture; adult; alternative medicine; anus disease; anxiety; arthritis; Article; breast cancer; cancer staging; constipation; cross-sectional study; depression; distress syndrome; edema; electroacupuncture; epistaxis; fatigue; female; hair loss; health care cost; health survey; herbal medicine; hospital discharge; hot flush; human; kinesiotherapy; major clinical study; moxibustion; nausea; pain; physician; physiotherapy; prevalence; side effect; skin disease; South Korea; tooth pain; vomiting; adverse drug reaction; alternative medicine; breast tumor; economics; health care cost; integrative medicine; middle aged; Breast Neoplasms; Complementary Therapies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Female; Health Care Costs; Health Expenditures; Humans; Integrative Medicine; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Republic of Korea,2-s2.0-85065056409

We provide a clinical analysis of renal function after adult ITx. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 8 adult ITx patients who survived for at least 6 months between 2004 and 2018. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)measurements were performed at baseline, at 3 and 6 months post-transplantation, and yearly. The median follow-up duration was 53.5 months. Results: All cases were isolated ITx; 3 received living-donor ITx, and 5 received deceased-donor ITx. The mean baseline GFR was 97 mL/min/1.73 m2. The GFR had decreased by more than 50% of baseline at 1 year post-transplant. Renal dysfunction was observed in 4 patients. Two patients developed acute kidney injury due to acute rejection and sepsis. One of these patients fully recovered renal function, but the second patient died. Another 2 patients developed chronic kidney disease and required hemodialysis (HD)within 6 and 3 years, respectively. The first living-donor ITx patient lost renal function progressively over 6 years after ITx. She received a renal graft from the same living donor as for the ITx after 3 years of HD. The other patient (deceased-donor ITx)received a kidney from his daughter at 5 months after HD. Conclusions: To obtain an accurate assessment of renal function, frequent direct measurements of GFR should be performed to facilitate early diagnosis of renal impairment and to determine subsequent strategies to improve renal function after ITx. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,basiliximab; daclizumab; mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor; tacrolimus; thymocyte antibody; acute graft rejection; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; Article; body weight gain; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; deceased donor; drug dose reduction; early diagnosis; end stage renal disease; female; follow up; glomerulus filtration rate; hemodialysis; human; intestine transplantation; kidney function; kidney graft; kidney transplantation; living donor; male; middle aged; patient isolation; priority journal; retrospective study; sepsis; survival rate; treatment outcome; intestine; kidney; kidney disease; pathophysiology; transplantation; young adult; Adult; Aged; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Intestines; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85065022708

However, whether the effect of afatinib on T790M acquisition differs from that of gefitinib when used clinically as first-line therapy remains unclear. To reaffirm the preclinical efficacy of afatinib on T790M-positive lung cancer cells, H1975 cells and established PC-9 cells resistant to gefitinib and erlotinib by T790M were used. In total, 398 patients with second biopsy at progression with stage IIIB/IV non–small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation, treated with afatinib or gefitinib as first-line therapy, were retrospectively reviewed. Propensity score matching was used to balance covariates. Afatinib inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells with low T790M allele frequencies, which are resistant to gefitinib, but not those with high T790M allele frequencies. Afatinib and gefitinib showed similar efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) (11.5 vs 13.4 months, P =.08) and overall survival (OS) (29.3 vs 28.5 months, P =.76). T790M patients had better PFS and OS than those without T790M. There was no significant difference in the cumulative T790M acquisition ratio over time between afatinib and gefitinib (48.8% vs 59.3%, P =.317). The median time to acquire T790M was 12.9 months for afatinib and 15.7 months for gefitinib (P =.342). Although afatinib inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells with low T790M allele frequencies in preclinical studies, this could not be translated into clinical efficacy in terms of lowering the rate or delaying the time of T790M acquisition. ? 2019 The Authors",,afatinib; gefitinib; adult; aged; Article; cell viability; cell viability assay; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; flow cytometry; gene frequency; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; immunofluorescence; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; MTT assay; mutational analysis; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; progression free survival; propensity score,2-s2.0-85064663358

These symptoms could be alleviated by acupuncture. Although several lines of evidence in Western countries suggest that acupuncture has a beneficial effect on symptoms in breast cancer survivors, few relevant studies have been conducted in Korean patients. This pilot study assessed the feasibility of acupuncture for a variety of treatment-related symptoms in Korean breast cancer survivors. Method: From October 2015 to March 2016, we recruited patients who had undergone treatment for breast cancer and subsequently reported symptoms, including aromatase inhibitor-related knee pain, vasomotor symptoms, insomnia, sexual dysfunction and post-mastectomy pain in the chest wall or shoulder. The women received 4 weeks of symptom-specific acupuncture followed by a further 4 weeks of follow-up to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture for this indication, and its impact on common and symptom-specific outcome variables. Results: Eight study participants were recruited over a period of 6 months, six of whom completed the planned acupuncture treatment and follow-up assessments. A total of 78 acupuncture sessions were performed. We found that acupuncture was feasible, with only six minor self-limiting acupuncture-related adverse events. Most of the women felt that they had benefitted from participation in the study. The preliminary analysis indicated improvement in common symptom-specific outcomes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that acupuncture is feasible, but low recruitment rates should be considered when considering future acupuncture research in Korean breast cancer survivors. Rigorous evaluation of this symptomatic treatment strategy is now needed in the Korean population. ?

Although recent data indicate that H2B monoubiquitination is strongly connected with tumor progression and regulation, the implications of this modification in lung adenocarcinoma are relatively unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated the clinical implication of H2B monoubiquitination and the potential role of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-interacting protein (TRAIP) in regulating its modification in lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that H2B monoubiquitination was significantly downregulated in 68 human lung adenocarcinoma patient samples compared to their normal adjacent tissues. Depletion of TRAIP by specific siRNA treatment markedly decreased ionizing radiation (IR)-induced H2B monoubiquitination. In addition, deletion mutants without RING domain or C-terminus of TRAIP diminished the ability to induce H2B monoubiquitination at lysine 120. Notably, the nuclear expression of TRAIP was positively related with H2B monoubiquitination levels in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, statistical analysis indicated that low levels of both TRAIP and H2B monoubiquitination, not each alone, in patients with lung adenocarcinoma were strongly correlated with poor survival. Taken together, these results suggest that TRAIP is a novel regulator of H2B monoubiquitination in DNA damage response and cancer development in lung adenocarcinoma. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Design: A single center study. Randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind trial Setting: Fifty-six subjects, who had more than 10 acne inflammatory lesions each, were randomly allocated into the CBT or placebo groups and took 5 g CBT extract (CBT group) or 5 g placebo extract (control group), respectively, three times a day for 8 weeks. Pattern identification, change of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions, temperature of the facial points, serum cortisol level, serum dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate level, number rating scale, investigator global assessment (IGA), and severity score on the Korean acne grading system were measured. Main outcome measure: mean change of the inflammatory acne lesions. Results: After CBT/placebo administration, the percentage count of inflammatory lesions in subjects was significantly reduced in the CBT group when compared with the control group. The other outcomes showed no significant difference between the two groups. On pattern identification, subjects with the Wind-Heat pattern (風熱型, WHP) and Disharmony of the thoroughfare and conception vessels pattern (衝任不調型, DTCVP) tended show better effect than those with other patterns. Conclusions: CBT is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of acne vulgaris, linked to inhibition of inflammatory lesions and facial heat.

Although these extracts contain various bioactive compounds, their applications are generally limited to a few previously known diseases. To effectively expand their use for the treatment of other conditions, systematic analysis should be conducted for repurposing. Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the new therapeutic efficacies of the Platycodon grandiflorum and ginseng extract using the CMAP-based gene expression analysis. Methods: In the present study, we analyzed the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from extracts as the basis for drug repurposing. Cells were treated with extracts or single compounds derived from nine natural products. DEG analysis indicated that the gene expression patterns of cells treated with P. grandiflorum and ginseng extracts were highly similar to those of cells treated with different types of Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. To identify the new mechanism of these extracts, we carried out cell viability assay, TUNEL assay, HDAC enzyme activity assay and immunoblot analysis. Results: In vitro experiments at the dose of 50 ?g/ml of each extract did not affect cell death rate but significantly inhibited HDAC activity. Each extract was found to inhibit HDAC enzymatic activity and induce the expression of the p21. Furthermore, our results revealed that each extract stimulated cell death and inhibited cell proliferation. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the HDAC-inhibiting activity of P. grandiflorum and ginseng extracts and further validate the effectiveness of DEG similarity-based repurposing of natural products. ? 2019",Differential expression pattern analysis; Ginseng; HDAC inhibitors; Platycodon grandiflorum; Repurposing,"ginseng extract; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase inhibitor; natural product; Platycodon grandiflorum extract; protein p21; protein p53; vorinostat; biological product; histone deacetylase inhibitor; plant extract; transcriptome; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; cell viability assay; comparative study; controlled study; drug repositioning; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; gene expression profiling; human; human cell; immunoblotting; in vitro study; nonhuman; oriental medicine; Platycodon; priority journal; protein expression; TUNEL assay; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug repositioning; genetics; lung tumor; Panax; pathology; procedures; tumor cell line; Biological Products; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Drug Repositioning; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Panax; Plant Extracts; Platycodon; Transcriptome",2-s2.0-85063903510

The ER stress response, which protects cells from cytotoxic proteins such as unfolded proteins, is related to several diseases including inflammation. In this study, we investigated the effect of ER stress on the pathophysiology of otitis media with effusion (OME). Methods: Thirty-nine pediatric patients who were diagnosed with OME and underwent ventilation tube insertion were enrolled in this study. Exudate from the middle ear cavity was collected through ventilation insertion, and ER stress gene expression was analyzed via real-time polymerase chain reactions(PCR). Results: There were no significant differences in ER stress-related mRNA expression between effusion culture-positive and culture-negative groups (p > 0.05). Expression of the C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) was higher in the otitis-prone group than in the non-otitis-prone group (p < 0.05). The most common type of fluid was mucoid, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1α expression was higher in serous fluid than in mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent fluid (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Endoplasmic reticulum stress-related responses are activated in pediatric OME patients, and specific ER-stress related pathways are related to both the characteristics of fluid and the frequency of OME. Thus, ER stress-related responses affect the pathophysiology of OME in pediatric OME patients. ? 2019",Endoplasmic reticulum stress; Otitis media with effusion; Pathophysiology,"CCAAT enhancer binding protein; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; inositol; messenger RNA; DDIT3 protein, human; ERN1 protein, human; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; messenger RNA; protein serine threonine kinase; ribonuclease; Article; bacterium culture; cell interaction; child; clinical article; effusion; endoplasmic reticulum stress; female; gene expression; genetic analysis; human; incidence; infant; male; middle ear; otitis media; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; pediatrics; prevalence; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; suppurative otitis media; endoplasmic reticulum stress; genetics; metabolism; middle ear ventilation; newborn; preschool child; secretory otitis media; Child; Child, Preschool; Ear, Middle; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Endoribonucleases; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Ear Ventilation; Otitis Media with Effusion; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Transcription Factor CHOP",2-s2.0-85062811233

We hypothesized that patients participating in clinical trials would achieve better survival outcomes than those not enrolled in trials. We assessed whether the trial effect can improve survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer patients who received palliative chemotherapy from January 2010 to December 2012. All patients in this study received fluoropyrimidine and platinum as the first-line palliative chemotherapy. Patients participating in clinical trials were matched 1:1 with patients not enrolled in trial based on propensity-score. Results: A total of 229 patients were identified, 83 (36.2%) among them participated in 14 clinical trials for advanced gastric cancer. The number of patients enrolled in phase I, II and III trials were 10, 54 and 19, respectively. The median overall survival of the total study patients was 13.0?months (95% confidence interval, 10.7–15.3 months). In the propensity-score matched population, a total of 78 matched pairs of patients were generated. The median overall survival of the 78 patients who participated in the clinical trials was 6 months longer than that of patients not enrolled in trials, although this benefit was marginally significant (15 months vs 9 months, hazard ratio, 0.709; p?=?0.068). Participation in clinical trials was a significant factor to predict better overall survival in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.533, p?=?0.001).

Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified more than 100 genetic variants for blood pressure traits and hypertension. However, the interactions between these genetic variants and environmental factors have not been systematically investigated. Therefore, we examined the interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors in blood pressure traits using the genetic risk score (GRS). Two Korean community-based cohorts, Cohort I (KARE; N = 8,840) and Cohort II (CAVAS; N = 9,599), were used for this study, and GRSs were calculated from 42 GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were validated for their association in these cohorts. We calculated GRSs in both ways by considering the effect sizes of each SNP (weighted GRS) and not considering the effect sizes (unweighted GRS). The unweighted GRS was strongly associated with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and hypertension (p = 9.03 × 10 –47, p = 9.41 × 10 –48, and p = 3.22 × 10 –55 by meta-analysis, respectively) and the weighted GRS showed the similar results. The environmental factors of body mass index, waist circumference, and drinking status were significantly associated with blood pressure traits, and the interaction between these factors and GRSs were examined. However, no interactions were found with?either the GRS or the individual SNPs considered for the GRS.

Background: Decision-making abilities comprise a key area of nursing practice and link nurses’ perceptions with behaviours. Introduction: Tacit knowledge is embedded within an individual and cannot be expressed or transmitted to other people in a specific form. Over time, new nurses gradually gain experience and tacit knowledge and become experts. Trust, an organizational characteristic, may serve as a potential mediator in the association between knowledge sharing and decision-making abilities among nurses. However, few studies have investigated the mediatory role of trust in this association. Method: The data were collected from 210 nurses selected via random sampling. The research instrument in the model included Knowledge-Sharing Behavior, Trust, and Clinical Decision-Making in Nursing Scale. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the collected data. Findings: The study findings showed that explicit knowledge sharing directly affects decision-making abilities, whereas tacit knowledge sharing is only associated with decision-making abilities when trust plays a mediating role. Discussion: A higher level of organizational trust can improve clinical decision-making abilities via tacit knowledge sharing. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that unlike explicit knowledge, which is shared more easily, tacit knowledge sharing does not directly lead to clinical decision-making abilities. A higher level of organizational trust leads to a stronger beneficial effect of tacit knowledge sharing on clinical decision-making abilities. Implications for nursing and health policy: These findings concerning the mediatory role of trust on the association between knowledge sharing and clinical decision-making abilities provide new knowledge that will allow nurses, managers, and researchers to support the clinical decision-making abilities of nurses. ? 2019 International Council of Nurses",Capacity Building; Clinical Decision-Making; Interpersonal; Organisational Behaviour Nursing,"article; capacity building; clinical decision making; health care policy; human; manager; mediator; nursing practice; perception; registered nurse; sampling; scientist; structural equation modeling; trust; cooperation; health personnel attitude; knowledge management; nursing staff; organization and management; organizational culture; psychology; public relations; trust; work engagement; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cooperative Behavior; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Knowledge Management; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Organizational Culture; Trust; Work Engagement",2-s2.0-85061451130

Methods: This prospective comparison study included 18 CMT type I patients and 18 age/sex-matched volunteers. Magnetic resonance imaging including DTI and axial T2-weighted Dixon sequence was performed for each subject. Region of interest analysis was independently performed by two radiologists on each side of the sciatic nerve at four levels: hamstring tendon origin (level 1), lesser trochanter of the femur (level 2), gluteus maximus tendon insertion (level 3), and mid-femur (level 4). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were calculated. The CSA of the sciatic nerve bundle was measured using axial water-only image at each level. Comparisons of DTI parameters between the two groups were performed using the two-sample t test and Mann–Whitney U test. Interobserver agreement analysis was also conducted. Results: Interobserver agreement was excellent for all DTI parameter analyses. FA was significantly lower at all four levels in CMT patients than controls. RD, MD, and CSA were significantly higher at all four levels in CMT patients. AD was significantly higher at level 2 in CMT patients. Conclusion: DTI assessment of the sciatic nerve is reproducible and can discriminate the demyelinating nerve pathology of CMT type I patients from normal nerves. The CSA of the sciatic nerve is also a potential parameter for diagnosing nerve abnormality in CMT type I patients. Key Points: ? Diffusion tensor imaging parameters of the sciatic nerve at proximal to mid-femur level revealed significant differences between the Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease patients and controls. ?

We aimed to develop and validate an operational definition of IBD cases from health insurance claims data and to examine the epidemiological features of IBD in Korea. Methods: We analyzed stratified sample data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment (2010–2016) database using 12 different definitions and applied the best definition to the entire (2007–2016) dataset. Results: The definition that combined the International Classification of Disease 10th revision code with IBD-specific medications had the best performance characteristics among the 12 tested definitions. During the 8-year study period, IBD prevalence increased from 25?345 in 2009 to 47?444 in 2016. Over that period, the prevalence of Crohn's disease increased 1.9-fold (from 16.0/100?000 in 2009 to 29.6/100?000 in 2016) and that of ulcerative colitis increased 1.6-fold (from 41.4/100?000 in 2009 to 66.0/100?000 in 2016). Similarly, the estimated incidence of Crohn's disease also increased 1.2-fold (from 2.4 to 2.9 per 100?000) and that of ulcerative colitis rose 1.3-fold (from 4.0 to 5.3 per 100?000). During the study period, the predominant increase in IBD incidence was among younger individuals, especially those aged <?30?years. Conclusion: Patients with IBD can be accurately identified using Korean insurance claims data by combining information regarding the International Classification of Disease 10th revision codes and the IBD medications used.

Methods: This study included 2208 adults undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery. Preoperative eGFR was calculated using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations. The relationships between preoperative eGFR and 90 day postoperative composite major complications were analyzed, including 90 day all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, severe acute kidney injury, respiratory and gastrointestinal complications, wound infection, sepsis, and multi-organ failure. Results: Of the 2208 included patients, 185 (8.4%) had preoperative eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 328 (14.9%) experienced postoperative major complications.

Although abusive potential of MPA was recognized, little is known about the neurotoxic potential of MPA up to now. We investigated whether MPA induces dopaminergic neurotoxicity, and whether MPA activates a specific dopamine receptor. Here, we observed that treatment with MPA resulted in dopaminergic neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. MPA treatment potentiated oxidative parameters (i.e., increases in the level of reactive oxygen species, 4-hydroxynonenal, and protein carbonyl), M1 phenotype-related microglial activity, and pro-apoptotic property (i.e., increases in Bax- and cleaved caspase-3-expressions, while a decrease in Bcl-2-expression). Moreover, treatment with MPA resulted in significant impairments in dopaminergic parameters [i.e., changes in dopamine level, dopamine turnover rate, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, dopamine transporter (DAT) expression, and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) expression], and in behavioral deficits. Both dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 and D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride protected from these neurotoxic consequences.

Previous studies indicated that the ecology of the transmitter vector (Aedes aegypti) is influenced by environmental parameters and human behavior; however, the effects of those variables on mosquito population dynamics depend on local environmental features. In this study, we identified the most important factors influencing the risk of dengue virus infection in Ecuador. The maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) was used to determine the areas with a high probability of the presence of Aedes aegypti under current and future (2050) climatic conditions, using the location of reported dengue cases and potential environmental factors. The model performance was quantified based on an accuracy assessment. Additionally, we used meteorological data from the study period in a partial least square regression (PLS-R) to predict the number of total dengue cases (TDC) and then estimated the future number of cases using the equation obtained with the PLS-R. Population density, elevation, and mean temperatures of the warmest and wettest quarters were found to be the most important variables influencing the mosquito's geographical distribution. Maximum temperature and minimum temperature were the climatic factors with the best projecting capacity in predicting the TDC in the Ecuadorian coast region. The results show a greater mosquito presence probability in populated areas, with a considerable expansion of suitable habitat across the central and southern provinces by 2050. The temporal analysis revealed that the regional dengue outbreak season goes from March to June, and the future estimation predicted that the next large outbreak would occur in 2018. These results present a good intel for solutions of reduction of dengue cases in the country. This further will allow the responsible authorities to pinpoint proper vector control measurements by province. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Aedes aegypti; Climate change; Dengue fever; Ecological model; Ecuador; Habitat suitability,Behavioral research; Climate change; Climate models; Ecosystems; Geographical distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Viruses; Aedes aegypti; Dengue fevers; Ecological modeling; Ecuador; Habitat suitability; Population distribution; accuracy assessment; climate change; climate effect; dengue fever; disease incidence; disease vector; ecological modeling; environmental factor; geographical distribution; habitat structure; infectious disease; mosquito; population dynamics; population outbreak; risk assessment; scale effect; Ecuador; Aedes aegypti; Dengue virus,2-s2.0-85063615950

Aim of the study: To evaluate the effects of SWD on chondrocyte proliferation of growth plate in adolescent female rats. Materials and methods: Female adolescent rats were allocated to one of the following four groups; SWD 100 and 300 mg/kg, recombinant human growth hormone, and vehicle for 4 days. Tetracycline was intraperitoneally injected at 48 h before sacrifice to obtain a band exhibiting fluorescence by binding newly formed bone. Bromodeoxyuridine was injected at day 2–4 to mark proliferating chondrocytes. To evaluate possible mechanisms of SWD, expressions of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in the growth plate were examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: Treatment with SWD significantly increased the number of BrdU-positive chondrocytes and the new bone formation in the proximal growth plate of tibia compared to the vehicle treated control group. SWD also increased the expression of IGF-1 and BMP-2 in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones of the growth plate. Conclusions: SWD 300 mg/kg stimulates chondrocyte proliferation and new bone formation in the growth plate. Immunohistochemical studies indicate that the effects of SWD may be due to upregulation of local IGF-1 and BMP-2 expression in the growth plate, which may be considered as a GH-dependent paracrine-autocrine pathway. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",BMP-2; Chondrocyte; Growth plate; IGF-1; Siwu decoction,"bone morphogenetic protein 2; broxuridine; Chinese drug; hematologic agent; human growth hormone; Siwu decoction; somatomedin C; tetracycline; unclassified drug; Bmp2 protein, rat; bone morphogenetic protein 2; insulin-like growth factor-1, rat; plant extract; somatomedin C; adolescent; animal experiment; Article; cell proliferation; chondrocyte; controlled study; enchondral ossification; epiphysis plate; female; growth retardation; high performance liquid chromatography; immunohistochemistry; nonhuman; ossification; protein expression; rat; upregulation; animal; biosynthesis; bone development; cell proliferation; chondrocyte; dose response; drug effect; epiphysis plate; Korean medicine; metabolism; Sprague Dawley rat; tibia; Animals; Bone Development; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Cell Proliferation; Chondrocytes; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Growth Plate; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Medicine, Korean Traditional; Plant Extracts; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tibia",2-s2.0-85062540047

This study aimed to assess the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) texture analysis (CTTA) in differentiating benign and malignant mediastinal LNs. Methods: Pathologically confirmed malignant and benign mediastinal LN samples, obtained using endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), were retrospectively reviewed, in addition to chest CT and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake positron emission tomography (PET) data. For each LN, CTTA was performed using ""AVIEW"" software (Coreline Soft, Republic of Korea) by drawing a region of interest. Results: A total of 132 LNs from 80 patients were included and classified into two groups according to pathology results: malignant (n = 61) and benign (n = 71). In EBUS, size &gt; 1 cm, round shape, heterogeneous echogenicity, and presence of coagulation necrosis sign were more prevalent in malignant than in benign LNs; length was the only feature that distinguished the two groups. Among CTTA features, compactness and normalized standard deviation (SD) showed differences between the two groups. The ability to distinguish malignant LNs was higher using high standard uptake value (SUV) on FDG PET/CT (SUVmax ? 5) and normalized SD on CTTA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.739 versus 0.742, respectively); however, normalized SD demonstrated very low sensitivity despite high specificity. Conclusions: CTTA may be helpful in distinguishing between benign and malignant LNs; however, the diagnostic value was not high. Therefore, integrated evaluation with other imaging modalities is needed. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Malignancy; Mediastinal lymph node; Texture and shape analysis,"fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adult; aged; Article; bronchial aspiration procedure; cancer staging; clinical feature; computed tomography texture analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration; female; human; major clinical study; male; mediastinum cancer; mediastinum lymph node; non small cell lung cancer; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; prevalence; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; standardized uptake value; thorax radiography; diagnostic imaging; endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy; evaluation study; lung tumor; lymph node metastasis; mediastinum; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; standards; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Mediastinum; Middle Aged; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography",2-s2.0-85066464169

In normal cells, long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1, L1) is mostly repressed by DNA methylation in its 5′ untranslated region but is activated by DNA demethylation process during tumorigenesis. p53 is indispensable for maintaining genomic stability and plays its role in controlling genomic stability by repressing retrotransposon activity. However, it is unclear whether p53 regulates expression or methylation of L1 differently depending on the mutational status of TP53. Four hundred ninety cases of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) were analyzed for their statuses in p53 expression and L1 methylation using immunohistochemistry and pyrosequencing, respectively. Whether L1 methylation and expression statuses were differently affected by types of TP53 mutants was analyzed in gastric cancer cell line. Results: By p53 immunohistochemistry, tumors were classified into 4 groups according to the intensity and extent of stained tumor nuclei. L1 methylation level was significantly higher in p53 expression group 1 than in the other groups in which L1 methylation level was similar (P < 0.001). Although L1 methylation and p53 expression statuses were associated with patient survival, multivariate analysis revealed that L1 methylation was an independent prognostic parameter. In in vitro analysis of AGS cells with the introduction of wild type or mutant types of TP53, L1 methylation level and activity were different depending on types of TP53 mutation. Conclusions: Findings suggest that L1 methylation level is affected by TP53 mutation status; although, L1 methylation status was an independent prognostic parameter in patients with AGC. Further study is required to elucidate the mechanism of how wild type or mutant p53 affects L1 activity and methylation status of L1 CpG island. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Gastric cancer; LINE-1; Methylation; Prognosis; TP53,genomic DNA; mutant protein; protein p53; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; female; gastric cancer cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; long interspersed repeat; major clinical study; male; molecular mechanics; multivariate analysis; mutational analysis; priority journal; protein analysis; protein DNA interaction; protein expression; protein function; pyrosequencing; retrospective study; stomach cancer; tumor classification; very elderly; wild type,2-s2.0-85065718675

Although incretin hormones are immediately secreted in response to environmental stimuli, such as nutrients, cytokines, and LPS, but studies of glucose-induced incretin secretion in an inflamed state are limited. We hypothesized that GI inflammatory conditions induce over-stimulated incretin secretion via an increase of glucose-sensing receptors. To confirm our hypothesis, we observed the alteration of glucose-induced incretin secretion and glucose-sensing receptors in a GI inflammatory mouse model, and we treated a conditioned media (Mφ 30%) containing inflammatory cytokines in intestinal epithelium cells and enteroendocrine L-like NCI-H716 cells. In GI-inflamed mice, we observed that over-stimulated incretin secretion and insulin release in response to glucose and sodium glucose cotransporter (Sglt1) was increased. Incubation with Mφ 30% increases Sglt1 and induces glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion with increasing intracellular calcium influx. Phloridzin, an sglt1 inhibitor, inhibits glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion, ERK activation, and calcium influx. These findings suggest that the abnormalities of incretin secretion leading to metabolic disturbances in GI inflammatory disease by an increase of Sglt1. ? 2019 by the authors.

The dyspeptic symptoms are not easily cured despite the availability of various conventional Western medical treatments. Banha-sasim-tang (BST) is a traditional herbal medicine that has long been used for treating FD. METHODS: The following databases will be searched from inception to January 2019: Medline via PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, National Digital Science Library, Korean Medical Database (KoreaMed), Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System, Korean Studies Information Service System, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, and Citation Information by Nii. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that used BST or herbs-added BST for treating FD will be included in the systematic review. Control groups in these RCTs will be the placebo, no-treatment, and conventional Western medicine groups. RCTs that compared BST and Western medicine combination therapy with the conventional Western medicine will also be included in the systematic review to investigate the synergistic effect of BST and Western medicine. Data extraction and evaluation of risk of bias will be performed by 2 independent investigators. The primary outcome will be the total clinical effective rate and secondary outcomes will include gastrointestinal symptom scale, visual analog scale, FD-related quality of life, electrogastrography, plasma motilin, dyspepsia-related symptom score, gastric emptying, and adverse events. RevMan version 5.3 will be used for data integration and analysis. RESULTS: This systematic review will provide a high-quality integration of current evidence of BST for treating FD from several aspects including total clinical effective rate, dyspepsia-related symptoms, quality of life, and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review will provide evidence of the effectiveness and safety of BST on FD. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Identifying information of the participants will not be revealed; hence, this protocol does not need ethical approval.

METHODS: In this randomized (1:2:2), multicentre, double-blind trial, patients (n?=?124; age: 40-78 years) were administered placebo, calcium dobesilate (CD; 750?mg/d), or GSPE (150?mg/d) orally for up to 12 months. All patients had retinal thickening with hard exudates (HEs) that met predefined criteria; the median best-corrected visual acuity was 0.8, as assessed using the Snellen visual acuity card. The main outcome measure was an improvement in HEs by at least 1 grade on a 10-grade severity scale. This was evaluated using fundus photography over 1 year. RESULTS: The rate of improvement in the HE severity was higher in the GSPE group than in the CD group. No statistically significant difference existed among the study groups in optical coherence tomography parameters, such as central subfield macular thickness and total macular volume (TMV). However, in the GSPE group, TMV after 9 months of treatment was significantly decreased compared with that at baseline. The GSPE group showed a significantly greater improvement in HE severity than did the placebo or CD group. Four cases in the GSPE group and 2 in the CD group were determined to have developed potential treatment-related adverse reactions, which were all gastrointestinal in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GSPE therapy for 1 year improved HEs in patients with NPDR.

It aims to assess a user's subhealth status, and then to recommend relevant traditional Korean medicine (TKM)-based health-promoting strategies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of MBBG's employment for the subhealth management of general healthy adults. METHODS: This is a prospective, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial that will seek to enroll 150 healthy adults, aged 30 to 49 years old, from 2 hospitals in the Republic of Korea. The eligible participants will then be randomly allocated to either the MBBG or control group, at a 1:1 allocation ratio. The MBBG group will use the application for 12 weeks, while the control group will undergo no intervention. The awareness of subhealth status will be primarily assessed. Health promoting behaviors, quality of life, TKM-based health questionnaires, and physical examination results will be assessed as secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION: The primary endpoint will be tested with a 2-sample t test, or a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Any other continuous variables will be tested via an analysis of covariance, while categorical variables will be tested by a Chi-squared or Fisher exact test. Repeated measure analysis of variance will be performed to explore any in-group differences. The results will be addressed with a 95% confidence interval. We expect that MBBG will be the 1st TKM-based mobile application to be feasible for primary care in subhealth management.

Although such innovation has brought CGM technology closer to realizing the artificial pancreas, discomfort and infection problems have arisen from short lifespans and open wounds. A fully implantable sensor with a longer-term lifespan (90 days) is considered as an alternative CGM sensor with high comfort and low running cost. However, it still has barriers, including surgery for applying and replacing and frequent calibration.

Methods: In total, 168 participants (89 boys and 79 girls) aged 10-16 years were recruited for the Intervention for Childhood and Adolescent Obesity via Activity and Nutrition Study in 2016. The subjects were categorized into two groups using the definition of metabolic syndrome by the International Diabetes Federation: metabolically unhealthy (with at least two of the five criteria) and healthy groups (with less than one criterion). Correlation analysis of the participants' general characteristics was performed. Odds ratios (ORs) of physical fitness for cardiometabolic risk were evaluated via logistic regression. Results: Metabolically unhealthy children showed greater weight, height, and body mass index, higher Children's Depression Inventory score, and longer screen time than did the metabolically healthy children. Metabolically healthy children showed greater upper and lower extremity muscular strength than did the metabolically unhealthy children (P=0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). In the multiple logistic regression analysis, lower extremity muscle strength was inversely related to the clustered cardiometabolic risk of the children and adolescents with or without adjustment for confounders (OR, 4.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.87-9.97; OR, 7.64; 95% CI, 1.55- 37.74, respectively).

We would like to report a rare case of abducens and vagus nerves palsy caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV) without the typical vesicular rash. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 71-year-old woman presented with diplopia. Three days previously, she had experienced sore throat and hoarseness. DIAGNOSIS: At presentation, the prism cover test revealed esotropia of 10 prism diopters at primary gaze, and abduction was restricted in the right eye. No vesicular rash was observed on the patient's face, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no pathology. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed multiple ulcerations on the right side of the larynx-from the epiglottis to the arytenoid. After 1 day of hospitalization, a diffuse skin rash occurred on the patient's trunk, and polymerase chain reaction for VZV DNA was positive at the skin lesion. The patient was diagnosed as having herpes zoster associated with vagus and sixth nerve palsy. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOMES: She received famciclovir at a dose of 500?mg 3 times daily for 7 days and coadministered methylprednisolone. At the 4-month follow-up, her diplopia and eye movement had resolved completely. LESSONS: In patients with abducens nerve palsy without typical vesicular lesion, herpes zoster may not be detected early.

However, the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. To identify this relationship, we first compared lung tumor growth in parkin knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Parkin KO mice showed decreased lung tumor growth and increased expression of p21, a cell cycle arrester, as compared with WT mice. We also found that parkin interacts with p21, resulting in its degradation; however, parkin KO, knockdown, as well as mutation (R275W or G430D) reduced the degradation of p21. We investigated whether parkin KO increases the association of p21 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or CDK2 by reducing p21 degradation, and, thus, arresting the cell cycle. The interaction between p21 and PCNA or CDK2 was also enhanced by parkin knockdown, and this increased interaction induced sub G0/G1 arrest, leading to cell death. Therefore, our data indicate that parkin KO reduces the development of lung tumors via cell cycle arrest by blocking the degradation of p21. These findings suggest that PD could be associated with lower lung cancer incidence. ? 2019 Park et al.

The intervention group was provided T&CM interventions in addition to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and counseling, whereas the control group was treated with only NRT and counseling. Individuals received treatment for 4 weeks, then follow-up care for 20 weeks. Results: Forty-one participants were enrolled and assigned to either an intervention group or a control group at a ratio of 1:1. The odds ratio values at 4 weeks were 1.96 (0.51-8.51) in intention-to-treat analysis and 3.27 (0.75-17.75) in per-protocol analysis. The amount of smoking (cigarettes) decreased in both groups: from 17.2 ± 10.31 (baseline) to 1.7 ± 3.02 (4 weeks) in the intervention group and from 12.9 ± 5.47 (baseline) to 3.3 ± 5.96 (4 weeks) in the control group. The total medical costs per patient were $212.20 USD in the intervention group and $170.80 in the control group. The adjusted ICER of T&CM interventions was $13,355. Conclusions: This pilot study evaluated the clinical feasibility of T&CM used in conjunction with NRT and counseling for the smoking cessation treatment. However, there was no statistically significant effectiveness of T&CM interventions to raise cessation success rate. This study demonstrates the necessity for further studies based on large-scale randomized controlled trials. ?

Recently, the use of acupuncture with Doin has increased in clinics and clinical trials have demonstrated its effects. However, well-designed studies examining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture with Doin therapy are rare. Methods and analysis This multicentre, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups aims to evaluate the clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture with Doin therapy. A total of 124 patients (with a neck pain duration of 6 months or longer and a Numeric Rating Scale ?5) will be recruited at five Korean medicine hospitals. Patients will be randomly allocated to acupuncture with Doin therapy (n=62) and acupuncture alone (n=62) for 5 weeks of treatment. This study will be carried out with outcome assessor and statistician blinding. The primary outcome measure will consist of improvement in neck pain using the Visual Analogue Scale at 6 weeks. The secondary outcomes including measures of pain, functional disability, health-related quality of life and economic evaluation will be conducted at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment Ethics and dissemination The project is approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine and the Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital at Gangdong.

Safety standards for industrial robots operating in specific spaces have been established, but no such standards have been specified for collaborative and service robots. To establish safety standards for such robots, we assessed pressure pain thresholds for collisions between humans and robots, under the assumption that the pain threshold is lower than the mild injury threshold. The pressure pain threshold for collision with a robot was measured in 90 male Korean adults using a homemade collision system. The pain thresholds were measured three times at 15 sites, including the forehead. The highest threshold was 196.1 ± 85.8 N/cm2 at the back of the hand, and the lowest was 65.1 ± 22.6 N/cm2 at an arm nerve. Moderate thresholds, i.e., 100–120 N/cm2, were noted on the forehead, neck muscle, ball of the thumb, and shin. The thresholds of participants &lt; 30 years of age were lower, by 3–33%, than those of participants aged &gt; 30 years. Thresholds differed by body mass index only at certain sites, including the shoulder joint, neck, and back of the hand. The pressure pain threshold depended on individual characteristics, body site, and age. The threshold relevant to potential human-robot collisions was determined to be between 65.1 ± 22.6 and 196.1 ± 85.8 N/cm2. ? 2019 Park et al.

Methods: The ethics committee of the palliative medicine subgroup of the Korean Cancer Study Group designed this study and solid cancer patients to whom chemotherapy was offered, from seven institutions, were evaluated. The details relating to surrogate’s signing of chemotherapy consent were evaluated. Then, we analyzed the factors associated with surrogate’s signing according to patient’s demographics and characteristics related to chemotherapy consent. Results: Surrogate’s signing was noted for 20.7% (84/405) of patient and over half of surrogate signings were performed by the patients’ son or daughter (60.7%). Two main reasons for surrogate signing were patient’s incapacity (34.5%) and taking over authorization from patients (33.3%). The factors associated with more frequent surrogate’s signing were absence of spouse, lower education level, outpatient, and when residents played a role as a principle provider of chemotherapy consent. Conclusions: This study suggests the lack of patients’ own decision making for chemotherapy in some situations. This ethical dilemma must be considered for adequately informed decision making for chemotherapy while ensuring the patients’ autonomy is maintained. ? 2019 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.",Drug therapy; Informed consent; Neoplasms; Surrogate decision making,adult; article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; controlled study; decision making; education; female; human; informed consent; major clinical study; male; outpatient; palliative therapy; professional standard; resident; son; spouse; aged; decision making; drug therapy; ethics; middle aged; personal autonomy; Aged; Decision Making; Drug Therapy; Female; Humans; Informed Consent; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Autonomy,2-s2.0-85065560733

We examined the association between impairments in specific cognitive domains and sarcopenia (and its defining components) in community-dwelling older adults. We analyzed 1887 patients who underwent cognitive function tests and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry from the baseline data of adults aged 70–84 years obtained from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study. Those with disability in activities of daily living, dementia, severe cognitive impairment, Parkinson’s disease, musculoskeletal complaints, neurological disorders, or who were illiterate were excluded. Cognitive function was assessed using the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Packet, the Frontal Assessment Battery. For sarcopenia, we used the diagnostic criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 9.6% for men and 7.6% for women. Sarcopenia (odds ratio [OR] 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–2.99) and slow gait speed (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.34–4.99) were associated with cognitive impairment in men. Only slow gait speed (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.05–3.36) was associated with cognitive impairment in women. Sarcopenia is associated with cognitive impairment mainly due to slow gait speed. Our results suggested that cognitive impairment domains, such as processing speed and executive function, are associated with sarcopenia-related slow gait speed. ? 2019 by the authors.

A field survey was conducted on 11 facilities from October 2017 to April 2018. Elder care facilities in industrial, urban, and forested areas were excluded. Two indoor, and one outdoor, measuring points were selected per facility. These points were located in areas most often used by the residents. Measurements were taken at random time-points before February 2018 and at specific times in the morning and afternoon thereafter. The relationships among bacterial counts, carbon dioxide concentrations, dust levels, temperature, relative humidity, and ventilation were examined. The pooled average bacterial counts at the daycares, medical facilities, elder care facilities, and postnatal care centers were 540.25 CFU m?3, 245.49 CFU m?3, 149.63 CFU m?3, and 169.65 CFU m?3, respectively. Considering the upper 95% confidence interval, the bacterial counts in many daycares may in fact be &gt;800 CFU m?3, which is the threshold set by the Korean Ministry of the Environment. The pooled average indoor: outdoor bacterial count ratio was 1.13. Indoor airborne bacterial counts were influenced mainly by their sources. This study found no significant correlations among indoor temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, dust levels, and airborne bacterial counts, unlike previous studies. Airborne bacteria management at daycares should be a top priority. The sources of airborne bacteria must also be identified, and a management plan must be developed to control them. ? 2019 by the authors.

Ursolic acid (UA) has various pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer. However, the effect of UA on TSLP regulation has not been fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to analyze how UA regulates the production of TSLP in the human mast cell line HMC- 1. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, western blotting, caspase-1 assay and fluorescent measurements of intracellular calcium levels were conducted to analyze the regulatory effects of UA. The results revealed that UA inhibited TSLP production and mRNA expression. In addition, UA reduced the activation of nuclear factor-κB and degradation of IκBα. Caspase-1 activity was increased by exposure to phorbol myristate acetate plus calcium ionophore, whereas it was reduced by UA. Finally, UA treatment prevented an increase in intracellular calcium levels. These results indicated that UA may be a useful agent for the treatment and/or prevention of atopic and inflammatory diseases, and its effects are likely mediated by TSLP downregulation. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. Data were collected with 479 nurses from two general hospitals in Seoul, Korea, using a questionnaire designed to collect data on patient participation in patient safety activities, PCC, teamwork perceptions, and safety climate. The response rate was 74.1% (N = 355). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: The mean score for patient participation was 2.76 ± 0.46 of 4.0. The mean scores for PCC, teamwork, and safety climate were 3.61 ± 0.46, 3.64 ± 0.41, and 3.35 ± 0.57 of 5.0, respectively. Nurses who experienced high patient participation in patient safety activities (? 3.0) had higher scores for PCC, teamwork, and safety climate. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that PCC (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.14–4.70) and safety climate (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.09–5.78) scores were the significant factors associated with patient participation. Conclusion: The degree of patient participation in patient safety activities was not high. Nurses' PCC, teamwork, and safety climate were positively related with patient participation. In particular, the findings indicate that enhancing nurses' competency for patient-centered care and creating a strong safety climate are important to promote patient participation for safer health care. ? 2019",culture; patient participation; patient safety; patient-centered care,adult; article; climate; cross-sectional study; drug safety; female; human; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; nurse; patient care; patient participation; patient safety; perception; questionnaire; South Korea; statistics; teamwork; clinical competence; middle aged; nursing care; organizational culture; procedures; young adult; Adult; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nursing Care; Organizational Culture; Patient Care Team; Patient Participation; Patient Safety; Patient-Centered Care; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85063914585

In contemporary society, osteoporosis is more common than cancer and stroke and results in a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in the human population. Osteoporosis can conclusively be diagnosed with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In this study, we propose a computer-aided osteoporosis detection (CAOD) technique that automatically measures bone mineral density (BMD) and generates an osteoporosis report from a DXA scan. Methods: The CAOD model denoise and segments DXA images using a non-local mean filter, Machine learning pixel label random forest respectively, and locates regions of interest with higher accuracy. Pixel label random forest classifies a pixel either bone or soft tissue; then contours are extracted from binary image to locate regions of interest and calculate BMD from bone and soft tissues pixels. Mean standard deviation and correlation coefficients statistical analysis were used to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of BMD measurements. Results: During a consistency test of BMD measurements using three consecutive scans from Computerized Imaging Reference Systems’ Bona Fide Phantom (CIRS-BFP) for the spine, the CAOD model showed an averaged standard deviation of 0.0029 while the standard deviation from manual measurements on the same data set by three different individuals was recorded as 0.1199. During another correlation study of BMD measurements evaluating real human scan images by the CAOD model versus manual measurement, the model scored a correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0.9901 while the CIRS-BFP study scored a correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0.9709. Conclusions: The CAOD model increases the preciseness and accuracy of BMD measurements. This CAOD method will help clinicians, untrained DXA operators, and researchers (medical scientists, doctors, and bone researchers) use the DXA system with reliable accuracy and overcome workload challenges. It will also improve osteoporosis diagnosis from DXA systems and increase system performance and value. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Bone density; Contours processing; DXA; Image segmentation; Osteoporosis; Select region of interest (ROI),"Binary images; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Pixels; Statistical tests; Statistics; Tissue; Bone density; Bone mineral density; Correlation coefficient; Dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA); Mean standard deviation; Non-local mean filters; Osteoporosis; Region of interest; Bone; Article; bone density; computer aided design; diagnostic accuracy; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; human; image segmentation; machine learning; osteoporosis; random forest; algorithm; artificial neural network; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; false positive result; female; femur; fracture; imaging phantom; male; middle aged; osteoporosis; photon absorptiometry; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Absorptiometry, Photon; Algorithms; Bone Density; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; False Positive Reactions; Female; Femur; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks (Computer); Osteoporosis; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-85063047378

Methods: We compared the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, death-censored allograft survival and all-cause mortality, and also compared the impact of high sensitization or desensitization on the clinical outcomes of elderly and young recipients. Results: A total of 4966 KT recipients from the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry were included. The definition of elderly recipients was based on age >60 years (n = 356), and recipients aged <60 years were defined as young recipients (n = 4610). The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection did not differ between the two groups irrespective of the donor type; however, the impact of high sensitization was significant only in young recipients. Being an elderly recipient was an independent risk factor for death-censored allograft failure in terms of overall and living donor KT, but not with deceased donor KT. In regard to patient death, being an elderly recipient was a significant predictor in general and in the two subgroups, and desensitization showed a significant interaction with death in the elderly recipients in the living donor KT group. Conclusions: In conclusion, KT in elderly recipients might be associated with poor allograft or patient survival in general, and especially, desensitization therapy carried out in these patients might increase the risk of patient mortality.

Objective: In this study, we tried to demonstrate that longitudinally defined ACOS is more useful in the real world than blending patients with asthma and COPD. Methods: The study patients had undergone two consecutive pulmonary function tests measured at least 3?months apart (n?=?1889). We selected the patients who had positive bronchodilator response or methacholine provocation tests (n?=?959). Next, we defined ACOS as a patient with a persistent airflow obstruction [forced expiratory volume in 1?second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity <0.7] that was identified twice consecutively by an interval of at least 3?months (n?=?228). Results: The proportions of patients who were older, male and smokers were significantly higher, and baseline lung function was lower in patients with ACOS. In the longitudinal analysis, the mean change in lung function was high, and a greater decline in FEV1 was observed in patients with ACOS. In addition, we compared ACOS and severe asthma, and we also performed a cluster analysis and compared the results with our definition of ACOS. According to our definition, ACOS is an independent subtype with distinctive characteristics. Finally, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify genetic variations associated with ACOS, but no significant single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that ACOS should be defined longitudinally and considered as an independent subgroup distinguished by inherited environmental factors rather than as a genetically distinct independent group. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",asthma; asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome; cluster analysis; genome-wide association study; longitudinal studies,bronchodilating agent; methacholine; adult; airway obstruction; Article; asthma; asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome; asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome; chronic obstructive lung disease; cluster analysis; controlled study; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; human; Korea; longitudinal study; lung function test; major clinical study; male; priority journal; provocation test; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking; treatment response,2-s2.0-85061602073

While JAM-A has been reported to facilitate tissue infiltration of leukocytes under inflammatory conditions, the contributions of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in vivo remain unresolved. We investigated the role of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in acute peritonitis induced by zymosan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or TNFα using mice with selective loss of JAM-A in myelomonocytic cells (LysM-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl ). Surprisingly, in LysM-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl mice, loss of JAM-A did not affect neutrophil (PMN) recruitment into the peritoneum in response to zymosan, LPS, or TNFα although it was significantly reduced in Jam-a KO mice. In parallel, Jam-a KO peritoneal macrophages exhibited diminished CXCL1 chemokine production and decreased activation of NF-kB, whereas those from LysM-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl mice were unaffected. Using Villin-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl mice, targeted loss of JAM-A on intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased intestinal permeability along with reduced peritoneal PMN migration as well as lower levels of CXCL1 and active NF-kB similar to that observed in Jam-a KO animals. Interestingly, in germ-free Villin-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl mice, PMN recruitment was unaffected suggesting dependence on gut microbiota. Such observations highlight the functional link between a leaky gut and regulation of innate immune responses. ? 2019, Society for Mucosal Immunology.",,"CXCL1 chemokine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; junctional adhesion molecule A; lipopolysaccharide; tumor necrosis factor; zymosan; cell adhesion molecule; cell surface receptor; CXCL1 chemokine; F11R protein, human; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; female; hematopoietic stem cell; immunoregulation; innate immunity; intestine epithelium cell; intestine flora; intestine mucosa permeability; leukocyte; macrophage migration; male; mouse; myelomonocytic cell; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; peritoneum; peritoneum macrophage; peritonitis; priority journal; protein deficiency; protein depletion; protein expression; protein induction; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; chemically induced; disease model; genetics; human; immunology; intestine mucosa; knockout mouse; macrophage; metabolism; neutrophil; neutrophil chemotaxis; pathology; permeability; tight junction; transgenic mouse; Animals; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cells, Cultured; Chemokine CXCL1; Disease Models, Animal; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Neutrophil Infiltration; Neutrophils; NF-kappa B; Peritonitis; Permeability; Receptors, Cell Surface; Tight Junctions; Zymosan",2-s2.0-85061400872

This study aimed to examine the longitudinal associations between exercise and/or dietary varieties and incidence of frailty in older women. Design: A 2-year population-based prospective cohort study. Setting and participants: Six hundred and four community-dwelling older Japanese women aged ?75 years with non-frailty at baseline survey. Measurements: Frailty was assessed using Fried’s frailty criteria composed of shrinking, weakness, slowness, low activity, and exhaustion at both baseline and follow-up surveys. Frailty incident was defined as the presence of =3 components at the follow-up survey. At baseline, information about exercise and dietary habits were obtained from all participants through a face-to-face interview. Participants were grouped into two categories, high (=2) and low (<2) exercise varieties, assessed by the number of participations in 17 exercise types. By dietary variety, assessed using Dietary Variety Score (range, 0 to 10), participants were grouped into two, high (=4 points) and low (<4 points) dietary varieties. Binary logistic regression analyses were applied to obtain adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs) of the incidence of frailty in the 4 groups (low-exercise and low-dietary varieties [low EV + low DV] as reference; low-exercise and high-dietary varieties [low EV + high DV]; high-exercise and low-dietary varieties [high EV + low DV]; and high-exercise and high-dietary varieties [high EV + high DV]). Results: Frailty incidence rate was 9.3% over the 2-year follow-up period. Incidence rates of frailty in the 4 groups were as follows: 23.7%, 10.1%, 6.5%, and 7.7% in the low EV + low DV, low EV + high DV, high EV + low DV, and high EV + high DV groups, respectively. After adjustment for covariates, only the high EV + high DV group was associated with a significantly lower OR (0.38; 95% CI 0.15–0.92) of frailty incidence compared with the low EV + low DV group. Conclusion: Higher variety of exercise and diet was significantly associated with lower incidence of frailty. Thus, the combination of variety-rich exercise and dietary program may be useful in preventing the incidence of frailty in older women. ? 2018, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.",dietary; exercise; frailty; Variety,aged; aging; Article; body weight loss; cerebrovascular accident; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; community dwelling person; depression; diabetes mellitus; dietary pattern; exercise; exhaustion; female; follow up; frailty; grip strength; heart disease; human; hypertension; incidence; Japanese (people); longitudinal study; major clinical study; nutritional assessment; osteoporosis; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; risk reduction; walking speed; weakness,2-s2.0-85061242418

This study aimed to determine the clinical outcomes of active RA patients with normal APR values. Method: Of 5376 patients with RA enrolled in the Korean observational study network for arthritis (KORONA) registry, 400 patients with disease duration of <2?years who had Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of >2.8 at baseline, biologic-na?ve, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) drawn at both baseline and 2-year follow-up visits were identified. Patients were grouped according to baseline APR levels: normal APRs, one APR elevated, and both APRs elevated. Results: Baseline tender and swollen joint counts, mean CDAI and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) scores were significantly lower in the normal APRs group compared with APR-elevated groups (P?<?0.0001). At 2-year follow-up, mean CDAI scores, HAQ-DI, and percentage of the patient achieving remission were not significantly different between the normal APRs group compared with the APR-elevated groups regardless of the baseline disease activity.

Materials and methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies that employed MRI features to differentiate HCC from IHCC. Overlapping descriptors used to denote the same imaging finding in different studies were subsumed under a single feature. The pooled diagnostic accuracies, including the diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the identified features, were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. Results: In total, 1,370 patients with HCC and 687 patients with IHCC in 14 studies were included. Fifty-two descriptors were subsumed under 15 MRI features. Of these, 11 features were informative for differentiating HCC from IHCC. The five MRI features favouring HCC were capsule, arterial diffuse enhancement, portal venous washout, conventional washout, and intralesional fat; the six MRI features favouring IHCC were surface retraction, arterial rim enhancement, progressive enhancement, target appearance on diffusion-weighted and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images, and bile duct dilatation. These features tended to show high specificity, but low sensitivity. Useful MRI features with high DORs (>20) were capsule (34; 95% CI, 5–215) and intralesional fat (23; 4–85) for HCC and arterial rim enhancement (31; 6–160), progressive enhancement (24; 8–73), and target appearance on HBP images (29; 3–261) for IHCC.

The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with residual sequelae after treatment of HPVO. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with HPVO at 5 tertiary-care hospitals between January 2005 and December 2012. Sequelae were defined as an inability to walk without assistance, bladder/bowel incontinence, and/or unresolved pain that required analgesic therapy at 12 months after completing the HPVO treatment. Results: Of the 279 patients with microbiologically proven HPVO, 79 (28.3%) had sequelae at 12 months posttherapy. Independent risk factors for sequelae were neurologic deficit (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.38), recurrence within 12 months (aOR, 2.45), age ? 65 years (aOR, 2.05), C-reactive protein level ? 10 mg/dL (aOR, 2.01), and epidural/paravertebral abscess (aOR, 2.00). Among 58 patients with neurologic deficit, sequelae rates differed according to the surgical strategy, as follows: 28.6% (early surgery [<48 h]), 55.0% (delayed surgery [?48 h]), and 66.7% (no surgery) (P = 0.03). Among the 170 patients with abscess, early drainage (<72 h) was an independent protective factor for sequelae (aOR, 0.35). The 12-month recurrence rates differed according to the total duration of antibiotic treatment, as follows: 20.5% (4–6 weeks), 18.4% (6–8 weeks), and 5.2% (?8 weeks) (P < 0.001). Conclusions: A substantial proportion of patients with HPVO experienced sequelae after completing treatment. Early surgery for neurologic deficit, early drainage of abscess, and antibiotic therapy of appropriate duration to reduce recurrence may prevent development of sequelae in patients with HPVO. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Abscess; Prevention; Sequelae; Spondylitis; Vertebral osteomyelitis,antibiotic agent; C reactive protein; adult; aged; Article; brain abscess; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; end stage renal disease; female; human; immune deficiency; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; neurologic disease; operation duration; priority journal; protein blood level; recurrence risk; retrospective study; rheumatic disease; spondylitis; tertiary care center; treatment outcome; urine incontinence; very elderly,2-s2.0-85059043808

Merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP7) is a multigene family which forms a non-covalent complex with MSP-1 prior to receptor-ligand recognition in Plasmodium falciparum and thus an important antigen for vaccine development. However, no study has been done in any of the ortholog family members in P. knowlesi from clinical samples. This study investigates the level of polymorphism, haplotypes, and natural selection acting at the pkmsp-7D gene in clinical samples from Malaysia. Methods: Thirty-six full-length pkmsp7D gene sequences (along with the reference H-strain: PKNH-1266000) obtained from clinical isolates of Malaysia, which were orthologous to pvmsp7H (PVX-082680) were downloaded from public databases. Population genetic, evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine the level of genetic diversity, polymorphism, recombination and natural selection. Results: Analysis of 36 full-length pkmsp7D sequences identified 147 SNPs (91 non-synonymous and 56 synonymous substitutions). Nucleotide diversity across the full-length gene was higher than its ortholog in Plasmodium vivax (msp7H). Region-wise analysis of the gene indicated that the nucleotide diversity at the central region was very high (π = 0.14) compared to the 5′ and 3′ regions. Most hyper-variable SNPs were detected at the central domain. Multiple test for natural selection indicated the central region was under strong positive natural selection however, the 5′ and 3′ regions were under negative/purifying selection. Evidence of intragenic recombination were detected at the central region of the gene. Phylogenetic analysis using full-length msp7D genes indicated there was no geographical clustering of parasite population. Conclusions: High genetic diversity with hyper-variable SNPs and strong evidence of positive natural selection at the central region of MSP7D indicated exposure of the region to host immune pressure. Negative selection at the 5′ and the 3′ regions of MSP7D might be because of functional constraints at the unexposed regions during the merozoite invasion process of P. knowlesi. No evidence of geographical clustering among the clinical isolates from Malaysia indicated uniform selection pressure in all populations. These findings highlight the further evaluation of the regions and functional characterization of the protein as a potential blood stage vaccine candidate for P. knowlesi. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Genetic diversity; Haplotypes; Malaysia; Merozoite surface protein 7D; Plasmodium knowlesi; Positive selection,"merozoite surface protein 7D; parasite antigen; protozoal protein; unclassified drug; membrane protein; merozoite surface protein 7, Plasmodium; protozoal protein; Article; controlled study; data base; diversifying selection; evolutionary rate; gene sequence; genetic recombination; genetic variability; haplotype; Malaysia; microbial diversity; microbial gene; microbial genetics; nonhuman; nucleic acid base substitution; phylogeny; pkmsp 7D gene; Plasmodium knowlesi; Plasmodium vivax; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; DNA sequence; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; human; malaria; parasitology; Plasmodium knowlesi; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Humans; Malaria; Malaysia; Membrane Proteins; Phylogeny; Plasmodium knowlesi; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Protozoan Proteins; Recombination, Genetic; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA",2-s2.0-85065248990

We aimed to elucidate the clinical impact of PH on these patients. Methods: PH was defined as hospitalization for two or more days in the preceding 90 days. Patients with PH-associated pneumonia (PHAP) or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were matched using the propensity score matching method, and the clinical outcomes were compared. We also conducted subgroup analyses based on intravenous antibiotic use during PH, duration of PH, and time to re-admission. Results: A total of 704 patients were identified; the PHAP group included 97 patients (13.7%). After matching according to propensity scores, the baseline characteristics of the PHAP group were similar to those of the CAP group. The isolation rate of PDR pathogens as well as the 30-day and total in-hospital mortality did not differ between propensity score-matched PHAP and CAP patients (13.6% vs. 10.2%, P = 0.485; 10.2% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.362; and 13.6% vs. 15.9%, P = 0.671, respectively). In subgroup analyses, only intravenous antibiotic use during PH was associated with the isolation rate of PDR pathogens (adjusted OR: 5.066; 95% CI: 1.231-20.845). Conclusions: PH itself might not be related with higher isolation rates of PDR pathogens or mortality in patients admitted with pneumonia. Therefore, it seems reasonable that broad spectrum antibiotic therapy for PDR pathogens should be selectively applied to PHAP patients with intravenous antibiotic use during PH. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Antibiotics; Hospitalization; Microbiology; Mortality; Pneumonia,"antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter baumannii; adult; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacterium isolation; carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae; case control study; Chlamydia pneumoniae; cohort analysis; community acquired pneumonia; controlled study; disease association; Escherichia coli; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; female; hospital acquired pneumonia; hospital admission; hospital mortality; hospitalization; human; Legionella pneumophila; major clinical study; male; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; outcome assessment; pneumonia; prior hospitalization; propensity score; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; retrospective study; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Streptococcus pneumoniae; aged; bacterial pneumonia; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; hospitalization; intravenous drug administration; isolation and purification; microbiology; middle aged; pathology; propensity score; treatment outcome; very elderly; Administration, Intravenous; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Female; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Bacterial; Propensity Score; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85065185183

For such tumor tissues with RNA instability, RNAlater containing a high concentration of quaternary ammonium sulfates that denature RNA-hydrolyzing enzymes is often used to protect RNAs from hydrolysis. Although a few studies have been carried out to determine the effect of RNAlater on DNA and RNA, whether RNAlater influences the proteome and phosphoproteome is largely unknown. In this study we carried out a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the effect of RNAlater on the proteome and phosphoproteome using high-resolution mass spectrometry. PDAC tissues from three patients were individually pulverized and the tissue powders of each patient were divided into two portions, one of which was incubated in RNAlater at 4 °C for 24 h (RNAlater tissue) while the other was kept at - 80 °C (frozen tissue). Comprehensive quantitative profiling experiments on the RNAlater tissues and the frozen tissues resulted in the identification of 99,136 distinct peptides of 8803 protein groups and 17,345 phosphopeptides of 16,436 phosphosites. The data exhibited no significant quantitative changes in both proteins and phosphorylation between the RNAlater tissues and the frozen tissue. In addition, the phosphoproteome data showed heterogeneously activated pathways among the three patients that were not altered by RNAlater. These results indicate that the tissue preservation method using RNAlater can be effectively used on PDAC tissues for proteogenomic studies where preservation of intact DNA, RNA and proteins is prerequisite.

However, their implementation usually requires an extended consultation time. Despite significant advances in medical diagnosis and treatment, no studies have examined consultation time and patient centeredness in Korea. Methods: We conducted a ""15-Minute Consultation"" for first-time patients in outpatient clinics of 13 departments. A control group was selected from the same physicians' first-time patients, adjusting for age and gender. A total of 275 patients were selected for receiving in-depth consultation and 141 control patients were selected for regular consultation. Data were collected from patients using a questionnaire comprising a patient-centeredness scale and items on potential predictors such as socio-demographic and clinical factors. We also investigated the participating physician's professionalism. Results: As compared to the control group, the in-depth consultation group scored higher on 5 variables associated with PCC, including (patients' perception of) medical professionals, wait and consultation times, treatment, patient advocacy, and patient satisfaction. While 92.4% of patients in the in-depth consultation group reported that the consultation time was sufficient, only 69.0% of those in the control group reported the same (P < 0.01). In the in-depth consultation group, scores on satisfaction level were the highest for the department of internal medicine, followed by departments of surgery and pediatrics. Participating physicians' improved satisfaction following the intervention proved that in-depth consultation facilitated building a rapport with patients. Conclusion: This study illustrated that the provision of sufficiently long consultation for serious and rare diseases could improve PCC and physicians' professionalism. Health authorities should reshuffle the healthcare delivery system and provide sufficient consultation time to ensure PCC and medical professionalism. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Consultation; Medical Professionalism; Patient-Centered Care; Satisfaction,adolescent; adult; case control study; female; human; male; middle aged; outpatient department; patient advocacy; patient care; patient referral; patient satisfaction; professionalism; questionnaire; South Korea; tertiary care center; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Advocacy; Patient Satisfaction; Patient-Centered Care; Professionalism; Referral and Consultation; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tertiary Care Centers; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85065098727

Chuna manual therapy (CMT) combines aspects of physiology, biodynamics of spine and joint motion, and basic theory of movement dynamics. This study aimed to test the comparative effectiveness and safety of CMT for non-acute LBP. Methods: A three-arm, multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted from 28 March 2016 to 19 September 2016, at four medical institutions. A total of 60 patients were randomly allocated to the CMT group (n = 20), usual care (UC) group (n = 20), or combined treatment (CMT + UC) group (n = 20), and received the relevant treatments for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was a numeric rating scale (NRS) representation of LBP intensity, while secondary outcomes included NRS of leg pain, Oswestry disability index (ODI), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), lumbar range of motion, and safety. Results: A total of 60 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 55 patients (CMT, 18; UC, 18; CMT + UC, 19) were included in the per-protocol analysis (drop-out rate 5.3%). Over the treatment period there were significant differences in the NRS score for LBP (CMT mean - 3.28 (95% CI - 4.08, - 2.47); UC - 1.95 (- 2.82, - 1.08); CMT + UC - 1.75 (- 2.70, - 0.80), P < 0.01) and the ODI scores in each group (CMT - 12.29 (- 16.86, - 7.72); UC - 10.34 (- 14.63, - 6.06); CMT + UC - 9.27 (- 14.28, - 4.26), P < 0.01). The changes in other secondary outcomes did not significantly differ among the three groups. Sixteen minor-to-moderate safety concerns were reported. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CMT has comparative efficacy for non-acute LBP and is generally safe. As this was a preliminary study, a well-powered (over 192 participants) two-arm (CMT versus UC) verification trial will be performed to assess the generalizability of these results.

The quality of life can be degraded by the symptoms of CHHF. In particular, gynecological disorders such as menstrual pain, infertility, leucorrhea, and irregular bleeding may be related to CHHF. Sipjeondaebo-tang (SDT) is widely used in the treatment of various diseases including CHHF by balancing Yin and Yang, restoring the deterioration of physiological function, and improving immunity. However, the efficacy of SDT in the treatment of CHHF has not been assessed in clinical trials. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of a full randomized clinical trial of SDT for the treatment of CHHF in Korean women through this trial. Methods: This study will be a pilot, randomized, double-blind, two-arm, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial. Women aged 19-59 years who present with CHHF will be recruited from five university hospitals. A total of 60 subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (SDT) or a placebo group at a 1:1 ratio. The subjects will receive 3 g of either SDT or placebo three times daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measures will be the Visual Analogue Scale scores of CHHF. The secondary outcome measures will be changes in body temperature in both the hands and the feet as measured using a thermometer and the Korean version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Abbreviated Version. Discussion: This will be the first trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of SDT in the treatment of CHHF. This study will provide basic clinical information regarding Korean herbal medicine treatment of CHHF and a clinical basis for designing a full randomized clinical trial.

Peripheral nerve degeneration leads to distal motor or sensory disorders such as diabetic neuropathy, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and Gullain–Barr? syndrome, with symptoms such as dysesthesia, speech impairment, vision change, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. Schwann cells play an important role in peripheral nerve degeneration. Therefore, revealing the characteristics of Schwann cells will be essential in understanding peripheral neurodegeneration-related diseases for which there is currently no effective treatment. Trichostatin A (TSA) is a noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs have been shown not only to deacetylate histones but also to target non-histone proteins involved in diverse signaling pathways. Recent studies have revealed that diverse HDAC subtypes regulate peripheral neurodegeneration. Thus, regulating HDAC levels could be an effective strategy for the development of drugs targeting peripheral nerve-related diseases. In fact, the use of TSA has been investigated for the treatment of many diseases, including degenerative diseases of the central nervous system; however, the effects of TSA on peripheral neurodegeneration have not yet been well established. In this study, we revealed the effect of TSA on the process of peripheral neurodegeneration. TSA successfully inhibited myelin fragmentation, axonal degradation, and trans-dedifferentiation and proliferation of Schwann cells, which are essential phenotypes in peripheral neurodegeneration. Therefore, TSA could be a potential drug for patients suffering from peripheral neurodegeneration-related diseases. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Acetylation; Axonal degradation; Demyelination; Histone deacetylases; Schwann cells; Trichostatin A,"myelin; trichostatin A; histone deacetylase inhibitor; hydroxamic acid; trichostatin A; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell dedifferentiation; controlled study; diabetic neuropathy; dysesthesia; erectile dysfunction; immunohistochemistry; male; MAPK signaling; mouse; nerve degeneration; neurofilament; nonhuman; peripheral neuropathy; phenotype; priority journal; protein degradation; Schwann cell; sciatic nerve; Western blotting; axon; cell culture; cell proliferation; drug effect; human; metabolism; myelin sheath; nerve degeneration; pathology; peripheral neuropathy; Axons; Cell Dedifferentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Hydroxamic Acids; Myelin Sheath; Nerve Degeneration; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Schwann Cells",2-s2.0-85060548168

Spirulina platensis (SP) is a blue-green alga that is widely supplemented in healthy foods. The objective of this study was to determine whether SP supplementation can prevent obesity-induced liver fibrosis in vivo. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a low-fat or a high-fat (HF)/high-sucrose/high-cholesterol diet or an HF diet supplemented with 2·5 % SP (w/w) (HF/SP) for 16 or 20 weeks. There were no significant differences in body weight, activity, energy expenditure, serum lipids or glucose tolerance between mice on HF and HF/SP diets. However, plasma alanine aminotransferase level was significantly reduced by SP at 16 weeks. Expression of fibrotic markers and trichrome stains showed no differences between HF and HF/SP. Splenocytes isolated from HF/SP fed mice had lower inflammatory gene expression and cytokine secretion compared with splenocytes from HF-fed mice. SP supplementation did not attenuate HF-induced liver fibrosis. However, the expression and secretion of inflammatory genes in splenocytes were significantly reduced by SP supplementation, demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effects of SP in vivo. Although SP did not show appreciable effect on the prevention of liver fibrosis in this mouse model, it may be beneficial for other inflammatory conditions. ?

This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of NAC in non-HGSC patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent NAC for advanced stage non-HGSC between 2002 and 2017 in 17 institutions. Demographics, surgical outcomes, and survival rates were evaluated according to histological subtypes. Results: A total of 154 patients were included in this study, comprising 20 cases (13.0%) of mucinous adenocarcinoma, 31 cases (20.1%) of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 28 (18.2%) cases of clear cell carcinoma, 29 (18.8%) cases of low-grade serous carcinoma and 12 cases (7.8%) of carcinosarcoma. Complete remission/partial remission after the third cycle of NAC was achieved in 100 (64.9%) patients and optimal debulking surgery (residual disease ?1 cm) at interval debulking surgery was achieved in 103 (66.9%) patients. The most common reason for performing NAC was high tumor burden (n = 106, 68.8%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 14.3 months and median overall survival (OS) was 52.9 months. In multivariate analyses, mucinous and clear cell carcinoma were negative prognostic factors for both PFS (p = 0.007 and p = 0.017, respectively) and OS (p = 0.002 and p = 0.013, respectively). Conclusions: In this study, poor survival outcomes were observed in patients with mucinous and clear cell carcinoma undergoing NAC.

In colorectal cancer, studies reporting the association between overexpression of GLUT and poor clinical outcomes were flawed by small sample sizes or subjective interpretation of immunohistochemical staining. Here, we analyzed mRNA expressions in all 14 SLC2A genes and evaluated the association with prognosis in colorectal cancer using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Methods: In the present study, we analyzed the expression of SLC2A genes in colorectal cancer and their association with prognosis using data obtained from the TCGA for the discovery sample, and a dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus for the validation sample. Results: SLC2A3 was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in both the discovery sample (345 patients) and validation sample (501 patients). High SLC2A3 expression resulted in shorter OS and DFS. In multivariate analyses, high SLC2A3 levels predicted unfavorable OS (adjusted HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.22-3.11; P = 0.005) and were associated with poor DFS (adjusted HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.10-3.12; P = 0.02). Similar results were found in the discovery set. Conclusion: Upregulation of the SLC2A3 genes is associated with decreased OS and DFS in colorectal cancer patients. Therefore, assessment of SLC2A3 gene expression may useful for predicting prognosis in these patients. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Colorectal cancer; Glucose transporter (GLUT); Prognosis; Solute carrier 2A (SLC2A); The cancer genome atlas (TCGA),"glucose transporter 3; glucose transporter 3; SLC2A3 protein, human; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease free survival; female; gene control; gene expression; genetic association; genetic database; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; overall survival; prediction; predictive value; reference value; SLC2A3 gene; survival time; upregulation; validation study; cancer staging; colorectal tumor; gene expression regulation; genetics; middle aged; pathology; prognosis; survival analysis; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Databases, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glucose Transporter Type 3; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Survival Analysis; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85064068213

However, few studies have investigated the particularity of completed suicide in South Korea. Methods Study subjects consisted of 2,838 suicide cases and 56,758 age and sex matched living controls from a national representative sample of 1,025,340 South Koreans. They were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) with follow-up up to 12 years. We obtained information on primary diagnosis of any ICD-10 disorder along with suicide cases during their lifetime. Results Among ICD-10 disorders, depression was the most common disorder (19.10%, n=542), found in victims of completed suicides except for common medical disorders such as hypertensive crisis, respiratory tract infection or arthropathies. After adjusting for sex, age, economic status, disability, and disorders, schizophrenia showed the strongest association with suicide (AOR: 28.56, 95% CI: 19.58-41.66) among all ICD-10 disorders, followed by psoriasis, multiple body injury, epilepsy, sleep disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder.

Twins completed self-report questionnaires of the HB symptoms scale and the somatization scale via a telephone interview. The results of the general sex-limitation model showed that 43% (95% CI [36, 50]) of the total variance of somatization was attributable to additive genetic factors, with the remaining variance, 57% (95% CI [50, 64]), being due to individual-specific environmental influences, including measurement error. These estimates were not significantly different between the two sexes. The phenotypic correlation between HB and somatization was.53 (p <.001). The bivariate model-fitting analyses revealed that the genetic correlation between the two symptoms was.68 (95% CI [.59,.77]), while the individual-specific environmental correlation, including correlated measurement error, was.41 (95% CI [.34,.48]). Of the additive genetic factors of 43% that influence somatization, approximately half (20%) were associated with those related to HB, with the remainder being due to genes unique to somatization. A substantial part (48%) of individual environmental variance in somatization was unrelated to HB; only 9% of the environmental variance was shared with HB. Our findings suggest that HB and somatization have shared genetic etiology, but environmental factors that precipitate the development of HB and somatization may be largely independent from each other. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Comorbidity; environment; genes; hwabyung (anger syndrome); somatization; twin,"adolescent; adult; Article; child; controlled study; dizygotic twins; environmental factor; female; genetic correlation; genetic variability; heredity; heritability; human; hwabyung symptoms scale; hwabyung syndrome; major clinical study; male; measurement error; mental disease; mental disease assessment; monozygotic twins; priority journal; self report; sex difference; sex limitation; somatization; somatization scale; South Korean; telephone interview; twins; anger; Asian continental ancestry group; biological model; environment; genetics; pathophysiology; psychology; questionnaire; register; sexual characteristics; twins; young adult; Adolescent; Anger; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Diseases in Twins; Environment; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Genetic; Registries; Sex Characteristics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85065331520

Articular disease is common manifestation, but patients may rarely present with extra-articular manifestation such as cranial neuropathy. Also, primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) has rarely been reported in patient treated with immunosuppressive drug such as methotrexate (MTX) for RA. We herein describe a case of cranial neuropathy and MTX-related PHL in a woman receiving MTX for RA. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 73-year-old women received MTX treatment for more than 5 years, presented with recurrent cranial neuropathies. During therapy of cranial neuropathies, liver enzyme levels were elevated. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed as RA by laboratory examination. A series of examinations had been launched to evaluate any possible cause of the extra-articular manifestation of the patient including ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance image (MRI) and positron emission tomography of the liver and MRI of the brain. Finally, the patient diagnosed as MTX-associated PHL and cranial neuropathy. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent 4-year MTX therapy for RA at first with prednisolone. After that, she had been treated with cyclophosphamide therapy for cranial neuropathy. The liver biopsy was performed for hepatic lesion. OUTCOMES: MTX was discontinued, but no improvement of PHL and elevated liver enzyme was observed during the 3 weeks. The patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy for 3 months and achieved complete remission including PHL and cranial neuronal lesion with symptom. No instances of relapse have occurred in 2 years of follow-up. LESSONS: The present case is the extremely rare case in which MTX-related PHL and cranial neuropathy were involved together in the RA patient. It is necessary to examine long-term follow up hepatic and neurologic examinations that patient had a long history of receiving MTX therapy for RA.",,"antirheumatic agent; methotrexate; aged; case report; complication; cranial neuropathy; female; follow up; human; liver tumor; lymphoma; pathology; recurrent disease; rheumatoid arthritis; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cranial Nerve Diseases; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Lymphoma; Methotrexate; Recurrence",2-s2.0-85065322463

In addition, abdominal discomfort score of CSS slightly decreased in the GE group compared with the placebo group after the 12-week treatment (P?=?.060). However, stool consistency, total CSS score, and PAC-SYM score did not change significantly in both GE group and the placebo group over the 12-week treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: GE treatment for 12 weeks improved the stool symptom score on the PAC-SYM and abdominal discomfort score on the CSS in obese adults.

Methods: The participants were 54 parents of high-risk newborns in a NICU. Data were collected from January to March 2018. Parental stress and parents' perceptions of nurses' communication ability and styles were measured using a questionnaire. Results: The average scores for parental stress and nurses' communication ability were 3.39 and 4.38 respectively, on a 5-point scale. Parents most commonly reported that nurses showed a friendly communication style, followed by informative and authoritative styles. Mothers and fathers reported significantly different levels of parental stress. Parental stress showed a negative correlation with nurses' perceived verbal communication ability. Higher scores for nurses' verbal communication ability and for friendly and informative communication styles were associated with lower parental stress induced by the environment, the baby's appearance and behaviors, and treatments in the NICU. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that nurses need to offer proper information for parents and to support parents by encouraging them to express their emotions of stress and by providing parents with therapeutic communication and opportunities to participate in care. ? 2019 Korean Academy of Child Health Nursing.",Communication; Neonatal intensive care units; Newborn; Parents; Psychological stress; ??; ????; ???; ???????; ????,article; controlled study; father; female; human; human experiment; infant; major clinical study; male; mental stress; mother; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; nurse; parental stress; perception; questionnaire; verbal communication,2-s2.0-85065260569

Methods: Clinical data were collected from April 2016 to March 2018. Patients aged ?19 years with metastatic solid tumor were eligible. Bioimpedance analysis was used to assess body fluid distribution and the E/I ratio. Clinical characteristics, including laboratory test results and nutrition status according to the E/I ratio, were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to identify risk factors for mortality. Results: In total, 87 patients were included in the study. The 87 patients were divided into 2 groups according to the median E/I ratio: a high E/I group (E/I ratio ?1.0, n = 43) and a low E/I group (E/I ratio <1.0, n = 44). Poor performance status, fluid retention, malnutrition, elevation of C-reactive protein levels, and decreases in hemoglobin, albumin, and protein levels were significantly associated with the high E/I group. The median overall survival time was 1.6 and 12.5 months in the high E/I and low E/I groups, respectively (P <.001). In the multivariate analysis, poor performance status, leukocytosis, fluid retention, and E/I ratio were independent prognostic factors, and the E/I ratio was the strongest prognostic factor predicting overall survival (hazard ratio = 3.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.75-6.96, P <.001). Conclusions: The E/I ratio can predict survival time in patients with metastatic cancer. More rigorous research is required to confirm this result. ?

However, severe arthritic changes can cause chronic buttock or low back pain and can be misdiagnosed as another disease presenting with sacroiliitis such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 33-year-old woman was diagnosed with AS due to chronic buttock pain and progressive sacroiliitis on plain X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her buttock and low back pain gradually worsened despite proper treatment for AS. DIAGNOSIS: Computed tomography revealed an accessory SI joint with arthritic changes. INTERVENTIONS: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and restricted movement were prescribed. OUTCOMES: The symptoms were controlled with NSAIDs, rest, and restriction of excessive movement. The medication could be stopped after the pain subsided. LESSONS: An accessory SI joint can be a cause of chronic back pain and can be misdiagnosed as AS with sacroiliitis when progressive arthritic changes are observed.

Midazolam or remifentanil can often be coadministered because of their synergistic or additive effects with propofol as well as amnesic properties and the blockade of sympathetic stimulation. However, no study has confirmed the appropriate dose of propofol for loss of consciousness in aged patients when administered with other drugs, including opioids or benzodiazepines. METHODS: Patients >65 years scheduled for general anesthesia were enrolled. The patients were randomized into 3 groups using a computer-generated randomization table. Patients in group P (propofol) received only propofol for loss of consciousness, those in group PR (propofol-remifentanil) received remifentanil before propofol, and those in group PMR (propofol-midazolam-remifentanil) received remifentanil and midazolam before propofol. After propofol administration, loss of both eyelash reflex and verbal response represented success. The 95% effective dose of propofol for loss of consciousness in each group, which was the primary outcome, was determined using a modified biased coin up-and-down method. RESULTS: In total, 120 patients were randomized into the 3 groups (n?=?40). The 95% effective dose of propofol for loss of consciousness was 1.13, 0.87, and 0.72?mg/kg in groups P, PR, and PMR, respectively. The mean blood pressure (MBP) in group PMR was more significantly decreased before propofol injection (P?=?.041) as well as 2 minutes (P?=?.005) and 3 minutes after propofol administration (P<.001), compared with group P, but there were no intergroup differences at other time points. CONCLUSIONS: The effective dose of propofol for loss of consciousness in elderly patients could be decreased by 23% and 36% when remifentanil pretreatment was used without and with midazolam, respectively. However, the decrease in MBP was greater with remifentanil and midazolam pretreatment than with propofol alone. These findings suggest that pretreatment with midazolam for propofol infusions with remifentanil in elderly patients should be cautiously used, due to hemodynamic instability during induction.",,"intravenous anesthetic agent; midazolam; propofol; remifentanil; aged; combination drug therapy; consciousness; controlled study; dose response; drug effect; elderly care; female; general anesthesia; human; male; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; Aged; Anesthesia, General; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Consciousness; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Health Services for the Aged; Humans; Male; Midazolam; Propofol; Remifentanil; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85065095199

RBC transfusion is often inevitable to address intraoperative massive bleeding; it is a key component in safe perioperative patient management. Unlike general medical resources, packed RBCs (pRBCs) have limited availability because their supply relies entirely on voluntary donations. Additionally, excessive utilization of pRBCs may aggravate prognosis or increase the risk of developing infectious diseases. Appropriate perioperative RBC transfusion is, therefore, crucial for the management of patient safety and medical resource conservation. These concerns motivated us to develop the present clinical practice guideline for evidence-based efficient and safe perioperative RBC transfusion management considering the current clinical landscape. Methods: This guideline was obtained after the revision and refinement of exemplary clinical practice guidelines developed in advanced countries. This was followed by rigorous evidence-based reassessment considering the healthcare environment of the country. Results: This guideline covers all important aspects of perioperative RBC transfusion, such as preoperative anemia management, appropriate RBC storage period, and leukoreduction (removal of white blood cells using filters), reversal of perioperative bleeding tendency, strategies for perioperative RBC transfusion, appropriate blood management protocols, efforts to reduce blood transfusion requirements, and patient monitoring during a perioperative transfusion. Conclusions: This guideline will aid decisions related to RBC transfusion in healthcare settings and minimize patient risk associated with unnecessary pRBC transfusion. ?

Little is known about the roles of autophagy in endometriosis and, to date, the expression of autophagy-associated mRNAs has not been compared in patients with endometriosis and gynecologic cancers. This study therefore compared the levels of expression of autophagy-associated mRNAs in patients with endometriosis and gynecologic cancers. The levels of autophagy mRNAs, including those encoding mTOR, P13KC3, Beclin-1, Bcl-2, LC3 II, FLIP, Rubicon, BIRC2 and BIRC5, were measured by real time polymerase chain reaction in peritoneal fluid of 27 patients with benign masses (control group), 42 patients with endometriosis, and 43 patients with gynecologic (ovarian, uterine, and cervical) cancers. Findings in the three groups were compared. Autophagy mRNAs were present in all samples from patients with endometriosis and gynecologic cancers. The levels of PI3K, FLIP, and Rubicon mRNAs were significantly higher in the endometriosis than in the control group (p < 0.05 each). Compared with the gynecologic cancer group, the levels of LC3II and FLIP mRNAs were significantly lower, and the levels of Beclin-1 and Rubicon mRNAs significantly higher, in the endometriosis group (p < 0.05 each). Levels of PI3K and FLIP mRNA were significantly higher in the endometriosis and gynecologic cancer groups than in the control group (p < 0.05 each). PI3K, FLIP, and Rubicon mRNAs are closely associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The similar increases in PI3K and FLIP mRNA expression observed in patients with endometriosis and gynecologic cancer suggest that these conditions have similar autophagic characteristics. The lower levels of Beclin-1 mRNA in the gynecologic cancer than in other two groups suggest that lower Beclin-1 mRNA levels increase the likelihood of developing gynecologic cancer. ? 2019 The Authors",Autophagy; Endometriosis; Gynecologic cancer,baculoviral IAP repeat containing protein; baculoviral IAP repeat containing protein 2; baculoviral IAP repeat containing protein 5; beclin 1; beta actin; complementary DNA; FLICE inhibitory protein; lc3 ii protein; mammalian target of rapamycin; messenger RNA; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein; protein bcl 2; rubicon protein; unclassified drug; adult; Article; autophagy; benign neoplasm; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; endometriosis; female; female genital tract cancer; human; major clinical study; ovary cancer; pathogenesis; peritoneal fluid; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; uterine cervix cancer; uterus cancer,2-s2.0-85064458630

We investigated the effects of 5?cmH2O of PEEP on intraocular pressure and optic nerve sheath diameter as a surrogate for intracranial pressure in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Fifty patients scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were divided into a zero-PEEP (ZEEP) group and a 5?cmH2O of PEEP (PEEP) group. Intraocular pressure, optic nerve sheath diameter, and respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were measured before induction (T0), 10?minutes after induction of general anesthesia in the supine position before CO2 insufflation (T1), 5?minutes (T2), and 30?minutes (T3) after steep Trendelenburg positioning with pneumoperitoneum, after desufflation of pneumoperitoneum in the supine position (T4), and after 30?minutes in the recovery room postoperatively (T5). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in intraocular pressure or optic nerve sheath diameter between the groups during the study. The partial pressure of arterial oxygen and dynamic lung compliance at T1, T2, T3, and T4 were significantly higher in the PEEP than in the ZEEP group. There was no difference in mean arterial pressure or heart rate between groups at any time. CONCLUSION: Applying 5?cmH2O of PEEP did not increase intraocular pressure or optic nerve sheath diameter during pneumoperitoneum with steep Trendelenburg positioning in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. These results suggest that low PEEP can be safely applied during surgery with pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg positioning in patients without preexisting eye disease and brain pathology.",,"carbon dioxide; aged; anatomy and histology; artificial pneumoperitoneum; controlled study; head-down tilt; human; intracranial pressure; intraocular pressure; laparoscopy; male; middle aged; myelin sheath; optic nerve; positive end expiratory pressure; procedures; prostatectomy; randomized controlled trial; robotic surgical procedure; Aged; Carbon Dioxide; Head-Down Tilt; Humans; Intracranial Pressure; Intraocular Pressure; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Myelin Sheath; Optic Nerve; Pneumoperitoneum, Artificial; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Prostatectomy; Robotic Surgical Procedures",2-s2.0-85064240019

A total of 874 eyes from 442 HM subjects older than 55 years were identified and 104 eyes of 54 patients (72 ± 11 years) were included in the study and followed up for 23.5 ± 19.5 months. The estimated AMD frequency in HM subjects over 55 years was 11.9% (95% confidence interval; 9.8%–14.0%). A total of 34 of 104 eyes were diagnosed with drusen, 22 with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), 28 with both drusen and RPD, and 20 with geographic atrophy. Neovascularization was detected in 52 eyes (50%), and type 1 was the most frequent form (39 eyes, 75%). Overall, NV was treated with 4.6 ± 2.6 anti-VEGF injections. Eyes with treatment-na??ve NV at baseline (n = 34) required 3.8 ± 1.5 anti-VEGF injections during the first year of treatment. This exceeded the injection number in the purely myopic population (1.8 to 3.6 injections for the first year). CONCLUSIONS. This study provides evidence to suggest that older patients with HM are at a significant risk of the dry and neovascular forms of AMD. NV in eyes with HM and AMD required more injections in the first year compared to NV in HM eyes without AMD. ? 2019 The Authors.",Age-related macular degeneration; Choroidal neovascularization; Drusen; Geographic atrophy; High myopia; Pseudodrusen,"aflibercept; bevacizumab; ranibizumab; vasculotropin antibody; angiogenesis inhibitor; adult; age related macular degeneration; aged; angiogenesis; Article; atrophy; biomicroscopy; central macular thickness; choroidal thickness; drusen; eye axis length; female; fluorescence angiography; human; hypertension; image quality; keratopathy; major clinical study; male; middle aged; myopia; near infrared reflectance spectroscopy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; ophthalmoscopy; optical coherence tomography; phenotype; photodynamic therapy; prevalence; priority journal; refraction error; retrospective study; visual acuity; degenerative myopia; drusen; geographic atrophy; Italy; macular degeneration; pathology; phenotype; prevalence; subretinal neovascularization; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Choroidal Neovascularization; Female; Geographic Atrophy; Humans; Italy; Macular Degeneration; Male; Middle Aged; Myopia, Degenerative; Phenotype; Prevalence; Retinal Drusen; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85064205126

Methods: At baseline, patients were converted from cyclosporine-based to PR-T-based immunosuppression and randomized (1:1) to receive either corticosteroids maintained at prestudy dose (standard-dose group) or tapered from week 4 to 50% of the prestudy dose by week 12 (reduced-dose group). Patients were seen at baseline and weeks 1, 4, 12, and 24. The primary endpoint was change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (Modification-of-Diet-in-Renal-Disease-4) between baseline and week 24. Secondary endpoints included either acute rejection or patient-reported satisfaction with PR-T. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Results: Overall, 150 patients were randomized into a reduced-dose group (n = 73) and a standard-dose group (n = 77). At week 24, mean ± standard deviation for corticosteroid dose was 2.5 ± 0.9 mg and 5.0 ± 1.3 mg, respectively. Mean change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to week 24 was +1.5 ± 9.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P =.1567) and +3.4 ± 10.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P =.0065), respectively, and not significantly different between groups. There were no acute rejection episodes. Most respondents (&gt;70%) considered PR-T more convenient than cyclosporine. AE incidence was similar between groups. The most common AEs experienced by ?3% of patients in either treatment group were gastrointestinal events (20.8% and 28.6% of patients receiving reduced- and standard-dose corticosteroids, respectively). Most AEs in both treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity. Conclusion: Renal function was maintained following conversion from cyclosporine to PR-T, irrespective of corticosteroid regimen; PR-T enables reduced corticosteroid dosage. ? 2019 The Authors",,corticosteroid; cyclosporine; tacrolimus; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; immunosuppressive agent; tacrolimus; acute graft rejection; adult; age; aged; Article; clinical assessment; clinical practice; controlled study; diarrhea; disease severity; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug response; drug safety; estimated glomerular filtration rate; exploratory research; female; gingiva hyperplasia; graft recipient; human; hypertrichosis; immunosuppressive treatment; incidence; kidney donor; kidney failure; kidney function; kidney transplantation; Korea; major clinical study; male; morning dosage; multicenter study; patient satisfaction; phase 4 clinical trial; physical examination; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; sustained drug release; treatment duration; treatment outcome; urticaria; vital sign; clinical trial; delayed release formulation; drug therapy; glomerulus filtration rate; graft recipient; graft rejection; methodology; middle aged; procedures; South Korea; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Cyclosporine; Delayed-Action Preparations; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Graft Rejection; Humans; Immunosuppression; Immunosuppressive Agents; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Republic of Korea; Research Design; Tacrolimus; Transplant Recipients,2-s2.0-85064071575

In this study, we investigated the usage status of pharmacopuncture among Korean medicine doctors (KMDs) and differences in satisfaction regarding pharmacopuncture use. Methods: We conducted a self-reporting online survey via e-mail from April 25 to 7 May 7, 2018, and analyzed the responses of a total of 393 KMDs. Results: Eighty-eight percent of respondents had used pharmacopuncture during the previous year. Their average clinical experience of using pharmacopuncture was 8.04 years and the percentage of patients treated using pharmacopuncture was 39.2%. Pharmacopuncture was used mainly to treat musculoskeletal, neurological, and gastrointestinal diseases. Bee venom and blood stasis pharmacopuncture were the most commonly used types. Participants were highly satisfied with treatment efficacy but were less satisfied with treatment cost. KMD satisfaction with pharmacopuncture was assessed with regards to two aspects: practitioner and patient (as evaluated by the practitioner) satisfaction. In both cases, satisfaction with pharmacopuncture was high in KMDs who use it for gastrointestinal diseases. However, practitioner satisfaction was low among KMDs who used bee venom and blood stasis pharmacopuncture, whereas patient satisfaction was high among those KMDs who treated them using ginseng pharmacopuncture. Discussion/Conclusions: Satisfaction with pharmacopuncture treatment tended to contrast with the frequency of use. Although KMDs are currently focusing on pain-related disorders, our results indicate that pharmacopuncture can be highly applicable in other areas such as the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases; however, this needs to be verified by further research. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH",Complementary therapy; Korean traditional medicine; Pharmacopuncture; Traditional therapy; Treatment satisfaction; Usage status,bee venom; acupuncture; adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; controlled study; e-mail; endocrine disease; female; gastrointestinal disease; ginseng; gynecologic disease; hemostasis; herbal medicine; human; Korean medicine; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal disease; neurologic disease; patient satisfaction; pharmacopuncture; physician; priority journal; self concept; urogenital tract disease,2-s2.0-85064001263

However, the clinical significance of MRSA positive for the qacA and qacB chlorhexidine tolerance genes has not been established. We investigated the clinical features and predictive factors of MRSA bloodstream infection (BSI) isolates, caused by qacA- and qacB-positive MRSA, from 2010 to 2016 at a tertiary hospital in South Korea. A total of 246 MRSA BSI isolates were included; 71 (28.9%) isolates carried qacA/B. The annual frequency of qacA- and qacB-positive MRSA bacteremia did not change significantly over the study period. Patients infected with qacA- and qacB-positive MRSA had common risk factors for health care-associated infections, including prior antibiotic use, central venous catheterization in situ, intensive care unit-acquired bacteremia, and nosocomial infection. The qacA- and qacB-positive isolates were also associated with an increasing chlorhexidine MIC and resistance to nonlactam antibiotics. The qacA- and qacB-positive isolates were more likely to belong to sequence type 5 (ST5), which is a common health care-associated MRSA strain in South Korea. In multivariable analyses, qacA- and qacB-positive MRSA isolates were found to be associated with agr dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.59 to 16.10), ST5 MRSA strain (aOR, 4.96; 95% CI, 1.85 to 13.26), nosocomial infection (aOR, 4.88; 95% CI, 2.20 to 10.83), and antibiotic use within the previous 3 months (aOR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.20 to 5.59).

However, the therapeutic concept with radiolabeled folate conjugates has not yet been applied to clinical applications owing to the high renal absorbed dose. The effectiveness of targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) depends primarily on the absorbed dose rate and on the total absorbed dose delivered to the tumor and to normal tissue. Owing to various limitations associated with organ level dosimetry, voxel-based dosimetry has become essential for the assessment of a more accurate absorbed dose during TRT. In this study, we synthesized iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP)-conjugated radiolabeled folate (177Lu-IONP-Folate) and performed voxel-based dosimetry using SPECT/CT images of normal mice through direct Geant4 application for emission tomography (GATE) Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We also prepared 177Lu-Folate and 177Lu-IONPs for the comparison of absorbed doses with that of 177Lu-IONP-Folate. In addition, we calculated the mean absorbed dose at the organ-level using the medical internal radiation dose (MIRD) schema. The radioactivities of all three radiotracers were mainly accumulated in the liver and kidneys immediately after injection. For the kidneys, the voxel-based absorbed doses obtained with 177Lu-IONP-Folate, 177Lu-Folate, and 177Lu-IONPs were 1.01 ± 0.17, 2.46 ± 0.50, and 0.52 ± 0.08 Gy/MBq, respectively. The renal absorbed dose decreased significantly (?half) when 177Lu-IONP-Folate was used compared with when the 177Lu-Folate only was used. The mean absorbed dose values obtained at organ-level using the MIRD schema were comparable to voxel-based absorbed doses estimated with GATE MC. The voxel-based absorbed dose values obtained in this study of individualized activity show that the renal absorbed dose could be reduced to almost half with 177Lu-IONP-Folate. Therefore, 177Lu-IONP-Folate could be clinically applicable in the TRT of folate receptor-positive cancers in a personalized manner when using the voxel-based dosimetry method. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.",absorbed dose; folate; GATE; IONPs; MIRD; SPECT/CT; voxel-based,folic acid; lutetium 177; ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide; animal experiment; animal model; Article; binding affinity; comparative study; controlled study; dosimetry; drug brain level; heart; human; human cell; image reconstruction; in vitro study; liver; lung; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; radiation dose; radioactivity; single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography; tissue distribution; voxel based dosimetry,2-s2.0-85063535591

Combination therapy improves patient compliance. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the combination therapies telmisartan/amlodipine + rosuvastatin, telmisartan/amlodipine, and telmisartan + rosuvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Methods: In this Phase III, multicenter, 8-week randomized, double-blind study, participants with hypertension and dyslipidemia (defined as a sitting systolic blood pressure [sitSBP] of ?140 mm Hg, a low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [LDL-C] level of ?250 mg/dL, and a triglyceride level of ?400 mg/dL) were screened. After a 4-week washout/run-in period involving therapeutic lifestyle changes and telmisartan 80 mg once a day, eligible patients had a sitSBP of ?140 mm Hg and met the LDL-C level criteria according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III cardiovascular disease risk category. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) telmisartan/amlodipine 80/10 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg (TAR group); (2) telmisartan/amlodipine 80/10 mg (TA group); or (3) telmisartan 80 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg (TR group). The primary efficacy end points were the percentage changes from baseline in LDL-C in the TAR and TA groups and the mean changes in sitSBP in the TAR and TR groups at week 8 compared to baseline. Continuous variables were compared using the unpaired t test or the Wilcoxon rank sum model, and categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 or Fisher exact test. Tolerability was assessed based on adverse events found on physical examination including vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, and 12-lead ECG. Findings: A total of 134 patients were enrolled. The least squares mean percentage changes in LDL-C at 8 weeks after administration of the drug compared to baseline were ?51.9% (3.0%) in the TAR group and ?3.2% (2.9%) in the TA group (P &lt; 0.001). At 8 weeks after baseline, the least squares mean (SE) changes sitSBP were ?28.3 (2.4) mm Hg in the TAR group and ?10.7 (2.1) mm Hg in the TR group (P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were 15.0%, 25.0%, and 12.2% in the TAR, TA, and TR groups, respectively; those of adverse drug reactions were 15.0%, 22.7%, and 10.2%. None of the differences in rates were significant among 3 groups. Implications: Triple therapy with TAR can be an effective treatment in patients with dyslipidemia and hypertension. The TAR combination has value for hypertensive patients with hyperlipidemia in terms of convenience, tolerability, and efficacy.

However, instability and poor bioavailability have been major challenges for delivering Vitamin D 3 . The objective of this study was to formulate improved nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) vitamin D 3 emulsions. We tested the effect of different carrier oils and the use of a solid lipid nanoparticle emulsifier, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) on the stability of the vitamin D 3 emulsions. In contrast to the control that used glyceryl monostearate (GMS) the PGPR substitution resulted in relatively small particle sizes (0.30 to 0.43 μm), with high absolute value of zeta potentials (39.5 to 67.8 mV) and high encapsulation efficiency (85.2% to 90.4%). The stability of the NLC emulsions against environmental stresses was evaluated under varying conditions of ionic strength, pH, freeze–thaw cycles, and storage at different temperatures. Although NLC emulsions were stable at high ionic strengths, they were found to be unstable at low pH (&lt;3), which led to aggregation and coalescence of emulsion droplets. In case of freeze–thaw stress, although relatively stable compared to control NLC, the PGPR substituted groups exhibited a slight increase in particle size and a decrease in zeta potential when the cycle was repeated five times. Additionally, we found that PGPR-substituted emulsions showed higher liquid dispersion stability than controls at 25 and 65 °C. Thus, we have formulated a modified NLC vitamin D 3 emulsion that can be widely used in the food industry. Practical Application: Vitamin D 3 , an essential micronutrient, is often added as supplements in food products and beverages for added health benefits.

Methods: Twenty-eight boys and 27 girls with obesity (BMI ?95th percentile, 12-18 years) were randomly assigned to 3-month interventions (180 minutes per week) of AE or RE. Changes in total and regional fat and skeletal muscle distribution were assessed by a whole-body magnetic resonance imaging. Results: After controlling for corresponding baseline values, age, and race, changes in body weight, BMI, BMI z-score, and waist circumference were similar between exercise groups (p &gt; 0.05) and sexes (p &gt; 0.05). There were no sex or exercise group differences in the reductions in total fat, total SAT, visceral fat, or intermuscular fat. With AE, boys had greater (p &lt; 0.05) reductions in abdominal SAT as compared with girls. With RE, boys had greater (p &lt; 0.05) increases in total, upper body, and abdominal skeletal muscle as compared with girls. Independent of exercise modality, the improvement in VO 2max was greater (p &lt; 0.05) in boys than in girls. Independent of sex, the increase in muscular strength index was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the RE vs. AE group. Conclusion: With the exception of abdominal SAT, there were no sex or exercise treatment differences in the reductions in total and regional fat. In response to RE, the increases in total and regional skeletal muscle were significantly greater in boys than in girls. ? 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",adipose tissue; adolescents; childhood obesity; exercise; skeletal muscle,,2-s2.0-85062831921

Inflammation is mediated by cytokine secretion from RSV?infected airway epithelial cells. Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) exhibits potent antioxidant capacity, as well as anti?bacterial, anti?viral, anti?carcinogenic, anti?inflammatory and anti?allergic actions. However, few studies have explored the anti?inflammatory effects of GSPE on airway epithelial cells infected with RSV. Airway epithelial A549 cells were pretreated with GSPE and its effects on cytokine production during RSV infection were investigated. A549 cells were infected with RSV, with or without GSPE pretreatment, and cultured for 24, 48 and 72 h. The expression of interleukin (IL)?1β, IL?6 and IL?8, were measured by reverse transcription?quantitative polymerase chain reaction, ELISA and western blotting. RSV infection induced significant increases in proinflammatory cytokine expression. However, GSPE pretreatment decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL?1?, IL?6 and IL?8. GSPE regulated the immune response by reducing the RSV?induced transcription of proinflammatory cytokines in airway epithelial cells, suggesting that GSPE helps to prevent RSV?induced airway disease. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Methods: We prospectively enrolled 12 patients with BMS and 14 healthy controls. Volumetric T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo imaging and pseudo-continuous ASL were performed to obtain GMV and CBF, respectively. We analyzed differences in the GMV and CBF between the two groups, and their correlations with clinical parameters. Results: The GMV was smaller in the left thalamus and left middle temporal gyrus in the BMS group when compared to controls. Regional CBF in the BMS group was significantly decreased in the left middle temporal gyrus, left insula, right middle temporal gyrus, and right insula compared with controls. In BMS patients, there was a significant correlation between GMV and pain severity in the left middle temporal gyrus. Conclusion: The reduced GMV seen in the thalami of BMS patients is consistent with the pattern observed in those with chronic pain disease, which implies that the pathogenesis of BMS may be associated with atrophy of the brain structures associated with thalamocortical processing.

Therefore, this trial is designed to propose a protocol to investigate the efficacy and economic efficiency of CMT on TMD, compared to usual care (UC). Methods: This trial is a prospective, assessor-blinded, two-arm parallel multicenter randomized controlled trial. Eighty patients with temporomandibular disorder, with numeric rating scale (NRS) above 4, will be randomly assigned to either the CMT or the UC group, with a 1:1 ratio. Participants will be recruited by five Korean Medicine hospitals. Participants will be treated eight times for 4 weeks, and will be assessed for pain, range of motion, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Adverse events will also be reported. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness, medical consumption data (quality of life questionnaire) will be used to assess indices such as the Quality Adjusted Life Year. Discussion: There were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of CMT for TMD, however, evidence is evaluated as “Low”. For this reason, this trial was designed as a high-quality RCT protocol. Conclusion: We expect that this trial will contribute new knowledge on the effects of CMT for TMD, so that an economically efficient way of treatment could be developed and standardized, providing more populations with the benefits of an effective and economic treatment for TMD. ? 2019 The Authors",Chuna manual therapy temporomandibular disorder; Protocol; Randomized controlled trial,adverse event; Article; clinical effectiveness; clinical research; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; depression; human; jaw disease; jaw pain; Korean medicine; manipulative medicine; multicenter study; parallel design; priority journal; prospective study; quality adjusted life year; randomized controlled trial; range of motion,2-s2.0-85062168628

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of 3 imaging methods for the detection of bone invasion in upper and lower gingival cancer: computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) and CT. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients who underwent a maxillectomy or a mandibulectomy for gingival cancer. Each preoperative image (CT, MRI, or PET/CT) was reviewed for the presence of bone invasion, and the possibility for bone invasion was graded. These results were verified with pathology reports. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the detection of mandibular involvement in alveolar bone were calculated, and a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed. Results: Forty patients (27 men and 13 women) were enrolled. Pathologic examination disclosed bone invasion in 25 of the 40 patients. Of these patients, 13 had maxillary and 12 had mandibular alveolus involvement. The diagnostic accuracy of CT (90.0%) was highest among the 3 modalities for the detection of bone invasion. In the ROC curve analysis, values for the area under the curve for upper gingival cancer were lower than those for lower gingival cancer. Conclusions: The 3 imaging methods were less sensitive for the detection of bone invasion in upper gingival cancer than in lower gingival cancer. Cases of upper gingival cancer should be evaluated more carefully for bone invasion before surgery. ? 2018 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",,adult; aged; Article; bone metastasis; clinical article; cohort analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; female; gingival cancer; human; intermethod comparison; male; mouth cancer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; x-ray computed tomography,2-s2.0-85060973579

Current understanding of people who would be involved in advance care planning (ACP) is crucial to disseminate it systematically. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate awareness and attitudes toward ACP in South Korea. Methods: A multicenter, nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted, a survey regarding ACP among four groups that would have different positions and experiences: 1001 cancer patients, 1006 family caregivers, 928 physicians, and 1241 members of the general public. Results: A total of 15% of the general population, 33% of the patients and caregivers, and 61% of the physicians had knowledge of advance directives. More than 64% of the general population, above 72% of the patients and caregivers, and 97% of the physicians were willing to do so when the disease status was aggravated or terminal. The possibility for changing the plan, uncertainty as to whether directives would actually be followed, and psychological discomfort were common reasons for not wanting to engage in ACP. Routine recommendations for a specific medical condition, heightened accessibility, and health insurance support were common factors that could help facilitate ACP. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that strategies for promoting ACP should reflect different perspectives among the general public, patients, family caregivers, and physicians. Public advocacy, resources for approaching and integrating ACP into routine health care, as well as systematic support provisions are needed. ? 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine",Advance care planning; advance directives; decision-making; life support care; terminal care,adult; advance care planning; Article; cancer patient; caregiver; cross-sectional study; decision making; education; employment status; family; female; health care access; health insurance; human; life sustaining treatment; living will; major clinical study; male; patient attitude; physician attitude; South Korea; terminal care; terminal disease,2-s2.0-85060851023

Methods: The clinical records of patients who received TEP hernia repair from August 2007 to September 2016 were reviewed. The patients were categorized into two groups: younger than 70 and 70?years or older. The patient demographics, operative time, estimated blood loss, rate of open conversion, complications, length of hospital stay, rate of readmission, rate of recurrence were compared. Results: A total of 425 cases were documented. 317 (74.6%) patients were younger than 70?years and 108 (25.4%) were 70?years or older. The mean ages were 51.6?years in the younger group and 75.3?years in the older group.

Factors analyzed for delay in recovery included duration of preoperative symptoms; number of preoperative local corticosteroid injections; preoperative flexion contracture of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint; multiplicity of trigger finger lesions; occupation; presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, other hand disorders like carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain disease, or Dupuytren contracture; and fraying or partial tear of the flexor tendon. Results: Twenty-six fingers (19.3%) showed prolonged postoperative symptoms, with mean time until complete relief being 14.0 ± 6.4 weeks (range, 9–34 weeks). Risk factors associated with prolonged postoperative symptoms included duration of preoperative symptoms, preoperative flexion contracture of the PIP joint, and fraying or partial tear of the flexor tendon. Conclusions: Physicians should consider the duration of preoperative symptoms and preoperative flexion contracture of the PIP joint when deciding timing of surgery for trigger finger patients. In addition, they should explain to patients with a positive history of these factors and in whom flexor tendon injury is found during surgery about the possibility of prolonged postoperative symptoms.

We analyzed the research and development (R&D) budget of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in 2018 and compared the results with those of the 2015 Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study. Methods: The 2018 MOHW R&D Project integrated implementation plan was used to analyze the R&D budget of the MOHW. The budget was allocated according to the KNBD disease group and according to the budget lines. The allocated budget was compared with the economic burden and the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015. Also, for budget targets for risk factors, DALYs of attributable risk factors were compared with corresponding budgets. Results: In 2018, the MOHW major R&D budget of USD 435.1 million accounted for 3% of the total government budget. Within the disease specific R&D budget, 35.9% was allocated to communicable disease groups, 64.1% to non-communicable diseases, and 0% to injury and violence. Among level 2 disease groups, neoplasm was ranked first. Among risk factors, climate change and behavioral risk were targeted for R&D. Conclusions: It would be difficult to say that current R&D allocations focus to minimize the burden of disease. A mismatch was observed between the R&D budget and the burden of disease in terms of economic burden and DALYs. There was a similar finding for risk factors R&D. A novel approach for allocating government R&D funding that is based on the goal of minimizing the disease burden in the Korean population should be considered. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Burden of Disease; Korea; R&D Funding,economics; global disease burden; health care policy; human; quality adjusted life year; research; resource allocation; Global Burden of Disease; Health Policy; Humans; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Research; Resource Allocation,2-s2.0-85063511158

However, not all cancers avidly take up glucose, suggesting heterogeneity in their metabolic demand. Thus, we aim to generate a genomic signature of glucose hypermetabolism in breast cancer and examine its clinical relevance. To identify genes significantly associated with glucose uptake, gene expression data were analyzed together with the standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of 18 F-fluorodeoxy-glucose on positron emission tomography (PET) for 11 breast cancers. The resulting PET signature was evaluated for prognostic significance in four large independent patient cohorts (n = 5417). Potential upstream regulators accountable for the high glucose uptake were identified by gene network analysis. A PET signature of 242 genes was significantly correlated with SUVmax in breast cancer. In all four cohorts, high PET signature was significantly associated with poorer prognosis. The prognostic value of this PET signature was further supported by Cox regression analyses (hazard ratio 1.7, confidential interval 1.48–2.02; P &lt; 0.001). The PET signature was also strongly correlated with previously established prognostic genomic signatures such as PAM50, Oncotype DX, and NKI. Gene network analyses suggested that MYC and TBX2 were the most significant upstream transcription factors in the breast cancers with high glucose uptake. A PET signature reflecting high glucose uptake is a novel independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. MYC and TBX2 are potential regulators of glucose uptake. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",18 F-fluorodeoxy-glucose; Breast cancer; MYC; Positron emission tomography; TBX2,"fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; Myc protein; transcription factor; transcription factor TBX2; unclassified drug; glucose; adverse outcome; Article; breast cancer; cancer prognosis; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease activity; disease association; gene expression; genetic marker; genetic screening; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; human; maximum standardized uptake value; metabolic regulation; positron emission tomography; predictive value; priority journal; protein function; reference value; sensitivity and specificity; standardized uptake value; breast tumor; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; glycolysis; metabolism; positron emission tomography; procedures; prognosis; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glucose; Glycolysis; Humans; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prognosis",2-s2.0-85061565753

To identify the risk loci for CAA susceptibility in patients with KD, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using our previous Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 KD patients) and a new replication study in an independent sample set (713 KD patients) by grouping KD patients without CAA (control) versus KD patients with extremely large aneurysms (diameter ? 5?mm) (case).

Epigastric pain is a frequent complication of ESD. However, little is known about its incidence and associated factors. This study evaluated pain incidence and characteristics of patients with pain after gastric ESD. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively collected registry of clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic results of patients who underwent ESD for gastric adenoma or cancer from January 2010 to December 2015. A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain immediately after, and 2, 12, and 24?h after ESD. The primary outcome was the use of painkillers (VAS score > 4). Analyzed data included age, sex, pathology, specimen and tumor size, procedure time, and tumor location. Results: Of 1226 patients, 461 (36.4%) needed a painkiller at least once after ESD (pain group). Compared with the no pain group, the pain group had more females, less alcohol consumption, larger tumor and specimen size, and more antral lesions. In multivariate analysis, female sex (OR 1.559, 95% CI 1.217–1.996, p < 0.001), antral tumor location (OR 1.780, 95% CI 1.398–2.265, p < 0.001), and procedure time over 30?min (OR 1.443, 95% CI 1.130–1.842, p = 0.003) were predictive factors for pain. Conclusion: This study showed that a considerable number of patients needed one or more painkiller doses after gastric ESD. The factors affecting pain included sex, procedure time, and lesion location.

Drugs to treat these side effects are urgently needed in the clinic, since there is no clearly defined medication for treating these symptoms. Previous studies demonstrated that the herbal formula, PM014, is effective for radiation-induced lung injury and fibrosis in mice. In this study, we investigated gene expression profiles to understand the mechanism of action behind the effects of PM014 on radiation induced damage in immortalized lung epithelial cells, MLE12. We performed QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq analysis on the mRNA from radiation treated MLE-12 cells in the presence and absence of PM014. Transcriptome analysis found that 217 genes were significantly affected by PM014. Among them (217 genes, > twofold, p value < 0.05, 4 normalize), 77 genes were found to be upregulated, and 140 genes were downregulated in response to PM014 treatment in a dose dependent manner. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, we found that genes involved in cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathways were the most strongly affected by PM014. Based on these data, we selected 20 genes, and performed real-time PCR. Expression of 11 genes, including IL-18, IL-12a, Tnfrsf9, IL-17, CCR5, Blnk, Irf8, Nrros, TGF-β, Relt, and Cxcl2 was increased after irradiation, while PM014 treatment showed the reversed expression pattern of these genes. Therefore, PM014 may be useful for the treatment of radiation induced lung injury by modulating genes involved in cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathway. ? 2018, Institute of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Inflammation; Irradiation; MLE-12; PM014,erythropoietin; interleukin 12p35; interleukin 18; messenger RNA; platelet derived growth factor; transcriptome; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; Blnk gene; carbon metabolism; CCR5 gene; Cxcl 2 gene; down regulation; fibrosis; gene; gene expression profiling; gene insertion; human; IL 17 gene; IL 2a gene; Irf8 gene; irradiation; lung epithelium; lung parenchyma; mouse; multigene family; nonhuman; Nrros gene; PDK1 gene; priority journal; protein interaction; radiation; radiation induced fibrosis; real time polymerase chain reaction; Relt gene; RNA sequence; TGF beta gene; Tnfrsf9 gene; upregulation,2-s2.0-85063045501

This study protocol is aimed at showing the effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture therapy for stroke survivors with shoulder pain. Methods: After assessing their eligibility, 60 stroke survivors with shoulder pain will be enrolled from two traditional Korean medicine hospitals and randomly divided into either the verum or the sham electroacupuncture (EA) group with a 1:1 ratio. The participants will receive 9 sessions of EA procedures for 3 weeks. The verum EA consists of needling on 6 unilateral acupoints (LI4, LI15, TE14, SI9, SI11, and GB21) with electronic stimulation. A non-penetrating Park sham device and fake electronic stimulation will be used in the sham group on the same acupoints. Patients and outcome assessors will be blinded throughout the entire study. A visual analog scale will be used primarily for the evaluation, and pain rating scale, Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity, modified Ashworth scale, manual muscle test, passive range of motion test, Korean version of a modified Barthel index, and Korean version of the Beck depression inventory will be also be measured. A blinding index will be assessed. For safety, adverse events will be recorded. Data will be statistically analyzed by two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for efficacy and a chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for safety, at 5% of significance level.

We aimed to compare the survival rate and clinical outcomes of UKA in SONK and medial compartment osteoarthritis (MOA) via a meta-analysis of previous studies. Materials and methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched up to January 2018 with keywords related to SONK and knee arthroplasty. Studies were selected with predetermined inclusion criteria: (1) medial UKA as the primary procedure, (2) reporting implant survival or clinical outcomes of osteonecrosis and osteoarthritis, and (3) follow-up period > 1?year. Quality assessment was performed using the risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomized studies. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR) and standardized mean difference. Results: The incidence of UKA revision for any reason was significantly higher in SONK than in MOA group (pooled RR = 1.83, p = 0.009). However, the risk of revision due to aseptic loosening was not significantly different between the groups. Moreover, when stratified by the study quality, high-quality studies showed similar risk of overall revision in SONK and MOA (p = 0.71). Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in failure between SONK and MOA after cemented mobile and fixed bearing UKA. Results of uncemented UKA were reported only in one study, which showed higher failure of SONK compared to MOA. Clinical outcomes after UKA were similar between SONK and MOA (p = 0.66). Conclusions: Cemented UKA has similar survival and clinical outcomes in SONK and MOA. Prospective studies designed specifically to compare the UKA outcomes in SONK and MOA are necessary. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Arthroplasty; Knee; Osteoarthritis; Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee; Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty; Unicondylar knee arthroplasty,"body mass; bone necrosis; disease association; effect size; follow up; human; knee arthroplasty; knee disease; knee osteoarthritis; knee spontaneous osteonecrosis; medial compartment osteoarthritis; meta analysis; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; prosthesis loosening; Review; surgical risk; systematic review; treatment outcome; unicompartmental knee arthroplasty; bone necrosis; knee osteoarthritis; knee replacement; postoperative complication; procedures; reoperation; statistics and numerical data; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Humans; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Osteonecrosis; Postoperative Complications; Reoperation; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85060677254

Although several risk factors for CAN progression have been established, whether CAN is reversible remains unclear and the clinical factors associated with CAN recovery have not been identified. This study aimed to determine clinical factors related to CAN recovery. Methods: Type 2 diabetes patients with CAN but free of cardiovascular disease at baseline were enrolled and followed for 2-3 years in this retrospective longitudinal study. CAN was classified as early (one abnormal parasympathetic test), definite (two or more abnormal parasympathetic tests), severe (definite plus orthostatic hypotension), or atypical (early plus orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension alone) based on Ewing's method. CAN recovery was classified as partial or complete: Partial recovery was defined as one-step improvement in CAN stage (early to normal, definite to early, or severe to definite), including the disappearance of only one abnormal result in any stage. Complete recovery was defined as normalization from definite or severe CAN. Results: Among 759 subjects with CAN, 29.9% (n = 227) experienced CAN recovery, and 1.2% (n = 9) recovered completely. In a multivariate model, younger age (odds ratio [OR] per 5-year decrease 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.78, P < 0.001), shorter duration of diabetes (OR per 5-year decrease 1.33; 95% CI 1.05-1.67, P = 0.016), presence of micro/macroalbuminuria (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15-0.78, P = 0.011), body weight reduction (OR per 1-kg decrease 1.11; 95% CI 1.02-1.21, P = 0.016), and HbA1c reduction (OR per 1% decrease 1.32; 95% CI 1.05-1.67, P = 0.019) were significantly associated with composite events of partial and complete CAN recovery. Age had the highest relative significance among the associated clinical factors. In addition, younger age was the only significant factor in complete CAN recovery. Conclusions: Younger age was the most important factor in CAN recovery in subjects with type 2 diabetes, including recovery from the definite or severe stage. HbA1c reduction, body weight reduction, no concurrent micro/macroalbuminuria, and shorter duration of diabetes were also significantly associated with CAN recovery. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy; Recovery; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,"hemoglobin A1c; biological marker; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; adult; age distribution; Article; autonomic neuropathy; body weight loss; cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular disease assessment; cholinergic system; confidence interval; controlled study; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic patient; disease duration; disease severity; Ewing method; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; macroalbuminuria; major clinical study; male; microalbuminuria; neurologic examination; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; odds ratio; orthostatic hypotension; retrospective study; risk factor; age; aged; autonomic nervous system; autonomic neuropathy; blood; blood pressure; cardiovascular system; complication; convalescence; diabetic neuropathy; innervation; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; risk factor; time factor; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Autonomic Nervous System; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Biomarkers; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular System; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Neuropathies; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Weight Loss",2-s2.0-85062764796

A multi-center RCT (randomized controlled trial) to compare the quality of life (QOL) of patients undergoing totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) and laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) for gastric cancer, named as KLASS 07, has been currently prepared in Korea. Methods: Patients diagnosed as gastric cancer, with clinical stage IA (T1N0M0) or IB (T1N1M0 / T2N0M0) according to the 7th edition of the Americal Joint Committee on Cancer System, were randomized to receive either TLDG or LADG. For surgical quality control, the surgeons participating in this trial had to have performed at least 50 gastrectomies and at least 30 gastrectomies annually (regardless of open or laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer). The patients who are allocated to TLDG group undergo intracorporeal anastomosis and those who are assigned to LADG undergo extracorporeal anastomosis for gastrointestinal reconstruction. Discussion: Thirty-one surgeons from 26 institutions were engaged in this trial. The primary endpoint is 30-day morbidity, and secondary endpoint is QOL assessed by the questionnaire score. The KLASS 07 trial is the first multi-center RCT to investigate whether there are significant and quantifiable differences between the QOL of TLDG and LADG. The findings from this trial are expected to be the critical clues for designing the detailed procedures during laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who had been diagnosed with community-onset cellulitis. Of the 2208 cellulitis patients, 232 (10.5%) had HCA cellulitis, 1243 (56.3%) patients were hospitalized, and 15 (0.7%) died in hospital. Compared with community-acquired (CA) cellulitis, patients with HCA cellulitis were older and more frequently presented with comorbidity and septic shock. A total of 355 microorganisms were isolated from 314 patients (14.2%). Staphylococcus aureus (134 isolates) was the most common organism, followed by Streptococcus spp. (86 isolates) and Gram-negative fermenters (58 isolates). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 29.1% (39/134) of S. aureus infections. None of the Gram-negative fermenters were resistant to carbapenem. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern of isolated microorganisms was not different between HCA and CA cellulitis. In patients with HCA cellulitis, S. aureus (11.2% [26/232] vs. 5.5% [108/1976], p = 0.001), including MRSA (4.3% [10/232] vs. 1.5% [29/1976], p = 0.003) and Gram-negative fermenters (6.0% [14/232] vs. 2.3% [44/1976], p = 0.002), were more common causative organisms than in CA-cellulitis patients.

Materials and Methods: From July 2006 to November 2016, 384 patients underwent distal gastrectomy for AGC. Data on short- and long-term outcomes were prospectively collected and reviewed. Propensity score matching was applied at a ratio of 1:1 to compare the LDG and ODG groups. Results: The operative times were longer for the LDG group than for the ODG group. However, the time to resumption of diet and the length of hospital stay were shorter in the LDG group than in the ODG group (4.7 vs. 5.6 days, P=0.049 and 9.6 vs. 11.5 days, P=0.035, respectively). The extent of lymph node dissection in the LDG group was more limited than in the ODG group (P=0.002), although there was no difference in the number of retrieved lymph nodes between the 2 groups. The 3-year overall survival rates were 98% and 86.9% (P=0.018), and the 3-year recurrence-free survival rates were 86.3% and 75.3% (P=0.259), respectively, in the LDG and ODG groups. Conclusions: LDG is safe and feasible for AGC, with earlier recovery after surgery and longterm oncologic outcomes comparable to those of ODG. ? 2019.

The short form of the Korean occupational stress scale was used to measure occupational stressors. A questionnaire with 8 items was employed to assess emotional labor. Depressive symptoms were estimated using the Korean Version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The association of emotional labor and occupational stressors with depressive symptoms was assessed using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression.Overall, 699 female call-center workers were enrolled into this study. The odds ratios of experiencing depressive symptoms in workers exposed to emotional labor and job insecurity were 5.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.38-8.80) and 2.37 (95% CI: 0.86-6.50), respectively.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the OSS preparation, in comparison to those of a standard polyethylene glycol (PEG; 4 L) preparation, in elderly patients. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded study was conducted. Participants were randomized to receive OSS or 4-L PEG with a split-dose regimen. Bowel cleansing efficacy was assessed using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). Acceptance, satisfaction, and preparation-related symptoms were recorded. Additionally, blood parameters were analyzed for electrolyte abnormalities and nephrotoxicity. Results: A total of 193 patients were analyzed. No group differences in overall bowel cleansing efficacy were observed, with “adequate” preparations achieved in 95.9% (93/97) and 94.8% (91/96) of patients in the OSS and 4L PEG groups, respectively (p=0.747). However, mean BBPS scores for the entire (p=0.010) and right colon (p=0.001) were significantly higher in the OSS group than in the 4-L PEG group. The severity of clinical adverse events and frequency of acute kidney injury were similarly low, and no clinically meaningful electrolyte changes were identified. Self-reported scores regarding amount (p<0.001) and feeling (p=0.007), as well as overall satisfaction (p=0.001) and willingness to repeat the preparation (92.8% vs 67.7%, p<0.001), were significantly better in the OSS group than in the 4-L PEG group.

A common feature of these diseases is neurotoxic inflammation by activated microglia, indicating that regulation of microglial activation is a potential mechanism for preserving neurons in the adult brain. Recently, we reported that upregulation of prothrombin kringle-2 (pKr-2), one of the domains that make up prothrombin and which is cleaved and generated by active thrombin, induces nigral dopaminergic (DA) neuronal death through neurotoxic microglial activation in the adult brain. In this study, we show that silibinin, a flavonoid found in milk thistle, can suppress the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase and neurotoxic inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, after pKr-2 treatment by downregulating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway in the mouse substantia nigra. Moreover, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining, measurements of the dopamine and metabolite levels, and open-field behavioral tests, silibinin treatment protected the nigrostriatal DA system resulting from the occurrence of pKr-2-triggered neurotoxic inflammation in vivo. Thus, we conclude that silibinin may be beneficial as a natural compound with anti-inflammatory effects against pKr-2-triggered neurotoxicity to protect the nigrostriatal DA pathway and its properties, and thus, may be applicable for PD therapy. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",microglia; neurodegeneration; nigrostriatal dopaminergic system; prothrombin kringle-2 silibinin,"3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; dopamine; homovanillic acid; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 1beta; mitogen activated protein kinase; prothrombin; prothrombin kringle 2; silibinin; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; dopamine; interleukin 1beta; prothrombin; silibinin; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; controlled study; corpus striatum; cytokine production; dopamine brain level; dopaminergic system; drug effect; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; kringle domain; locomotion; male; MAPK signaling; microglia; mouse; nervous system inflammation; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; nigroneostriatal system; nonhuman; open field behavior; open field test; priority journal; Silybum marianum; striatonigral degeneration; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; dopaminergic nerve cell; genetics; human; metabolism; Parkinson disease; Animals; Dopamine; Dopaminergic Neurons; Humans; Interleukin-1beta; Kringles; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Microglia; Parkinson Disease; Prothrombin; Silybin; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85063287251

Various nutrients are reported to influence skin health, but the effect of dietary patterns (DPs) on skin health is unclear. In this study, we considered the DPs associated with these three skin health parameters in 84 healthy adults aged 19–37 years. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and skin health parameters were determined on the forehead of each subject. Among the four DPs extracted from the FFQ, DP2, characterized by a high intake of cereals, potatoes and starch, saccharides and fish and shellfish, was negatively associated with skin hydration. DP3, characterized by a high intake of potatoes and starch, seeds and nuts, fruits and eggs, was positively associated with acidic skin pH only before adjusting for potential confounders. On the other hand, DP4, characterized by a low intake of beans, and a high intake of meats, dairy products and beverages and alcohol, was negatively associated with acidic skin pH and positively associated with sebum content. The data stratified by sex revealed a negative association between skin hydration and DP2 in males and a negative association between sebum content and DP3 and a positive association between sebum content and DP4 in females. In conclusion, we demonstrated that specific DPs were associated with sebum content, skin hydration and pH in healthy Korean adults and that those associations were affected by sex. ? 2019 by the authors.

In this study, we investigate the effects of EEM on endochondral bone formation. Female adolescent rats were given EEM, growth hormone or vehicle for 10 days. Tetracycline was intraperitoneally injected to light the fluorescent band 72 h before sacrifice to determine endochondral bone formation. In order to evaluate endocrine or paracrine/autocrine mechanisms, expressions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), or bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) were evaluated after EEM administration in liver or growth plate (GP). EEM oral administration significantly increased endochondral bone formation and proliferative and hypertrophic zonal heights of tibial GP. EEM also upregulated hepatic IGF1 and IGFBP3 mRNA expressions, and IGF1 and BMP2 expressions in GP. Taken together, EEM increases endochondral bone formation through stimulating proliferation and hypertrophy with upregulation of hepatic IGF1 and IGFBP3 expressions. Considering immunohistochemical studies, the effect of EEM may be due to increased local IGF1 and BMP2 expression in GP, which may be considered growth hormone (GH)-dependent endocrine and autocrine/paracrine pathways. ? 2019 by the authors.

While DAA and its derivatives are known for improving diabetes and hyperlipidemia, the antiaging effect and its underlying mechanisms of DAA on skin have not been fully examined. Here, we assessed the antiaging effects of DAA on human dermal fibroblasts and skin equivalents. Methods: We investigated the effect of DAA on the secretion of type I procollagen and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) in ultraviolet B (UVB)-irradiated neonatal normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFn). Using nonlinear optical imaging techniques, we visualized quantitative and qualitative changes of collagen fibers by DAA treatment in human skin equivalent models. Results: DAA induces increases in type I procollagen secretion when treated on UVB-irradiated NHDFn. DAA also downregulates secretion of MMP-1 through the inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway. In human skin equivalent models, we successfully visualized the spatial distribution of collagen fibers in the dermis and found that quantity, diameter, and arrangement of collagen fibers in the dermis were significantly improved by DAA treatment. Conclusion: Our results suggest that DAA could be a useful agent for improving skin photoaging through the protection and regeneration of collagen fibers in skin. ? 2019 S.

However, hepatic injury can impair cellular activity and lead to endothelial dysfunction, eventually inducing the development of critical hepatic disease, including cirrhosis. Because LSECs exert their effects through paracrine factors, maintenance of paracrine potentials and survival activity in LSECs under injury stress is a critical strategy for inhibiting disease progression. This study explored the effect of Substance-P (SP) on cell viability, proliferation, and nitric oxide (NO)/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) production in LSECs. Under noninjured conditions, SP treatment enhanced cell viability, cell proliferation, and HGF/NO secretion in LSECs. In the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced inflammatory stress, SP blocked TNF-α-induced endothelial dysfunction, accompanied by elevated cell viability and NO/HGF secretion. Interestingly, SP-primed LSEC-conditioned medium accelerated hepatocyte repopulation without causing morphological alterations. The primitive effect of SP was reversed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibitor or HGF/c-MET inhibitor, indicating the importance of the NO/HGF combination in hepatic regeneration by SP. Taken together, these results suggest SP can protect LSECs from inflammatory stress by NO/HGF, which contributes to hepatocyte repopulation. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",hepatocyte growth factor; liver sinusoidal endothelium; nitric oxide; Substance-P,endothelial nitric oxide synthase; nitric oxide; oxygenase inhibitor; scatter factor; substance P; tumor necrosis factor; Article; cell population; cell proliferation; cell viability; endothelial dysfunction; endothelium cell; Hep-G2 cell line; hepatic stellate cell; human; human cell; human cell culture; inflammation; liver cell; liver regeneration; paracrine signaling; priority journal; protein secretion,2-s2.0-85062621089

However, the underlying anti-cancer mechanism of F. fomentarius is unknown. To determine the molecular mechanism of the anti-cancer effects of F. fomentarius, various methods were used including fluorescence-activated cell sorting, Western blotting, migration, and crystal violet assays. F. fomentarius ethanol extract (FFE) decreased cell viability in six cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, A549, H460, DU145, and PC-3). FFE decreased the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells without causing cell toxicity. Furthermore, FFE attenuated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and phosphorylation of Akt as well as increased E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells. FFE arrested the S and G2/M populations by inhibiting the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2, cyclin A/E, and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2. FFE increased the sub-G1 population and expression of cleaved caspase-9, -3, and cleaved poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP-ribose) polymerase at 72 h and suppressed B-cell lymphoma 2. Interestingly, FFE and AKT inhibitors showed similar effects in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, FFE contained betulin which inhibited p-AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our findings demonstrate that FFE inhibits cell motility and growth and induces apoptosis by inhibiting the phsphoinositide 3- kinase /AKT pathway and caspase activation. ? 2019 by the authors.

In plant metabolomics, NMR-based strategies are considered a golden method providing both a holistic view of the chemical profiles and a correlation between the metabolome and bioactivity, becoming a corner stone of drug development from natural products. Objective: Create a multivariate model to identify antiplasmodial metabolites from 1H NMR data of two African medicinal plants, Keetia leucantha and K. venosa. Methods: The extracts of twigs and leaves of Keetia species were measured by 1H NMR and the spectra were submitted to orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) for antiplasmodial correlation. Results: Unsupervised 1H NMR analysis showed that the effect of tissues was higher than species and that triterpenoids signals were more associated to Keetia twigs than leaves. OPLS–DA based on Keetia species correlated triterpene signals to K. leucantha, exhibiting a higher concentration of triterpenoids and phenylpropanoid-conjugated triterpenes than K. venosa. In vitro antiplasmodial correlation by OPLS, validated for all Keetia samples, revealed that phenylpropanoid-conjugated triterpenes were highly correlated to the bioactivity, while the acyclic squalene was found as the major metabolite in low bioactivity samples. Conclusion: NMR-based metabolomics combined with supervised multivariate data analysis is a powerful strategy for the identification of bioactive metabolites in plant extracts. Moreover, combination of statistical total correlation spectroscopy with 2D NMR allowed a detailed analysis of different triterpenes, overcoming the challenge posed by their structure similarity and coalescence in the aliphatic region. ? 2019, The Author(s).",In vitro antiplasmodial activity; Keetia leucantha; Keetia venosa; NMR-based metabolomics; STOCSY; Triterpenes,antiprotozoal agent; cinnamic acid derivative; ferulic acid; Keetia leucantha extract; Keetia venosa extract; lactate dehydrogenase; oleanolic acid; phenylalanine derivative; phenylpropanoid; plant extract; plant medicinal product; triterpene; tyrosine derivative; unclassified drug; ursolic acid; antiplasmodial activity; Article; cytotoxicity; enzyme assay; heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; heteronuclear single quantum coherence; IC50; metabolomics; multidrug resistance; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; parasite viability; Plasmodium falciparum; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; treatment failure; twig,2-s2.0-85062426850

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of retirement on depressive symptoms by gender in middle-aged and older adult Koreans, using a large, nationally representative sample. Methods Using year 2010 and 2012 data from the Korea Longitudinal Study of Aging, we investigated the relationship between adults’ retirement status and depressive symptoms measured by the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression (CES-D10) scale. A series of propensity score matching models were calculated to test the potential retirement effect on adults’ depressive symptoms. Results Overall, the level of depressive symptoms of the retired group was not different from that of the employed counterpart. In gender-stratified models, the gain of CES-D10 scores in the retired group was higher than that of the employed group for males, which was in the opposite direction among females. However, the propensity score matching model showed that the relationship between retirement status and CES-D10 score gain was significant for males but not for females. Conclusions Our study reinforces the assertion that retirement could worsen depressive symptoms and could differ by gender. Intervention programs focused on the mental health of retired men need to be actively developed and widely implemented. ? 2019 Noh et al.

Applying machine learning techniques to the visual field test results, a valid clinical diagnosis of glaucoma solely based on the SAP data is provided. In order to reflect structural-functional patterns of glaucoma on the automated diagnostic models, we propose composite variables derived from anatomically grouped visual field clusters to improve the prediction performance. A set of machine learning-based diagnostic models are designed that implement different input data manipulation, dimensionality reduction, and classification methods. Methods: Visual field testing data of 375 healthy and 257 glaucomatous eyes were used to build the diagnostic models. Three kinds of composite variables derived from the Garway-Heath map and the glaucoma hemifield test (GHT) sector map were included in the input variables in addition to the 52 SAP visual filed locations. Dimensionality reduction was conducted to select important variables so as to alleviate high-dimensionality problems. To validate the proposed methods, we applied four classifiers—linear discriminant analysis, na?ve Bayes classifier, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks—and four dimensionality reduction methods—Pearson correlation coefficient-based variable selection, Markov blanket variable selection, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm, and principal component analysis— and compared their classification performances. Results: For all tested combinations, the classification performance improved when the proposed composite variables and dimensionality reduction techniques were implemented. The combination of total deviation values, the GHT sector map, support vector machines, and Markov blanket variable selection obtains the best performance: an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.912. Conclusion: A glaucoma diagnosis model giving an AUC of 0.912 was constructed by applying machine learning techniques to SAP data. The results show that dimensionality reduction not only reduces dimensions of the input space but also enhances the classification performance. The variable selection results show that the proposed composite variables from visual field clustering play a key role in the diagnosis model. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Dimensionality reduction; Glaucoma; Machine learning classifier; Visual field clustering,Automation; Correlation methods; Diagnosis; Discriminant analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Ophthalmology; Principal component analysis; Reduction; Support vector machines; Vision; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction method; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Glaucoma; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Pearson correlation coefficients; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Visual fields; Data reduction; adult; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; controlled study; female; glaucoma; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; perimetry; priority journal; support vector machine,2-s2.0-85062157793

The present study aimed to assess label adherence for NOACs in a Korean AF population and to determine risk factors of off-label prescriptions of NOACs. Materials and Methods: In this COmparison study of Drugs for symptom control and complication prEvention of AF (CODE-AF) registry, patients with AF who were prescribed NOACs between June 2016 and May 2017 were included. Four NOAC doses were categorized as on-or off-label use according to Korea Food and Drug Regulations. Results: We evaluated 3080 AF patients treated with NOACs (dabigatran 27.2%, rivaroxaban 23.9%, apixaban 36.9%, and edoxaban 12.0%). The mean age was 70.5±9.2 years; 56.0% were men; and the mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 3.3±1.4. Only one-third of the patients (32.7%) was prescribed a standard dose of NOAC. More than one-third of the study population (n=1122, 36.4%) was prescribed an off-label reduced dose of NOAC. Compared to those with an on-label standard dosing, patients with an off-label reduced dose of NOAC were older (?75 years), women, and had a lower body weight (?60 kg), renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance ?50 mL/min), previous stroke, previous bleeding, hypertension, concomitant dronedarone use, and anti-platelet use. Conclusion: In real-world practice, more than one-third of patients with NOAC prescriptions received an off-label reduced dose, which could result in an increased risk of stroke. Considering the high risk of stroke in these patients, on-label use of NOAC is recommended. ?

In addition, present and future dental health were significantly associated with IOTN levels, although self-confidence, attractiveness, and future health were not. As expected, the 5 subscale scores and total score of COHIP were significantly associated with IOTN levels after adjustment for gender, age, socioeconomic level, and caries state.

A computerized search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed to identify relevant original articles on the use of image-guided percutaneous CNB of sclerotic bone lesions. The pooled proportions of the diagnostic yield and pooled accuracy estimates were assessed using random-effects modeling. We also performed subgroup analyses of the diagnostic yield according to the drill systems (battery-powered vs manual). Heterogeneity among studies was determined using the inconsistency index (I 2 ). Meta-regression analyses were performed to evaluate the potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS. Fifteen eligible studies, involving 969 sclerotic bone lesions for diagnostic yield, and 242 sclerotic bone lesions for diagnostic accuracy, were included. The pooled proportion of the diagnostic yield of image-guided percutaneous CNB of sclerotic bone lesions was 74% (95% CI, 62–84%), and the pooled accuracy estimate for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions was 87% (95% CI, 77–93%). In the subgroup analysis, the pooled proportion of the diagnostic yield of the battery-powered drill system (76.7% [95% CI, 64.0–85.8%]) was higher than that of the manual drill system (65.2% [95% CI, 58.0–71.8%]). In the meta-regression analyses, no variables were significantly different (p = 0.13–0.93). CONCLUSION. In conclusion, we determined that image-guided percutaneous CNB of sclerotic bone lesions is an accurate diagnostic technique with good diagnostic yield, particularly when the battery-powered bone biopsy system is used. ?

This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of immediate MVI compared with culprit-vessel intervention only (CVI-O) in diverse subgroups with STEMI and MVD. Patients and methods We compared immediate MVI (n=260) and CVI-O (n=931) regarding 1-year major adverse cardiac event rates for cardiac death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), and repeat revascularization in 1191 STEMI patients with MVD using data from the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction-National Institutes of Health registry (2011-2015). High-risk patients and those who underwent a staged procedure were excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, propensity score matching and stratified subgroup analyses were performed. Results Immediate MVI and CVI-O groups had similar 1-year major adverse cardiac event rates [7.7 vs. 8.9%, hazard ratio (HR): 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-1.47, log-rank P=0.5628]. No difference was found between the groups in terms of the 1-year rate of cardiac death (2.9 vs. 1.3%, HR: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.75-6.67) or recurrent MI (2 vs. 1.5%, HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.45-4.44). However, repeat revascularization occurred less frequently in the immediate MVI group than in the CVI-O group (2.0 vs. 5.7%, HR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.13-0.90, log-rank P=0.0142). These findings were found to be consistent across a broad spectrum of subgroups. Conclusion Compared with CVI-O, immediate MVI did not improve 1-year net clinical outcomes in stable STEMI patients with MVD. The only benefit found was a reduced repeat revascularization in immediate MVI. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",multivessel disease; revascularization; ST-elevation myocardial infarction,acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; clopidogrel; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; fibrinogen receptor antagonist; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; prasugrel; ticagrelor; adult; Article; clinical outcome; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; dual antiplatelet therapy; female; heart death; heart muscle revascularization; high risk patient; human; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; observational study; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; propensity score; prospective study; recurrent disease; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; stent thrombosis,2-s2.0-85060919200

However, nonadherence remains a barrier to effective delivery of healthcare worldwide. Methods: Twenty healthcare facilities (secondary or tertiary hospitals) belonging to the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Diseases (KAPARD) participated. Questionnaires were given to patients currently receiving treatment in the form of inhalant useor oral intake or transdermal patch for mild to moderate asthma. Results: A total of 1,838 patients responded to the questionnaire. Mean age was 5.98 ± 3.79 years (range: 0-18 years). With help from their caregivers, the percentage of patients that answered “taking as prescribed” was 38.04% for inhalant users, 50.09% for oral medication users and 67.42% for transdermal users. Transdermal patch users had significantly greater adherence compared to the other 2 groups (P < 0.001). The 34.15% of inhalant users, 70.33% of oral medication users and 93.00% of transdermal patch users felt that their medication delivery system was “Easy” or “Very easy” to use (P < 0.001). “Method of administration” was deemed to be the most difficult part of the treatment regimen to follow, and 76.7% of patients preferred once-daily administration (i.e., “Frequency of administration”). Conclusions: Asthma medication adherence in young children was found to be better in the transdermal patch group. This may be due to requiring fewer doses and easy to follow instructions. From an adherence point of view, the transdermal patch seems more useful for long-term asthma control in children compared to oral or inhaled medicine.

We investigated the changes of diameter and evolution pattern of acute lacunar infarcts, and the factors associated with the evolution pattern. Patients with acute single subcortical hemispheric or brainstem ischemic lesions of penetrating arterial territories were included. Maximal diameters on initial diffusion-weighted image (DWI) and follow-up fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (FLAIR), which performed > 12 months after initial DWI, were semi-automatically measured. Clinical characteristics were compared according to evolution patterns on follow-up FLAIR, classified as cavitated, focal lesion without cavitation, and disappeared. Five hundred nine patients were included. Mean time to follow-up was 31.3 ± 13.7 months. Mean diameter of acute lacunar lesions decreased from 12.9 ± 4.4 to 8.5 ± 4.8?mm during follow-up. Lesions of 58.2% patients remained as cavitated, 18.3% as focal lesion without cavitation, and 23.6% disappeared.

After adjustment for covariates, diameter of the acute lesion, initial number of old lacunes, and anterior lesion location were associated with the appearance of cavitation. Initial lesion diameter and posterior lesion location were associated with the disappearance. We observed reduction of the acute lacunar lesion diameter in 86%.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequently mentioned neurodegenerative disease showing dementia. Although many useful drugs for dementia were developed, we still need better and safer drugs. Here, we tested pinoresinol, a lignan found in sesame seed and olive oil, whether it could be a candidate for this purpose. Pinoresinol (25 mg/kg, p.o.) ameliorated memory impairment in dementia model induced by cholinergic blockade in the passive avoidance test in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, pinoresinol (50 μM) facilitated induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation, a cellular model of learning and memory. Pinoresinol blocked acetylcholinesterase (AchE), an acetylcholine-degrading enzyme, activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, pinoresinol (50 μM) facilitated calcium influx into neuro2a cell. These results suggest that pinoresinol improves memory impairment and facilitates hippocampal LTP induction and these results might be related to the effect of pinoresinol on AChE and calcium influx. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Alzheimer's disease; Memory; Pinoresinol,"acetylcholinesterase; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; olive oil; pinoresinol; protein kinase B; acetylcholinesterase; calcium; cholinesterase inhibitor; Creb1 protein, mouse; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; furan derivative; lignan; mitogen activated protein kinase; pinoresinol; protein kinase B; scopolamine; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; calcium transport; cell culture; controlled study; dementia; drug effect; drug potentiation; drug structure; electrophysiology; enzyme activity; hippocampus; learning; male; memory; memory disorder; mouse; MTT assay; nerve cell plasticity; Neuro-2a cell line; nonhuman; passive avoidance test; sesame; Western blotting; animal; cell line; chemically induced; dementia; drug effect; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; long term potentiation; memory disorder; metabolism; nerve cell plasticity; Acetylcholinesterase; Animals; Calcium; Cell Line; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Dementia; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Furans; Hippocampus; Lignans; Long-Term Potentiation; Male; Memory Disorders; Mice, Inbred ICR; Neuronal Plasticity; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Scopolamine",2-s2.0-85060544323

Study design: Of 33,531 Korean women who underwent cervicography as a screening test for cervical cancer between January 2015 and December 2016, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 4117 women who simultaneously or subsequently underwent Pap cytology, an HPV test, cervicography, and colposcopically directed biopsy. At a threshold of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+), based on colposcopic biopsy, we compared the diagnostic capacities and cost-effectiveness of these screening tools. Results: The CIN2+ prevalence was 10.8% (446 of 4117 women) and the positive rate of high-risk HPV was 61.0% (2511 of 4117 women). Cervicography as an adjunctive to Pap cytology was a more sensitive test (97.5% vs 93.7%) with a higher odds ratio (15.65 vs 5.86) than the HPV test for detection of CIN2+ (P-value = 0.003). Moreover, the cost of cervicography co-testing was 23% less than that of HPV co-testing, decreasing the cost per patient with CIN2+ lesions from $1474 to $1135. Conclusion: Cervicography and Pap co-testing had superior screening capacity and cost-effectiveness for detection of preinvasive cervical lesions than HPV and Pap co-testing and may be an effective and cost-saving screening strategy in clinical practice in country with a high prevalence of cervical cancer. ? 2019",Cervicography; Cytology; Diagnosis; Uterine cervical neoplasms,adult; Article; cervicography; cost effectiveness analysis; DNA sequence; female; gynecological examination; health care cost; health care system; human; human papillomavirus test; human tissue; Korea; major clinical study; Papanicolaou test; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix carcinoma in situ; uterine cervix dysplasia; virus detection; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; diagnostic imaging; economics; mass screening; middle aged; odds ratio; Papanicolaou test; Papillomaviridae; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; South Korea; uterine cervix; uterine cervix carcinoma in situ; uterine cervix tumor; vagina smear; virology; Adult; Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia; Cervix Uteri; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Papanicolaou Test; Papillomaviridae; Prevalence; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaginal Smears,2-s2.0-85060283007

However, the beneficial effects of MDSCs on the experimental mouse model of psoriasis have not been reported. Therefore, we investigated the anti-psoriatic effect of MDSCs on IMQ-induced skin inflammation in mice and explored the mechanisms involved. Our results showed that administration of MDSCs (1?×?106 or 2?×?106?cells) suppressed the development of IMQ-induced skin inflammation in mice as exemplified by a significant reduction in clinical severity scores and was associated with a reduction of histopathological changes, including inflammatory infiltration, epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. The immunosuppressive effect of MDSCs (1?×?106 or 2?×?106?cells) corresponded to the production of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23) in the serum and dorsal skin. Administration of MDSCs (1?×?106 or 2?×?106?cells) also inhibited splenomegaly. Moreover, an increased percentage of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and decreased percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells were found in mice treated with MDSCs. Taken together, these results imply that MDSCs have immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects on disease progression in a murine model of psoriasis and that MDSCs could be used in preventive or therapeutic strategies for the management of autoimmune inflammatory skin disorders, such as psoriasis. ? 2018 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology",imiquimod; immunomodulation; myeloid-derived suppressor cells; psoriasis,"CD4 antigen; gamma interferon; interleukin 17; interleukin 2 receptor alpha; interleukin 23; transcription factor FOXP3; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; imiquimod; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autoimmune skin disease; controlled study; cytokine production; dermatitis; disease severity; epidermis hyperplasia; female; histopathology; hyperkeratosis; imiquimod-induced psoriasis; immune response; immunomodulation; inflammatory infiltrate; mouse; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; splenomegaly; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; immunology; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; pathology; physiology; psoriasis; Animals; Cytokines; Dermatitis; Female; Imiquimod; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells; Psoriasis; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Th1 Cells; Th17 Cells",2-s2.0-85059953073

We hypothesized that (a) informal social control by family members would be negatively associated with victim alcohol abuse/dependence and (b) husband’s coercive control would be positively associated with victim alcohol abuse/dependence. We measured alcohol abuse/dependence (CAGE scale), IPV and coercive control by husbands, and informal social control of IPV (ISC_IPV) by extended family members in a three-stage random cluster sample of 462 married women in Seoul, South Korea. Both random effects regression and zero-inflated Poisson regression models found that ISC_IPV by extended family members was associated with a significantly lower CAGE scores, and coercive control was associated with significantly higher CAGE scores. Interventions to boost ISC_IPV by extended family members may mitigate some of the risk of alcohol abuse/dependence by victims. ?

When a patient has persistent symptoms after surgery, there are no tests that accurately predict whether a patient will have remnant epileptic foci. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a prognostic tool in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: From July 2012 to July 2016, 21 patients underwent preoperative and postoperative MEG at our center. Postoperative MEG was performed within 2 weeks after surgery. We analyzed MEG by estimating the time-frequency component of the signal to define gamma oscillations (GOs), which are an indicator of epileptogenic foci. We analyzed the relationship between GOs on MEG and surgical outcomes. Results: Mean follow-up period was 28.3 months (range, 13–44 months). At the last follow-up visit, patients were divided into 2 groups according to surgical outcome. All patients showed spike waves and GOs on preoperative electroencephalography and MEG. In the seizure control group (16 patients), spike waves (2 patients) and GOs (2 patients) were seen postoperatively despite absence of symptoms. In the recurrent seizure group (5 patients), whereas 3 patients showed spike waves, all 5 patients showed GOs on MEG postoperatively. There was a significant association between presence of GOs on postoperative MEG and surgical outcome (P = 0.01). Conclusions: MEG can provide valuable postsurgical information on epileptic foci in patients with recurrent symptoms; GOs on postoperative MEG were especially correlated with epileptic recurrence. Our data show that GOs on postoperative MEG may have prognostic value. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Anterior temporal lobectomy; Magnetoencephalography; Prognosis; Temporal lobe epilepsy,"anticonvulsive agent; adult; aged; anticonvulsant therapy; Article; cavernous hemangioma; clinical article; complex partial seizure; cortical dysplasia; electroencephalography; epileptic discharge; epileptic focus; female; follow up; gamma rhythm; glioma; hippocampal sclerosis; human; intractable epilepsy; magnetoencephalography; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; prognosis; recurrent disease; spike wave; temporal lobe epilepsy; temporal lobectomy; amygdala; chronic disease; evaluation study; hippocampus; middle aged; procedures; prognosis; prospective study; temporal lobe; temporal lobe epilepsy; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Aged; Amygdala; Anterior Temporal Lobectomy; Chronic Disease; Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Temporal Lobe; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85059786201

Methods: This prospective study included 32 eligible subjects with presbyopia. Objective ocular functions and a survey of ocular discomfort were performed at baseline. All participants underwent the same examinations after reading while wearing the pinhole glasses and not wearing these glasses at a 1-week interval in random order. Results: The pinhole glasses improved uncorrected distance and near visual acuity in presbyopia. These glasses also required 15% less accommodative power over the near stimulus of 25 cm than did eyes without pinholes. Compared to reading without pinhole glasses, reading with pinhole glasses led to the following changes: increase in monocular near point of accommodation from 4.39 ± 0.78 diopter (D) to 5.19 ± 1.12 D, increase in depth of focus from 1.42 ± 0.44 D to 2.00 ± 0.33 D, and increase in amplitude of fusional convergence from 13.38 ± 6.88 prism D to 21.62 ± 10.00 prism D. In contrast, the reading speed decreased, inter-blink interval increased, tear break-up time shortened, and subjective ophthalmic symptoms worsened with pinhole glasses compared to without. Conclusion: In presbyopia, pinhole glasses improve visual acuity and accommodation-related parameters by pseudo-accommodation and the pinhole effect. However, the low legibility, increased inter-blink interval, and shortened break-up time of pinhole glasses cause an uncomfortable feeling and excessive eye fatigue. Pinhole glasses have strengths and limitations that must be considered to provide appropriate guidance in patients with presbyopia.

Participants were 15,461 adults (664 cancer survivors) with available EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ5D) information. Measurements: Constructs from the revised Wilson and Cleary's model were examined. HRQOL status was measured using the EQ5D. EQ5D dimensional problems and indices were compared across cancer sites using multiple linear and quantile regression analyses. Results: The most common problems across cancer sites were pain/discomfort and mobility. There were differences in EQ5D dimensional problems by cancer site: problems of usual activities in the cervix-cancer group and anxiety/depression in the thyroid cancer group were prevalent. Those with cervix cancer (vs. stomach) had higher EQ5D index scores; however, no significant differences were observed between other site subgroups. Subjective health perception and socioeconomic factors were significant determinants affecting HRQOL among cancer survivors with low EQ5D index scores. Conclusions: Subjective health status and socioeconomic characteristics are predicted to have a greater impact on survivors with low (vs. high) HRQOL.

It has been detected in prostatic tissue of patients with prostatitis and reported to be associated with chronic prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia as well as prostate cancer. Recently, experimental rodent models of prostatitis induced by pathogen infection have been developed. However, there have so far been no reports of prostatitis caused by T. vaginalis infection in animals. Here, we investigated whether infection with T. vaginalis via the rat urethra could cause prostatitis. Methods: T. vaginalis was injected into prostate through urethra of rat (Wistar rats), and the rats were killed 1, 2, or 4 weeks later. The presence of T. vaginalis trophozoites in the rat prostates was examined by immunohistochemistry, and pathological changes of the prostate were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and evaluated by grading from 0 to 5 for inflammatory cell infiltration, acinar changes, and interstitial fibrosis. Infiltrated mast cells were observed by toluidine blue staining of rat prostate tissue. Chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) levels of the rat prostates were measured by ELISA. Results: T. vaginalis trophozoites were observed in acini in the prostates of the injected rats. The prostate tissues had higher pathological scores, and 83% (5/6) and 100% (6/6) of the ventral and dorsolateral lobes (n = 6), respectively, were inflamed. Infiltration and degranulation of mast cells were observed at higher rates in prostate sections of the T. vaginalis-infected rats. Also, prostate tissues of the injected rats had increased CCL2 levels. Conclusions: Injection of T. vaginalis in rats caused prostatitis as revealed by pathologic changes, mast cell infiltration and increased CCL2 production. Therefore, this study provides the first evidence that T. vaginalis infection in rats causes prostatitis. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",CCL2; histopathology; mast cell; prostatitis; Trichomonas vaginalis,"monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; fibrosis; male; mast cell degranulation; nonhuman; priority journal; prostatitis; rat; trichomoniasis; trophozoite; upregulation; animal; chemistry; complication; parasitology; pathology; prostate; prostatitis; Trichomonas vaginalis; trichomoniasis; Wistar rat; Animals; Chemokine CCL2; Male; Prostate; Prostatitis; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Trichomonas Infections; Trichomonas vaginalis",2-s2.0-85057575010

The iron containing PMs frequently confront in underground stations, which ultimately have an impact on the health of living beings especially in children. Hence, it is necessary to conduct toxicity assessment of chemical species and regularized the indoor air pollutants to ensure the good health of children. Therefore, in this study, a new indoor air quality (IAQ) index is proposed based on toxicity assessment by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. The new indices called comprehensive indoor air toxicity (CIAT) and cumulative comprehensive indoor air toxicity (CCIAT) suggests the new standards based on toxicity assessment of PM2.5. QSAR based deep neural network (DNN) exhibited the best model in predicting the toxicity assessment of chemical species in particulate matters, which yield lowest RMSE and QF3 2 values of 0.6821 and 0.8346, respectively, in the test phase. After integration with a standard concentration of PM2.5, two health risk indices of CIAT and CCIAT are introduced based on toxicity assessment results, which can be use as the toxicity standard of PM2.5 for detail IAQ management in a subway station. These new health risk indices suggest more sensitive air pollutant level of iron containing fine particulate matters or molecular level contaminants in underground spaces, alerting the health risk of adults and children in “unhealthy for sensitive group”. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Comprehensive indoor air toxicity; Deep learning; Iron-containing PMs; Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR); Toxicity assessment index,"iron; iron; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; health risk; indoor air; iron; machine learning; metro system; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; real time; regression analysis; toxicity test; air pollutant; air quality; Article; chemical composition; controlled study; deep neural network; ecotoxicity; health hazard; indoor air pollution; machine learning; mathematical model; particle size; particulate matter; prediction; quantitative structure activity relation; railway; toxicity testing; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; child; environmental monitoring; human; indoor air pollution; procedures; quantitative structure activity relation; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Iron; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Railroads",2-s2.0-85056652763

We used the Questionnaire Survey of Dietary Habits of Korean Adults (Q-DH-KOR) comprising 25 questions. The following indices were derived as follows: (1) quality of healthy dietary habits (Q-HD)—eight questions on number of meals, regularity, quantity, duration, skipping breakfast, dinner with companion(s), overeating and late-night snacks; (2) habits of nutritional balance (H-NB)—questions on consuming five food categories (grains, fruits, proteins, vegetables and dairy products); and (3) habits of unhealthy foods (H-UF)—questions on consuming three food categories (fatty, instant and fast foods). The times and regularity of meals, frequency of skipping breakfast, dinner with companion(s) and overeating were better in groups with high symptomatic and functional QoL. Symptomatic QoL positively affected Q-HD and H-NB (p?<?0.001 and p?=?0.024 respectively) and negatively affected H-UF (p?=?0.02). Breast cancer survivors more frequently ate from the fruit, protein and vegetable categories than did the control group, with lower H-UF and higher Q-HD values (p?<?0.001 and p?<?0.001 respectively). Our findings supported the relationship between QoL and dietary habit and showed healthier dietary habits of breast cancer survivors than controls. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",breast cancer; cancer survivor; dietary habit; quality of life; questionnaire,adult; age distribution; aged; breast tumor; cancer survivor; case control study; cross-sectional study; ethnology; feeding behavior; female; food preference; healthy diet; human; middle aged; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; South Korea; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Preferences; Healthy Diet; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85056362918

The monitored photoluminescence emission spectrum indicated that the Eu 3+ ions took the high symmetry positions in the host lattices which was further confirmed via the theoretical calculation based on the Judd-Ofelt theory. The thermal quenching performance of the EuF 3 nanoplates was analyzed by the temperature-dependent photoluminescence emission spectra and the activation energy was decided to be 0.28 eV. With the aid of the near-ultraviolet chip and EuF 3 nanoplates, a red-emitting light-emitting diode device was prepared so as to identify the feasibility of the EuF 3 nanoplates for solid-state lighting. Additionally, the cell viability of the EuF 3 nanoplates as well as their fluorescence imaging behaviors in the A549 lung cancer cells was also investigated.

We found that gukulenin A suppressed tumor growth in A2780-bearing mice. Gukulenin A markedly inhibited cell viability in four ovarian cancer cell lines, including the A2780 cell line. Gukulenin A treatment increased the fraction of cells accumulated at the sub G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner and the population of annexin V-positive cells, suggesting that gukulenin A induces apoptotic cell death in ovarian cancer cells.

We aimed to determine the association between different HDL cholesterol subclasses and risk of future hypertension. Methods: A total of 270 Japanese Americans (130 men, 140 women) without hypertension between the ages of 34 to 75 years were enrolled. Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer, and average blood pressure was calculated. Incident hypertension was determined 5 to 6 and 10 to 11 years after enrollment. HDL2, HDL3, and total HDL cholesterol were measured at baseline. Results: During 10 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of hypertension was 28.1% (76/270). In univariate analysis, age, diabetes, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin resistance index, total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and visceral adipose tissue were significant predictors for incident hypertension. Among the HDL cholesterol subclass, HDL2 cholesterol was inversely associated with hypertension incidence, but both total and HDL3 cholesterol were not. In addition, HDL2/HDL cholesterol was inversely associated with future hypertension risk. In multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 to 2.31; P=0.001), systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.31 to 2.56; P<0.001), and HDL2/HDL cholesterol (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98; P=0.035), were associated with future development of hypertension. Conclusion: A higher proportion of HDL2 cholesterol among total HDL cholesterol predicted a lower risk for incident hypertension. However, concentrations of total HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol were not independent predictors of incident hypertension.

Therefore, suicide is a serious medical problem, as well as a social problem. In this paper, we provide a social psychiatric perspective on suicide and recommend suicide prevention strategies based on programs with roots in the Gwangju mental health pilot project and an analysis of suicide patterns in Seoul. First, early intervention and active case management are mandatory to prevent suicide among individuals with mental illnesses such as depression, schizophrenia, and alcohol use disorder. To this end, mental health and welfare centers, addiction management centers, suicide prevention centers, and care program after a suicide attempt in the emergency department of general hospitals should collaborate via a multidisciplinary approach. Second, crisis intervention should be provided in collaboration with the police, government officials, and mental health agencies to people who are at immediate risk of suicide. Additionally, case management services should be expanded for individuals who are treated at hospitals for psychiatric illness. Third, social welfare services should be offered to low-income individuals at risk of suicide. Fourth, the mass media should restrict reporting about suicide and follow the relevant reporting guidelines. Finally, access to methods of committing suicide, such as charcoal for burning and agrichemical poisoning, should be regulated by the government. Proactive psychosocial strategies implemented with government support will prevent suicide-related deaths and decrease the suicide rate in Korea. ?

Methods: Participants were 419 young adolescent students (11~15 years old). The content validity of the expert group was calculated as the content validity index (CVI) after the translation and reverse translation process of the 25 items of the YFAS-C. The multitrait-multi-method matrix (MTMM) method was used to verify the construct validity; the generalized linear model (GLM) was used to evaluate the concurrent and incremental validity. Reliability was calculated as Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) and Spearman-Brown coefficients. Results: The CVI of the 25 items was greater than the item-level CVI .80 and the scale-level CVI .90. The Korean version of YFAS-C had verified convergent validity in emotional eating and external eating and discriminant validity in restrained eating. In addition, it had verified concurrent validity in emotional eating and external eating. Finally the incremental validity of the Korean version of YFAS-C was statistically significant on BMI. Reliability was KR-20 a=.69 and the Spearman-Brown coefficient was .64. Conclusion: The Korean version of YFAS-C is a valid and reliable scale for measuring the severity of food addiction; it can be a useful scale for preventing obesity by predicting food addiction early. ? 2019 Korean Society of Nursing Science.",Adolescent; Child; Food addictions; Validity and Reliability,adolescent; body mass; child; emotion; female; food addiction; human; male; pathology; questionnaire; reproducibility; severity of illness index; South Korea; translating (language); Adolescent; Body Mass Index; Child; Emotions; Female; Food Addiction; Humans; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Republic of Korea; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translating,2-s2.0-85062606948

Previous studies identified many cases of Fabry disease among men with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The purpose of this study was to define the frequency of Fabry disease among Korean men with LVH. Methods: In this national prospective multicenter study, we screened Fabry disease in men with LVH on echocardiography. The criterion for LVH diagnosis was a maximum LV wall thickness 13 mm or greater. We screened 988 men with LVH for plasma α-Gal A activity. In patients with low α-Gal A activity (< 3 nmol/hr/mL), we searched for mutations in the α-galactosidase gene. Results: In seven men, α-Gal A activity was low. Three had previously identified mutations; Gly328Arg, Arg301Gln, and His46Arg. Two unrelated men had the E66Q variant associated with functional polymorphism. In two patients, we did not detect GLA mutations, although α-Gal A activity was low on repeated assessment. Conclusion: We identified three patients (0.3%) with Fabry disease among unselected Korean men with LVH. Although the prevalence of Fabry disease was low in our study, early treatment of Fabry disease can result in a good prognosis. Therefore, in men with unexplained LVH, differential diagnosis of Fabry disease should be considered. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Fabry disease; Korean men; Left ventricular hypertrophy,"alpha galactosidase; adult; aged; blood; complication; dna mutational analysis; echocardiography; Fabry disease; genetics; genotype; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; human; kidney; male; middle aged; pathology; prospective study; single nucleotide polymorphism; South Korea; young adult; Adult; Aged; alpha-Galactosidase; DNA Mutational Analysis; Echocardiography; Fabry Disease; Genotype; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Kidney; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prospective Studies; Republic of Korea; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85062167458

The aim of the present study is to establish clinical evidence of thread-embedding acupuncture (TEA) in the treatment of sequelae of Bell's palsy.Method/Design:This is a patient-assessor blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial with two parallel arms. Fifty-six patients aged 19-65 years, who have experienced sequelae of Bell's palsy for >3 months, will be recruited and screened using the eligibility criteria. After screening, they will be randomly allocated to a TEA group or a sham TEA (STEA) group. Both groups will receive TEA or STEA treatment on ten predefined acupoints once a week for 8 weeks. Additionally, both groups will receive the same acupuncture treatment twice a week for 8 weeks as a concurrent treatment. Changes in the Facial Disability Index over 8 weeks will be assessed as the primary outcome. Furthermore, the House-Brackmann Grade, Facial Nerve Grading System 2.0, Sunnybrook Facial Grading System, facial stiffness score, lip mobility score, and treatment satisfaction score will be measured and analyzed as secondary outcomes. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks after screening.Discussion:The results from this trial will help establish clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of TEA in the treatment of patients with sequelae of Bell's palsy.Trial registration number:KCT0002557 (Clinical Research Information Service of the Republic of Korea).

Methods EEG data from 13 people with iRBD (mean age, 66.3 years; men, 84.6%) and 10 controls (mean age, 62.3 years; men, 70%) were analyzed. We selected thirty 3 s miniepochs of both tonic and phasic REM sleep. We estimated relative power for six frequency bands. For functional connectivity analysis, we calculated weighted phase lag index (wPLI) and conducted pairwise comparisons between the two groups. Results EEG power spectral analysis revealed significant interactions between the REM sleep state (phasic vs. tonic) and group at sigma (p = 0.009) and beta (p = 0.002) bands. Sigma- and beta-power decrease during phasic REM sleep was more pronounced and extensive in people with iRBD than in controls. Regarding functional connectivity, there were significant interactions between the REM sleep state and group at alpha (p = 0.029), sigma (p = 0.047), beta (p = 0.015), and gamma (p = 0.046) bands. The average wPLI was significantly higher during phasic REM sleep than during tonic REM sleep, which was observed in people with iRBD but not in controls. The altered functional connections mainly involved the frontal and parietal regions at beta and gamma bands. Conclusions Our findings provide neurophysiological evidence for pathological motor cortex activation during phasic REM sleep which may be associated with generation of dream-enacting behaviors in iRBD. ?

The n-BuOH fraction (Fr) from M. verticillata promoted significant recovery of alloxan-damaged (AXD) pancreatic islets (PIs) in zebrafish (ZF). Two major components were isolated from M. verticillata through repeated-column chromatography. Based on several spectroscopic methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), the chemical structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined. In addition, the quantity of both compounds in the n-BuOH Fr was investigated through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the quantities of compounds 1 and 2 in the n-BuOH Fr were determined to be 5.58% ± 0.16% and 2.85% ± 0.13%, respectively. The n-BuOH Fr, compounds 1 and 2, and the mixture of compounds 1 and 2 (MX, 1 and 2, the ratio of both compounds in n-BuOH Fr, 1.96:1) were evaluated for their ability to recover AXD PIs and for their K ATP channel-blocking mechanism using diazoxide in ZF. The n-BuOH Fr (10 μg/mL) and compounds 1 and MX (1 μg/mL) exhibited a recovery effect on AXD PIs. The n-BuOH Fr (10 μg/mL) and MX (1 μg/mL) were also confirmed to be useful K ATP channel activators. A synergistic effect of MX in the recovery of AXD PIs was first confirmed in ZF, and it was discovered that 2 acted as an insulin sensitivity activator that increased the activity of compound 1. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","3,5,6,9-tetrahydroxy-7-megastigmene; antidiabetes; L-tryptophan; Malva verticillata; synergistic effect; zebrafish","3,5,6,9 tetrahydroxy 7 megastigmene; alloxan; antidiabetic agent; diazoxide; glimepiride; glucose; plant extract; tryptophan; unclassified drug; adenosine triphosphate sensitive potassium channel; alloxan; insulin; plant extract; alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; Article; chemical composition; column chromatography; comparative study; controlled study; drug isolation; drug structure; fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry; glucose transport; high performance liquid chromatography; infrared spectroscopy; insulin release; larva; Malva; Malva verticillata; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pancreas islet cell; priority journal; repeated column chromatography; synergistic effect; zebra fish; animal; chemical structure; chemically induced; chemistry; drug effect; drug potentiation; experimental diabetes mellitus; infrared spectrophotometry; insulin resistance; Malva; metabolism; pancreas disease; pancreas islet; pathology; phytotherapy; Alloxan; Animals; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Drug Synergism; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Islets of Langerhans; KATP Channels; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Malva; Molecular Structure; Pancreatic Diseases; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment; Spectrophotometry, Infrared; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-85061234912

Purpose: The aims of this study were to investigate the developmental trajectories of body mass index (BMI), self-esteem, and adjustment among students from early to late adolescence and to examine the longitudinal relationships among these variables. Methods: Data from 2006 to 2012 were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study. Of the initial sample of 521 students, 487 completed a validated questionnaire measuring BMI, self-esteem, and adjustment. Latent growth curve modeling analyses were conducted to examine the relationships among the variables. Results: Univariate linear growth models showed a significant increase in BMI and significant declines in both self-esteem and adjustment across three time points from childhood to adolescence. The goodness of fit of the multivariate conditioned model supported the validity of the proposed longitudinal model (comparative fit index =.93, root mean square error of approximation =.08). Change in BMI was significantly linked with change in adjustment (β =.18, p <.05) but not with change in self-esteem, whereas change in self-esteem exerted a statistically significant effect on change in adjustment (β =.47, p <.001). Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Our findings indicate that BMI and self-esteem are key determinants of student adjustment in school settings. Therefore, future health education interventions should focus on enhancing the positive physical and mental self-concepts of students, which should improve health and social behavior among students and subsequently afford a better quality of life for these students in adulthood.

Objective: To determine whether the Psoriatic Arthritis Screening and Evaluation (PASE) questionnaire can be used to monitor disease activity in patients with psoriasis. Methods: This was a multicenter, non-interventional, cross-sectional study. Demographic factors and PASI and PASE scores were collected to investigate associations between each. Results: PASE data were available for 1,255 patients, of whom 498 (39.7%) had a score of ?37. Compared with the group with PASE score ＜37, the group with score ?37 had a higher proportion of women (34.9% vs. 48.8%, p＜0.0001), older mean age at diagnosis (36.4 vs. 41.7 years, p＜0.0001), more severe disease activity using PASI and body surface area measures (p=0.0021 and p=0.0008, respectively), and higher mean body mass index (23.7 vs. 24.1, p=0.0411). In a multiple linear regression model, PASE score was positively associated with cutaneous disease activity (p＜0.0001). Conclusion: After risk-adjustment, PASE was positively associated with PASI, which suggests that PASE can be sensitive to disease activity. Since psoriasis is regarded as one of the IMIDs, PASE may be utilized as a tool not only to screen PsA but also to monitor disease activity. Copyright ?

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with telmisartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin versus telmisartan plus amlodipine or telmisartan plus rosuvastatin in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. Methods: The Jeil Telmisartan, Amlodipine, and Rosuvastatin Randomized Clinical Trial (J-TAROS-RCT) was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, Phase III clinical trial conducted at 9 hospitals in Korea. After a run-in period of >4 weeks, patients who fulfilled the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines were eligible for randomization to receive 1 of 3 treatments for 8 weeks: (1) telmisartan/amlodipine 80 mg/10 mg plus rosuvastatin 20 mg, (2) telmisartan/amlodipine 80 mg/10 mg, or (3) telmisartan 80 mg plus rosuvastatin 20 mg. The primary end point was efficacy evaluation of combination therapy with telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin by comparing the change in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) and mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment. Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory data, and vital signs were assessed in all patients. Findings: Among 148 patients, the changes in msSBP from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment were a mean (SD) of ?24.41 (2.38) versus ?9.31 (2.36) mm Hg in the telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin and telmisartan/rosuvastatin groups, respectively. Significantly more participants achieved the target BP at week 8 in the telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin group (41 patients [87.2%]) than in the telmisartan/rosuvastatin group (24 [50.0%], P < 0.001). The changes in mean (SD) LDL-C at 8 weeks compared with baseline values were ?57.59% (11.59%) versus 6.08% (20.98%) in the telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin and telmisartan/amlodipine groups, respectively. The percentages of patients who achieved the target LDL-C according to their risk factors after 8 weeks of treatment were 97.87% vs 6.12% in the telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin and the telmisartan/amlodipine groups (P < 0.0001), respectively. No significant differences were found in the incidence of overall AEs and adverse drug reactions, and serious AEs were comparable among 3 groups. Implications: Fixed-dose combinations of telmisartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin decreased BP and LDL-C in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. The safety and tolerability profiles of fixed-dose telmisartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin combination therapy were comparable with those of telmisartan plus amlodipine or telmisartan plus rosuvastatin.

Methods: Fifty patients older than 40 years who underwent arthroscopic stabilization for recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation were analyzed. Results: The mean age at the time of surgery was 44.8 years (range, 40-72 years), and the mean duration of follow-up was 45 months (range, 28-150 months). The mean visual analog scale score for pain with motion significantly improved from 4.1 preoperatively to 1.7 at the last follow-up (P <.001). The range of motion in the affected shoulder revealed limitations of 9.4° in forward flexion and 17.8° in external rotation compared with the unaffected shoulder. Both the Constant and Rowe scores significantly improved (P <.001 and P <.001, respectively). Recurrence, which includes dislocation and subluxation, occurred in 14% postoperatively. Anteroinferior labral lesion was seen in 92% of patients. Associated lesions included superior labrum anterior to posterior lesion (22%), midsubstance capsular tear (10%), and Hill-Sachs lesion (92%). Rotator cuff tears were found in 18%—partial-thickness tear in 10% and full-thickness tear, which was repaired with suture anchor, in 8%. Among the intra-articular lesions, there was no significant relation with recurrent instability or functional outcome as a single factor. Conclusions: In patients with chronic anterior shoulder instability who were older than 40 years, the clinical results after arthroscopic surgery showed statistically significant improvement with good muscle strength recovery.

Patients and methods: We reviewed the records of 68 patients with 69 aneurysms, including large and giant intradural ICA aneurysms, treated using microsurgical techniques from January 2008 to December 2014. We used adenosine-induced cardiac standstill or retrograde suction decompression for some aneurysm clipping cases and performed bypass surgery if needed. Results: Fifty-eight large and giant ICA aneurysms (84%) were treated with direct clipping, including 6 aneurysms (9%) clipped using adenosine-induced cardiac standstill and 10 aneurysms (14%) clipped using suction decompression. Eleven unclippable aneurysms (16%) were trapped with extracranial-intracranial bypass. Good or excellent results (modified Rankin Scale scores 0–2) were obtained in 47 patients with unruptured aneurysms (92%) and in 14 patients with ruptured aneurysms (82%) at the 6-month follow-up. Of 17 patients with visual disturbances before treatment, 11 (65%) had improved vision after surgical treatment. A remnant sac was found in 20 cases (29%) on digital subtraction angiography performed immediately postoperatively. At the median follow-up of 22 months, we encountered 3 recurrent aneurysm cases (5%) among the 58 aneurysms that were followed up. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that microsurgical treatment of large and giant intradural ICA aneurysms remains competitive to flow-diverting treatment, if the surgeon is prepared to perform multifarious surgical methods, including adenosine administration, retrograde suction decompression, and bypass vascular anastomosis. ? 2018",Adenosine; Cerebral revascularization; Clip; Giant intracranial aneurysm; Internal carotid artery,adenosine; adult; aged; aneurysm clipping; Article; brain artery aneurysm rupture; clinical outcome; decompression surgery; digital subtraction angiography; extraintracranial anastomosis; female; human; internal carotid artery aneurysm; major clinical study; male; microsurgery; recurrent disease; visual disorder,2-s2.0-85059290711

Electric moxibustion (EM), which has been recently developed as an alternative, offers adjustable and constant heat stimulation. This study aimed to investigate the psychophysical and psychophysiological responses to EM heat stimulation. Methods: Twenty-seven healthy volunteers received two different levels of heat stimulation using EM. High-temperature (HT) and medium-temperature (MT) heat stimulations were randomly delivered at the TE5 acupoint on the left or right arm. Participants rated the intensity and the spatial information of the heat sensations immediately after each EM stimulation. Local blood flow around the acupoint was measured with Laser Doppler perfusion imaging before and after heat stimulation. Results: Both HT-EM and MT-EM induced considerable heat sensations and enhanced local blood flow around the acupoints. HT-EM resulted in greater heat sensation compared to MT-EM. HT-EM induced a higher increase in local blood flow around the stimulation site compared to MT-EM. No remarkable adverse effects were noted. Conclusion: Two different levels of EM heat stimulation induced two different levels of heat sensations and enhanced local blood flow. This preliminary study suggests that the newly developed EM can be further applied to examine the effectiveness of moxibustion in clinical trials. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Bodily sensation map; Electric moxibustion (EM); Heat sensation; Laser doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI); Psychophysical; Psychophysiological,acupuncture point; adult; Article; blood flow; electric moxibustion; female; human; human experiment; laser Doppler flowmetry; male; moxibustion; normal human; psychophysiology; temperature; thermal stimulation; acupuncture point; arm; clinical trial; electricity; heat; moxibustion; procedures; psychology; psychophysiology; sensation; skin; young adult; Acupuncture Points; Adult; Arm; Electricity; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Moxibustion; Psychophysiology; Regional Blood Flow; Sensation; Skin; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85059198817

However, the use of chest radiography for lung cancer screening in Asian populations is still controversial. We investigated the effectiveness of chest radiographic surveillance using a nationwide health service data in South Korea. Methods: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service examinee cohort of 2004 to 2013 were examined, and 63,228 patients with lung cancer were identified, 38,494 (57%) of whom underwent chest radiography screening. The others did not undergo lung cancer screening and were considered as a control group. Clinical data including age, smoking, screening intervals, lung cancer stages, treatments, and survival were collected. Survival gain from surveillance after adjustment for lead-time bias based on the sojourn time was calculated. Cox-proportional hazard analyses were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of screening and to determine the appropriate screening interval for chest radiography surveillance. Results: Early lung cancer was found in 38% of patients receiving chest radiography versus 26% of those without surveillance. A patient age of more than 65 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% confidence limits [CL], 1.50–1.56), male (HR, 1.66; 95% CL, 1.62–1.70), and high lung cancer stages at the time of diagnosis were independent factors associated with mortality (each, P < 0.001). Chest radiography surveillance was a factor for decreasing mortality in female (HR, 0.81; 95% CL, 0.77–0.84, P < 0.001), with mortality reduction of 10% at the 3- and 5-year survival time-points. In female patients, chest radiography surveillance at intervals of less than 3 years was an independent predictor of improved survival. Conclusions: Surveillance chest radiography increased survival in a female screened population in South Korea. Chest radiography intervals of less than 3 years may help to detect lung cancer in female patients. ? 2018",Chest radiography; Lung cancer; Screening; Surveillance,"adult; aged; Article; cancer epidemiology; cancer mortality; cancer screening; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; female; groups by age; health service; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; smoking; South Korea; thorax radiography; early cancer diagnosis; health survey; Kaplan Meier method; lung tumor; mass screening; middle aged; mortality; proportional hazards model; public health; register; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Population Surveillance; Proportional Hazards Models; Radiography, Thoracic; Registries; Republic of Korea",2-s2.0-85059115529

Methods: Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) cohort data (n = 10,030) were used to develop T2DM prediction models. Both clinical-only and integrated (clinical factors + genetic factors) models were derived using the Cox proportional hazards model. Internal validation was performed to evaluate the prediction capabilities of the clinical and integrated models. Results: The clinical model included 10 selected clinical risk factors. The selected SNPs for the integrated model were rs9311835 in PTPRG, rs10975266 in RIC1, rs11057302 in TMED2, rs17154562 in ADAM12, and rs8038172 in CGNL1. For the clinical model, validated c-indices with time points of 5, 7, and 10 years were 0.744, 0.732, and 0.732, respectively. Slightly higher validated c-indices were observed for the integrated model at 0.747, 0.736, and 0.738, respectively. The p-values of the survival net reclassification improvement (NRI) for the SNP point-based score were statistically significant. Conclusions: Clinical and integrated models can be effectively used to predict the incidence of T2DM in Koreans. ? 2018",Genetic risk score; Risk factor; Risk prediction; Single-nucleotide polymorphism,"adult; aged; biological model; female; genetic marker; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; incidence; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phenotype; prognosis; risk assessment; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; South Korea; time factor; Adult; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prognosis; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85058783927

Hypothesis: The mechanical thromboprophylaxis could reduce the incidence of DVT compared to non-prophylaxis group and would have similar efficacy as the chemoprophylaxis following TKA in a low DVT incidence population. Materials and methods: From January 2009 to June 2016, 1259 elective primary TKA with preoperative diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis in a single institute were enrolled. Patients were divided into three groups: those who were managed with chemoprophylaxis (CPX group, 414 cases), with mechanical prophylaxis (IPC group, 425 cases), or without pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis (control group, 420 cases). All patients underwent preoperative ultrasonography and computed tomographic venography on postoperative day 6 to assess development of DVT. The incidence of overall, proximal, symptomatic DVT and symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) were compared among the groups. Major and minor bleeding complications were also evaluated. Results: The incidence of overall DVT was 14.8% in control group, 6.3% in CPX group and 11.3% in IPC group respectively and CPX group showed significantly lower incidence than other two groups (p < 0.001). The incidence of proximal DVT was 1.9% in control group, 0.7% in CPX group and 0.9% in IPC group respectively (p > 0.05). The incidence of symptomatic DVT was 0.7% in control group, 0% in CPX group and 0.7% in IPC group respectively (p > 0.05). There was no case of symptomatic PE diagnosed during hospital stay in all patients. Discussion: Single use of IPC device could not reach significant level of DVT prophylaxis compared to control group and only chemoprophylaxis showed significantly reduce the incidence of overall DVT following TKA. Single use of IPC device does not show effective thromboprophylaxis in a low DVT incidence population.

Among the evaluated resveratrol analogs, we have identified N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,5-dimethoxybenamide (MPDB) as a potent anti-proliferative compound. Treatment with MPDB resulted in G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest, which was accompanied by alteration of G 2 /M-related protein expression and phosphorylation. MPDB-induced G 2 /M arrest was blocked by transfection of ATM/ATR siRNAs, indicating the critical role of ATM/ATR in G 2 /M phase arrest. In addition, treatment with MPDB displayed the activation of caspase and decreased Bcl-xl protein expression after 20 h in HeLa cells. Moreover, MPDB increased cytosolic cytochrome c release and Fas and Fas-L protein expression, indicating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathway, respectively. These results suggest that MPDB is a new and potent compound that induces ATM/ATR-dependent G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, implicating it as a putative candidate in the investment of cervical cancer therapy. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Antiproliferation; Apoptosis; G2/M arrest; N-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-3,5-dimethoxybenamide; Resveratrol","2 (2 methoxybenzoylamino)benzoic acid methyl ester; 2,5 dimethoxyl n (4 methoxyphenyl)benzamide; 2,6 dimethoxy n (4 butoxyphenyl)benzamide; 2,6 dimethoxy n (4 methoxyphenyl)benzamide; 2,6 dimethoxy n phenylbenzamide; ATM protein; ATR protein; caspase; caspase 3; caspase 8; cytochrome c; Fas ligand; n (3,4 dimethoxyphenyl) 2,4,6 trimethoxybenzamide; n (4 methoxyphenyl) 3,5 dimethoxybenzamide; protein bcl xl; resveratrol; small interfering RNA; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; ATM protein; ATM protein, human; ATR protein, human; BCL2L1 protein, human; benzamide derivative; CDK1 protein, human; checkpoint kinase 1; checkpoint kinase 2; CHEK1 protein, human; CHEK2 protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase 1; protein bcl x; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; Ca Ski cell line; controlled study; cytosol; drug synthesis; enzyme activation; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; genetic transfection; HeLa cell line; HL-60 cell line; human; human cell; MRC-5 cell line; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; SiHa cell line; uterine cervix cancer; apoptosis; cell proliferation; drug effect; female; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; metabolism; phosphorylation; signal transduction; tumor cell line; uterine cervix tumor; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins; bcl-X Protein; Benzamides; CDC2 Protein Kinase; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Checkpoint Kinase 1; Checkpoint Kinase 2; Female; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Humans; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85057879836

For comparison with conventional denoising methods, the Wiener filter and total variation (TV) denoising algorithm were used. The temporal resolution, coefficient of variation (COV), and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) were evaluated for three exposure conditions: (a) various tube voltages at fixed 40 mAs, (b) various tube currents at fixed 28 kVp, and (c) auto exposure control mode. The results showed that the proposed FNLM denoising algorithm can achieve a similar temporal resolution to the Wiener filter and may efficiently reduce image noise by using COV and CNR values in mammography. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Denoising algorithm; Fast non-local means approach; Image processing; Medial mammography; Medical application,Diseases; Image enhancement; Image processing; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Phantoms; Coefficient of variation; Contrast to noise ratio; De-noising algorithm; Early breast cancer; Exposure conditions; Non local means; Temporal resolution; Total variation denoising; Image denoising,2-s2.0-85057811791

To prepare and store biomolecule-containing reagents stably, reducing agents are used during protein preparation, and freeze-drying technology has been applied to the protein reagents. Some of the additives used during these processes may affect subsequent processes such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, we evaluated the impact of TCEP, a reducing agent, and TBA, a freeze-drying medium, on the performance of convection PCR (cPCR) using a battery-operable PCR device. Singleplex cPCR detection of a 249?bp amplicon from human genomic DNA suggested that approximately 82% of performance was achieved in the presence of 0.1?mM TCEP and 1% TBA. The limit of detection and the minimum number of cycles at which amplicons began to appear was a little lower (~ 82% efficiency) or higher (20 vs 15 cycles), respectively, in the chemical-treated group than in the control group. With larger amplicons of 500?bp, the chemical-treated group revealed approximately 78% of performance and amplicons started to appear at 20 cycles of cPCR in both groups.

However, the risk of bleeding remains a major concern. We assessed the association of potent P2Y12 blockers with ischemic and bleeding outcomes in patients with NSTEMI. Methods: From the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry-National Institute of Health database, 4927 patients with NSTEMI receiving drug-eluting stents (DES) were divided into potent P2Y12 blocker (ticagrelor or prasugrel, n = 901) and clopidogrel (n = 3180) groups. Propensity-matched 12-month ischemic and bleeding events were compared. Patients who received anticoagulants or who discontinued P2Y12 blockers or switched between potent P2Y12 blockers and clopidogrel were excluded. Results: In the overall population, patients at higher ischemic and bleeding risks more often received clopidogrel. After propensity matching (n = 901 in each group), 12-month rates of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events were lower (7.3% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.038), but Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major or minor bleeding rates were higher (5.9% vs. 2.2%, p < 0.001) with potent P2Y12 blockers. Twelve-month rates of death from any cause, MI, stroke, or TIMI major bleeding were not different. On multivariate analysis, 12-month risk of TIMI major or minor bleeding was higher with B2 or C lesion, potent P2Y12 blocker use, body weight <60 kg, and lower with time to PCI <12 h and radial artery access. Conclusions: In patients with NSTEMI receiving DES, potent P2Y12 blockers were associated with reduced ischemic but increased bleeding risk with similar net clinical benefits. ? 2018",Antiplatelet agents; Drug-eluting stents; Myocardial infarction,clopidogrel; fibrinogen receptor; hemoglobin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; prasugrel; ticagrelor; adult; age; angina pectoris; anticoagulant therapy; Article; bleeding; blood clot lysis; body weight; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; clinical outcome; diabetes mellitus; female; heart infarction; heart rate; hospitalization; human; hypertension; ischemia; leukocyte count; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; radial artery; risk assessment; sex difference; smoking; thorax pain; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85055625751

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of mild glenohumeral osteoarthritis on the clinical outcome after large to massive rotator cuff repair. Methods: This study included 146 patients who underwent rotator cuff repair for large to massive tears and were available for follow-up at a minimum of 2 years. Of the patients, 74 had mild glenohumeral osteoarthritis (group A) and 72 did not have glenohumeral osteoarthritis (group B). Results: The mean visual analog scale score during motion, mean University of California at Los Angeles score, and mean Constant score were 1.8, 30.2, and 87.4, respectively, in group A and 2.0, 30.8, and 89.2, respectively, in group B at final follow-up. The retear rates were 31.1% (23 of 74 patients) in group A and 25.0% (18 of 72 patients) in group B. The osteoarthritis progression rates were 12.1% (9 of 74) in group A and 13.8% (10 of 72) in group B. However, in group A, the osteoarthritis progression rates were 26.1% (6 of 23) for retear cases and 5.9% (3 of 51) for healed cases. There was a significant difference in the progression rates between retear and healed cases in group A (odds ratio, 5.65; P =.022). Conclusions: There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between patients with and without glenohumeral osteoarthritis before surgery and during final follow-up. The progression of osteoarthritis in large to massive rotator cuff tears is relatively low. However, it is significantly higher in patients with retears in whom osteoarthritis is present. ? 2018 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",glenohumeral joint; large to massive; Level III; osteoarthritis; retear; Retrospective Cohort Design; rotator cuff tear; Shoulder; Treatment Study,"abduction; adult; aged; Article; case control study; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease exacerbation; disease severity; external rotation; female; follow up; forward flexion; glenohumeral osteoarthritis; human; joint mobility; major clinical study; male; movement (physiology); muscle strength; osteoarthritis; priority journal; range of motion; retrospective study; rotator cuff rupture; scoring system; visual analog scale; complication; joint characteristics and functions; middle aged; osteoarthritis; pain measurement; pathophysiology; recurrent disease; rotator cuff injury; shoulder; shoulder pain; treatment outcome; Aged; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis; Pain Measurement; Range of Motion, Articular; Recurrence; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Shoulder Joint; Shoulder Pain; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85054750862

We used a label-free quantitative proteomic technique to investigate differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in human PDLSCs (hPDLSCs) compared to human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and identify proteins specific to hPDLSCs. Material and Methods: hPDLSCs (n?=?3) and hBMSCs (n?=?3) were cultured and harvested for protein extraction and trypsin digestion. The proteomes of both cell types were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. DEPs in hPDLSCs compared to hBMSCs were detected by label-free quantification and evaluated through signal transduction pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis. Results: In total, 690 and 771 proteins were identified from hPDLSCs and hBMSCs, of which 561 proteins were in common and 124 DEPs were found between hPDLSCs and hBMSCs. Fifty-eight proteins were expressed at significantly higher levels in hPDLSCs, whereas 66 proteins were expressed at lower levels compared to hBMSCs. The more highly expressed proteins were associated with translation and initiating protein synthesis, and lower expressed proteins were related to cell aging and metabolic processes. Proteins unique to hPDLSCs and hBMSCs were associated with translation and metabolic processes, respectively. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate evidence of distinct differences in protein expression between hPDLSCs and hBMSCs by using label-free quantitative proteomic analysis which was the first attempt in this field. DEPs included previously reported hPDLSC marker proteins and novel marker candidates, such as microtubule-associated protein, CTP synthase 1 and stathmin, which could be the markers for developing periodontal disease diagnostics and therapies. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, very few studies have investigated the association between sleep hygiene and sleep symptoms, especially in patients with mild or moderate OSA. This study evaluated the relationship between factors related to sleep hygiene and clinical symptoms in patients with mild to moderate OSA. Methods: One hundred and seventy-four patients who visited the Sleep Breathing Disorder Center at a tertiary academic center to evaluate suspected OSA were included. All patients underwent standard polysomnography (PSG) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and questionnaires related to daytime and nighttime symptoms and sleep hygiene. Medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and PSG parameters. Correlation analysis between sleep hygiene-related conditions and clinical symptoms in patients with mild to moderate OSA was performed. Results: The correlation analysis between the nine categories of sleep hygiene and the three categories of clinical symptoms showed that, in the case of inadequate temperature and humidity conditions, the three categories of clinical symptoms were more severe (daytime symptoms r = 0.382, nighttime symptoms r = 0.568, ESS score r = 0.321). Drinking alcohol before sleep (daytime symptoms r = 0.457, nighttime symptoms r = 0.649, ESS score r = 0.301) and emotional excitement or arousal (daytime symptoms r = 0.378, nighttime symptoms r = 0.545, ESS score r = 0.341) were correlated with greater severity of each of the clinical symptoms (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Among the factors of sleep hygiene-related conditions, inadequate temperature and humidity, drinking alcohol before sleep, and emotional excitement or arousal were associated with symptoms of mild to moderate OSA. This study supports the hypothesis that patients with mild to moderate OSA can experience symptom relief if they are trained to correct lifestyle habits to maintain adequate sleep hygiene-related conditions. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Apnea–hypopnea index; Body mass index; Clinical symptoms; Obstructive sleep apnea; Sleep hygiene; Total sleep time,"alcohol; adult; apnea hypopnea index; arousal; Article; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; drinking behavior; emotion; Epworth sleepiness scale; excitement; female; human; humidity; major clinical study; male; polysomnography; sleep disordered breathing; sleep hygiene; temperature; arousal; drinking behavior; emotion; humidity; middle aged; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; sleep disordered breathing; somnolence; temperature; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Arousal; Emotions; Female; Humans; Humidity; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Sleep Hygiene; Sleepiness; Temperature",2-s2.0-85048788927

As a result of the development of atherosclerotic lesions, the walls of blood vessels become thicker and inhibit blood circulation. Atherosclerosis is caused by a high-fat diet and vascular injury. Chronic arterial inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In particular, secretion of the pro-atherogenic cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α induces expression of endothelial adhesion molecules including P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which mediate attachment of circulating monocytes and lymphocytes. In this study, we examined the anti-atherosclerotic effect of sorghum, which is known to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. A 50% ethanol extract of Sorghum bicolor L. Moench fermented with Aspergillus oryzae NK (fSBE) was used for experiments. In vitro expression of endothelial adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 and pro-inflammatory factor cyclooxygenase-2 was significantly decreased and that of the anti-atherogenic factor heme oxygenase-1 significantly increased by fSBE (P < 0.05). At the in vivo level, we examined fat droplets of liver tissue, and aortic thickness via histological analysis, and determined the blood lipid profile through chemical analysis. fSBE at a dose of 200?mg/kg significantly improved blood and vascular health (P < 0.05).

Moreover, there are few studies investigating data-driven cognitive trajectory in aMCI. We therefore classified patients with aMCI based on their cognitive trajectory, measured by clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SOB). Then, we compared the clinical and neuroimaging features among groups classified by cognitive trajectory. Methods: We retrospectively recruited 278 patients with aMCI who underwent three or more timepoints of neuropsychological testing. They also had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including structured three-dimensional volume images. Cortical thickness was measured using surface-based methods. We performed trajectory analyses to classify our aMCI patients according to their progression and investigate their cognitive trajectory using CDR-SOB. Results: Trajectory analyses showed that patients with aMCI were divided into three groups: stable (61.8%), slow decliner (31.7%), and fast decliner (6.5%). Changes throughout a mean follow-up duration of 3.7 years in the CDR-SOB for the subgroups of stable/slow/fast decliners were 1.3-, 6.4-, and 12-point increases, respectively. Decliners were older and carried apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotypes more frequently than stable patients. Compared with the stable group, decliners showed a higher frequency of aMCI patients with both visual and verbal memory dysfunction, late stage aMCI, and multiple domain dysfunction. In addition, compared with the stable group, the slow decliners showed cortical thinning predominantly in bilateral parietotemporal areas, while the fast decliners showed cortical thinning predominantly in bilateral frontotemporal areas. Both decliner groups showed worse cognitive function in attention, language, visuospatial, memory, and frontal/executive domains than the stable group. Conclusions: Our data-driven trajectory analysis provides new insights into heterogeneous cognitive trajectories of aMCI and further suggests that baseline clinical and neuroimaging profiles might predict aMCI patients with poor prognosis. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Amnestic mild cognitive impairment; Cognitive trajectory; Data-driven,apolipoprotein E4; aged; Article; attention; brain region; Clinical Dementia Rating; cognition; comparative study; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); disease classification; disease course; disease duration; female; follow up; genotype; human; illness trajectory; language ability; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prognosis; retrospective study; verbal memory; visual memory,2-s2.0-85060401829

However, few studies have been conducted on the effects of new psychoactive phenethylamines on the release of DA and 5-HT. In the present study, the effects of new psychoactive phenethylamines with a variety of aromatic ring substitutions (5-API, 3-FMA, 5-MAPB, and DMMA) on the release of DA and 5-HT were investigated. Methods: Changes of DA, 5-HT and their metabolites in brain microdialysates from rats following exposure to the drugs were examined using a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method. Their potencies of DA and 5-HT uptake inhibition as well as dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) binding were also determined. Results: With the exception of DMMA, the drugs markedly affected the extracellular concentration of DA, 5-HT and/or their metabolites in rats and acted as potent inhibitors for DAT and/or SERT. Especially, 5-API potently induced the nonselective release of both DA and 5-HT, which was strongly correlated with a high degree of uptake inhibition and binding affinity to DAT and SERT. The 3-FMA, a methamphetamine analog with a halogen-substituted benzene, induced greater 5-HT release than DA. Conclusions: We found that new psychoactive phenethylamines, with a variety of aromatic ring substitutions, affected the extracellular levels of DA, 5-HT, and/or their metabolites in the nucleus accumbens of rats to varying degrees and in different ways. The current results may assist further research into monoamine neurotransmitter-related mechanisms of new psychoactive phenethylamines.

US is routinely used for evaluation of various salivary gland diseases because of its easy accessibility and absence of ionizing radiation. US also allows dynamic studies with real-time imaging during diagnostic or surgical procedures. However, conventional US images have limitations in salivary duct visualization. Although US images acquired with saline irrigation have improved visualization because of ductal system dilation by the pulling effect, the resultant image quality remains insufficient for diagnosis. Therefore, contrast agents are required during US-guided sialo-irrigation procedures to produce diagnostic image quality. Air bubbles in saline solution have high echogenicity and enhance image quality by acting as a US contrast agent. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance of US-guided sialo-irrigation with a saline–air contrast medium, to estimate its diagnostic and treatment efficacy, and to examine the procedure in two patients. In the study, two patients underwent US-guided salivary gland irrigation with air-bubble mixed saline solution. During the procedure, we were able to visualize the salivary gland duct and subsequently irrigate and clean the inside of the duct.

In particular, CCL17 and CCL22 expression is increased in patients with chronic skin inflammation. In this study, we synthesized several α- and β-anomers of dihydroergosterol (DHE)-glycosides and assessed their effects on CCL17 and CCL22 expression. We confirmed that the β-anomers of DHE-glycosides were superior to α-anomers of DHE-glycosides in inhibiting CCL17 and CCL22 mRNA and protein expression. In addition, we determined that DHE-glycoside β-anomers showed strong inhibitory activity towards pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and protein expression, including that of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β- in stimulated HaCaT cells. These results imply that DHE-glycoside α- and β-anomers should be separated during synthesis of drugs for chronic skin inflammation.

We tried to find whether there is any related side effect, and discovered that early discharge, especially before 10?days after surgery, is associated with higher mortality. Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze the association between the length of hospital stay after hip fracture and 1-year mortality in older adults aged ? 65?years old. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance Service data to identify patients who were discharged after hip fracture surgery from 2007 to 2009 among 487,460 older adults of age ? 65?years. The lengths of stay involving hip fracture surgery were categorized at 10-day interval, and analyzed in relation to 1-year mortality from the date of hospital discharge. Results: A total of 4213 patients were discharged after hip fracture surgery, of whom 604 (14.3%) died within 1?year of discharge. The average length of stay was 30.7?days (standard deviation 24.5?days). The 1-year mortality was the highest for the length of stay ? 10?days group at 21.7%, followed by 15.2%, 14.3%, 13.3%, and 12.4% for > 40, 21–30, 31–40, and 11–20?days groups, respectively (p value 0.05). On Cox proportional hazard regression, the adjusted hazard ratio for length of stay ? 10?days group was 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.14–2.12) against the reference group (11–20?days), while other groups did not show statistical significance.

Although numerous systematic reviews have analyzed various therapies for sciatica, the validity of their included studies is limited. Considering the limitations of conventional treatment options for sciatica, acupuncture is a possible option; however, evidence supporting its efficacy and mechanism in patients with sciatica is lacking. The aim of this proposed protocol is to investigate the effect and neurophysiological mechanism of acupuncture in patients with chronic sciatica. Methods/design: This study is a randomized, patient-assessor blind, two-arm, parallel, non-penetrating, sham-controlled clinical trial. Eligible participants will include adults (aged 19-70 years old) with a clinical diagnosis of chronic sciatica (40 mm or more of a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) for bothersomeness) blinded to the treatment received. Patients will be randomly allocated into the acupuncture treatment group (manual acupuncture plus electroacupuncture (EA), n = 34) or the sham acupuncture control group (sham acupuncture plus placebo EA without electrical stimulation, n = 34). Groups will receive treatment twice a week for a total of eight sessions over 4 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging will be implemented at baseline and endpoint to investigate the mechanism of acupuncture. The primary outcome measure is the VAS for bothersomeness and secondary outcomes include the VAS for pain intensity, Oswestry Disability Index, EuroQol 5-Dimension, Coping Strategy Questionnaire, Beck's Depression Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Adverse events will be assessed at every visit. Discussion: The results of this trial (which will be available in 2020) should provide important clinical evidence for the effect of acupuncture and demonstrate how acupuncture can be helpful for the treatment of chronic sciatica.

Methods: The medical records of 534 patients diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma at Kyung Hee University Hospital between January 2007 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Mean patient age was 47.9?±?16.2?years. The most common symptoms at the time of presentation were headache (26.2%) and visual disturbance (12.4%). The referral rate to the ophthalmology department was 18.44% and patients most often presented to the neurosurgery department. Optic chiasm compression was identified in 23.4% of patients (54.4% of patients referred to ophthalmology, 15.0% of patients not referred to ophthalmology). Normal visual field (57%) was the most common visual field feature followed by bitemporal hemianopsia (17.8%). Optic chiasmal compression without visual field defects was found in 36.1% of patients. Tumor volume was positively correlated with visual field pattern standard deviation (PSD, p?=?0.020) and best-corrected logMAR visual acuity (p?=?0.000) and negatively associated with tumor volume and visual field mean deviation (MD, p?=?0.000). Best-corrected visual acuity (p?=?0.000), MD (p?=?0.001), and PSD (p?=?0.028) significantly improved after surgery. Conclusions: Pituitary adenoma patients do not always have ocular symptoms at their first presentation, even when optic chiasm compression and visual field deficits are present.

The traumatic experience results in the development of a prolonged stress response that causes impaired memory function and increased inflammation in the hippocampus. Currently, antidepressants are the only approved therapy for PTSD. However, the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of PTSD is marginal. The ethanol extract of Aralia continentalis (AC) is traditionally used in oriental medicine, and has been showed to possess pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-diabetic effects. Nevertheless, the effects of AC on cognitive memory and its mechanism of action in PTSD remain unclear. Given the necessity of further treatment options for PTSD, we investigated the effect of AC on the spatial cognitive impairment caused by single prolonged stress (SPS) in a rat model of PTSD. Methods: Male rats were treated with various intraperitoneal (i.p.) doses of AC for 21 consecutive days after inducing chronic stress with the SPS procedure. Results: Cognitive impairment caused by SPS were inhibited after treatment with 100 mg/kg AC, as measured by the Morris water maze test and an object recognition test. Additionally, AC treatment significantly alleviated memory-related decreases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that AC significantly inhibited the cognitive deficits caused by SPS via increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, in the rat brain. Conclusions: AC reversed the behavioral impairments and inflammation triggered by SPS-derived traumatic stress and should be further evaluated as a potential therapeutic drug for PTSD. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Aralia continentalis; Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Memory; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Pro-inflammatory cytokines,"antiinflammatory agent; Aralia continentalis extract; brain derived neurotrophic factor; fluoxetine; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; plant extract; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; brain derived neurotrophic factor; plant extract; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Aralia; Aralia continentalis; Article; chronic stress; cognition; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; hippocampus; male; Morris water maze test; nonhuman; novel object recognition test; posttraumatic stress disorder; protein expression; protein modification; protein RNA binding; rat; traditional medicine; animal; chemistry; cognitive defect; disease model; genetics; human; immunology; isolation and purification; maze test; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychology; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Aralia; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Male; Maze Learning; Plant Extracts; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",2-s2.0-85059796955

Significantly increased neurite regeneration and MMP-2 expression was observed in the ES group compared with the sham group. However, an MMP inhibitor significantly decreased this ES-induced neurite regeneration.

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in utilization and survival rate in patients supported with ECMO for severe respiratory failure in Korea. Methods: This was a multicenter study on consecutive patients who underwent ECMO across 16 hospitals in Korea. The records of all patients who required ECMO for acute respiratory failure between 2012 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed, and the utilization of ECMO was analyzed over time. Results: During the study period, 5552 patients received ECMO in Korea as a whole, and a total of 2472 patients received ECMO at the participating 16 hospitals. We analyzed 487 (19.7%) patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure. The number of ECMO procedures provided for respiratory failure increased from 104 to 153 during the study period. The in-hospital survival rate increased from 30.8% to 35.9%. The use of prone positioning increased from 6.8% to 49.0% (p < 0.001), and the use of neuromuscular blockers also increased from 28.2% to 58.2% (p < 0.001).

Methods: A survey conducted at an outpatient clinic from June to October 2014 and retrospective charts for patients undergoing thyroidectomy at Konkuk University Medical Centers from June 2009 to December 2013 were reviewed. We compared clinical characteristics and pre- and postoperative obesity-related factors in 227 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy or lobectomy. Results: Patients included 39 males and 188 females with a mean age of 46.0 ± 11.0 years; the mean follow-up period was 23.9 ± 16.7 months, and 90 of the 227 patients showed postthyroidectomy obesity. In effect of operative extent on postoperative obesity, patients who underwent TT (48.2 years) than those who underwent lobectomy (43.4 years). TT group had longer follow-up and the frequency of menopause was higher than in the lobectomy group. No differences in postthyroidectomy obesity, body weight change, or body mass index (BMI), change among 2 groups. The predictors of postthyroidectomy obesity were older age, female, heavy alcohol consumption (P = 0.029), higher preoperative BMI (P < 0.001), larger postoperative weight gain (P = 0.024), and larger BMI change. However, the extent of thyroidectomy did not affect postthyroidectomy obesity. Preoperative BMI (P < 0.001) and heavy alcohol consumption (P = 0.03) were independent factors of postthyroidectomy obesity. Conclusion: The extent of thyroidectomy does not affect postthyroidectomy obesity. Preoperative BMI and heavy alcohol consumption are risk factors for postthyroidectomy obesity.

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-endometriotic effect of dehydrocostus lactone, an active compound in A. lappa roots, using human endometriotic cells and macrophages stimulated by these cells. Dehydrocostus lactone induced apoptotic cell death in 12Z human endometriotic cells. Dehydrocostus lactone stimulated the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, while caspase inhibitors significantly reversed the dehydrocostus lactone-induced cell death in 12Z cells. In addition, dehydrocostus lactone decreased the production of PGE2 and neurotrophins (BDNF, NGF, NT3, and NT4/5), which are regarded as endometriosis-associated pain factors in human endometriotic cells. Moreover, dehydrocostus lactone inhibited the expression of M2 markers (CD206, and Trem-2), IL-10, VEGF, and MMP-2/-9 in endometriosis-associated macrophages (EAMs). Furthermore, dehydrocostus lactone inhibited the Akt and NFκB pathways in both endometriotic cells and EAMs. Taken together, our findings suggest that dehydrocostus lactone, an active compound of A, lappa, has anti-endometriotic activities via induction of apoptosis and downregulation of pain factors in endometriotic cells and inhibition of the alternative activation of EAMs. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Apoptosis; Aucklandia lappa; Dehydrocostus Lactone; Endometriosis; M2 Macrophages; Neurotrophins,"antiinflammatory agent; brain derived neurotrophic factor; caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; caspase inhibitor; dehydrocostus lactone; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 10; nerve growth factor; neurotrophin 3; neurotrophin 4; prostaglandin E2; protein kinase B; Saussurea lappa extract; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; vasculotropin; caspase; cell surface receptor; dehydrocostus lactone; interleukin 10; lactone; lectin; mannose binding lectin; mannose receptor; nerve growth factor; prostaglandin E2; sesquiterpene; 12Z cell line; Akt signaling; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; drug isolation; drug synthesis; endometriosis; enzyme activation; female; human; human cell; macrophage; macrophage activation; plant root; prostaglandin synthesis; protein expression; apoptosis; cell line; chemical stimulation; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; endometriosis; endometrium; immunology; isolation and purification; metabolism; phytotherapy; Saussurea; traditional medicine; Apoptosis; Caspases; Cell Line; Dinoprostone; Endometriosis; Endometrium; Female; Humans; Interleukin-10; Lactones; Lectins, C-Type; Macrophage Activation; Mannose-Binding Lectins; Medicine, Traditional; Nerve Growth Factors; Phytotherapy; Plant Roots; Receptors, Cell Surface; Saussurea; Sesquiterpenes; Stimulation, Chemical",2-s2.0-85072157693

The objective of this study was to report several cases of neurological deficits due to proximal ASD in patients with post-tuberculous kyphotic deformity and discuss the characteristics of the authors' corrective surgical technique. Methods: The inclusion criteria in this study were severe angular kyphosis due to a post-tuberculous kyphotic deformity and a late-onset neurological deficit. The cause of these deficits was related to a lesion in the proximal cephalad portion of the kyphotic deformity. Surgical intervention, including decompression and compromised restoration of the sagittal imbalance, was performed in all patients. Preoperative surgical planning with a radiological evaluation included CT, plain radiograph, and MRI studies. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Results: The main goal of our surgical technique was the correction of sagittal malalignment by positioning the patient's head above the kyphotic deformity on the sagittal plane, excluding aggressive osteotomy. The neurological symptoms showed immediate improvements postoperatively, except in 1 patient. Compared to the preoperative value of 66.9, the mean ODI score improved to 42.6 at the final follow-up for all patients. Preoperatively, the mean values of the angles of deformity and the sagittal vertical axis were 99.7° and 157.7 mm, respectively, and decreased to 75.3° and 46.0 mm, respectively, at the final follow-up. No major complications were observed, and the patients' self-satisfaction was high with respect to both cosmetic and functional outcomes. Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of the degeneration of the vertebrae above the kyphotic segment in patients with post-tuberculosis deformity. Successful neurological recovery and compromised sagittal balance could be obtained by using our ""head on kyphus"" surgical concept. ? 2019 AANS.",Adjacent segment degeneration; Degenerative; Kyphosis; Neurological deficit; Surgical technique; Tuberculosis,cosmetic; adult; aged; American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale; Article; clinical article; clinical outcome; female; follow up; human; kyphosis; male; middle aged; neurologic disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteotomy; Oswestry Disability Index; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; post tuberculous kyphotic deformity; preoperative period; proximal adjacent segment degeneration; retrospective study; sagittal vertical axis; spinal cord atrophy; spinal cord decompression; spine malformation; spine radiography; treatment planning; x-ray computed tomography,2-s2.0-85072035849

At present, however, the impact of hypertension on recanalization of coiled aneurysms has not been adequately investigated. This study examined the relation between hypertension and subsequent outcomes of coiled aneurysms, using a?matched patient analysis. Methods: A?total of 715 subjects undergoing coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms between 2011 and 2013 were selected for study. Time-of-flight magnetic resonance or conventional angiography was used (singly or together) to gauge degrees of occlusion after coiling, applying the Raymond classification in grading recanalization. Patients with hypertension were grouped as controlled or uncontrolled, based on blood pressure readings at outpatient clinics. Hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects were matched (1:1) for several relevant variables. Results: Overall, 484 patients (67.7%) were hypertensive (controlled 338; uncontrolled 146). During the follow-up period (28.6?± 9.7?months), 129 aneurysms (18.0%) displayed recanalization (minor?58; major?71). Patient age, concomitant diabetes, hyperlipidemia, aneurysm size, neck size, depth-to-neck ratio, and aneurysm type differed significantly in hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups; however, group incidences of cumulative recanalization were similar (p?= 0.297). After 1:1?matching the cumulative recanalization rate (13.5%) in hypertensive and non-hypertensive counterparts (14.3%) again proved similar (p?= 0.578). In the hypertensive group, in addition, recanalization showed no relation to controlled and uncontrolled subgroup (odds ratio, OR?= 1.000, p?> 0.999). Conclusion: Unlike other aspects of evolving aneurysms (e.g. formation, growth, or rupture), recanalization of coiled aneurysms seems to be unaffected by systemic hypertension. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Aneurysm; Coil embolization; Hypertension; Recanalization; Recurrence,,2-s2.0-85071468420

In this study, we propose a framework to identify social information as a significant predictor of depression. Using the proposed framework, we develop an application called the Socially Mediated Patient Portal (SMPP), which detects depression-related markers in Facebook users by applying a data-driven approach with machine learning classification techniques. We examined a data set of 4350 users who were evaluated for depression using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. From this analysis, we identified a set of features that can distinguish between individuals with and without depression. Finally, we identified the dominant features that adequately assess individuals with and without depression on social media. The model trained on these features will be helpful to physicians in diagnosing mental diseases and psychiatrists in analysing patient behaviour. ?

Upon discovering a number of T or B cell epitope regions from T. gondii IMC, ROP18 and MIC8, multi-antigen VLPs or combination VLPs were generated. Mice immunized with multi-antigen VLPs or combination VLPs were challenge infected with T. gondii (ME49). T. gondii-specific IgG, IgG isotypes and IgA antibody responses, memory T and B cell responses and protection were evaluated. All the mice survived upon T. gondii challenge infection by multi-antigen VLPs vaccination. Vaccinated mice elicited higher levels of parasite-specific IgG and IgG2a antibody responses in sera, IgA antibody responses in feces, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, and cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-10) responses compared to combination VLPs. In particular, the multi-antigen VLPs vaccination showed significantly higher levels of antibody secreting cell (ASC) responses, CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells, and memory B cells than combination VLPs. Multi-antigen VLPs vaccination showed significant reduction of brain cyst counts and size, and all mice survived. Prediction and analysis of epitopes have indicated that IMC, ROP18 and MIC8 showed partially overlapping epitopes for T and B cells. Our results indicated that antibody responses, memory T and B cells induced by multi-antigen VLPs vaccination might contribute to the complete protection upon T. gondii (ME49) challenge infection. ? 2019 Lee et al.

Current medications available for BPH treatment display several adverse effects; thus, the search for effective treatments with less side effects is still ongoing. In this study, we investigated the effect of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Preparata (dried root of Aconitum carmichaelii Debx.; AL), which is an herb used to treat extremely cold symptoms in traditional Korean medicine, on BPH using a testosterone propionate- (TP-) induced BPH rat model. Eight-week inguinal injection of TP induced BPH in rats, the prostate of which was displaying an abnormal proliferation. The pathological proliferation of the prostate was ameliorated by AL treatment of 4 weeks. Pathohistological changes in the prostate including epithelial thickness and lumen area were restored in AL-treated rats. Furthermore, 5α-reductase (5AR) and androgen receptor (AR), the two main factors in the pathogenesis of BPH, were decreased. In addition, the ratio of BAX and Bcl-2, an indicator of apoptosis, was increased by AL as well. Similar results were observed in AL-treated LNCaP prostate cancer cells. AL treatment suppressed the expression of the 5AR-AR axis and increased the ratio of BAX and Bcl-2. Apoptosis in the testis is considered a crucial side effect of finasteride, a 5AR inhibitor used to treat BPH. Our results showed that AL treatment did not display such effects, while finasteride treatment resulted in loss of spermatogenic cells within the prostate. Overall, these results suggest AL as a potentially safe nature-derived therapeutic agent for BPH treatment. ? 2019 Jinbong Park et al.",,aconiti lateralis radix preparata; androgen receptor; plant extract; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; steroid 5alpha reductase; testosterone propionate; unclassified drug; Aconitum carmichaelii; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; human; human cell; Korean medicine; LNCaP cell line; male; nonhuman; plant root; prostate cell; prostate hypertrophy; rat,2-s2.0-85071094026

Various methods have been applied for periodontal regeneration, including tissue substitutes, bioactive materials, and synthetic scaffolds. However, all of these treatments have had limited success in structural and functional periodontal tissue regeneration. To achieve the goal of complete periodontal regeneration, many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of decellularized scaffolds fabricated via tissue engineering. The aim of this study was to fabricate a decellularized periodontal scaffold of human tooth slices and determine its regeneration potential. We evaluated two different protocols applied to tooth slices obtained from human healthy third molars. The extracellular matrix scaffold decellularized using sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100, which are effective in removing nuclear components, was demonstrated to preserve an intact structure and composition. Furthermore, the decellularized scaffold could support repopulation of PDL stem cells near the cementum and expressed cementum and periodontal-ligament-related genes. These results show that decellularized PDL scaffolds of human teeth are capable of inducing the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, thus having regeneration potential for use in future periodontal regenerative tissue engineering. ? 2019 Son et al.

We aimed to compare costs between SILS and CLS for colon cancer. Methods: We analyzed the clinical outcomes and overall hospital costs of patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer from July 2009 to September 2014 at our institution; 288 were used for analysis after propensity score matching. The total hospital charge, including fees for the operation, anesthesia, preoperative diagnosis, and postoperative management was analyzed. Results: The total hospital charges were similar in both groups ($8770.40 vs. $8352.80, P = 0.099). However, the patients' total hospital bill was higher in the SILS group than in the CLS group ($4184.82 vs. $3735.00, P < 0.001) mainly due to the difference of the cost of access devices. There was no difference in the additional costs associated with readmission due to late complications between the two groups ($2383.08 vs. $2288.33, P = 0.662). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for total incision length in ‘total hospital charge’ and patient's bill and government's bill in ‘cost of instruments and supplies’ were -$107.08/1 cm, -$109.70/1 cm, and $80.64/1 cm, respectively. Conclusion: SILS for colon cancer yielded similar costs as well as perioperative and long-term outcomes compared with CLS. Therefore, SILS can be considered a reasonable treatment option for colon cancer for selective patients. ? 2019",Colon cancer; Cost; Cost analysis; Single-incision laparoscopic surgery,,2-s2.0-85070732779

However, the area under the curve (AUC) for NMLR (0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-0.93) was significantly greater than that for NLR (0.88 [0.84-0.92]). Conclusions: The neutrophil-to-monocyte-plus-lymphocyte ratio (NMLR) can be used as a new index that is more powerful than neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in discriminating tuberculosis (TB) from non-TB infectious lung diseases. NMLR had more statistical strength than NLR in discriminating TB from non-TB infectious lung diseases. ? 2019 American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019. All rights reserved.

Methods: Between January 2010 and April 2019, 101 patients with pathologically confirmed gastric cancer were collected. Among them, 53 patients with pathologic T3 and T4a cancers were included in this study. Three reviewers assessed preoperative CT scans for radiologic T staging in two sessions, independently and in consensus at a 2-week interval, while blinded about the pathologic T stage. The radiologic serosal invasion sign was defined as a nodular extension from the outer gastric wall reaching beyond the perigastric vascular plane and adopted as a new CT criterion for T4a cancer. We evaluated the diagnostic performance, interobserver agreement, and prognostic significance of this sign for the postoperative recurrence. Results: There were 46 pathologic T3 cancers (86.7%) and seven pathologic T4a cancers (13.2%). The diagnostic performance of the radiologic serosal invasion sign in the differentiation between T3 and T4a cancers was as follows: sensitivity, 91.3%; specificity, 71.43%; and accuracy, 88.68% for R1 and sensitivity, 78.26%; specificity, 85.71%; and accuracy, 79.25% for R2. The k-value was 0.64. Among the clinical and pathologic variables, radiologic T4a sign [hazard ratio (HR): 7.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36–26.86, p = 0.001], pathologic T4a (HR 9.82, 95% CI 2.35–40.95, p = 0.002), tumor size (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02–1.35, p = 0.026), and lymphovascular invasion (HR 6.39, 95% CI 1.42–28.75, p = 0.015) were the significant factors for postoperative recurrence. Conclusions: Radiologic serosal invasion sign is reliable as a new CT criterion for T4a cancer staging in patients with advanced gastric cancer, demonstrating 80% to 88% accuracy. Radiologic serosal invasion sign can also serve as a prognostic factor for postoperative recurrence as well as pathologic T4a stage. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Advanced gastric cancer; Computed tomography; Postoperative recurrence; Serosal invasion; Tumor staging,,2-s2.0-85069898747

The purpose of this study was to analyze the dietary patterns and food groups that contribute to sodium and potassium intakes according to dietary Na/K ratio in Koreans. Methods: A 24-hour dietary recall was collected twice from 640 healthy adults (aged 19-69 years) in four Korean provinces. The subjects were divided into groups of Na/K<1 and Na/K?1, and their dietary pattern focused on sodium and potassium intakes and Na/K ratio of major food groups were analyzed and compared. Results: The average Na/K ratio of the subjects was 1.5; the highest ratio was in the twenties. Daily sodium and potassium intakes were significantly high in the Na/K?1 group and the Na/K<1 group, respectively. Sodium intake from grains, meat, fish, and seasonings of the Na/K?1 group and potassium intake from potatoes, beans, nuts, and fruits of the Na/K<1 group were significantly higher than the counterpart groups. Food groups with the lowest Na/K (0.1) were fruits, cooked rice, and beans, and a Na/K ratio greater than 10.0 included seasonings and salted seafood. The Na/K<1 group consumed more fruits and potatoes and the Na/K?1 group consumed more grains, beverages, meats, and seasonings. Conclusions: Dietary Na/K ratio of Koreans was significantly higher than Korean or WHO guidelines. Recommendation of reducing sodium intake from grains, meats, and seasonings and increasing potassium intake from fruits, potatoes, and beans may be suggested for lowering the Na/K ratio. ?Mattioli 1885.",24-hour dietary recall; Food group; Na/k ratio; Potassium; Sodium,potassium; sodium; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; dietary pattern; female; fish; grain; human; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; meat; metabolic ratio; middle aged; nut; potassium intake; potato; rice; sodium intake,2-s2.0-85069469048

In this study, we reviewed the frequency and spectrum of cutaneous adverse events (AEs) caused by PD-1 antibodies and their possible correlation with treatment response. Methods: We reviewed records of all patients from a single institution treated with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab from August 1, 2014 to April 1, 2017. Results: Of 211 patients included in the study, 134 (63.5%) were treated with nivolumab and 77 (36.5%) with pembrolizumab. Thirty-five patients (16.4%) developed cutaneous AEs. Cutaneous AEs were significantly associated with longer treatment cycles (P = 0.001). The prevalence of cutaneous AEs did not differ between nivolumab (17.2%) and pembrolizumab (15.6%). Patient age, gender, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale and underlying malignancy were not associated with development of cutaneous AEs. Median time until onset of cutaneous AEs was 50.0 days (range, 1-378 days). Anti-PD-1 therapy was tolerable in most of patients with grade 1 (65.2%) and grade 2 (23.9%) cutaneous AEs. Pruritus (32.6%) and eczema (21.7%) were the most commonly reported cutaneous AEs. In lung cancer patients, cutaneous AEs were not associated with better treatment outcomes after adjusting for the number of treatment cycles. Conclusion: Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab exhibited tolerable cutaneous safety profiles in a variety of cancer patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy.

Methods: The medical records of 326 patients diagnosed with DLBCL were re trospectively analyzed. Both doctor’s progress records and nursing records were reviewed. IRR was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria. Results: IRR was not associated with overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) of DLBCL patients as compared to those who did not have IRR (OS: median 78.0 months vs. 69.0 months, p = 0.700; PFS: median 65.4 months vs. 64.0 months, p = 0.901).

Search sources were Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and PubMed. In addition, we assessed the quality of SR with the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). This review did not consider control groups and outcomes. Thirty-four SRs met a set of criteria. According to interventions, there were twenty SRs which included yoga, acupuncture, and herbal medicines. Meta-analysis of 19 out of 34 reviews showed the followings: (1) acupuncture had a beneficial effect on the frequency of hot flushes, (2) yoga had a beneficial effect on depression and health-related QOL, (3) mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) had a beneficial effect on anxiety and depression, (4) combination of herbal medicine and chemotherapy synergistically improved clinical outcomes, (5) acupuncture did not show significant effect on the severity of hot flushes and cancer-related pain, (6) yoga was unable to be confirmed as having an effect on cancer-related pain and physical well-being. Given the results of AMSTAR, 9 out of 34 reviews were of high quality and 3 reviews were deemed to be of low quality. In conclusion, since most SRs were at moderate or high quality levels, CAM could be helpful for treating specific symptoms related to breast cancer. ? 2019 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Breast cancer; Complementary and alternative medicine; Overview; Systematic review,"A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews; acupuncture; alternative medicine; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer therapy; depression; herbal medicine; human; meta analysis; mindfulness; mixed anxiety and depression; physical well-being; quality of life; Review; systematic review; yoga; anxiety; bibliographic database; breast tumor; female; palliative therapy; psychology; Acupuncture Therapy; Anxiety; Breast Neoplasms; Complementary Therapies; Databases, Bibliographic; Depression; Female; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Mindfulness; Palliative Care; Quality of Life; Yoga",2-s2.0-85069215099

Nevertheless, people still take part in outdoor physical activities, even on days when a fine dust risk alert is issued, which shows that people's awareness of the danger of fine dust to their health is still lacking. This study used 341 surveys that was conducted to analyze and compare people's motives for participation in physical activities in relation to the fine dust level. After an exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis using SPSS 23.0, the level of fine dust concentration in the atmosphere was divided into ""dangerous"" and ""normal,"" while the respondents to the survey were divided into a ""with fine dust group"" and a ""without fine dust group."" People's participation motives were compared and analyzed by using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). People who participated in outdoor physical activities on days with a severe fine dust concentration showed higher scores for the motives of Competition, Appearance, Physical Condition, and Mastery, while those who participate in outdoor physical activities on days without a find dust alert showed higher scores for the motive of Psychological Condition.

Induction of obesity and type 2 diabetes by both leptin deficiency (ob/ob) and high fat diet (HFD) has been verified in animal models. In the present experiment, three types of diets (normal diet; ND, HFD and high sucrose diet; HSD) and two types of genetic mice (Wild type: WT and ob/ob) were used to explore the relationship among diet supplements, gut microbiota, host genetics and metabolic status. HFD increased the body, fat and liver weight of both ob/ob and WT mice, but HSD did not. HFD also resulted in dyslipidemia, as well as increased serum transaminases and fasting glucose in ob/ob mice but not in WT mice, while HSD did not. Moreover, HFD led to brain BDNF elevation in WT mice and reduction in ob/ob mice, whereas HSD did not. Both HFD and HSD had a greater influence on gut microbiota than host genotypes. In detail, both of HFD and HSD alteration elucidated the majority (?63%) of the whole structural variation in gut microbiota, however, host genetic mutation accounted for the minority (?11%). Overall, diets more intensively disturbed the structure of gut microbiota in excess of genetic change, particularly under leptin deficient conditions. Different responses of host genotypes may contribute to the development of metabolic disorder phenotypes linked with gut microbiota alterations. ? 2019 Wang, Shin, Lim, Im, Song, Nam and Kim.",Gut microbiota; High fat diet; High sucrose diet; Overweight; Sequencing,aminotransferase blood level; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biochemical analysis; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; diet; dietary supplement; dyslipidemia; environmental factor; food intake; gene mutation; genetic analysis; glucose blood level; heredity; intestine flora; leptin deficiency; lipid diet; liver weight; male; metabolic disorder; metabolism; metagenomics; mouse; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; phylogeny; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85069048080

The legacy pen and paper-based affective state determination methods are limited in their scientific explanation of causes and effects. Therefore, due to advances in intelligence technology, researchers are trying to apply some advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods to realize individuals' affective states. To recognize, realize, and predict a human's affective state, domain experts have studied facial expressions, speeches, social posts, neuroimages, and physiological signals. However, with the advancement of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and wearable computing technology, on-body non-invasive medical sensor observations are an effective source for studying users' effects or emotions. Therefore, this paper proposes an IoMT-based emotion recognition system for affective state mining. Human psychophysiological observations are collected through electromyography (EMG), electro-dermal activity (EDA), and electrocardiogram (ECG) medical sensors and analyzed through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to determine the covert affective state. According to Russell's circumplex model of effects, the five basic emotional states, i.e., happy, relaxed, disgust, sad, and neutral, are considered for affective state mining. An experimental study is performed, and a benchmark dataset is used to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The higher classification accuracy of the primary affective states has justified the performance of the proposed method. ? 2013 IEEE.",Affective computing; convolutional neural network; emotion recognition; healthcare IoT; Internet of Medical Things,Benchmarking; Convolution; Electrocardiography; Health care; Internet of things; Neural networks; Speech recognition; Wearable sensors; Affective Computing; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Determination methods; Emotion recognition; Facial Expressions; Pervasive healthcare; Physiological signals; Deep neural networks,2-s2.0-85068330016

Objective: Very little is known about potential activity of fermented dried Citrus unshiu peel extracts (FCU) using Bacillus subtilis, as well as its mechanism of action. We investigated the effects of FCU on the anti-inflammatory activities in murine macrophages and moisturizing effects in human keratinocytes. Materials and methods: We isolated the Bacillus subtilis from Cheonggukjang and FCU using these Bacillus subtilis to prepare samples. The cells were pre-treated with various extracts for 2 h and then induced with LPS for 22 h. We determined the NO assay, TNF-α, IL-6 and PGE2 in RAW 264.7 ells. The expression of SPT and Filaggrin by FCU treatment was measured in HaCaT cells. Result: We found that two types of FCU highly suppressed LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) without exerting cytotoxic effects on RAW 264.7 cells (21.9 and 15.4% reduction). FCU inhibited the expression of LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 proteins and their mRNAs in a concentration-dependent manner. TNF-α (59 and 30.9% reduction), IL-6 (39.1 and 65.6% reduction), and PGE2 secretion (78.6 and 82.5% reduction) were suppressed by FCU in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, FCU can induce the production of hyaluronic acid (38 and 38.9% induction) and expression of Filaggrin and SPT in HaCaT keratinocyte cells. Discussion and conclusion: FCU potentially inhibits inflammation, improves skin moisturizing efficacy, and it may be a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of inflammation and dry skin. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

Technological advancements in DNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, and computational methods allow us to carry out multiomics analyses although such approaches are not routine yet. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are a widely used model system to study pathological and physiological processes associated with the cardiovascular system. In this study, next-generation sequencing and high-resolution mass spectrometry to profile the transcriptome and proteome of primary HUVECs is employed. Analysis of 145 million paired-end reads from next-generation sequencing confirmed expression of 12?186 protein-coding genes (FPKM ?0.1), 439 novel long non-coding RNAs, and revealed 6089 novel isoforms that were not annotated in GENCODE. Proteomics analysis identifies 6477 proteins including confirmation of N-termini for 1091 proteins, isoforms for 149 proteins, and 1034 phosphosites. A database search to specifically identify other post-translational modifications provide evidence for a number of modification sites on 117 proteins which include ubiquitylation, lysine acetylation, and mono-, di- and tri-methylation events. Evidence for 11 “missing proteins,” which are proteins for which there was insufficient or no protein level evidence, is provided. Peptides supporting missing protein and novel events are validated by comparison of MS/MS fragmentation patterns with synthetic peptides. Finally, 245 variant peptides derived from 207 expressed proteins in addition to alternate translational start sites for seven proteins and evidence for novel proteoforms for five proteins resulting from alternative splicing are identified. Overall, it is believed that the integrated approach employed in this study is widely applicable to study any primary cell type for deeper molecular characterization. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the roles of the gut microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of ginsenosides in humans have not yet been fully elucidated. Methods: Red ginseng (RG) or fermented red ginseng was orally administered to 34 healthy Korean volunteers, and the serum concentrations of the ginsenosides were determined using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, the fecal ginsenoside Rd– and compound K (CK)–forming activities were measured. Then, the correlations between the pharmacokinetic profiles of the ginsenosides and the fecal ginsenoside–metabolizing activities were investigated. Results: For the RG group, the area under the serum concentration–time curve values of ginsenosides Rd, F2, Rg3, and CK were 8.20 ± 11.95 ng·h/mL, 4.54 ± 3.70 ng·h/mL, 36.40 ± 19.68 ng·h/mL, and 40.30 ± 29.83 ng·h/mL, respectively. For the fermented red ginseng group, the the area under curve from zero to infinity (AUC∞) values of ginsenosides Rd, F2, Rg3, and CK were 187.90 ± 95.87 ng·h/mL, 30.24 ± 41.87 ng·h/mL, 28.68 ± 14.27 ng·h/mL, and 137.01 ± 96.16 ng·h/mL, respectively. The fecal CK-forming activities of the healthy volunteers were generally proportional to their ginsenoside Rd–forming activities. The area under the serum concentration–time curve value of CK exhibited an obvious positive correlation (r = 0.566, p &lt; 0.01) with the fecal CK-forming activity. Conclusion: The gut microbiota may play an important role in the bioavailability of the nonpolar RG ginsenosides by affecting the biotransformation of the ginsenosides. ? 2019",Gut microbiota; Pharmacokinetics; Protopanaxadiol ginsenosides; Red ginseng,,2-s2.0-85067951655

In birds, vocal activity at the individual and population level is generally closely associated with breeding cycles, reaching the peak during territorial and mating competition, and decreasing with the onset of egg incubation and chick feeding. However, little is known about patterns of vocal activity in avian brood parasites that have unusual breeding cycles without parental care. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we determined the seasonal and diurnal patterns of population vocal activity in two avian brood parasites: the Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus and the Lesser Cuckoo C. poliocephalus. We found that both species and both sexes showed a similarly highly structured pattern of seasonal vocal activity, reaching a sharp peak in the early breeding season when birds compete for territories and mates, although males sang more frequently than females. Likewise, the diurnal patterns of vocal activity were similar in both species and both sexes of cuckoos, with peak activity occurring around dawn. Nocturnal calls by male cuckoos were also detected in both species, but only in the early breeding season. Collectively, the observed patterns of population vocal activity may suggest that the absence of parental care may not extend the period of vocal activity in these two species of brood parasites. ? 2019 British Ornithologists’ Union",Common Cuckoo; Lesser Cuckoo; passive acoustic monitoring; song meter,,2-s2.0-85067854290

However, its unrevealed mechanism and complicated comorbidities have led to no specific medication, except for weight loss and lifestyle modification. Alisma orientale (Sam.) Juzep (A. orientale, Alismataceae) has been increasingly reported on therapeutic effects of A. orientale against NAFLD and metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Therefore, this study aimed to review the preclinical efficacy of A. orientale and its chemical constituents including Alisol A 24-acetate, Alisol B 23-acetate, Alisol F, and Alismol against NAFLD and metabolic syndrome. A. orientale prevented hepatic triglyceride accumulation through suppressing de novo lipogenesis and increasing lipid export. In addition, it controlled oxidative stress markers, lipoapoptosis, liver injury panels, and inflammatory and fibrotic mediators, eventually influencing steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Moreover, it exhibited pharmacological activities against hyperlipidemia, obesity, and hyperglycemia as well as appetite. These biological actions of A. orientale might contribute to adiponectin activation or a role as a farnesoid X receptor agonist. In particular, Alisol A 24-acetate and Alisol B 23-acetate could be expected as main compounds. Taken together, A. orientale might be an effective candidate agent for the treatment of NAFLD and its comorbidities, although further assessment of its standardization, safety test, and clinical trials is consistently required. ? 2019 Eunsol Choi et al.",,acetic acid; agents affecting metabolism; alismol; alisol B 23 acetate; alisol f; farnesoid X receptor; herbaceous agent; liver protective agent; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; Alisma; Alisma orientale; antidiabetic activity; antifibrotic activity; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; chemical composition; drug activity; drug effect; human; hyperglycemia; hyperlipidemia; hypolipidemic activity; lipid storage; lipoapoptosis; lipogenesis; liver fibrosis; liver protection; metabolic syndrome X; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; Review,2-s2.0-85067831811

Methods: Healthy, non-diabetic young (n=10) and elderly (n=13) male subjects with normal body mass index were eligible for this study. Subjects who passed the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with high-dose (80 mU/m2·min) insulin infusion. Results: M-values were normalized to body weight (MBW) and fat-free mass (MFFM). Neither M-value was significantly different between age groups (P=0.458 and P=0.900, respectively). An inverse correlation was observed between MFFM and baseline insulin (r=?0.418; P=0.047), baseline C-peptide (r=?0.426; P=0.043) and OGTT 2-hour glucose (r=?0.452; P=0.030).

Frequent fruit consumers (? 4 servings/day) had a lower risk of incident MetS than did rare consumers (< 1 serving/day) in both men and women (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.55, 95% CI 0.44–0.67, p < 0.0001 for men; HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.47–0.70, p for trend < 0.0001 for women) after adjusting for confounders. Frequent fruit consumption was inversely associated with incidence of abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and elevated blood pressure. Frequent vegetable consumption was inversely associated with a risk of hyperglycemia only in men (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.44–0.96, p for trend = 0.0275), but no association was observed with risk of incident MetS. Conclusions: High fruit consumption was associated with a reduced risk of incident MetS and its components, whereas high vegetable consumption was associated with a reduced risk of incident hyperglycemia, but not with MetS in middle-aged and older adults. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Fruit; Korea Genome and Epidemiology Study; Metabolic syndrome; Prospective study; Vegetable,,2-s2.0-85067312041

Among recent advancements in flexible and stretchable electronics, epidermal electronic devices have shown major breakthroughs in wearable device research fields. Epidermal systems, such as tattoo- and patch-type stretchable systems, have conformity to the human skin, which can be deformed with the skin without detachment for fracture. In this paper, the implementation of a six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) on a stretchable platform for applications in wearable electronics is presented. The proposed device is implemented using circuit elements on a patchlike substrate to collect accurate data from the human body. To achieve flexible and stretchable characteristics of the device, a serpentine interconnection is adopted between the circuit elements. Instead of a microfabrication process, a low-cost, dry, and freeform “cut-and-paste” method that uses a thin metal sheet and a cutting tool to fabricate complex serpentine interconnections is used to fabricate the substrate. The performance characteristics of the IMU using the proposed method are demonstrated for future application in highly accurate biosensors. ?

In this randomized clinical trial, we aimed to compare the two methods of ADT in terms of quality of life (QOL). Methods: Eighty patients who underwent primary ADT for newly diagnosed prostate cancer were randomly assigned to CAB group (Group 1) and LHRH agonist monotherapy group (Group 2). Leuprolide and anti-androgen (bicalutamide 50?mg) were used to minimize the confounding effects caused by medication. QOL was evaluated at baseline, 3?months and 6?months post-ADT using validated EORTC QLQ-C30, PR25, and depression questionnaires. A difference of > 10 points in the EORTC domain scores was defined as ‘clinically significant’. Results: In the baseline characteristics, there was no significant difference between the two groups. At 3?months after ADT, Group 1 had significantly lower pain scores than Group 2 (p = 0.004), while Group 1 had significantly poorer diarrhea symptom score than Group 2, without clinical significance (p = 0.047). No significant differences were observed in the C30, PR25 domains, and the depression score at 3?months. At 6?months, the QOL scores of all the groups were similar. Conclusions: There was no difference in the patient’s QOL, except that CAB group was associated with significantly better pain relief than LHRH agonist monotherapy at 3?months following ADT, which was not sustained thereafter. Our results suggest that the benefit of prolonged (? 3?months) CAB is questionable in terms of patients’ QOL. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Androgen deprivation therapy; Combined androgen blockade; Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist; Prostate cancer; Quality of life,,2-s2.0-85066996780

To address these unmet healthcare challenges, monitoring and Activity Recognition (AR) are considered as a subtask in pervasive computing and context-aware systems. Innumerable interdisciplinary applications exist, underpinning the obtrusive sensory data using the revolutionary digital technologies for the acquisition, transformation, and fusion of recognized activities. However, little importance is given by the research community to make the use of non-wearables i.e. unobtrusive sensing technologies. The physical state of human pervasively in daily living for AR can be seamlessly presented by acquiring health-related information by using unobtrusive sensing technologies to enable long-term health monitoring without violating an individual’s privacy. This paper aims to propose and provide supervised recognition of Activities of Daily Livings (ADLs) by observing unobtrusive sensor events using statistical reasoning. Furthermore, it also investigates their semantic correlations by defining semantic constraints with the support of ontological reasoning. Extensive experiments were performed with real-world dataset shared by the University of Ja?n Ambient Intelligence (UJAmI) Smart Lab in order to recognize the human activities in the smart environment. The evaluations show that the accuracy of the supervised method (87%) is comparable to the one, state of the art semantic approach (91%). ?

This study investigated the effect of electro acupuncture at different frequencies and intensities via electroencephalography. Bilateral ST36 (zusanli) of 15 healthy participant volunteers were stimulated via two different modes of electroacupuncture: 2Hz (low frequency) with a highintensity mode (5-6mA), and 120Hz (high frequency) with a low-intensity (2-2.5mA) mode. Eight-channel EEG were recorded before and during the electro acupuncture stimulation. After eliminating artifacts from raw EEG data, power spectrum analysis was done according to frequency bands: theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-30Hz), and gamma (30-50Hz) bands. With electroacupuncture stimulation, the absolute theta power was decreased compared with baseline in the overall region (P<0.05 in all channel with some minor exceptions). Moreover, high frequency electroacupuncture stimulation increased the absolute alpha power in the posterior region (P=0.047 in left; P=0.125 in right). Further, high frequency electroacupuncture stimulation decreased the absolute beta power in prefrontal region (P=0.006 in left; P=0.006 in right), and decreased the absolute gamma power in posterior region (P=0.035 in right). It is likely that electroacupuncture at ST36 affects brain waves differently depending on stimulation frequency.

To identify commonalities in gene expression data across all antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) tissues thus far characterized. Methods. Gene expression data were collected from the 3 AAV tissues thus far characterized (orbit, peripheral leukocytes, and sinus brushings). These data were analyzed to identify commonly expressed genes and disease pathways. The pathways data were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a combined local false discovery rate, which estimates the probability of a false discovery of a given pathway in all 3 tissues analyzed. Results. Only 4 genes were upregulated in all 3 tissues - IL1RN, TLR2, SLC11A1, and MMP9. After multiple comparison adjustments, the network pathway analysis revealed 28 pathways associated with all 3 tissues. The most strongly associated pathway for all 3 tissues was the neutrophil degranulation pathway [multidimensional local false discovery (md-locfdr) = 1.05 × 10-12], followed by the osteoclast differentiation (md-locfdr = 3.8 × 10-05), cell surface interactions at the vascular wall (md-locfdr = 4.2 × 10-04), signaling by interleukins (md-locfdr = 6.1 × 10-04), and phagosome (md-locfdr = 0.003) pathways. There were no downregulated genes or pathways common to all 3 tissues. Conclusion. This analysis identified individual genes and pathways of disease common to all AAV tissues thus far characterized. The use of a network pathway analysis allowed us to identify pathologic mechanisms that were not readily apparent in the commonly expressed genes alone. Many of these pathways are consistent with current theories about infectious drivers and the crossroads of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. In addition, this analysis highlights novel pathways, such as vessel wall interactions and platelet activation, which require further investigation. ? 2019 Journal of Rheumatology.

Here, we present the effect of linoleic acid (LA), a constituent of Allium hookeri (AH), to alleviate mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation. Pretreatment of LA and AH significantly reduced caspase-1 activation without displaying host cell cytotoxicity in activated human mast cells. IC50 value of LA on caspase-1 activity is 0.014?μM. LA and AH pretreatment effectively regulated increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and tumor necrosis factor on activated human mast cells. Moreover, LA and AH were effective against activations of nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases in human mast cells. In summary, LA and AH alleviate allergic inflammatory reactions via blocking caspase-1 cascade signaling pathway. These results provide evidence for the anti-allergic inflammatory properties of LA and AH and corroborate its potential use for the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases.

Although various conventional treatments for AD exist, patients with AD often seek complementary and alternative therapies when conventional therapy has failed to relieve their AD symptoms or has had adverse effects. Acupuncture treatment may relieve AD symptoms, but controlled trials are needed to confirm this. Following our pilot study, which found that acupuncture treatment improves AD symptoms in mild-to-moderate AD patients, we will assess the effect of acupuncture treatment for symptom relief of AD using a trial with a complemented protocol. This is a two-arm, randomized, participant- and assessor-blinded, sham-controlled trial. A total of 36 mild-to-moderate AD patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive eight sessions twice weekly of either verum acupuncture (VA) or nonpenetrating sham acupuncture (SA) over four weeks. The primary outcome measured will be the change in the total Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score. Secondary outcomes will be (1) changes in AD symptoms, QoL, dyspepsia symptoms, and electroencephalography (EEG) between baseline and week 4 and (2) changes in AD symptoms and QoL at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, and 8.

Here, we elucidated efficacy of TJ001, a traditional herbal decoction, in inhibiting de novo lipogenesis. TJ001 had significant cytotoxicity against DU145 but not PC3 and LNCaP cells and, similarly, TJ001 markedly AMPK phosphorylation only in DU145 cells. This was accompanied by the downregulation of phosphorylated-acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) proteolytic cleavage, thereby inhibiting its role as a transcription factor to induce lipid biosynthesis. When Oil Red O staining was performed, it is reflected in the reduction of lipid droplets (LDs). TJ001 also induced G1/S cell cycle arrest via a cell cycle inhibitor (CKI) p21WAF1/CIP1 upregulation. Although p53 proteins remained unchanged, both cyclin E and cyclin D1 were decreased. Moreover, TJ001 suppressed the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Generally, the prolonged G1/S phase arrest accompanies apoptosis, but TJ001 failed to work as a trigger apoptosis in DU145 cells. We showed that mutant p53 proteins were required for the survival of DU145 cells. In presence of TJ001, inhibition of endogenous mutant p53 by RNAi led to cell viability reduction and induction of the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio. In addition, it induced apoptotic cell death in DU145 cells. At the cellular level, induction of PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-9 cleavages was observed, and caspase-3 activity was increased in the p53 knockdown cells treated with TJ001. Taken together, we demonstrated that TJ001 inhibited cell growth in DU145 prostate cancer cells as indicated by blocking lipogenesis and induction in G1/S cell cycle arrest. In addition, we may provide an evidence that mutant p53 protein has potential role as an oncogenic action in DU145 cells. Collectively, the combination of mutant p53 targeting and TJ001 treatment resulted in decreased cell growth in DU145 cells. ? 2019 Sooyeon Kang et al.",,adenylate kinase; antineoplastic agent; Chinese drug; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1; cyclin E; mammalian target of rapamycin; protein p53; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; taeeumjowi tang; unclassified drug; Article; cancer inhibition; cell viability; drug cytotoxicity; DU145 cell line; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; lipogenesis; prostate cancer; RNA interference; staining; upregulation,2-s2.0-85066026816

In this study, we explored the effect of β-Lapachone (βL), a compound obtained from the bark of the lapacho tree, against obesity. In vivo administration of βL into either high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL6 mice and genetically obese Lepr- mice prevented body weight gain, which was associated with tissue weight loss of white adipose tissue (WAT). In addition, βL elevated thermogenic proteins including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and mitochondrial count in BAT and human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). βL also induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, subsequent upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and UCP1, and these effects were diminished by AMPK inhibitor compound C, suggesting that AMPK underlies the effects of βL. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways participated in the thermogenesis of βL, specifically p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were activated by βL treatment in hAMSCs. Additionally, inhibitors of p38/JNK/ERK1/2 abrogated the activity of βL. Taken together, βL exerts anti-obese effects by inducing thermogenesis mediated by AMPK signaling pathway, suggesting that βL may have a potential therapeutic implication of obesity. Taken together, βL exerts anti-obese effects by not only inducing thermogenesis on brown adipocytes but also inducing the browning of white adipocytes. The anti-obese effect of βL is mediated by AMPK signaling pathway, suggesting that βL may have potential therapeutic implication of obesity. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Brown Adipocyte Differentiation; Brown Adipose Tissue; Human Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Thermogenesis; β -Lapachone,"acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; beta lapachone; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; stress activated protein kinase; synaptophysin; uncoupling protein 1; antiobesity agent; beta-lapachone; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; naphthoquinone; Ucp1 protein, mouse; uncoupling protein 1; adipose tissue cell; AMPK signaling; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiobesity activity; Article; bark; body weight gain; body weight loss; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cell; in vivo study; lipid diet; male; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; nonhuman; nonshivering thermogenesis; obesity; upregulation; white adipocyte; white adipose tissue; adipocyte; adverse event; animal; brown adipose tissue; C57BL mouse; cell culture; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; mitochondrion; obesity; pathology; phosphorylation; physiology; phytotherapy; signal transduction; Tabebuia; thermogenesis; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue, Brown; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Cells, Cultured; Diet, High-Fat; Humans; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria; Naphthoquinones; Obesity; Phosphorylation; Phytotherapy; Signal Transduction; Tabebuia; Thermogenesis; Uncoupling Protein 1; Weight Gain",2-s2.0-85065844326

As a result, the contribution of specific HLA alleles and amino-acid residues to the overall risk of SLE and to risk of specific autoantibodies are far from completely understood. Here, we dissected (a) overall SLE association signals across HLA, (b) HLA-peptide interaction, and (c) residue-autoantibody association. Classical alleles, SNPs, and amino-acid residues of eight HLA genes were imputed across 4,915 SLE cases and 13,513 controls from Eastern Asia. We performed association followed by conditional analysis across HLA, assessing both overall SLE risk and risk of autoantibody production. DR15 alleles HLADRB1*15:01 (P = 1.4x10-27, odds ratio (OR) = 1.57) and HLA-DQB1*06:02 (P = 7.4x10-23, OR = 1.55) formed the most significant haplotype (OR = 2.33). Conditioned protein-residue signals were stronger than allele signals and mapped predominantly to HLA-DRB1 residue 13 (P = 2.2x10-75) and its proxy position 11 (P = 1.1x10-67), followed by HLA-DRB1-37 (P = 4.5x10-24). After conditioning on HLA-DRB1, novel associations at HLA-A-70 (P = 1.4x10-8), HLA-DPB1-35 (P = 9.0x10-16), HLA-DQB1-37 (P = 2.7x10-14), and HLA-B-9 (P = 6.5x10-15) emerged. Together, these seven residues increased the proportion of explained heritability due to HLA to 2.6%. Risk residues for both overall disease and hallmark autoantibodies (i.e., nRNP: DRB1-11, P = 2.0x10-14; DRB1-13, P = 2.9x10-13; DRB1-30, P = 3.9x10-14) localized to the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRB1. Enrichment for specific amino-acid characteristics in the peptide-binding groove correlated with overall SLE risk and with autoantibody presence. Risk residues were in primarily negatively charged side-chains, in contrast with rheumatoid arthritis. We identified novel SLE signals in HLA Class I loci (HLA-A, HLA-B), and localized primary Class II signals to five residues in HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, and HLADQB1. These findings provide insights about the mechanisms by which the risk residues interact with each other to produce autoantibodies and are involved in SLE pathophysiology. ? 2019 Molineros et al.

Bioavailable 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) has been suggested for the accurate determination of vitamin D status. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of bioavailable 25(OH)D in assessing vitamin D status when vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) was significantly altered by pregnancy and liver cirrhosis (LC). The role of genotyping of GC, a gene encoding VDBP, in the determination of bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration in a Korean population was also evaluated. Methods. This prospective study enrolled a total of 136 subjects (53 healthy controls, 45 patients with LC, and 38 pregnant women) from 2017 to 2018. The concentrations of total 25(OH)D and VDBP were measured, and bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations were calculated. GC genotyping was performed to determine rs4588 and rs7041 polymorphisms. Clinical and laboratory data were compared among the three groups of subjects. Results. Median VDBP and total 25(OH)D concentrations were 165.2 μg/ml and 18.5 ng/ml in healthy controls, 76.9 μg/ml and 10.5 ng/ml in patients with LC, and 368.9 μg/ml and 17.7 ng/ml in pregnant women, respectively. Compared with controls, patients diagnosed with LC had significantly lower VDBP and total 25(OH)D concentrations (all P < 0 001) while pregnant women had significantly higher VDBP concentrations (P < 0 001). Although total 25(OH)D concentrations in pregnant women were similar to those in controls (P = 0 394), their bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower (1.2 vs. 3.0 ng/ml; P < 0 001). Among all the three groups combined, the genotype-specific bioavailable 25(OH)D and the genotype-independent bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations did not differ significantly (P = 0 299). Conclusions. Our study has demonstrated that bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration reflects vitamin D status more accurately than the total 25(OH)D concentration, especially in pregnant women. In addition, GC genotyping did not significantly affect bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration. Therefore, if VDBP concentration is significantly altered, the measurement of bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration might facilitate the accurate determination of vitamin D status. However, GC genotyping might be unnecessary. ? 2019 Hyun-Young Kim et al.

This study investigated the ability of the ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio to predict survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: The medical records of patients with pathologically confirmed advanced NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. The ferritin level, hemoglobin level, and ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio at the initiation of treatment were investigated. After descriptive analysis of the ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio, the optimal diagnostic cutoff value for survival was determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. After dichotomizing patients according to the optimal cutoff value, the prognostic effect of the ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio was assessed. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the prognostic effect with respect to survival. Results: Of the enrolled patients, 91.3% had stage IV NSCLC, 42.0% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-PS) score of 2, and 56.5% previously underwent systemic chemotherapy. The median OS of enrolled patients was 11.5 months. The range of the ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio was 0.6-294.2, and the optimal cutoff value of the ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio for survival was 13.0 (sensitivity, 58.5%; specificity, 80.0%; area under the curve = 0.68; P = 0.004). The median OS of patients with a low ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio (<13.0) was 19.7 months, whereas that of patients with a high ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio (?13.0) was 8.5 months (P < 0.001). After eliminating confounding factors such as age, sex, ECOG-PS, histologic type, and C-reactive protein level, a high ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio was significantly associated with poor survival. The multivariate proportional hazards model revealed that the ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio was an independent prognostic marker for survival (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.88; P = 0.002). Conclusion: The ferritin-to-hemoglobin ratio, a potential parameter of tumor progression, was a significant prognostic factor for OS, with a direct correlation to survival time in patients with advanced NSCLC. ?

The aim of this retrospective study was to review the clinical characteristics, outcomes and factors associated with success in adult patients who underwent flexible or rigid bronchoscopy for airway FB removal. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 103 patients who underwent bronchoscopy to remove airway FB at Samsung Medical Center, South Korea from January 1999 to March 2017. Results: The median patient age was 64 years, and 70% were males. Among the 54 patients who underwent flexible bronchoscopy as first-line treatment, 43 (80%) patients had their FB successfully removed. Previous attempts at other hospitals was significantly associated with failed flexible bronchoscopy [9/11 (82%) vs. 3/43 (7%), P<0.001]. Delayed diagnosis (median 29 vs. 5 days, P=0.074) and peripherally located airway FB [9/12 (75%) vs. 23/48 (48%), P=0.115] were factors that trended towards flexible bronchoscopy failure. All of the 59 patients who underwent rigid bronchoscopy had their FB successfully removed. Rigid bronchoscopy was preferred to flexible bronchoscopy in patients with no comorbidities [38/59 (64%) vs. 18/44 (41%), P=0.018], previous attempts at other hospitals [34/59 (58%) vs. 4/44 (9%), P<0.001], delayed diagnosis (median 162 vs. 5 days, P<0.001), and hard FBs [48/62 (77%) vs. 21/49 (43%), P<0.001]. Conclusions: Our data suggest that previous failed attempts and delayed diagnosis are associated with flexible bronchoscopy failure. However, rigid bronchoscopy could be effective in removing an airway FB even in these cases. Further studies to identify factors to facilitate optimal patient selection will minimize failure rates and optimize resource utilization. ? Journal of Thoracic Disease.

However, current analyses of multiple, disease-contributing factors, and their combined interactions, remains quite difficult, using traditional approaches. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) shows what shape a data set can have, facilitating clustering analysis, by determining which components are close to each other. Thus, TDA can generate a network, using Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data, revealing the genetic relatedness of specific individuals, and can derive multiple ordered sub-groups, from one with a low patient concentration, to one with a high patient concentration. Since it is widely accepted that T2D pathogenesis is affected by multiple genetic factors, we performed TDA on T2D data from the Korea Association REsource (KARE) project, a population-based, genome-wide association study of the Korean adult population. Since KARE data contains follow-up information about the incidence of T2D, we compared the T2D status of each individual, at baseline, with that of ten years later. For the TDA network-driven sub-groups, ordered by prevalence, we compared the T2D incidence rate, after ten years, for individuals initially without T2D. As a result, we found that the TDA network-driven, ordered subgroups had significantly increased incidence rates, linearly correlated with prevalence (p-value = 0.006914). Our results demonstrate the usefulness of TDA in both identifying genetic contributors (e.g., SNPs), and their interrelationships, in the pathology of complex diseases. ?

Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 42 patients treated with HA-WBRT for brain metastases. A total of 25 Gy for whole brain and 35-55 Gy for gross tumors were delivered with 10 fractionations. Local tumor and intracranial progression were defined as a recurrence or tumor progression in SIB field and any recurrence or tumor progression within whole brain, respectively. Progression in HA zone was defined as the recurrence within the area expanded 5 mm from HA zone. Results Median follow-up duration was 10.0 months (range, 4.1 to 56.4 months). Intracranial progression was observed in 13 patients (31.0%) and the median duration from the start of HA-WBRT to progression was 10.6 months (range, 0.9 to 33.0 months). Local tumor progression and new metastasis outside SIB field occurred in 10 patients (23.8%) and nine patients (21.4%), respectively. There was no isolated hippocampal metastasis, except only one patient (2.4%) with multiple metastases inside and outside HA zone simultaneously. Median survival time and intracranial progression-free survival rate at 1 year were 19.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6 to 29.2) and 71.5%, respectively, and those for overall survival were 26.5 months (95% CI, 15.4 to 37.5) and 67.9%, respectively. Conclusion HA-WBRT was associated with low risk of new metastasis in HA region in the patients with brain metastases. These findings would serve as useful guidance on applying HA-WBRT in clinical practice.

CGA was more effective in suppressing weight gain than 3,5-diCQA. In contrast, 3,5-diCQA was more effective in improving glucose tolerance than CGA. In the biopsy, it was confirmed that CGA inhibited visceral fat and liver fat accumulation. 3,5-diCQA also inhibited visceral fat accumulation, but 3,5-diCQA increased liver fat accumulation. The liver fat accumulation induced oxidative stress, but 3,5-diCQA reduced oxidative damage through its antioxidant activity. The increased liver fat accumulation was because a 3,5-diCQA greatly increased Akt phosphorylation and decreased AMPK phosphorylation in the liver. Consequently, CGA was effective in alleviating the problems caused by high-fat diets, while maintaining normal balance. 3,5-diCQA also showed a positive effect on problems caused by high-fat diets, but it increased liver fat accumulation and thereby had negative consequences. ?The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology.","3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid; Chlorogenic acid; Obesity; P-Akt; P-AMPK",,2-s2.0-85064462634

The present study explored the relationship between serum levels of periostin and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in asthmatic children. Methods: The study population consisted of 86 children 6–15 years old divided into an asthmatic group (n = 56) and healthy controls (n = 30). We measured the levels of periostin in serum and performed pulmonary function tests including baseline measurements, post-bronchodilator inhalation tests, exercise bronchial provocation tests (BPTs), and mannitol BPTs. Results: The 56 asthmatic children were divided into four groups: asthmatics with positive exercise BPT and positive mannitol BPT (n = 30), asthmatics with positive exercise BPT but negative mannitol BPT (n = 7), asthmatics with negative exercise BPT but positive mannitol BPT (n = 10), and asthmatics with negative exercise BPT and negative mannitol BPT (n = 9). Serum levels of periostin in asthmatic children with both positive exercise and mannitol BPT were significantly greater than those in asthmatic children with both negative exercise and mannitol BPT (95.0 [75.0–104.0] vs. 79.0 [68.0–82.5] ng/mL, P = 0.008) and controls (74.0 [69.75–80.0] ng/mL, P &lt; 0.001).

Specifically, the subtlety of cortical atrophy in some frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients and overlapping patterns of atrophy among three FTD clinical syndromes including behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and semantic variant PPA (svPPA) give rise to the need for classification models at the individual level. In this study, we aimed to classify each individual subject into one of the diagnostic categories in a hierarchical manner by employing a machine learning-based classification method. Methods: We recruited 143 patients with FTD, 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and 146 cognitively normal subjects. All subjects underwent a three-dimensional volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and cortical thickness was measured using FreeSurfer. We applied the Laplace Beltrami operator to reduce noise in the cortical thickness data and to reduce the dimension of the feature vector. Classifiers were constructed by applying both principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to the cortical thickness data. For the hierarchical classification, we trained four classifiers using different pairs of groups: Step 1 - CN vs. FTD + AD, Step 2 - FTD vs. AD, Step 3 - bvFTD vs. PPA, Step 4 - svPPA vs. nfvPPA. To evaluate the classification performance for each step, we used a10-fold cross-validation approach, performed 1000 times for reliability. Results: The classification accuracy of the entire hierarchical classification tree was 75.8%, which was higher than that of the non-hierarchical classifier (73.0%). The classification accuracies of steps 1–4 were 86.1%, 90.8%, 86.9%, and 92.1%, respectively. Changes in the right frontotemporal area were critical for discriminating behavioral variant FTD from PPA. The left frontal lobe discriminated nfvPPA from svPPA, while the bilateral anterior temporal regions were critical for identifying svPPA. Conclusions: In the present study, our automated classifier successfully classified FTD clinical subtypes with good to excellent accuracy. Our classifier may help clinicians diagnose FTD subtypes with subtle cortical atrophy and facilitate appropriate specific interventions. ? 2019",Classification model; Frontotemporal dementia; Machine learning,florbetaben; flutemetamol f 18; adult; aged; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain cortex atrophy; clinical assessment; controlled study; corpus striatum; cortical thickness (brain); dementia; diagnostic accuracy; discriminant analysis; disease classification; female; frontal lobe; frontal variant frontotemporal dementia; frontotemporal dementia; functional neuroimaging; human; image analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; posterior cingulate; precuneus; primary progressive aphasia; principal component analysis; priority journal; temporal lobe,2-s2.0-85064073581

We aimed to evaluate the associations between FSTL1, the presence of MU state and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated FSTL1 levels and their relationship with the presence of MU state and coronary artery plaques in 230 Korean patients. Significant increase in FSTL1 levels was observed in subjects with MU state (p = 0.020), but not those with obesity state according to body mass index criteria (p = 0.790). After adjusting for confounders, the odd ratio (OR) for the MU state among patients in the highest FSTL1 tertile (T3) was higher in comparison with the lowest tertile (T1) (OR = 3.60, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.20-10.83). In a subgroup (n = 66), FSTL1 levels were also marginally higher in patients with plaques (p = 0.098). The OR for plaque presence in patients with T3 was significantly higher in comparison with T1 after adjusting for confounders (OR = 12.51, 95% CI = 1.15-135.73).

Acute exposure to crotonaldehyde decreased cell viability and induced autophagy followed by cell death. In addition, inhibiting the autophagic flux markedly promoted the viability of endothelial cells exposed to high concentrations of crotonaldehyde. Crotonaldehyde activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and pretreatment with inhibitors specific to these kinases showed autophagy inhibition and partial improvement in cell viability.

This study was to investigate an association of incident MetS with levels of HbA1c and fasting glucose. Methods: In a cohort of Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, 5515 non-diabetic adults were grouped by the levels of baseline fasting glucose and HbA1c, and followed-up for 10?years. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards assumption, hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for incident MetS (adjusted HRs [95% CI]) were calculated according to baseline fasting glucose and HbA1c. In individuals with normal fasting glucose, subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate an association of HbA1c levels with MetS. Results: The risk for MetS significantly increased proportionally to fasting glucose ? 80?mg/dL and HbA1c ? 5.5%, compared with fating glucose < 80?mg/dL and HbA1c < 5.3%, respectively. In subgroups of normal fasting glucose, HbA1c ? 5.7% had the increased risk of MetS in fasting glucose < 80?mg/dL (5.7–5.9%: 1.41 [1.07–1.86] and 6.0–6.4%: 2.20 [1.40–2.92]), and HbA1c ? 5.5% had the increased risk of MetS in fasting glucose of 80–99?mg/dL (5.5–5.6%: 1.33 [1.08–1.64], 5.7–5.9%: 1.57 (1.27–1.93), and 6.0–6.4%: 2.37 [1.87–3.00]). Conclusions: Both elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c were significantly associated with the increased risk of MetS even within normal range. HbA1c is effective in identifying high-risk group for MetS in individuals with normal fasting glucose. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.",Fasting glucose; Glycated hemoglobin; Metabolic syndrome,glycosylated hemoglobin; adult; analysis; blood; cohort analysis; diet restriction; female; glucose blood level; human; male; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; proportional hazards model; risk factor; South Korea; Adult; Blood Glucose; Cohort Studies; Fasting; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85063165414

Participants and methods: A total of 230 CN elderly individuals underwent comprehensive clinical assessments including the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire (SMCQ), VR assessment, and multimodal brain imaging including [ 11 C] Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET), [ 18 F] fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging. Results: We found a significant overall positive association between cerebral Aβ retention and SMCQ score. In addition, we found a significant cerebral Aβ retention × VR interaction effect on the SMCQ score. Subgroup analyses showed that the Aβ-SMC association was found only in VR-negative, and not in VR-positive, individuals. We found no relationship between ND and SMCQ. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that SMC in CN elderly individuals reflects early accumulation of Aβ in the brain. Given the modulating effect of VR on the Aβ-SMC relationship, SMC can be used as a meaningful marker of early Aβ deposition in individuals without VR. ? 2019 Kim et al.",Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta; Cognitively normal; Subjective memory complaints; Vascular risk,amyloid beta protein; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; Pittsburgh compound B; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; cerebral amyloid deposition; cerebrovascular disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; human; image analysis; major clinical study; male; memory disorder; nerve degeneration; neurologic disease assessment; neuropathology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; prospective study; risk; risk assessment; Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire; vascular risk,2-s2.0-85062965118

As a result, the risk of MetS incidence was significantly increased only at ?12 years of age at menarche (OR = 1.91, P<0.05).

Paeonia extract mixture HT074 is a standardized multiherbal mixture comprising extracts from Inula britannica flowers and Paeonia lactiflora roots, which are used to treat digestive disorders in traditional Korean medicine. This study was focused on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the gastroprotective effects of HT074 in different gastric ulcer models. Methods. Gastric lesions were induced in rats by an HCl/EtOH solution, water immersion-restraint stress (WIRS), and indomethacin. Gastric secretions were studied in pylorus-ligated rats, while mucus secretions were assessed by measuring alcian blue-binding capacity of mucus in the rat model of HCl/EtOH-induced gastric ulcer. Additionally, the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) and sulfhydryl compounds in HT074-mediated mucosal protection was elucidated using their inhibitors, i.e., NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), respectively. Furthermore, the effects on indomethacin-induced cell death and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels were assessed in AGS cells. Results. Oral administration of HT074 significantly decreased gastric lesions induced by HCl/EtOH, WIRS, and indomethacin. Furthermore, it significantly decreased the volume, acidity, and total acidity of gastric juice in pylorus-ligated rats and increased the alcian blue-stained gastric mucus in HCl/EtOH-induced gastric ulcer in rats. Pretreatment with NEM abolished the gastroprotective effects of HT074, while L-NAME did not. In AGS cells, HT074 significantly reduced indomethacin-induced cell death and increased the PGE2 levels. Conclusions. These findings suggest that HT074 has gastroprotective effects against various ulcerogens, including HCl/EtOH, immersion stress, and NSAIDs. These effects are attributed to the inhibition of gastric secretions and preservation of the gastric mucosal barrier by increased mucus production, which is partially mediated through endogenous sulfhydryl compounds and PGE2. Based on these findings, we propose that HT074 may be a promising therapeutic agent for gastritis and gastric ulcer. ? 2019 Young-Sik Kim et al.",,antiulcer agent; carbenoxolone; gastrointestinal mucosa protective agent; ht 047; ht 074; nitric oxide; omeprazole; Paeonia extract; prostaglandin E2; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiulcer activity; Article; cell death; cell viability; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug dose comparison; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; experimental gastric ulcer; gastroprotection; glandular stomach; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; immobilization stress; male; mucus secretion; nonhuman; prophylaxis; protection; rat; stomach mucus; stomach pH; stomach secretion; water immersion,2-s2.0-85062611435

For the 3D segmented EPI sequence, the MTRasym values significantly differed among the three fitting methods at 0.86, 2.14, 3.00, and 3.43 ppm offset frequencies. For the 3D GRASE sequence, the MTRasym values obtained by 14th polynomial and spline fitting methods significantly differed at arbitrary offset frequencies.

To date, however, the in vivo-like vessel system has not been fully realized due to the difficulty of co-cultivation of the cells with orthogonal alignment. In this study, we report the utilization of microfabrication technology to construct biomimetic 3D co-cultured vasculature. First, microwrinkle patterns whose direction was perpendicular to the axis of a circular microfluidic channel were fabricated, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were cultured inside the microchannel, leading to an in vivo-like circumferential VSMC layer. Then, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were co-cultured on the circumferentially aligned VSMC, and the success of double layer formation of HUVEC-VSMC in the circular microchannel could be monitored. After HUVEC cultivation, we applied shear flow in order to induce the orientation of HUVEC parallel to the axis, and the analysis of orientation angle and spreading area of HUVECs indicated that they were changed by shear stress to be aligned to the direction of flow. Thus, the HUVEC and VSMC layer could be aligned with a distinct direction. The expression level of VE-Cadherin located at the boundary of HUVECs implies in vivo-like vascular behavior. The proposed in vitro microfluidic vascular assay platform would be valuable for studying vascular diseases with high reliability due to in vivo-likeness. ? 2019 Author(s).",,Advanced Analytics; Biomimetic processes; Blood vessels; Cytology; Microchannels; Microfluidics; Muscle; Shear flow; Shear stress; Circular microchannel; Double layer formation; Human umbilical vein endothelial cells; Micro-fabrication technology; Microwrinkle patterns; Orthogonal alignment; Threedimensional (3-d); Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells; Endothelial cells,2-s2.0-85062217643

In addition, pLTA increases the survival rate of mice in a septic shock model. In the current study, we have found that pLTA contributes to homeostasis through regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production. In detail, pLTA decreased the production of IL-10 by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 cells stimulated with prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) and LPS. However, TNF-α production which was inhibited by PGE-2+LPS increased by pLTA treatment. The regulatory effects of IL-10 and TNF-α induced by PGE-2 and LPS in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were mediated by pLTA, but not by other LTAs isolated from either Staphylococcus aureus (aLTA) or L. sakei (sLTA). Further studies revealed that pLTA-mediated IL-10 inhibition and TNF-α induction in PGE-2+LPS-stimulated PMAdifferentiated THP-1 cells were mediated by dephosphorylation of p38 and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), respectively. Reduction of pLTA-mediated IL-10 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), which was induced by IL-10 or conditioned media prepared from PGE-2+LPS-stimulated PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that pLTA contributes to inflammatory homeostasis through induction of repressed pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as inhibition of excessive antiinflammatory cytokines. ? 2019 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.",Anti-inflammation; Homeostasis; Interleukin-10; Lipoteichoic acid; Metastasis of breast cancer; Tumor necrosis factor-alpha,"cytokine; lipoteichoic acid; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; prostaglandin E2; stress activated protein kinase; synaptophysin; tumor necrosis factor; IL10 protein, human; interleukin 10; lipopolysaccharide; lipoteichoic acid; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; stress activated protein kinase; teichoic acid; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory activity; antineoplastic activity; Article; bacterium isolation; cell stimulation; controlled study; cytokine production; gene expression regulation; homeostasis; immune system; in vitro study; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lactobacillus sakei; lymphocyte differentiation; macrophage; MDA-MB-231 cell line; metastatic breast cancer; nonhuman; protein dephosphorylation; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis inhibition; Staphylococcus aureus; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; upregulation; antagonists and inhibitors; cell survival; chemically induced; chemistry; drug effect; human; inflammation; metabolism; phosphorylation; species difference; Th1 Th2 balance; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukin-10; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lipopolysaccharides; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphorylation; Species Specificity; Teichoic Acids; Th1-Th2 Balance; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85062066458

Interestingly, the ER stress-related proteins such as p-ATF2 and CHOP were elevated by SSD. Interestingly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cytotoxicity by SSD treatment were significantly reduced by N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Among the microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated by SSD treatment, miR-657 was most significantly reduced by SSD treatment. However, an miR-657 mimic reversed SSD-induced apoptosis by the attenuation of the expression of p-ATF2, CHOP, and PARP cleavage. Overall, these findings provide scientific evidence that miR657 is an onco-miRNA targeting the ER stress signal pathway and SSD induces apoptosis via the inhibition of miR-657, ROS, and the activation of p-ATF2 and CHOP as a potent anti-cancer agent for myeloid-originated hematological cancer. ? 2019 by the authors.

The most accessible flap is the reverse sural artery flap, which can be harvested as a fasciocutaneous flap or an adipofascial flap. The purpose of this study was to compare the two types of flap methods performed in patients with diabetic infected lateral malleolar bursitis. Methods: Twenty-nine cases of diabetic infected lateral malleolar bursitis treated with reverse sural artery flap between 2006 and 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Fasciocutaneous flap methods were performed in 15 cases (group A), and adipofascial flap methods were performed in 14 cases (group B). Patients in the two groups did not differ in sex or age. The mean follow-up period was 16 months. Results: All flaps survived. Infection was controlled at a mean of 2.4 months in both groups. At final follow-up, infection recurred in one case of each group, which was treated with antibiotics. No case developed an ulcer in the flaps. The patients were able to ambulate in regular shoes. All but one of the patients (28 patients) expressed satisfaction with the aesthetic appearance following treatment. No case required a debulking operation. Conclusion: Both the fasciocutaneous and adipofascial methods for reverse sural artery flaps were shown to be viable options for the control of diabetic lateral infection. In addition, the two groups did not differ in terms of appearance or complication rate following treatment. ?

We investigated the anti-obesity effects of combined extracts of Terminalia chebula (T) and Phylan-thus emblica (P) (TP; FBF-TC) in vitro and in vivo. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated for 9 days. On the last day of differentiation, Oil red O staining, glycerol release, intracellular cAMP levels, and lipolytic enzymes were measured. Compared to the control, lipid accumulation, and mRNA expressions of PDE3B and Perilipin were significantly decreased in the presence of TP 80 μg/mL. The levels of free glycerol, intracellular cAMP, and mRNA expressions of HSL and ATGL were significantly increased by 139%, 99.5%, 65.6%, and 100.8%, respectively, in the presence of TP 80 μg/mL. In the animal study, C57BL/6J mice were tested for 12 weeks after being separated into eight groups: Normal diet group (ND), high fat diet (HFD) group (C, Control), HFD with 1 g/kg b.w. of catechin group (PC, positive control), HFD with 600 mg/kg b.w. of T or P groups, and HFD with 150, 300, 600 mg/kg b.w. of TP groups. Feeding of HFD for 12 weeks resulted in significant increases in body weight compared to the ND group. FBF-TC groups showed reduced body weight, weight gain, mesenteric white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, subcutaneous WAT weight, serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels compared to the C group. In conclusion, this study suggests that TP is a novel anti-obesity candidate through its stimulation of lipolysis. ? 2019, Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.

Don (Fabaceae), has been used as a traditional treatment of various diseases. There is a report L. cuneata effects on hormone replacement therapy for endocrine-related disease. However, studies related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) have not been investigated. Objective: The effects of L. cuneata aqueous extract (LCW) on testosterone-induced prostatic hyperplasia (TPH) were examined. Materials and methods: Male Wistar rats (10 weeks, 330–350 g) were randomly divided to 6 groups (n = 6): Control group; TPH group (3 mg/kg, s.c, daily); TPH + LCW (25, 50, 100 mg/kg); TPH + Finasteride 10 mg/kg for 6 weeks. At the end of treatment, histological change of prostate, serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) level, mRNA expression of 5α-reductase, inflammatory factors, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in prostate were examined. Then, LCW was treated with BPH-1, a human BPH cell line, at 25, 50, 100 μg/mL for 24 h and examine mRNA level of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In addition, the content of vicenin-2 was analyzed. Results: LCW treatment of TPH inhibited serum DHT levels by 54.5, 51.2 and 54.1% and mRNA expression of 5α-reductase were inhibited 54.3, 61.3 and 73.6%, respectively. In addition, mRNA expression of inflammatory factors, PCNA and FGF-2 were decreased in the prostate of rats. Also, LCW attenuated mRNA level of AR and PSA in BPH-1 cell. The content of vicenin-2 in the LCW was analyzed to 0.89 mg/g. Discussion and conclusions: Based on the results, LCW is a potential pharmacological candidate for the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

Methods: Sixty HTOs and 50 UKAs completed between 1992 and 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. There were no significant differences in pre-operative demographics. The mean follow-up period was 10.7 ± 5.7?years for HTO and 12.0 ± 7.1?years for UKA (n.s.). The Knee Society knee and function scores, WOMAC, and range of motion (ROM) were investigated. The mechanical axis and femorotibial angle were evaluated. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed (failure: revision to TKA) and the failure modes were investigated. Results: Most of the clinical and radiographic results were not different at the last follow-up, except ROM; ROM was 135.3° ± 12.3° in HTO and 126.8° ± 13.3° in UKA (p = 0.005). The 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year survival rates were 100%, 91.0%, 63.4%, and 48.3% for closed-wedge HTO, respectively, and 90.5%, 87.1%, 70.8%, and 66.4% for UKA (n.s.). The survival rate was higher than that for UKA until 12?years post-operatively but was higher in UKAs thereafter, following a remarkable decrease in HTO. The most common failure mode was degenerative osteoarthritic progression of medial compartment in HTO and femoral component loosening in UKA. Conclusions: Long-term survival did not differ significantly between closed-wedge HTO and fixed-bearing UKA in patients with similar pre-operative demographics and knee conditions. The difference in post-operative ROM and failure mode should be considered when selecting a procedure.

In recent study, several studies have shown that Korean red ginseng (KRG) can be used in the prevention and treatment of various diseases. The objective of this study is to investigate whether KRG can play a role in repressing the development of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (CNP) in male Wistar rats. To induce CNP, rats were castrated and beta-estradiol (0.25 mg/kg) was subcutaneously (s.c.) injected daily. 7-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups (the normal group, CNP group, positive group, and KRG group (0.25g/kg) and another KRG (0.50g/kg) group. After 4 weeks, all rats were sacrificed and their prostate and serum were analyzed. Compared to the positive group, the KRG groups (0.25g/kg and 0.50g/kg) showed similar protective properties on CNP based on the histopathologic morphology of the prostate and the inflammation cytokines in the prostate tissue. Also, results of the immunohistochemistry staining showed that expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1?), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX2) were also decreased in KRG group (0.25g/kg) and KRG group (0.50g/kg). These results suggested that KRG inhibited the development of CNP and might a useful herbal treatment or functional food for CNP. ? 2019 Sang Wook Kang et al.",,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; creatinine; cytochrome c oxidase; estradiol; ginseng extract; guanosine triphosphate; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin A; cyclooxygenase 2; cytokine; IL1B protein, rat; Il6 protein, rat; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; plant extract; Ptgs2 protein, rat; tumor necrosis factor; vascular endothelial growth factor A, rat; vasculotropin A; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body weight; chronic nonbacterial prostatitis; chronic nonbacterial prostatitis; chronic prostatitis; controlled study; creatinine blood level; ginseng; immunohistochemistry; male; nonhuman; prostate tissue; protein expression; rat; urea nitrogen blood level; animal; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; inflammation; Panax; pathology; prostatitis; South Korea; Animals; Cyclooxygenase 2; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-6; Male; Panax; Plant Extracts; Prostatitis; Rats; Republic of Korea; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",2-s2.0-85060790901

Advanced maternal age has been known to be associated with perinatal outcomes, as well as birth weight (BW). In this study, we aimed to investigate the perinatal factors associated with low birth weight infants (LBWIs) using birth statistics of the Korean population. Methods: Birth statistics between 1993 and 2016 from the Korean Statistical Information Service were reviewed. We investigated 12,856,614 data points, which included the number of births, BWs, percentage of preterm births and LBWIs, multiple pregnancies, and maternal age. Results: The proportion of LBWIs delivered by mothers of advanced maternal age has gradually increased since 1993. In addition, the proportion of older mothers (= 35 years old) giving birth to LBWIs has increased over the years. Average BW has a negative correlation with the ratio of preterm births, LBW, multiple births, and advanced maternal age. The mean BW also has a negative correlation with maternal age. Conclusion: This study shows that the average BW continues to decline, and the incidence of LBWIs is increasing in Korea since 1993. This study also revealed that several perinatal factors, including percentage of preterm births, LBWIs, multiple births, and maternal age influence the mean BW. Although this study did not investigate the effects of decreasing mean BW on perinatal health, future research is worth discussing. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Birth weight; Infant; Korea; Low birth Weight; Maternal age; Premature birth,"adolescent; adult; birth weight; factual database; female; human; incidence; low birth weight; maternal age; middle aged; multiple pregnancy; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; South Korea; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Birth Weight; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Linear Models; Maternal Age; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Pregnancy, Multiple; Premature Birth; Republic of Korea; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85060652273

Methods: A prospective, nonrandomized, interventional case series involved 40 patients with persistent vascularized PED previously treated with at least 3 injections of intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab. Intravitreal aflibercept was administered as 3 initial loading doses every 4 weeks, followed by pro re nata retreatment every 8 weeks over 48 weeks. Pigment epithelial detachment was classified into solid-, hollow-, or mixed-type according to the reflective properties visualized using optical coherence tomography. The mean changes in best-corrected visual acuity, central subfield thickness, and the volumes of SRF and PED were analyzed. Results: The PED volume (baseline: 0.43 ± 0.55 mm3) significantly reduced to 0.23 ± 0.32 mm3 at Week 8 (P = 0.003) and increased to 0.36 ± 0.41 mm3 at Week 48 (P = 0.345). The SRF volume (baseline: 0.52 ± 0.64 mm3) significantly reduced to 0.24 ± 0.43 mm3 at Week 48 (P = 0.021). The mean baseline best-corrected visual acuity was 20/75 (47.5 letters); it showed no significant difference at Week 48 (+4.4 letters; P = 0.125). The baseline central subfield thickness was 323.2 ± 92.3 mm; it significantly reduced to 281.2 ± 90.7 mm at Week 48 (P = 0.001). In solid-type PEDs, there were poorer improvements in central subfield thickness, best-corrected visual acuity, and the volumes of the SRF and PED, with newly developed intraretinal cysts. Conclusion: Intravitreal aflibercept in treatment-resistant neovascular age-related macular degeneration led to significant reduction in PED and SRF volume, central subfield thickness, and best-corrected visual acuity preserved, over 12 months.

Mesially impacted MM2s were uprighted with orthodontic microimplants, inserted in the retromolar area, and then moved into their ideal position. The first patient was in an active growing stage, while the second patient was beyond the active growing stage. Therefore posterior available space (PAS) should be analyzed before treatment of impacted MM2s to prevent periodontal problems after uprighting of impacted teeth.

Therefore, our study aimed to describe the incidence and 5-year survival rates of biliary tract cancers by subsites in South Korea. Methods: A total of 86,134 patients with biliary tract cancers were selected from the National Health Information Database. Age-standardized incidence rates and annual percentage changes were calculated. Life-table methods and log-rank tests were used to determine the differences in survival rates. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio of the patients with biliary tract cancers. Results: The incidence rate of intrahepatic bile duct cancer decreased by 1.3% annually from 8.8 per 100,000 in 2006 to 7.8 per 100,000 in 2015. Extrahepatic bile duct cancer also showed a decreasing trend by 2.2% per year from 8.7 per 100,000 in 2006 to 6.7 per 100,000 in 2015. Gallbladder cancer showed the greatest decline, with an annual percentage change of 2.8% from 6.3 per 100,000 to 5.2 per 100,000 during the same period. The 5-year survival rates were 30.0% in gallbladder cancer, 27.8% in extrahepatic bile duct cancer, and 15.9% in intrahepatic bile duct cancer. Conclusions: The overall incidence rates of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct cancer and gallbladder cancer decreased from 2006 to 2015. Among biliary tract cancers, intrahepatic bile duct cancers exhibited the highest incidence rate and the worst survival rate. (Gut Liver 2019;13:104-113). ?

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,2019,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060047066&doi=10.1093%2fpm%2fpny186&partnerID=40&md5=6855edd481e493a39c0e9d5bf1eecf91,"Background. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is usually quantified using the visual analog scale (VAS). However, the VAS is a subjective measure and prone to reporting bias, therefore making it difficult to differentiate patients with true pain from those seeking to obtain secondary gain. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using plasma b-endorphin as an objective biomarker for CLBP. Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized trials that compared treatment vs sham procedures for patients with CLBP. Changes in VAS and b-endorphin levels between baseline and final evaluations were assessed for the treatment and control groups. A meta-regression model was developed to evaluate the association between the b-endorphin level and VAS. Results. We included data from seven trials involving 375 patients. There was no significant difference in VAS scores and b-endorphin levels between both groups at baseline. At final evaluation, the treatment group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in VAS scores and an increased b-endorphin level compared with the control group. The change in the plasma b-endorphin level may be a surrogate marker of treatment response for patients with CLBP (explanatory power: 80%). The plasma b-endorphin level might be rarely affected by sham procedures. For patients with CLBP, the baseline b-endorphin level may reflect the intensity of CLBP (explanatory power: 66%). Conclusions. A change in plasma b-endorphin level may be a surrogate marker of the treatment response for patients with CLBP. Advancements in b-endorphin measurements may help us better quantify pain intensity. ? 2017 American Academy of Pain Medicine.",Biomarker; Chronic Pain; Endorphin; Meta-Analysis; Spine,beta endorphin; biological marker; beta endorphin; Article; clinical evaluation; comparative effectiveness; disease marker; feasibility study; human; low back pain; meta analysis; pain intensity; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial (topic); sensitivity analysis; treatment outcome; treatment response; visual analog scale; chronic pain; low back pain; pain measurement; beta-Endorphin; Chronic Pain; Humans; Low Back Pain; Pain Measurement; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85060047066

Materials and Methods: Our study included 331 urological cancer (UC) survivors (114 PC, 108 KC, and 109 BC) aged 50 years disease-free for at least 1 year after surgery. The control group included 1,177 subjects without a history of cancer. The HRQoL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30, the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of any of the functioning sub-scales and symptoms, except significantly lower social functioning observed in BC survivors than that observed in KC survivors. Although the three groups of UC survivors showed essentially similar functioning sub-scales and symptoms when compared to the general population, PC and BC survivors showed significantly lower social functioning and a lower appetite than that observed in controls. KC survivors showed lower physical functioning, as well as higher pain and dyspnea. Although all three groups of UC survivors reported higher financial difficulties, they also reported higher perceived social support than that reported by the non-cancer control group. No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of depressive symptoms between each group of UC survivors and the general population. Conclusion: Disease-free survivors of the three major types of UCs showed generally similar HRQoL compared to the general population, as well as compared to each other.

As such, we aimed to compare the years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death between a population with disabilities and the total population of Korea. Methods: To calculate the YLLs in people with disabilities, we combined disability registration data from the 2002-2011 Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea and the causes of mortality data by Statistics Korea for 3,158,231 people. Results: YLLs of people with disabilities were 517,337, which accounted for 23.4% of YLLs of the total population. YLLs per 100,000 people with disabilities were approximately 3.8 times higher than those in the total Korean population. Ischemic stroke was associated with the highest YLLs per 100,000 people, followed by ischemic heart disease, hemorrhagic, and other non-ischemic stroke, diabetes mellitus, and self-harm. Among individuals with physical disabilities, ischemic heart disease was associated with the highest YLLs. For intellectual disability, epilepsy contributed to the most YLLs. For individuals with mental disability, self-harm was the largest contributor to YLLs. Conclusion: The burden of disease was higher in the population with disabilities than that in the general population. Cardiovascular diseases and cancer had a higher burden of disease than did other diseases in the population with disabilities; thus, overall, non-communicable diseases have a higher burden of disease than communicable diseases or injuries in the population with disabilities than in the general population. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Burden of disease; Disability-adjusted life years; Mortality; People with disabilities; Years of life lost,"adolescent; adult; aged; cause of death; cerebrovascular accident; child; disabled person; female; global disease burden; human; infant; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; pathology; premature mortality; preschool child; quality adjusted life year; South Korea; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Disabled Persons; Female; Global Burden of Disease; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality, Premature; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Republic of Korea; Stroke; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85059905535

Materials and Methods In converting NFOSI-18 and NTX-4, the following steps were performed: forward translation, backward translation, expert review, pretest of preliminary format, and finalization of Korean versions (K-NFOSI-18 and K-NTX-4). Patients were enrolled from six institutions where each had completed chemotherapy for ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer at least 1 month earlier. In addition to demographics obtained by questionnaire, all subjects were assessed via K-NFOSI-18, K-NTX-4, and a Korean version of the EuroQoL-5 Dimension. Internal structural validity and reliability were evaluated using item internal consistency, item discriminant validity, and Cronbach's . To evaluate test-retest reliability, K-NFOSI-18 and K-NTX-4 were readministered after 7-21 days, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. Results Of the 250 women enrolled during the 3-month recruitment period, 13 withdrew or did not respond, leaving 237 (94.8%) for the analyses. Mean patient age was 54.3±10.8 years. Re-testing was performed in 190 patients (80.2%). The total K-NFOSI-18 and K-NTX-4 scores were 49 (range, 20 to 72) and 9 (range, 0 to 16), respectively, with high reliability (Cronbach's =0.84 and 0.89, respectively) and reproducibility (ICC=0.77 and 0.84, respectively) achieved in retesting.

Hass, also known as avocado, has been reported to possess hypolipidemic, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, cardioprotective, and photoprotective potencies. However, few studies have reported its anti-colitic effects. In this study, we investigated anti-colitic effects of ethanol extract of P. americana (EEP) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitic mice and the involved molecular mechanisms. EEP effectively improved clinical signs and histological characteristics of DSS-induced colitis mice. In DSS-exposed colonic tissues, EEP reduced expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Moreover, EEP suppressed DSS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Consistent with in vivo results, EEP also suppressed protein and mRNA expression levels of iNOS, COX-2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB and STAT3 inactivation in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages.

We determined the impact of the primary tumor location in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Methods: Demographic data and clinical information were collected from 1,115 patients from the Republic of Korea, who presented with mCRC between January 2009 and December 2011, using web-based electronic case report forms. Associations between the primary tumor location and the patient’s clinical characteristics were assessed, and factors inf luencing overall survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: Of the 1,115 patients recruited to the study, 244 (21.9%) had right colon cancer, 483 (43.3%) had left colon cancer, and 388 (34.8%) had rectal cancer. Liver and lung metastases occurred more frequently in patients with left colon and rectal cancer (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively), while peritoneal and ovarian metastases occurred more frequently in patients with right and left colon cancer (p < 0.001 and p = 0.031, respec-tively). The median overall survival of patients with tumors originating in the right colon was significantly shorter than that of patients whose tumors had originated in the left colon or rectum (13.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.0 to 15.5] vs. 18.0 months [95% CI, 16.3 to 19.7] or 19.9 months [95% CI, 18.5 to 21.3], respectively; p = 0.003). Tumor resection, the number of metastatic sites, and primary tumor location correlated with overall survival in the univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusions: Primary tumor location influences the metastatic sites and prognosis of patients with mCRC. ? 2019, Korean Association of Internal Medicine.

Recently, we reported that CCAR2 protects cells from apoptosis following mitochondrial stress, possibly by co-operating with Hsp60. However, it is not clear how CCAR2 and Hsp60 control cell survival and death. Here, we found that depleting CCAR2 and Hsp60 downregulated expression of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family. Survivin expression in neuroblastoma tissues and human cancer cell lines correlated positively with expression of CCAR2 and Hsp60. Furthermore, high expression of CCAR2, Hsp60, and survivin was associated with poor survival of neuroblastoma patients. In summary, both CCAR2 and Hsp60 are required for expression of survivin, and both promote cancer cell survival, at least in part, by maintaining survivin expression. Therefore, CCAR2, Hsp60, and survivin are candidate tumor biomarkers and prognostic markers in neuroblastomas. ? 2019 by the authors.

This study aimed to investigate the role of the SNS and β-adrenoreceptor in gastric cancer progression. Materials and Methods: The density of SNS was quantified by immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase in 115 surgically-resected gastric cancer specimens. Immunostaining for β1- and β2-adrenoreceptor was also performed to examine the β-adrenoreceptor expression status in gastric cancer. Then the association of protein expression status with histological grade, pathological tumor stage (pT), and pathological node stage of gastric cancer was investigated. Results: The SNS density of pT4 tumors was significantly lower than that of pT1-3 tumors. The SNS density was positively correlated with β1-adrenoreceptor expression status. In addition, lower β1-adrenoreceptor expression was significantly associated with increased lymph node metastasis. Reduced β2-adrenoreceptor staining proportion was significantly associated with worse histological grade. Furthermore, the proportion of β2- adrenoreceptor staining was significantly lower in tumors with diffuse-type histology, than those with intestinal-type histology. Conclusion: A lower SNS density and β- adrenoreceptor expression was associated with an aggressive oncogenic behavior including worse histological grade, advanced pT, and increased lymph node metastasis.

In the United States, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer- related deaths in men. The major causes of prostate cancer include increasing age, family history, diet, sexual behavior, and geographic location. Early detection of prostate cancer can effectively reduce the mortality rate. In the past, researchers have adopted various multimodal feature extracting strategies to extract diverse and comprehensive quantitative imaging features and employed machine learning methods to detect prostate cancer. However, existing techniques lack detailed analysis of the magnitude of relationship among different individual discriminatory features, which is very important to understand the dynamics of the disease. In this study, we extracted diverse morphological features to summarize the imaging profile of patients of prostate cancer imaging database and employed Bayesian network analysis approach to quantify the association between different features and the strength of the association. The features and the association between the features were, respectively, modeled as the nodes and the edges of the network. The strength of association between the nodes was computed using Pearson's correlation, mutual Information and Kullback-Liebler methods. The strongest associations were found between multiple features: (Area → Equidiameter), (Area → Circulatory 2), (Circulatory 1 → (Elongatedness), (Circulatory 1 → Entropy), (Circulatory 1 → Max. Radius), and (Min. Radius → Eccentricity). Moreover, interaction impact among nodes and node force was also computed. This analysis will help in finding the features that are more dominant to establish the relationship and can further increase the detection performance. ? 2013 IEEE.",Bayesian network analysis; coherence; Kullback Liebler; morphological features; mutual information; Pearson's correlation; prostate cancer,Bayesian networks; Coherent light; Feature extraction; Image processing; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Principal component analysis; Tumors; Urology; Bayes method; Kullback Liebler; Morphological features; Mutual informations; Prostate cancers; Diseases,2-s2.0-85058896955

This study sought to compare the efficacy of Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents (R-ZES) and Xience everolimus-eluting stents (EES) for very long coronary lesions. Methods and results This randomized, multicenter, prospective trial compared the use of R-ZES with EES for very long (?50 mm) native coronary lesions. The primary end point was in-segment late luminal loss at 12-month angiographic follow-up. A total of 400 patients were needed to assess the primary end point. However, owing to very slow enrollment of patients, this trial was early terminated (302 patients were enrolled), and thus, this report provides descriptive information on primary and secondary end points. The R-ZES and EES groups had similar baseline characteristics. Lesion length was 49.6±10.2 and 50.6±13.3 mm in the R-ZES and EES groups, respectively (P=0.47). The number of stents used at the target lesion was 2.1±0.3 and 2.2±0.5, respectively. Twelve-month angiographic follow-up was performed in 50% of eligible patients. In-segment late luminal loss did not significantly differ between the R-ZES and EES groups (0.17±0.57 vs. 0.09±0.43 mm, P=0.32). In-segment binary restenosis rates were 8.1 and 5.3% in the R-ZES and EES groups, respectively (P=0.49). There were no significant between-group differences in the rate of adverse events (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, target lesion revascularization, and composite outcomes). Conclusion For patients with very long native coronary artery disease, R-ZES and EES implantation showed comparable angiographic and clinical outcomes through 1 year of follow-up. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods/design: This is a study protocol of a randomized patient-assessor-blinded, controlled, clinical trial. This study will be carried out at Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong in Korea. Participants with shoulder pain lasting more than 3 months will be recruited to the study. After eligibility screening, a total of 64 participants will be randomly allocated to one of the 2 groups in this trial, with 32 participants in each group. Over the 8 weeks treatment period, TEA and sham TEA will be performed in the respective groups once a week. In the follow-up phase, participants will undergo a telephone interview after 12 weeks and will visit for a final evaluation after 16 weeks. Results: The primary outcome measure is the change in pain intensity between baseline and treatment completion (8 weeks). Secondary outcome measures include the values for pain intensity, shoulder disability, safety, satisfaction, and quality of life. Conclusions: Previous studies have shown that TEA could be an alternative treatment for shoulder pain. However, there is still a lack of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of TEA for chronic rotator cuff disease. This study will provide useful evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of TEA treatment. The findings will serve as important data for conducting additional acupuncture studies on chronic rotator cuff disease. ? 2018",Protocol; Randomized controlled trial; Rotator cuff disease; Shoulder pain; Thread-embedding acupuncture,acupuncture; adult; analgesia; Article; chronic disease; clinical evaluation; controlled study; female; follow up; human; Korea; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; pain intensity; patient satisfaction; physical examination; priority journal; quality of life; quality of life assessment; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; rotator cuff injury; safety; shoulder pain; Shoulder Pain and Disability Index; telephone interview; therapy effect; thread embedding acupuncture; treatment duration,2-s2.0-85058459899

This study aimed to identify EA-related biological pathways by analyzing genome-wide gene expression profiles in sputum cells. Methods: A total of 3,156 gene probes with significantly differential expressions between EA and healthy elderly controls were used for a hierarchical clustering of genes to identify gene clusters. Gene set enrichment analysis provided biological information, with replication from Gene Expression Omnibus expression profiles. Results: Fifty-five EA patients and 10 elderly control subjects were enrolled. Two distinct gene clusters were found. Cluster 1 (n = 35) showed a lower eosinophil proportion in sputum and less severe airway obstruction compared to cluster 2 (n = 20). The replication data set also identified 2 gene clusters (clusters 1' and 2'). Among 5 gene sets significantly enriched in cluster 1 and 3 gene sets significantly enriched in cluster 2, we confirmed that 2 were significantly enriched in the replication data set (OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION gene set in cluster 1 and EPITHELIAL MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION gene set in cluster 2'). Conclusions: The findings of 2 distinct gene clusters in EA and different biological pathways in each gene cluster suggest 2 different pathogenesis mechanisms underlying EA.

The findings intend to contribute to a thorough understanding of suicidal phenomena and development of suicide prevention guidelines. The present cross-section study examines the study rationale, methodology, and baseline characteristics of the participants. Methods: Participants were enrolled via the hospital and community gateways, establishing the hospital-based cohort (HC) and community-based cohort (CC), respectively. Baseline assessment was conducted on sociodemographic, clinical, diagnostic, and psychopathological aspects. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale was used to investigate suicidality. Results: A total of 800 suicidal people aged 15 years or older were enrolled from 8 university hospitals and 8 community mental health welfare centers (CMHWCs), among whom 480 (60%) were suicidal ideators and 320 (40%) were attempters. The ideators comprised 207 CC and 273 HC participants, whereas the attempters, 34 CC and 286 HC participants. Despite their lower severity in some measures, including suicidal ideation, compared with their HC counterparts, the CC participants within each group of ideators or attempters presented clinically significant psychopathology. Moreover, alcohol use problems and past suicide attempt were more likely to be found in CC participants. Only 11.1% to 21.6% of the participants in each of the four groups (defined by the cohorts and the ideators/attempters) were on any type of psychiatric treatment. Conclusions: Suicidal visitors to CMHWCs need to be as closely monitored as suicidal patients in university hospitals, especially considering their association with problem drinking and past suicide attempt. A cautious assumption is that the high suicide rate in Korea might be partly attributable to the low proportion of patients receiving psychiatric services. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Cohort studies; Community mental health centers; Hospitals; Korea; Suicide; Suicide attempt,"adolescent; adult; aged; alcohol abuse; anxiety; Article; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; depression; disease severity; female; human; hypomania; major clinical study; major depression; male; married person; mental disease; multicenter study; observational study; prospective study; psychiatric treatment; social status; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; alcoholism; clinical trial; middle aged; predictive value; psychology; South Korea; suicidal ideation; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcoholism; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Republic of Korea; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85056880371

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that MGCD0103 (MGCD), an HDAC inhibitor, protects the pancreas from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced oxidative stress and cell death. Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with STZ (40 mg/kg) to induce type I diabetes. MGCD (10 μg/day) was infused with osmotic mini-pump for 4 weeks. Pancreatic insulin and macrophage infiltration were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester was used to analyze mitochondrial membrane potential. Activation of caspase-3 was analyzed by western blotting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to investigate the binding affinity of specificity protein 1 (SP1) on the promoters of target genes. mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. As a result, we found that MGCD infusion ameliorated STZ-induced hyperglycemia, islet deformation, decreased insulin level, and macrophage infiltration. STZ injection promoted the production of ROS, which induced caspase activity and β-cell death. 4-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL), a mimetic of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced STZ-induced caspase activity and β-cell death. MGCD treatment increased SOD expression and histone acetylation level on promoters. Infusion of MGCD promoted acetylation of SP1 and its enrichment on SOD promoters. Thus, MGCD protects pancreatic β-cells from STZ-induced oxidative stress and cell death through the induction of antioxidant enzymes such as SODs. ? 2018",Histone deacetylase inhibitor; Oxidative stress; Pancreatic beta-cell death; Specificity protein 1; Type 1 diabetes,"caspase 3; catalase; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; extracellular superoxide dismutase; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; glutathione transferase P1; histone; histone deacetylase inhibitor; insulin; manganese superoxide dismutase; mocetinostat; reactive oxygen metabolite; tempol; tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; transcription factor Sp1; benzamide derivative; histone deacetylase inhibitor; mocetinostat; pyrimidine derivative; streptozocin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; Article; binding affinity; cell death; cell infiltration; cell protection; cell viability; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; fluorescence activated cell sorting; histone acetylation; hyperglycemia; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; macrophage; male; mitochondrial membrane potential; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pancreas islet; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; promoter region; protein acetylation; protein binding; quantitative analysis; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; Sprague Dawley rat; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; Western blotting; animal; cell death; dose response; HEK293 cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; human; infusion pump; metabolism; oxidative stress; pancreas; pancreas islet beta cell; pathology; physiology; randomization; Animals; Benzamides; Cell Death; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; HEK293 Cells; Hep G2 Cells; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Infusion Pumps; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Male; Oxidative Stress; Pancreas; Pyrimidines; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Streptozocin",2-s2.0-85055980164

There are reports on the misuse of MXE, which sometimes resulted in adverse consequences and death. Studies have also shown that MXE has abuse liability and stimulates dopamine neurotransmission in the mesolimbic reward pathway in the brain. These findings have contributed to the negative impression on MXE. However, recent preclinical studies have identified the antidepressant properties of MXE, which are attributed to its ability to affect the glutamatergic and serotonergic systems. MXE is also reported to have analgesic effects. These findings show some of the “redeeming qualities” of MXE and indicate its possible therapeutic uses. In this paper, we have reviewed the findings that provide insights into the adverse and potential therapeutic effects of MXE. We compiled studies on the toxicity, psychotomimetic effects, and abuse liability of MXE, as well as its promising antidepressant and analgesic properties. We also have discussed the mechanism of action that might mediate the somewhat paradoxical effects observed. Importantly, this review provides valuable information on MXE for future research and will enable a better understanding of its psychopharmacological properties and the mechanisms responsible for its unique effects. ? 2018",Abuse liability; Antidepressant; Intoxication; Methoxetamine,"analgesic agent; antidepressant agent; methoxetamine; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor blocking agent; psychedelic agent; unclassified drug; 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone; anesthetic agent; antidepressant agent; cyclohexanone derivative; cyclohexylamine derivative; dopamine; ketamine; analgesic activity; antidepressant activity; drug abuse; drug metabolism; human; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; serotoninergic system; therapy effect; animal; drug effect; metabolism; synaptic transmission; Anesthetics, Dissociative; Animals; Antidepressive Agents; Cyclohexanones; Cyclohexylamines; Dopamine; Humans; Ketamine; Synaptic Transmission",2-s2.0-85055691271

MicroRNAs are often deregulated in cancers. The primate-specific miR-944, located in a p63 intron, is known to be highly expressed in patients exhibiting low colorectal cancer recurrence rates. However, the biological functions of miR-944 in colorectal cancers remain unclear. In this study, we found that miR-944 was downregulated in colorectal cancer tissues, and inhibited cancer cell growth in a xenograft mouse model. The overexpression of miR-944 caused G1 phase arrest and increased p53 expression in cancer cells. p53 stability was enhanced by miR-944s targeting E3 ligases COP1 and MDM2. Overexpression of COP1 and MDM2 restored cell growth inhibition caused by miR-944. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-944 acts as a potential tumor suppressor in colorectal cancers through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. ? 2018",Colorectal cancer; miR-944; p53; Primate specific miRNA; Tumor suppressor,"microRNA; microRNA 944; proteasome; protein MDM2; protein p53; ubiquitin C; ubiquitin protein ligase COP1; unclassified drug; MDM2 protein, human; microRNA; MIRN-944 microRNA, human; protein MDM2; protein p53; RFWD2 protein, human; TP53 protein, human; ubiquitin protein ligase; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cell cycle progression; cell growth; colorectal cancer; controlled study; down regulation; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression regulation; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; protein RNA binding; protein stability; protein targeting; upregulation; animal; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; colorectal tumor; genetics; HCT 116 cell line; HT-29 cell line; human; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; xenograft; Animals; Colorectal Neoplasms; HCT116 Cells; Heterografts; HT29 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",2-s2.0-85055634141

However, very few studies have reported on symptomatic improvement duration and time when symptomatic improvement ceases. This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcome changes after arthroscopic microfracture in patients with OLT. Methods: Among patients who underwent arthroscopic microfracture for OLT, 70 patients were available for follow-up for more than 3 years. Of these, 6 patients who showed worsening or no improvement in the 6 months after surgery were excluded, and a total of 64 patients were included in the analysis. To analyze and compare the clinical outcome changes according to time, the visual analog scale (VAS) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores were evaluated every 3 months up to 1 year postoperatively and every 1 year thereafter. The clinical outcome differences based on the lesion size, lesion location, lesion containment, presence of cyst and bone marrow edema, age, sex, and obesity were analyzed. Results: The preoperative and final follow-up VAS scores significantly improved from 6.2 ± 1.1 to 1.2 ± 1.1 (P <.05) and the AOFAS score from 63.1 ± 7.3 to 91.0 ± 7.3 (P <.05). The overall success rate for arthroscopic microfracture in this study was 88.6%. The postoperative VAS and AOFAS scores at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 months were 3.7 ± 1.4, 2.5 ± 1.3, 2.0 ± 1.1, 1.6 ± 1.2, 1.2 ± 1.2, and 1.3 ± 1.2 and 74.7 ± 10.3, 80.5 ± 8.9, 84.3 ± 7.4, 88.3 ± 7.3, 91.1 ± 7.2, and 90.8 ± 7.5, respectively, showing significant improvements up to 2 years. After 2 years, the symptoms did not improve but were maintained at a certain level up to 3 years. No clinical outcome differences based on the lesion size, lesion containment, presence of cyst and bone marrow edema, age, sex, and obesity were observed. Conclusion: Symptomatic improvement early after arthroscopic microfracture for OLT was observed continuously for up to 2 years postoperatively. Symptom improvement was maintained without worsening for up to 3 years after surgery. Determining the final outcome of microfracture at least after 2 years would be reasonable.

In this study, we show that a phytochemical sulfuretin suppressed adipocyte differentiation of preadipocytes and administration of sulfuretin to high fat diet-fed obese mice prevented obesity and increased insulin sensitivity. These effects were associated with a suppressed expression of inflammatory markers, induced expression of adiponectin, and increased levels of phosphorylated ERK and AKT. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of sulfuretin in adipocytes, we performed microarray analysis and identified activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) as a sulfuretin-responsive gene. Sulfuretin elevated Atf3 mRNA and protein levels in white adipose tissue and adipocytes. Consistently, deficiency of Atf3 promoted lipid accumulation and the expression of adipocyte markers. Sulfuretin’s but not resveratrol’s anti-adipogenic effects were diminished in Atf3 deficient cells, indicating that Atf3 is an essential factor in the effects of sulfuretin. These results highlight the usefulness of sulfuretin as a new anti-obesity intervention for the prevention of obesity and its associated metabolic diseases. ? 2019 The Korean Society of Applied Pharmacology.",Adipocyte; Atf3; Diabetes; Metabolic diseases; Obesity; Sulfuretin,activating transcription factor 3; adiponectin; fatty acid binding protein 4; mitogen activated protein kinase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phytochemical; protein kinase B; sulfuretin; transcription factor 3; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; 3T3 cell line; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiobesity activity; Article; body weight; C3H/10T1/2 clone 8 cell line; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cell differentiation; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diet induced obesity; electrospray; female; food intake; gene expression; glucose blood level; histology; in vivo study; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; lipid storage; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; metabolic disorder; microarray analysis; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; protein expression level; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; spectrophotometry; thin layer chromatography; total cholesterol level; Toxicodendron vernicifluum; triacylglycerol blood level; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85053176187

Procedures: A retrospective review of CSC patients treated with full-fluence or half-fluence PDT for 12 months was performed. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), neural retinal thickness, subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), resolution of subretinal fluid (SRF), and incidence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy at 12, 24, and 36 months were assessed. Results: Thirty-seven and 30 eyes received full-fluence and half-fluence PDT, respectively. The BCVA and CMT improved significantly in both the full-fluence and half-fluence groups at 36 months, without a significant difference between the groups. Both groups showed significant reductions in SFCT with full-fluence (416.8-316.8 μm) being better overall than half-fluence (409.7-349.1 μm, p = 0.002). All patients achieved complete resolution without recurrence after one PDT treatment per eye. A few cases of RPE atrophy occurred, which could be correlated to PDT in both groups during the follow-up.

For a few individuals, these can end up with suicide. However, there have been no studies investigating any differences in attitudes toward suicides among individuals with no suicidal thoughts, those with suicidal thoughts, and those with suicide attempts. Aims: This study was carried out to compare attitudes toward suicide among three different groups: individuals with a history of no suicidal thoughts, those with a history of suicidal thoughts, and those with a history of suicide attempts. Method: To examine Koreans' attitudes toward suicide, we analyzed the data from the 2013 National Suicide Survey involving 1,500 participants aged between 19 and 75 years. Results: Different attitudes toward suicide were found among the three groups. Persons reporting that they had made a suicide attempt in their life showed the most permissive attitudes toward suicide. Limitations: Since this research is based on cross-sectional data, it is difficult to eliminate the possibility of changes in attitude toward suicide completely after having a suicidal thought and suicide attempt. Conclusion: These results can be a useful source for constructing effective messages for suicide prevention campaigns and can ultimately contribute to an improvement in the public's perceptions of suicide in the future. ? 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.",attitudes toward suicide; suicidal thoughts; suicide attempts,"adult; attitude to health; comparative study; female; human; male; middle aged; South Korea; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; Adult; Attitude to Health; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted",2-s2.0-85049186354

Neuropathic pain develops in ?30% of diabetics. Here, we examined the suppressive effect of GS-KG9 on neuropathic pain induced by streptozotocin (STZ). Methods: Hyperglycemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of STZ. Rats showing blood glucose level > 250 mg/dL were divided into five groups, and treatment groups received oral saline containing GS-KG9 (50 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, or 300 mg/kg) twice daily for 4 wk. The effects of GS-KG9 on pain behavior, microglia activation in the lumbar spinal cord and ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus, and c-Fos expression in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord were examined. Results: The development of neuropathic pain began at Day 5 and peaked at Week 4 after STZ injection. Mechanical and thermal pains were both significantly attenuated in GS-KG9-treated groups from 10 d after STZ injection as compared to those in the STZ control. GS-KG9 also repressed microglia activation in L4 dorsal horn and VPL region of the thalamus. In addition, increase in c-Fos-positive cells within L4 dorsal horn lamina I and II of the STZ control group was markedly alleviated by GS-KG9.

Methods: Eight gastroenterologists independently evaluated the exercises presented in the constipation YouTube videos for seven items: image quality, usefulness in relieving constipation (quality 1), usefulness for general physical health (quality 2), difficulty in following, activity intensity, fun, and overall quality. Raters were asked open-ended questions to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the videos. Five-point ordinal scales were used to score each item aforementioned, with the exception of image quality and overall quality that used a six-point Likert scale. Results: The 20 videos had a mean length of 268 seconds and a mean viewership of 32,694. The most common video source was commercial (n=10), and the most common type of physical activity was yoga (n=11). The median values of image quality, quality 1, quality 2, difficulty in following, activity intensity, fun, and overall quality were 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, and 2, respectively. Yoga videos had significantly higher median quality 1 values (3) compared with massage videos (2, adjusted p=0.006) and 'others' videos (2, adjusted p<0.001). A lack of medical evidence was the most common answer to open-ended questions about the weaknesses of each video. Conclusions: Overall, YouTube exercise videos presented a low-quality content.

Although comprehensive diagnostic approach on hip pain is mandatory for adequate treatment, un- or mis-diagnosis is not rare in primary care. The aim of this study was to analyze descriptively un- or mis-diagnosed hip pain cases referred from primary care to a tertiary hospital, especially in young adults ?50 years old. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 150 patients (?50 years old) with chronic hip pain (? 6 weeks), which was not diagnosed or misdiagnosed based on the information provided on the referral form. Results: Overall an average 32 cases/month were referred due to hip pain without a diagnosis or with an incorrect diagnosis. Among them, 150 patients were enrolled in this study and 146 (97.3%) could be allocated to a specific disease by using data from routine clinical practice. Four common final diagnoses were femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome (55.3%), hip dysplasia (HD, 13.3%), referred pain from the lumbar spine (9.3%), and spondyloarthritis (SpA, 7.3%). In patients with FAI syndrome, 37 (44.0%) had pincer-type FAI and 33 (39.8%) had combined-type. Although the pain site or gender was not tightly clustered, the distribution of final diagnosis was significantly different according to hip pain location or gender. Especially, SpA or HD was not observed in younger women subgroup or elder men subgroup, respectively, when stratified by the mean age of participants. Conclusion: Most ( > 80%) young patients with hip pain, a difficult issue to diagnosis for many primary physicians, had FAI syndrome, HD, spine lesions, and SpA. This study could give a chance to feedback information about cases with un- or mis-diagnosed hip pain, and it suggests that primary physicians need to be familiar with the diagnostic approach for these 4 diseases. ? 2018 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Acetabular dysplasia; Femoroacetabular impingement; Hip pain; Spondyloarthopathy,adolescent; adult; chronic disease; diagnostic error; female; femoroacetabular impingement; hip; hip dislocation; human; male; middle aged; pain; pathology; retrospective study; spondyloarthropathy; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Chronic Disease; Diagnostic Errors; Female; Femoracetabular Impingement; Hip; Hip Dislocation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Retrospective Studies; Spondylarthropathies; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85058918168

This study examined whether serum vitamin B 12 levels could be a prognostic factor in metastatic cancer patients. Methods: Data from a retrospective chart review were used to perform Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses of the Cox proportional hazards. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients without a liver lesion (hepatocellular carcinoma or liver metastasis). Results: A total of 523 patients were included. The median survival time was 1.8 months (mo) in the high B 12 group (&gt;911 pg/mL) and 5.1 mo in the normal B 12 group (211-911 pg/mL) (p &lt; 0.001). In patients without a liver lesion, the median survival times were 2.1 and 6.1 mo in the high and normal B 12 groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.001).

Although the anti-inflammatory activity of WFF has been reported, the underlying mechanisms for the activity remain unclear. Here, we examined whether the anti-inflammatory activity of WFF is associated with Nrf2, an anti-inflammatory factor, and A20, an ubiquitin-regulator protein that inhibits signaling cascades of endotoxin or cytokines. Materials and methods: The water extract of Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl was prepared and fingerprinted by HPLC. Cytotoxicity and intracellular ROS induced by WFF were determined by MTT and FACS analyses, respectively. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were analyzed by immunoblot. Expression of mRNA was analyzed by a semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of proteins or genes was quantitated by Image J. Results: WFF activated Nrf2, inducing the expression of Nrf2-dependent genes, such as HO-1, NQO1, and GCLC in RAW 264.7 cells. On the other hand, WFF suppressed NF-κB induced by LPS or TNF-α which was coincided with the expression of A20. Conversely, WFF failed to suppress NF-κB when A20 expression was silenced by siRNA. Conclusion: WFF activated Nrf2 and expressed A20. Given that Nrf2 suppresses inflammation and A20 broadly disrupts inflammatory signaling cascades, our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of WFF is attributable to Nrf2 and A20. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",A20; Anti-inflammation; Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.)

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Onchung-eum, a well-known herbal prescription in traditional medicine comprising 8 herbs that has long been used for skin diseases, on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)–induced OM in human pharyngeal cells and golden Syrian hamsters. DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, and reactive oxygen species production were measured in vitro. The effects of Onchung-eum on OM of hamster cheek pouches induced by 5-FU were evaluated histologically and using TUNEL assay. In addition, the expression of nuclear factor-κB, caspase-3, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Significantly increased cell viability was observed in the Onchung-eum–treated groups compared with the 5-FU–treated control group. In 500 and 1000 mg/kg Onchung-eum–treated groups, the damaged epithelial layers in the cheek pouches of hamsters were significantly recovered. Moreover, at all concentrations, cell death in the cheek pouches of hamsters in the Onchung-eum–treated groups significantly decreased. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-κB, and caspase-3 also significantly decreased in Onchung-eum–treated groups at 500 and 1000 mg/kg. In conclusion, this study revealed that Onchung-eum can be used to treat chemotherapy-induced OM. However, further studies are required to understand the underlying mechanisms. ?

The purpose of this study was to investigate the trends and current status of IBD surgeries in Korea. Methods: Using a national database from the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, we analyzed data from patients who underwent surgery for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis from January 2009 to October 2016. Results: The mean number of patients who underwent surgery for Crohn disease was 791.8 per year. Colorectal surgery, small bowel surgery, and anal surgery were performed fairly often (31.2%, 29.4%, 39.4%, respectively), and laparoscopic surgery continued to increase, recently exceeding 30%. About 50% of Crohn patients used biologics before and after surgery, and those patients also underwent a relatively high rate of anal surgeries (44.2%). The mean number of patients who underwent surgery for ulcerative colitis was 247.6 per year. Colorectal surgery accounted for more than half of all operations, and laparoscopic surgery has been increasing rapidly, having been performed in about 60% of patients in recent years. The incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis was very high and increased rapidly during the study period, reaching about 80%. Conclusion: The number of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for IBD in Korea has increased significantly. Biologics are actively used by patients with Crohn disease, with a high proportion of anal surgeries required. Many of the surgical indications for ulcerative colitis have shifted into colorectal cancer. ? 2018 The Korean Society of Coloproctology",Colitis-associated cancer; Crohn disease; Inflammatory bowel disease; Laparoscopy; Ulcerative colitis,adalimumab; infliximab; adolescent; adult; aged; anus surgery; Article; cancer incidence; cancer surgery; child; colon resection; colorectal cancer; colorectal surgery; Crohn disease; female; gastrointestinal surgery; hartmann procedure; hemicolectomy; human; ileocecectomy; ileostomy; intestine surgery; Korea; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; proctocolectomy; rectum abdominoperineal resection; rectum anterior resection; retrospective study; total colon resection; ulcerative colitis; very elderly,2-s2.0-85059639638

However, the responses to CRT range very widely and there is no specific molecular marker definitively proven to be predictive of responses to CRT. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in pretreatment biopsy samples and pathological response to CRT in rectal cancer. Methods: The immunohistochemical expression of three ABC transporters (ABCG2, ABCC2, and ABCC3) and two CSC markers (SOX2 and LGR5) was determined in 76 biopsy specimens from rectal cancer patients who underwent preoperative CRT. The association between protein expression and pathologic tumor regression grade was statistically analyzed. Results: Fifty-eight (76.3%) cases were classified as chemoradio-resistant group and 18 (23.7%) cases as chemoradio-sensitive group and pathological complete remission was found in 8 (10.5%) cases. ABCG2 was frequently expressed in chemoradio-sensitive group (P=0.042), while expression of ABCC2 was found in chemoradio-resistant group (P=0.014). Low expression of ABCC2 was associated with pathologic complete remission (P=0.008). Conclusions: Immunohistochemical expression of ABCC2 and ABCG2 was associated with tumor regression after preoperative CRT in rectal cancer. In particular, ABCC2 was associated with resistance to CRT of rectal cancer. These markers might be used as biomarkers for predicting response against CRT in rectal cancer. ?

However, this method has not been verified in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or in an interventional study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of estimating USE in a prospective low-salt diet education cohort (ESPECIAL). Methods: A new formula was developed on the basis of morning fasting urine samples from 228 CKD patients in the ESPECIAL cohort. This formula was compared to the previous four formulas in the prediction of 24-hour USE after treatment with olmesartan and low-salt diet education. Results: Most previously reported formulas had low predictability of the measured USE based on the ESPECIAL cohort. Only the Tanaka formula showed a small but significant bias (9.8 mEq/day, P < 0.05) with a low correlation (r = 0.34). In contrast, a new formula showed improved bias (-0.1 mEq/day) and correlation (r = 0.569) at baseline. This formula demonstrated no significant bias (-1.2 mEq/day) with the same correlation (r = 0.571) after 8 weeks of treatment with olmesartan. Intensive low-salt diet education elicited a significant decrease in the measured USE. However, none of the formulas predicted this change in the measured urine sodium after diet adjustment. Conclusion: We developed a more reliable formula for estimating the USE in CKD patients. Although estimating USE is applicable in an interventional study, it may be unsuitable for estimating the change of individual sodium intake in a low-salt intervention study. ? 2018 by The Korean Society of Nephrology.",Chronic kidney disease; Low-salt diet; Sodium excretion,creatinine; olmesartan; sodium; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; chronic kidney failure; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; creatinine blood level; education; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; major clinical study; male; monitoring; prediction; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; reliability; sodium restriction; sodium urine level; treatment duration,2-s2.0-85059215906

Hepatic tumors that located immediately beneath the diaphragm are difficult to treat with percutaneous RFA due to poor visualization by percutaneous ultrasonography and the close location of the heart or lung. A transthoracic approach has been proposed to be an alternative for hepatic tumors located beneath the diaphragm that are difficult to access by conventional percutaneous or laparoscopic approaches. There has been no report regarding the anesthetic management of the transthoracic RFA for hepatic tumor. Patient concerns: A 69-year-old female had undergone segmentectomy due to hepatocellular carcinoma 4 years ago. Diagnoses: Newly developed hepatic tumor located in the liver dome and beneath the diaphragm was diagnosed by follow-up imaging study. Interventions: Because the tumor could not be identified by transabdominal ultrasonography (US), transthoracic approach for RFA under one-lung ventilation was planned. General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil via target-controlled infusion system and rocuronium was administered. Orotracheal intubation with double-lumen endotracheal tube was performed and position of the tube in the trachea was confirmed by bronchoscope. The RFA electrode was introduced percutaneously into the right pleural cavity, guided by visualization through the thoracoscope and inserted into the tumor after visualizing the tumor by US. Radiofrequency waves can be successfully administered through the needle. Outcomes: We performed successfully RFA of the hepatic tumor through one-lung ventilation and transthoracic approach. At 5 days postoperatively, she was discharged in a stable condition without any complication. Lessons: Transthoracic RFA can be successfully performed under one-lung ventilation, optimal analgesia, and vigilant monitoring. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s).

Although the majority of spontaneous recoveries occur within 2 weeks, treatment of refractory SSNHL failing conventional therapy is difficult. In particular, it is more difficult to treat children—who have a worse prognosis than adults—with SSNHL refractory to conventional therapy. No studies reported delayed recovery of pediatric SSNHL later than 3 months after onset, or delayed recovery treated with acupuncture. Patient concerns: A 15-year-old girl experienced hearing loss after acquiring a cold. Diagnosis: She did not undergo audiometry and only took medicine for a common cold after diagnosis by an internal medicine doctor. Ninety-three days after onset, she visited an otorhinolaryngology clinic and was diagnosed with SSNHL. Seven rounds of intratympanic steroid (ITS) treatment were performed 93 to 135 days after onset; audiogram at 149 days did not demonstrate improvement. Interventions: Two-hundred sixty-six days after onset, she visited to TKM hospital and was admitted for 21 days and received outpatient treatment for 1 month after discharge. She was treated acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and moxibustion. Outcomes: She experienced improvement in experienced improvement in pure tone average, speech recognition threshold, and word recognition scores after acupuncture treatment. Delayed ITS treatment at 93 to 135 days after onset did not improve the patient’s hearing loss. However, slight recovery was achieved at the conclusion of treatment. Lessons: Acupuncture may be a therapeutic option for individuals who do not experience improvement after the use of steroids or miss early treatment. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s).

Methods and Results-Data for patients with a history of stroke or TIA at enrollment were extracted from the ASCOT (Anglo Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) and the ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial). BPV was defined as the within-subject standard deviation or coefficient of variation of systolic blood pressure across visits from 12 weeks poststroke or TIA onward. BPV was significantly higher in patients with a history of stroke or TIA than those without. BPV was a predictor of recurrent stroke in the pooled analysis. In the ASCOT study, 252 patients (12.3%) had a recurrent stroke among 2046 with a history of stroke. Incidence of recurrent stroke was significantly higher in the highest BPV quartile (17.8%) compared with the lowest quartile (10.5%); by treatment arm, this reached significance for the amlodipine-arm only (high- BPV: 18.7% versus low-BPV: 12.9%; P=0.029). Of the 2173 patients from the ALLHAT with a history of stroke or TIA, patients with the highest quartile of BPV had a higher incidence of recurrent stroke (9.6%) compared with the lowest quartile BPV (5.5%); by treatment arm, this reached significance for the chlorthalidone-arm only (high-BPV: 12.1% versus low-BPV: 5.4%; P=0.007). Conclusions-Visit-to-visit BPV is a predictor of recurrent stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA on antihypertensive treatment. Considering BPV following a stroke may be important to reduce the risk for a recurrent stroke. ? 2018 The Authors and Pfizer.",Blood pressure; Blood pressure variability; Calcium channel blocker; Secondary prevention; Stroke,"amlodipine; atenolol; chlortalidone; lisinopril; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; adult; aged; antihypertensive therapy; Article; blood pressure variability; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; human; hypertension; hypertensive patient; incidence; major clinical study; male; medical history; morbidity; predictive value; predictor variable; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; risk factor; risk reduction; systolic blood pressure; transient ischemic attack; treatment response; blood pressure; cerebrovascular accident; drug effect; hypertension; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; prognosis; recurrent disease; risk assessment; risk factor; secondary prevention; time factor; transient ischemic attack; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Hypolipidemic Agents; Incidence; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Secondary Prevention; Stroke; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85058759351

The effectiveness of Bosinji, one of the herbal medicines used for low back pain and radiating pain in patient with LHIVD, has been reported in several studies; however, little clinical evidence is available owing to the methodological limitations in previous studies. Hence, the present study aims to establish the clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of Bosinji in improving pain, function, and quality of life in LHIVD patients. Method/design: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, and equivalence trial with 2 parallel arms. A total of 74 patients who have low back pain and radiating pain due to LHIVD will be recruited and randomly allocated to the experimental group and control group. The patients in the experimental group and control group will take 2.5g of Bosinji granule (1.523g of Bosinji extract) or Loxonin tablet (60mg of loxoprofen) 3 times a day for 6 weeks. Additionally, both groups will receive the same acupuncture treatment once a week for 6 weeks as a concurrent treatment. Changes in the 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for low back pain after 6 weeks from baseline will be assessed as the primary outcome. Furthermore, the 100-mm VAS for radiating pain, Oswestry disability index (ODI), Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), global perceived effect (GPE), and deficiency syndrome of kidney index (DSKI) will be used to evaluate secondary outcomes. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 10 weeks after screening. For the safety evaluation, laboratory examinations including complete blood count, liver function test, renal function test, blood coagulation test, inflammation test, and urine analysis will be conducted before and after taking the medications. Discussion: The results of this trial will be used to establish clinical evidence regarding the use of Bosinji with acupuncture treatment in the treatment of patients with LHIVD.

This trial is designed to evaluate the impact of muscle relaxation during laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy on the oncological benefits, particularly in obese patients with gastric cancer. Materials and methods: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled multicenter prospective trial. Patients with clinical stage I-II gastric cancer with a body mass index of 25 and over, who undergo laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy will be eligible for trial inclusion. The patients will be randomized into a deep NMB group or a moderate NMB group with a 1:1 ratio. A total of 196 patients (98 per group) are required. The primary endpoint is the number of harvested lymph nodes, which is a critical index of the quality of surgery in gastric cancer treatment. The secondary endpoints are surgeon's surgical condition score, patient's sedation score, and surgical outcomes including peak inspiratory pressure, operation time, postoperative pain, and morbidity. Discussion: This is the first study that compares deep NMB with moderate NMB during laparoscopic gastrectomy in obese patients with gastric cancer.

The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the effort-reward imbalance–short form (ERI-SF) in industrial workers. The Korean version of ERI-SF was tested among 250 blue-collar workers. The reliability, content validity, and construct validity with confirmatory factor analysis, as well as interaction terms were analyzed. Reliability assessed by Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were satisfactory for all three subscales: effort 0.75, reward 0.74, and over-commitment 0.72. Confirmatory factor analysis showed an acceptable model fit with the three component theoretical structure (root mean square error of approximation = 0.07, comparative fit index = 0.84). Content validity was assessed with respect to a measure of perceived health. In addition, a significant synergistic interaction of ERI and over-commitment on job strain was found. In conclusion, the ERI-SF demonstrated good psychometric properties with Korean industrial workers. The ERI-SF is ideal for examining work-related stress in the workplace by occupational health professionals. This shorter version makes it easier to administer and score in the occupational health setting. ? 2018 The Author(s).",effort-reward imbalance; ERI-SF; job strain; reliability and validity,article; blue collar worker; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; content validity; Cronbach alpha coefficient; human; industrial worker; job stress; Korea; occupational health; reward; theoretical study; workplace,2-s2.0-85058627586

Focal adhesion of endometrial tissue to the peritoneum is an indication of incipient endometriosis. In this study, we examined the effect of various cytokines that are known to be involved in the pathology of endometriosis on endometrial cell adhesion. Among the investigated cytokines, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) increased adhesion of endometrial cells to the mesothelium through induction of α2-6 sialylation. The expression levels of β-galactoside α2-6 sialyltransferase (ST6Gal) 1 and ST6Gal2 were increased through activation of TGF-βRI/SMAD2/3 signaling in endometrial cells. In addition, we discovered that terminal sialic acid glycan epitopes of endometrial cells engage with sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-9 expressed on mesothelial cell surfaces. Interestingly, in an in vivo mouse endometriosis model, inhibition of endogenous sialic acid binding by a NeuAcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc injection diminished TGF-β1-induced formation of endometriosis lesions. Based on these results, we suggest that increased sialylation of endometrial cells by TGF-β1 promotes the attachment of endometrium to the peritoneum, encouraging endometriosis outbreaks. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"beta galactosidase; beta galactosidase alpha2 6 sialyltransferase; glycosyltransferase; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; beta-D-galactoside alpha 2-6-sialyltransferase; n acetylneuraminic acid; sialic acid binding immunoglobulin like lectin; sialyltransferase; Smad2 protein; SMAD2 protein, human; Smad3 protein; SMAD3 protein, human; small interfering RNA; transforming growth factor beta1; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell adhesion; controlled study; cytokine production; endometriosis; endometrium cell; female; fluorescence activated cell sorting; fluorescence microscopy; human; human cell; Ishikawa cell line; mesothelium; mouse; nonhuman; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; radioimmunoprecipitation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sialylation; animal; C57BL mouse; disease model; endometriosis; endometrium; epithelium; focal adhesion; genetics; metabolism; pathology; peritoneum; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Endometriosis; Endometrium; Epithelium; Female; Focal Adhesions; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; N-Acetylneuraminic Acid; Peritoneum; RNA, Small Interfering; Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins; Sialyltransferases; Signal Transduction; Smad2 Protein; Smad3 Protein; Transforming Growth Factor beta1",2-s2.0-85058601957

This study aimed to develop specific goals and performance indicators to establish a system to guarantee right to health and access to medical service for PWDs. The first procedure was the establishment of the performance indicators, and the second was the content validity verification of the established performance indicators. To establish the performance indicators, we used the policy indicators of the government to improve the health of the Korean people. The indicators that needed to be newly developed were established based on literature review and expert consultation. Three Delphi surveys were conducted to verify the content validity of the established performance indicators. The content validity index (CVI) was obtained for the importance and possibility of the performance indicators. The indicators using the existing policy indicators are “proportion of public health centers” and “rate of health checkup of PWDs,” and newly developed indicators are “establishment of facilities for PWDs in health care facilities (buildings and personnel)” and “diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in early childhood (average age and awareness).” The final performance indicators consist of a total of six areas, 22 sub-areas, and 40 individual indicators. The final performance indicators in this study can be used as basic data for continuously identifying the health status of PWDs in Korea and establishing the national policy for their health promotion. This study is also expected to serve as a framework to guarantee the right to health and access to medical service for PWDs rather than simply containing declarative content. ? 2018 Lee, Park.

However, some proteins are found to change in abundances during the process of blood collection and storage. In order to account such pre-analytical effects, we performed liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS) on 15 selected proteins in plasma samples prepared by varying storage time and temperature of whole blood prior to plasma isolation. Two cytosolic proteins, profilin-1 (PFN1) and thymosin beta-4 (TMSB4X), were absolutely quantified using 15N-labeled recombinant proteins spiked externally. The other 13 proteins were quantified in a relative way compared with the two reference proteins. Triplicated LC-MRM-MS measurements showed that the median CV of MRM peak areas was 5.7%. The amounts of PFN1 and TMSB4X increased rapidly depending on the storage time between blood collection and plasma preparation. It indicates the leakage of cellular components into the plasma fraction. Relative quantification further revealed that five proteins including PFN1, S10A8, S10A9, S10A11, and TMSB4X showed significant difference (P?&lt;?0.05). We further monitored PFN1 and TMSB4X on 40 samples collected for protein diagnostics under a typical clinical study condition. Compared with the plasma samples prepared within a day, the level of both PFN1 and TMSB4X increased in the plasma samples prepared from the blood collected the day before and kept overnight at 4°C (0.51 to 3.11?μg/mL for PFN1 and 0.98 to 5.36?μg/mL for TMSB4X in average). Our result suggests an effort of assuring plasma quality for accurate protein-based diagnosis or biomarker discovery and validation. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",blood storage; mass spectrometry; multiple reaction monitoring; plasma quality; pre-analytical effect; profilin-1; thymosin beta-4,"Blood; Diagnosis; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Patient monitoring; Plasma confinement; Bio-marker discovery; Cellular components; Cytosolic proteins; Multiple reaction monitoring; pre-analytical effect; Profilin; Relative quantification; thymosin beta-4; Recombinant proteins; actb protein; ca1 protein; cfhr5 protein; f2 protein; fetub protein; glutathione peroxidase 3; hp protein; igha1 protein; pfn1 protein; plasma protein; profilin 1; profilin 1 15 n; radioisotope; s10a11 protein; s10a8 protein; s10a9 protein; saa1 protein; timbetasin; timbetasin n 15; unclassified drug; von Willebrand factor; biological marker; nitrogen; PFN1 protein, human; profilin; recombinant protein; thymosin; thymosin beta(4); Article; blood cell; blood sampling; blood storage; cell isolation; controlled study; human; isotope labeling; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography; multiple reaction monitoring; plasma; priority journal; protein analysis; protein blood level; blood; blood storage; high performance liquid chromatography; plasma; procedures; tandem mass spectrometry; time factor; Biomarkers; Blood Preservation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Humans; Isotope Labeling; Nitrogen Isotopes; Plasma; Profilins; Recombinant Proteins; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Thymosin; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85058069827

RVS has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages in vitro, but whether oral administration of RVS affects the inflammatory response of macrophage needs to be verified. RVS was given orally to mice for ten days. For isolation of macrophages, intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate was performed. For determination of serum inflammatory response, intraperitoneal injection of LPS was applied. RVS stimulated monocyte differentiation in thioglycollate-induced peritonitis by increasing the population of cells expressing CD11b and class A scavenger receptors. These monocyte-derived macrophages showed an increased uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein. When peritoneal macrophages from the RVS group were stimulated with LPS, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 in the supernatant decreased, but the level of IL-12 increased. The surface expression of CD86 was reduced, but surface expression of class II major histocompatibility complex molecules was increased. RVS suppressed the serum levels of LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6. Collectively, RVS promoted monocyte differentiation upon inflammatory insults and conferred selective anti-inflammatory activity without causing overall inhibitory effects on immune cells. ? 2018 by the authors.

This study investigated the clinical characteristics of Korean patients treated with VKA for stroke prevention and assessed quality of VKA therapy and treatment satisfaction. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study. Patients with CHADS 2 ? 1 and treated with VKA (started within the last 3 months) were enrolled from April 2013 to March 2014. Demographic and clinical features including risk factors of stroke and VKA treatment information was collected at baseline. Treatment patterns and international normalized ratio (INR) level were evaluated during follow-up. Time in therapeutic range (TTR) &gt; 60% indicated well-controlled INR. Treatment satisfaction on the VKA use was measured by Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) after 3 months of follow-up. Results: A total of 877 patients (age, 67; male, 60%) were enrolled and followed up for one year. More than half of patients (56%) had CHADS 2 ? 2 and 83.6% had CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ? 2.

We investigated attitudes of the general population and physicians toward prognosis disclosure to children and associated factors in Korea. Methods: Physicians working in one of 13 university hospitals or the National Cancer Center and members of the general public responded to the questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of the age appropriate for informing children about the prognosis and the reason why children should not be informed. This survey was conducted as part of research to identify perceptions of physicians and general public on the end-of-life care in Korea. Results: A total of 928 physicians and 1,241 members of the general public in Korea completed the questionnaire. Whereas 92.7% of physicians said that children should be informed of their incurable illness, only 50.7% of the general population agreed. Physicians were also more likely to think that younger children should know about their poor prognosis compared with the general population. Physicians who opposed incurable illness disclosure suggested that children might not understand the situation, whereas the general public was primarily concerned that disclosure would exacerbate the disease. Physicians who were women or religious were more likely to want to inform children of their poor prognosis. In the general population, gender, education, comorbidity, and caregiver experience were related to attitude toward poor prognosis disclosure to children.

Methods: Consecutive patients referred for a new IBD consultation completed the following self-assessments: the Short Form-12, the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Scale, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, and the PROMIS-29. These measures were scored at the time of appointment check-in by a trained licensed clinical social worker (SW), and those scoring 1.5 standard deviations below the population mean were targeted for SW assessment and intervention at the point of care; patients or providers could also request a SW evaluation even if cutoffs were not met. In this steppedcare model, the SW could refer to same-day on-site psychiatry services or outside interventions and services. In addition, we implemented a 12-month curriculum with a monthly didactic and case-based education seminar for health care providers who interact with patients with IBD. Results: Between February 2014 and May 2015, 110 patients (53% male; mean age, 42 years) completed a self-assessment. All patients completed their self-assessment within 10 minutes. Of these, 36.4% (40/110) were targeted for SW assessment and intervention. The SW interventions were grouped into 4 categories: psychological education and coping tools for symptom management and emotional wellness (n = 30); psychotherapy referrals (n = 30); financial/governmental programs (n = 11); and psychiatry referrals for consultation and/or medication prescription (n = 21). The educational seminars were highly rated by participating providers. Conclusions: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial approach to adult IBD care is feasible. Education for providers and close coordination across specialties are critical to the success of a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial program. ? 2018 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

Patients with stage II-III rectal cancer between 1998 and 2013 were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were estimated in propensity-matched study population according to the use of RT. Among the 28,320 eligible patients, a total of 18,400 patients were identified from propensity score matching process balancing the distribution of prognostic covariates. The 10-year OS and DSS rates were higher in patients with preoperative RT than the postoperative group (51.6% vs. 49.8% with P < 0.001, and 65.4% vs. 64.8% with P = 0.037, respectively). However, in multivariate analysis, selection of combined RT sequence did not affect the survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04 and 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98?1.10 for OS; HR 0.97 and 95% CI 0.90?1.05 for DSS). Regarding hazard rate functions of cancer-specific mortality, the overall time-course risks after preoperative and postoperative RT were comparable. This study provides additional insight into the long-term prognostic implications of the two RT strategies, suggesting that the sequence of RT does not lead to differential survival in stage II-III rectal cancer. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"adult; aged; cancer staging; female; human; male; middle aged; mortality; pathology; procedures; radiotherapy; rectum tumor; survival analysis; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Radiotherapy; Rectal Neoplasms; Survival Analysis; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85056915880

Postoperative therapeutic options such as anticancer adjuvant therapies (AT) based on prognostic prediction models would provide patient-specific treatment to decrease postsurgical morbidity and mortality rates. Relevant prognostic factors in resected GC patient’s serum may improve therapeutic measures in a non-invasive manner. In order to develop a GC prognostic model, we designed a retrospective study. In this study, serum samples were collected from 227 patients at a 4-week recovery period after D2 lymph node dissection, and 103 cancer-related serum proteins were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Using the quantitative values of the serum proteins, we developed SEPROGADIC (SErum PROtein-based GAstric cancer preDICtor) prognostic model consisting of 6 to 14 serum proteins depending on detailed purposes of the model, prognosis prediction and proper AT selection. SEPROGADIC could clearly classify patients with good or bad prognosis at each TNM stage (1b, 2, 3 and 4) and identify a patient subgroup who would benefit from CCRT (combined chemoradiation therapy) rather than CTX (chemotherapy), or vice versa.

We also sought to identify risk factors related to the presence of ELPS. Methods: This retrospective study included 150 patients (216 knees) who were candidates for HTO from an initial screening of 3579 patients (7158 knees). There were 183 female and 33 male knees with a mean age of 58 years. The presence of ELPS was defined as a grade 3 uptake on the SPECT–CT at the lateral PF joint. To determine the risk factors related to the ELPS, multivariate regression analysis was performed with independent demographic and radiographic variables. Results: Increased uptake on the lateral side of the PF joints was detected in 120 knees (56% of total subjects). Of these, 34 (16%) knees presented with a grade 3 uptake, which indicated the presence of ELPS. No single risk factor had significant associations with the presence of ELPS. Conclusions: A considerable number of the knees that were candidates for HTO had ELPS. Nonetheless, we did not find any risk factor related to the presence of ELPS. These results suggest that surgeons should be cautious when diagnosing concomitant ELPS despite acceptable radiographic findings from patellofemoral joints when performing HTO. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excessive lateral pressure syndrome; High tibial osteotomy; Osteoarthritis,"adult; Article; disease classification; excessive lateral pressure syndrome; female; high tibial osteotomy; human; knee disease; knee osteoarthritis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multivariate logistic regression analysis; patellofemoral joint; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography; tibia osteotomy; aged; diagnostic imaging; knee osteoarthritis; osteotomy; prevalence; procedures; risk factor; tibia; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Osteotomy; Patellofemoral Joint; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography; Tibia",2-s2.0-85056197473

Survival analysis was performed to analyze the prospective cohort over time, and the bootstrap method was used to validate our model. We confirmed our findings in an external cohort. A diabetes risk score was calculated and the cut-off defined using a receiver operating characteristic curve.

A risk score was defined with a cut-off of ?5 that maximized sensitivity (72%) and specificity (62%), with an area under the curve of 0.73. Prediabetic subjects with a family history of diabetes had a higher probability of diabetes (risk score = 5) irrespective of other variables; this result was confirmed in the external cohort.

In the present study, the effects of an ethanol extract of A. asphodeloides Bunge (AAB) on osteoporosis and its underlying mechanisms on bone remodeling were investigated. Osteoporosis was induced in ICR strain mice by ovariectomy. The mice were divided into four groups: sham, ovariectomized, 17β-estradiol and 100 mg/kg AAB. The treatment was continued for 4 weeks. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In addition, Raw 264.7 cells were treated in the presence of 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/ml AAB with 100 ng/ml receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) to induce osteoclast formation and stained with tartrate resistant acid phosphatase. In addition, levels of osteoclast-related factors were analyzed to investigate the signaling cascades in osteoclasts. The results demonstrated that AAB treatment reversed the decreases of both BMD and BMC in osteoporotic femurs. Additionally, the formation of osteoclasts was significantly suppressed by the AAB treatment in RANKL-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells. Compared with cells treated with RANKL alone, the AAB-treated osteoclasts had significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. The protein levels of c-fos were also decreased in the AAB-treated osteoclasts. Furthermore, the RANKL-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB was attenuated in osteoclasts by the AAB treatment compared with cells treated with RANKL alone. Finally, AAB treatment downregulated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The present results demonstrated that AAB exhibited ameliorative effects on osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, and suggested that AAB may be a potential candidate for the treatment of osteoporosis. ? 2018 Spandidos Publications.

Recently, GCKR was shown to be related to circulating calcium levels involved in lipid and glycemic controls. Therefore, we hypothesized that GCKR SNPs are associated with major cardiovascular risk factors in the Korean population, and the association is modified by circulating calcium levels. Epidemiological data and GCKR SNPs (rs780093T>C, rs780094 T>C, and rs1260326 T>C) were collected from a subset of Ansung-Ansan cohort in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (n = 7815). Consistent with the results of previous studies, GCKR SNPs were significantly associated with decreased total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increased glucose levels and insulin resistance. Minor C allele carriers, particularly CC homozygotes, had lower serum calcium levels than TT homozygotes for all 3 SNPs. Particularly, the effect of GCKR SNPs on total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting glucose, and insulin resistance was apparent when serum calcium levels were in normal range (8.8-10.1 mg/dL). When serum calcium levels were high (?10.2 mg/dL), CC homozygotes also had significantly lower triglyceride and higher fasting glucose than TT homozygotes. However, the associations were not observed when serum calcium levels were low (<8.8 mg/dL). In conclusion, GCKR SNPs are associated with lipid profiles and glycemic status in the Korean population, and the genetic effect is modified by basal circulating calcium levels, particularly in normal or high ranges. It provides important information for individualized prevention and management of cardiovascular risk associated with GCKR SNPs. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Blood glucose; Calcium; Cardiovascular diseases; Lipids; Polymorphism; Single nucleotide,"calcium; cholesterol; glucokinase; glucose; insulin; lipid; triacylglycerol; calcium; cholesterol; GCKR protein, human; glucokinase; lipid; signal transducing adaptor protein; triacylglycerol; allele; Article; calcium blood level; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; epidemiology; genotype; glucose blood level; glycemic control; homozygote; human; insulin resistance; Korean (people); lipid analysis; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; triacylglycerol blood level; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; cardiovascular disease; female; genetics; male; metabolism; middle aged; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Alleles; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Glucose; Calcium; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol; Female; Genotype; Glucokinase; Homozygote; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Triglycerides",2-s2.0-85054737457

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been reported to reduce hepatic steatosis, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated whether exendin-4 (EX-4), a GLP-1 receptor analogue, improves hepatic steatosis through ER stress reduction. Furthermore, we explored which ER stress pathway is involved in this process, with a focus on the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)-nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. EX-4 treatment reduced hepatic lipid accumulation by suppressing the expression of lipogenic genes and restoring the expression of β-oxidation genes in palmitate-treated HepG2 cells and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In addition, EX-4 treatment suppressed hepatic ER stress activation in HFD-fed mice and tunicamycin-treated mice. In particular, EX-4 treatment restored HFD- and tunicamycin-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation to control levels. Inhibition of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced phosphorylation of PERK and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), as well as other substrates of the PERK pathway. Nrf2 knockdown also inhibited the protective effects of EX-4 against lipid accumulation, ER stress activation, and cell death in palmitate-treated HepG2 cells. EX-4 treatment prevents hepatic steatosis and improves cell survival by regulating hepatic lipid metabolism and reducing ER stress activation, and Nrf2 plays an essential role in the protective effect of GLP-1 on hepatic steatosis. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Endoplasmic reticulum stress; Exendin-4; Glucagon-like peptide-1; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2,"acyl coenzyme A desaturase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; carnitine palmitoyltransferase Ialpha; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1; exendin 4; fatty acid binding protein; fatty acid binding protein 1; fatty acid synthase; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase 1; palmitic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; protein kinase; protein kinase RNA like ER kinase; small interfering RNA; stearoyl CoA desaturase 1; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; transcription factor Nrf2; tunicamycin; unclassified drug; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; NFE2L2 protein, human; transcription factor Nrf2; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell death; cell survival; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum stress; fatty liver; gene expression; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; lipid diet; lipid liver level; lipid storage; male; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; protein phosphorylation; agonists; animal; C57BL mouse; cell line; drug effect; endoplasmic reticulum stress; fatty liver; lipid metabolism; liver; metabolism; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Exenatide; Fatty Liver; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; NF-E2-Related Factor 2",2-s2.0-85053885283

However, its scientific evidences have not been elucidated yet. Here we determined anti-allergic inflammatory effect of MDR and its constituent tannic acid (TA) in activated human mast cell line HMC-1 cells. In activated HMC-1 cells, MDR and TA reduced thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) protein release and mRNA expression without affecting cytotoxicity. MDR and TA blocked activities of caspase-1, nuclear factor-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are intracellular signaling pathways associated with increased TSLP levels in activated HMC-1 cells. Levels of inflammatory cytokines were reduced by MDR and TA on activated HMC-1 cells. Furthermore, MDR and TA reduced the nitric oxide production on activated macrophages. In conclusion, we clarified that MDR has a new anti-allergic inflammatory effect through reducing TSLP. Our results suggest that MDR may be useful in the treatment of allergic inflammatory diseases. Practical applications: A health functional food, MDR has been clinically used for the treatment of arthritis.

Design and setting:: A total of 428 inpatients who received acupuncture treatment underwent two assessments for bleeding-related adverse events, such as micro-bleeding, hematoma, and ecchymosis: 1) immediately after acupuncture treatment on the first day and 2) before acupuncture treatment on the following day. Additional analyses were performed using the number of acupuncture needles as independent variables. Multivariable analysis using factors likely related to bleeding and subgroup analysis according to regions of needle insertion were also performed. Results: A total of 169 patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs (exposure group) and 259 patients not receiving either drug (non-exposure group) were studied. Sixty-five (38.5%) patients in the exposure group and 115 (44.4%) patients in the non-exposure group had bleeding-related mild adverse events. There was no difference in the risk of bleeding-related adverse events between the two groups per sessions (relative risk (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69–1.10) and per needles (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70–1.13). In multivariable analysis, thickness of needle only increased risk of bleeding. Subgroup analysis showed that taking these drugs did not increase the risk of bleeding in any of the regions. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs do not increase the incidence of bleeding-related adverse events after acupuncture treatment. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Acupuncture safety; Adverse event; Anticoagulant; Antiplatelet; Bleeding,acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; cilostazol; clopidogrel; ozagrel; rivaroxaban; sarpogrelate; triflusal; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; acupuncture; adult; adverse event; Article; bleeding; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; controlled study; disease severity; ecchymosis; exposure; female; hematoma; human; incidence; international normalized ratio; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; outcome assessment; prospective study; prothrombin time; risk factor; safety; acupuncture; aged; bleeding; risk; Acupuncture Therapy; Aged; Anticoagulants; Female; Hemorrhage; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Prospective Studies; Risk,2-s2.0-85052993012

Materials and methods: Between January 2014 and December 2015, 223 patients with acute respiratory failure who underwent ECMO in 11 hospitals in South Korea were enrolled retrospectively, and data relating to pneumonia cases were analyzed. Patients were divided into groups according to their pre-treatment body mass index (BMI): obese (BMI ? 25 kg/m2) and non-obese (BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2). The BMI cut-off was adopted from the World Health Organization for Asian populations. Results: In total, 84 patients had pneumonia: obese group, 26; non-obese group, 58 (mean BMI, 27.8 vs. 21.4, p &lt; 0.001). Pre-ECMO parameters and rescue therapy did not differ between the groups. The rate of successful weaning from ECMO was not different between the groups (76.9% vs. 72.4%, p = 0.753), but survival-to-discharge (73.1% vs. 36.2%, p = 0.002) and 6-month survival (69.2% vs. 36.2%, p = 0.005) rates were higher in the obese group. After adjusting for age and the pre-treatment PaO2/FiO2 ratio, low BMI was significantly associated with 6-month mortality (odds ratio 3.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.06–11.03, p = 0.044).

The cobas 4800 HPV test was utilized to detect HPV in the self-samples. Pap smear results revealed three cases of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 649 cases of negative for an intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, and 48 non-specific inflammatory findings. High-risk HPV was detected in 6.7% of urine samples and 9.6% of vaginal self-swab samples. The overall agreement for HPV 16/18 between urine and vaginal self-swab samples was 99.1% (95%CI 98.1% to 99.6%). Colposcopic biopsy revealed one cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 lesion, 12 CIN1 lesions, and 23 normal or chronic cervicitis lesions. In conclusion, urine and vaginal self-swab sampling was feasible and deemed a potential alternative for HPV detection in women who hesitate to participate in cervical cancer screening programs. Meanwhile, due to overall lower rates of abnormal cytology and sexual risk behaviors in Korea, a larger sample size than expected is needed to assess the sensitivity of CIN2+ detection via self-samples. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,adult; early cancer diagnosis; female; human; Human papillomavirus type 16; Human papillomavirus type 18; middle aged; Papanicolaou test; papillomavirus infection; physiology; pilot study; procedures; prospective study; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; South Korea; urine; uterine cervix tumor; vagina; virology; Adult; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Human papillomavirus 16; Human papillomavirus 18; Humans; Middle Aged; Papanicolaou Test; Papillomavirus Infections; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Republic of Korea; Sensitivity and Specificity; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vagina,2-s2.0-85048487237

The angle of lateral bowing and bone mineral density showed significant differences between subtrochanteric and diaphyseal atypical fracture groups. In addition to the use of bisphosphonate, mechanical factors might play important roles in the occurrence of AFFs. Introduction: Although AFF could be divided into subtrochanteric and diaphyseal fracture according to the location of fractures, there is a lack of evidence regarding differences between two fractures and etiology of the occurrence. The aim of study is to determine differences between atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal fracture in Korean population. Methods: Between February 2010 and March 2015, 51 AFFs in 40 patients were included in this study. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. The AFF patients satisfied all the diagnostic criteria of the 2014 revised edition of the ASMBR. To analyze the differences according to the location of fracture, the AFFs were divided into subtrochanteric (n = 16) and diaphyseal (n = 35) fracture groups. The following factors were compared between two groups: patients’ demographics, underlying diseases, laboratory findings (serum-25(OH) VitD3, osteocalcin, c-telopeptide, ALP, Ca, and P), bone mineral density (BMD), duration of bisphosphonate (BP) usage, and lateral bowing of the femur at time of the fracture. Results: All AFFs happened in female patients (mean age, 73.8?years) who have received bisphosphonate treatments except three patients. The mean duration of bisphosphonate usage was 95.3?months. Between the two groups, demographic data (age, height, weight, and BMI), underlying diseases, laboratory findings, hip BMD, and duration of BP treatment were comparable to each other (p > 0.05). However, the subtrochanteric fracture group showed higher FNSBA (femoral neck shaft bowing angle, p < 0.001) and spine BMD (p = 0.014) compared to the diaphyseal fracture group. Conclusions: Angle of lateral bowing (FNSBA) and spine BMD showed significant differences between subtrochanteric and diaphyseal atypical fracture groups. According to our results, femoral bowing and spine BMD may play important roles in the AFF locations. ? 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Atypical femoral fracture; Bisphosphonate; Femoral bowing; Mechanical factor,"alkaline phosphatase; bisphosphonic acid derivative; calcifediol; calcium; carboxy terminal telopeptide; glucocorticoid; osteocalcin; phosphorus; bone density conservation agent; adult; aged; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; bone bowing; bone density; controlled study; demography; diaphyseal atypical femoral fracture; diaphyseal atypical femoral fracture; drug use; female; femoral neck; femur; femur diaphysis; femur fracture; femur subtrochanteric fracture; hip; human; Korean (people); laboratory test; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; mechanical stress; medical record review; multicenter study; patient satisfaction; priority journal; risk factor; serum; very elderly; vitamin blood level; clinical trial; diaphysis; femur fracture; incidence; middle aged; radiography; retrospective study; South Korea; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Density; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diaphyses; Diphosphonates; Female; Femoral Fractures; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Radiography; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85046534947

The present study aimed to evaluate the associations of abnormalities detected on technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans, focusing on the association with VUR of the levels of relative decrease in kidney function and cortical defects after a first febrile UTI in children. Methods: All 171 children underwent ultrasonography, DMSA scan and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). The features of ultrasound and DMSA scans were compared between patients with (n = 48) and without VUR (n = 123). The relative uptake (RU) by each kidney was derived from the absolute value of the differences between the value for RU of radionuclide in the right kidney and that in the left kidney. The extent of cortical defects (ECD) was graded according to the number of compartments that contained cortical defect in both kidneys (right upper/right lower, left upper/left lower). Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to examine the diagnostic value of these parameters of ultrasound and DMSA scans for predicting VUR. Results: The ratio of patients having hydronephrosis on ultrasound or cortical defects on DMSA scan did not differ significantly between VUR and non-VUR groups. However, the absolute values of the RU and the scores for ECD were significantly higher in the VUR group than in the non-VUR group. The area under the curves for these two parameters were higher than those for the presence of hydronephrosis or the presence of cortical defects or both. Conclusion: Decreased relative function and increased extents of cortical defects on DMSA scan may be associated with the presence of VUR. These findings may assist pediatricians to decide whether febrile UTI children need to undergo VCUG. ? 2018",children; DMSA scan; urinary tract infection; vesicoureteral reflux,creatinine; succimer; technetium 99m; radiopharmaceutical agent; succimer tc 99m; Article; child; comparative study; controlled study; creatinine blood level; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; disease duration; drug uptake; echography; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; estimated glomerular filtration rate; febrile urinary tract infection; female; human; isotope labeling; kidney function; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; micturition cystourethrography; prediction; predictive value; preschool child; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; sex ratio; single photon emission computed tomography; urinary tract infection; vesicoureteral reflux; complication; diagnostic imaging; fever; infant; kidney; urinary tract infection; vesicoureteral reflux; Female; Fever; Humans; Infant; Kidney; Male; Radiopharmaceuticals; Technetium Tc 99m Dimercaptosuccinic Acid; Urinary Tract Infections; Vesico-Ureteral Reflux,2-s2.0-85044320962

Cox proportional hazards modeling and Kaplan-Meier analysis were applied to determine the differences between KM and non-KM treated groups. The results shows that KM-treated group had a higher probability of survival than non-KM group patients. No significant difference was observed between the risk of readmission between the treated and non-treated patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a weak effect of KM treatments in the patients with 8 to 28 days of hospital stay for a lower risk of recurrence than in non-treated patients.

We evaluated 3D movement of the maxillary anterior teeth and alveolar bone levels, root length of the central incisors, long axes of the maxillary canines, and occlusal plane changes from CBCT images. Results: After retraction, the central incisors were more significantly intruded and their root apex was more retracted in the AP-group. The long axis of the canine was well maintained in the AP-group. There were no differences in the steepness of occlusal plane and the incidence of alveolar bone loss or of root resorption during en masse retraction with the two retractors.

Although manual therapy is widely used for treatment of neck pain, the body of evidence supporting its effectiveness and safety is not conclusive. The aim of this study is to examine the effect, safety, and cost-effectiveness of Chuna manual therapy, a traditional Korean manual therapy for treatment of various musculoskeletal complaints. Methods/Design: This study is the protocol for a two-armed parallel, assessor-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. A total 108 patients with chronic neck pain (time to onset ? 3 months, numeric rating scale [NRS] of neck pain ? 5) will be recruited at five Korean medicine hospital sites. Participants will be allotted to one of two groups (n = 54, respectively): the Chuna manual therapy group, and the usual care (conventional physical therapy and medication treatment) group. Ten sessions of Chuna manual therapy or usual care will be administered twice a week for five weeks. Since the study design does not permit patient or physician blinding, the outcome assessor and statistician will be blinded. The primary outcome will be the visual analogue scale (VAS) of neck pain at 5 weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes include the VAS of radiating arm pain, NRS of neck pain and radiating arm pain, Vernon-Mior neck disability index (NDI), Northwick Park neck pain questionnaire (NPQ), EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), EQ-VAS, patient global impression of change (PGIC), economic evaluation, adverse effects, and drug consumption. Follow-up outcome assessments will be conducted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization. Discussion: This study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of Chuna manual therapy and usual care on chronic neck pain. Adverse events, and costs and effectiveness (utility) data will be evaluated to assess safety and exploratory cost-effectiveness (economic evaluation). This study aims to provide evidence on the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of Chuna manual therapy. Trial registration: Clinical Research Information Service (CRIS), KCT0002732.

To develop a new probiotic strain for functional food applications, fourteen fecal samples were collected from healthy Koreans and the strain BCBR-583 was newly selected and isolated from a 25-year-old Korean woman’s fecal sample using the selective medium for Bifidobacterium. Subsequent fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) test and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of the strain BCBR-583 confirmed that it belongs to B. longum subsp. longum. The stress resistance tests showed that it has oxygen and heat tolerance activities (5-and 3.9-fold increase for 24 h at 60 and 120 rpm, respectively; 78.61 ± 6.67% survival rate at 45°C for 24 h). In addition, gut environment adaptation tests revealed that this strain may be well-adapted in the gut habitat, with gastric acid/bile salt resistance (85.79 ± 1.53%, survival rate under 6 h treatments of gastric acid and bile salt) and mucin adhesion (73.72 ± 7.36%). Furthermore, additional tests including cholesterol lowering assay showed that it can reduce 86.31 ± 1.85% of cholesterol. Based on these results, B. longum BCBR-583 has various stress resistance for survival during food processing and environmental adaptation activities for dominant survival in the gut, suggesting that it could be a good candidate for fermented food applications as a new probiotic strain. ? 2018 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.",Bifidobacteria; Bile salt resistance; Cholesterol lowering; Mucin adhesion; Probiotics,"cholesterol; mucin; oxygen; probiotic agent; RNA 16S; bile acid; cholesterol; mucin; probiotic agent; RNA 16S; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; bacterium isolation; Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum; controlled study; evolutionary adaptation; fermented product; food processing; gene sequence; heat tolerance; nonhuman; sequence analysis; stomach acid; survival rate; adaptation; adult; Bifidobacterium longum; enzymology; feces; female; fermented product; food control; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbial viability; microbiology; physiology; Adaptation, Biological; Adult; Bifidobacterium longum; Bile Acids and Salts; Cholesterol; Feces; Female; Fermented Foods; Food Microbiology; Gastric Acid; Humans; Microbial Viability; Mucins; Oxygen; Probiotics; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Thermotolerance",2-s2.0-85058872287

While there are a multitude of studies on bone mineral density (BMD) and liver diseases, not many studies have assessed the association between liver enzyme levels and BMD in homogeneous populations. Methods: The current study investigated the association between serum liver enzyme levels and BMD at various sites in Koreans. Out of 21,517 surveyees of the 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010-2012), 7160 participants' data on BMD, serum liver enzymes, and full covariate data were included for cross-sectional analysis. BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine, entire femur, and whole body was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and liver enzymes included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma(γ)-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels. Differences in participant characteristics by BMD and liver enzyme levels were analyzed, and complex sample design regression analysis adjusted for multiple covariates was performed to assess the relationship between liver enzymes and BMD. Results: Negative associations were seen with GGT and BMD at all sites (P ? 0.02), ALT with lumbar spine (P = 0.0013), and AST with lumbar BMD (P = 0.0009). In particular, GGT presented strong negative associations with BMD in postmenopausal women and elder men. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a negative relationship between liver enzyme levels and BMD, and suggests that a significant association exists between osteoporosis/decreased BMD and liver disorders. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Bone density; Cross-sectional studies; Health surveys; Liver function tests; Osteoporosis,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; gamma glutamyltransferase; liver enzyme; adult; aged; Article; body mass; bone density; cross-sectional study; disease association; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; exercise; female; femoral neck; femur; follow up; health survey; human; Korean (people); liver disease; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; medical examination; nutritional assessment; osteoporosis; physical activity; population; postmenopause; bone density; diagnostic imaging; enzymology; liver; middle aged; nutrition; osteoporosis; photon absorptiometry; physiology; procedures; South Korea; young adult; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adult; Aged; Bone Density; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Osteoporosis; Republic of Korea; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85057070205

A few case reports have indicated that acutely developed cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) might cause focal symptoms. This study sought to investigate the incidence and characteristics of symptomatic CMBs in the patients with acute stroke symptoms but without DWI ischemic lesions. Methods: We enrolled the patients with acute stroke symptoms who underwent magnetic resonance imaging including DWI and gradient echo (GRE) sequences within 7 days after symptom onset, at our prospective stroke registry. We then identified patients without DWIpositive ischemic lesions but with CMBs in the relevant brain regions. Results: Between January 2005 and February 2012, we identified 235 DWI-negative transient ischemic attack (n = 221) and stroke (n = 14) patients from 2129 consecutive patients at our registry. In total, 16 patients had CMBs corresponding to the focal symptoms. Among these 16 patients, 12 patients showed a hyperintense rim on DWI around a microbleed suspected to be related to focal symptoms; of the 12 patients, 7 experienced stroke symptoms for more than 24 h. However, the symptoms in the remaining patients (5 patients with the hyperintense rim and 4 patients without the hyperintense rim) improved within 24 h. Conclusion: Symptomatic microbleeds are infrequent but not rare in the patients with acute stroke symptoms. Perihematomal edema around an acute CMB can cause a hyperintense rim on DWI. Our results suggest that a combination of DWI and GRE imaging can help diagnose acute symptomatic CMBs. ? 2018 Heo, Lee, Kwon, Kim, Lee, Bushnell and Chang.",Cerebral microbleeds; Diffusion weighted image; Magnetic resonance image; Stroke; Stroke; Transient ischemic attack,adult; aged; Article; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; disease association; female; gradient echo sequence; human; imaging and display; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prospective study; transient ischemic attack; very elderly,2-s2.0-85057814588

Online 18O-labeling is performed by separately attaching two mHFERs in parallel to a 10-port switching valve with a high-pressure syringe pump and two syringes containing 16O- or 18O-water. 16O-/18O-labeled peptides are formed in this manner and simultaneously analyzed online using nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) without any residual trypsin activity. The usefulness of a parallel mHFER platform (P-mHFER) in 18O-labeling was tested using both cytochrome C and alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein to verify the incorporation level of two 18O atoms into tryptic peptides and to provide a quantitative assessment with varied mixing ratios. Additionally, our 18O-labeling approach was used to study the serum N-glycoproteome from lung cancer patients and controls to evaluate the applicability of lectin-based quantitative N-glycoproteomics. We successfully quantified 76 peptides (from 62 N-glycoproteins). Nineteen of these peptides from lung cancer serum were up-/down-regulated at least 2.5-fold compared to controls. As a result, the P-mHFER-based online 18O-labeling platform presented here can be a simple and reproducible way to allow quantitative proteomic analysis of diverse proteome samples. ? 2018",18O-labeling; Lung cancer; mHFER; N-glycoproteins; Quantitative proteomics,"Body fluids; Diseases; Enzymes; Glycoproteins; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Peptides; Syringes; Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein; Lung Cancer; mHFER; N-Glycoprotein; Nanoflow liquid chromatographies; Quantitative assessments; Quantitative proteomic analysis; Quantitative proteomics; Biological organs; cytochrome c; glycoprotein; lectin; n glycoprotein; orosomucoid; oxygen 18; unclassified drug; glycoprotein; oxygen; Oxygen-18; proteome; trypsin; Article; cancer patient; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; down regulation; electrospray mass spectrometry; human; isotope labeling; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lung cancer; pH; priority journal; protein degradation; proteomics; quantitative analysis; reaction temperature; tandem mass spectrometry; upregulation; bioreactor; chemistry; equipment design; lung tumor; metabolism; reversed phase liquid chromatography; statistical model; Bioreactors; Chromatography, Reverse-Phase; Equipment Design; Glycoproteins; Humans; Linear Models; Lung Neoplasms; Oxygen Isotopes; Proteome; Trypsin",2-s2.0-85054169582

However, the apoptosis-inducing of KSK05104 and its underlying mechanism have not yet been elucidated in human colon cancer cells. We show that KSK05104 triggered apoptosis, as indicated by externalization of Annexin V-targeted phosphatidylserine residues in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. KSK05104 induced the activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3, and the cleavage of poly (ADP ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). KSK05104-induced apoptosis was significantly suppressed by pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk (a broad caspase inhibitor). KSK05104 also induced release of cytochrome c (Cyt c), apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), and endonuclease G (Endo G) by damaging mitochondria, resulting in caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic cell death. KSK05104 triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and changed the intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i). Interestingly, treatment with KSK05104 activated not only ER stress marker proteins including inositol-requiring enzyme 1-alpha (IRE-1α) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), but also ?-calpain, and caspase-12 in a time-dependent manner. KSK05104-induced apoptosis substantially decreased in the presence of BAPTA/AM (an intracellular calcium chelator). Taken together, these results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress contribute to KSK05104-induced apoptosis in human colon cancer cells. ? 2018 by the authors.",Apoptosis; Calcium; Colon cancer; ER stress; Mitochondria; Rhodanine derivative,"antineoplastic agent; calcium; rhodanine; apoptosis; chemistry; colon tumor; drug effect; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; HCT 116 cell line; HT-29 cell line; human; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Calcium; Cell Line, Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; HCT116 Cells; HT29 Cells; Humans; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mitochondria; Rhodanine",2-s2.0-85056433692

Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging is an innovative optical technology that enables the precise discrimination of structural changes on the mucosal surface. Several studies have demonstrated its usefulness and superiority for tumor detection and differential diagnosis in the stomach as compared with conventional endoscopy. Furthermore, magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging has the potential to predict the invasion depth and tumor margins during gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection. Classifications of the findings of magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging based on microvascular and pit patterns have been proposed and have shown excellent correlations with invasion depth confirmed by microscopy. In terms of tumor margin prediction, magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging offers superior delineation of gastric tumor margins compared with traditional chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine. The limitations of narrow-band imaging, such as the need for considerable training, long procedure time, and lack of studies about its usefulness in undifferentiated cancer, should be resolved to confirm its value as a complementary method to endoscopic submucosal dissection. However, the role of magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging is expected to increase steadily with the increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection for the treatment of gastric tumors. ? 2018 Korean Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",Application; Delineation; Magnifying endoscopy; Narrow band imaging; Stomach,,2-s2.0-85057627067

The patient target doses were calculated from the transit dose, which was measured using a glass dosimeter positioned 150 cm from the source. The accuracy of the transit dose algorithm was evaluated using a solid water phantom for five patient treatment plans. We performed transit dose-based patient dose verification during the actual treatment of 34 patients who underwent 3D-CRT. These included 17 patients with breast cancer, 11 with pelvic cancer, and 6 with other cancers. In the solid water phantom study, the difference between the transit dosimetry algorithm with the treatment planning system (TPS) and the measurement was ?0.10 ± 1.93%. In the clinical study, this difference was 0.94 ± 4.13% for the patients with 17 breast cancers, ?0.11 ± 3.50% for the eight with rectal cancer, 0.51 ± 5.10% for the four with bone cancer, and 0.91 ± 3.69% for the other five. These results suggest that transit-dosimetry-based in-room patient dose verification is a useful application for 3D-CRT.

With anti-VEGF-based treatments for wet AMD requiring frequent injections, it is often burdensome to both patients and healthcare providers. To explore its possibility as a desirable alternative, we investigated the therapeutic potential of a recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 expressing a soluble variant of VEGF receptor-1 (rAAV2-sVEGFRv-1) in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model, as CNV is a defining feature of AMD progression. METHODS. C57/B6 mice were intravitreally administered with rAAV2-sVEGFRv-1, rAAV2-GFP, or clinically used bevacizumab after CNV lesions were induced via laser photocoagulation. Immunostaining was performed with phalloidin and CD31 to measure CNV extensiveness, F4/80 and CD11b for inflammatory cell infiltration, and pan-cytokeratin to visualize fibrotic progression. RESULTS. rAAV2-sVEGFRv-1 (5.0 × 10 7 viral genomes) possesses antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties. rAAV2-sVEGFRv-1 was demonstrated to significantly decrease retinal CNV lesion size (1336 ± 186) when compared to rAAV2-GFP-treated (2949 ± 437, P = 0.0043), mock-treated (3075 ± 265, P = 0.0013), and bevacizumab-treated models (995 ± 234). Infiltration by inflammatory cells significantly decreased with rAAV2-sVEGFRv-1 administration, while groups treated with rAAV2-GFP did not. Additionally, antiapoptotic activity was observed via TUNEL assay in rAAV2-sVEGFRv-1 (16.0 ± 3.6) and rAAV2-GFP (46.0 ± 7.5, P = 0.003). Overall, the rAAV2-sVEGFRv-1 viral vector was positively comparable to bevacizumab, indicating it as effective as approved therapeutics. CONCLUSIONS. The ability of a low dose of rAAV2-sVEGFRv-1 to exert a therapeutically relevant anti-VEGF effect in a CNV model is demonstrated, and strongly suggests gene therapy as an effective and convenient treatment for sustained VEGF suppression. ? 2018 The Authors.",Choroidal neovascularization; Recombinant adeno-associated virus; Soluble VEGF receptor 1; Vascular endothelial growth factor; Wet age-related macular degeneration,"adeno associated virus vector; bevacizumab; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; vasculotropin antibody; vasculotropin receptor 1; vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin receptor 1; Adeno associated virus 2; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiangiogenic activity; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell infiltration; cell migration; cell proliferation; chorioretinopathy; controlled study; DNA fragmentation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene expression; genetic transfection; human; human cell; immunoglobulin domain; immunohistochemistry; laser coagulation; laser-induced choroidal neovascularization; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; subretinal neovascularization; TUNEL assay; Western blotting; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; C57BL mouse; disease model; gene therapy; gene vector; genetics; intravitreal drug administration; metabolism; Parvovirinae; subretinal neovascularization; Animals; Blotting, Western; Choroidal Neovascularization; Disease Models, Animal; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; Immunohistochemistry; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Intravitreal Injections; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Parvovirinae; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1",2-s2.0-85056697183

However, there is no information regarding the effect of prophylactic palonosetron and sugammadex on PONV in patients undergoing MVD under propofol-maintained anesthesia. Medical records of 274 adults who had undergone MVD under propofol-maintained anesthesia were reviewed. Patients were classified into 4 groups, based on the reversal agent used (sugammadex/pyridostigmine) and whether or not prophylactic palonosetron was used. The PONV incidence and risk factors were analyzed according to the use of these agents. The overall incidence of PONV was 30.7% during the first 24hours postoperatively. The incidence of PONV was lower in the group using combination of prophylactic palonosetron and sugammadex (19.3%) compared with the group not using both agents (37.2%). The combined use of the prophylactic palonosetron and sugammadex was identified as a factor affecting the occurrence of PONV in both univariable (OR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.21-0.77, P=.006) and multivariable (OR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.20-0.75, P=.005) logistic regression analyses. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, female sex was also significant independent risk factor in PONV (OR=2.62, 95% CI: 1.35-5.08, P=.004). In this retrospective observational study, the combined use of prophylactic palonosetron before anesthetic induction and sugammadex as a reversal of neuromuscular blockade are associated with a reduction in the incidence of PONV in patients undergoing MVD under propofol-maintained anesthesia. ? 2018 the Author(s).

One-third of patients with ACS present atypically, which can influence their receiving timely lifesaving therapy. Methods: A total of 617 NSTEMI patients from the Korea Acute MI Registry (KAMIR) and the Korea Working Group on MI (KorMI) databases were analyzed. The study population was divided into two groups by symptoms at presentation (typical symptoms group, 128; atypical symptoms groups, 128). Results: In this study population, 23% of patients presented without chest pain. After propensity score matching, the contact-to-device time (2,618 ± 381 minutes vs. 1,739 ± 241 minutes, p = 0.050), the symptoms-to-balloon time (3, 426 ± 389 minutes vs. 2,366 ± 255 minutes, p = 0.024), and the door-to-balloon time (2,339 ± 380 minutes vs. 1,544 ± 244 minutes, p = 0.002) were signif icantly higher in the patients with atypical symptoms than in those with typical symptoms, respectively. Atypical symptoms were an independent predictor for 1-year mortality (hazard ratio, 2.820; 95% confidence interval, 1.058 to 7.515; p = 0.038). The Kaplan-Meier estimates showed higher risk for 12-month mortality in patients with atypical symptoms (p = 0.048) and no significant difference for 12-month major adverse cardiac events (p = 0.487). Conclusions: Acute myocardial infarction patients with atypical symptoms were not rare in clinical practice and showed a high risk of delayed reperfusion therapy. After imbalance between the groups was minimized by use of propensity score matching, patients who presented atypically had a high mortality rate. ? 2018, Korean Association of Internal Medicine.

We would like to report a rare case of isolated neurogenic blepharoptosis secondary to eyelid trauma with spontaneous recovery occurring within 4 weeks. Patient concerns: A previously healthy 47-year-old man presented with blepharoptosis in the right eye after eyelid trauma. Diagnosis: At presentation, visual acuity in both eyes was 20/20, and intraocular pressure was within the normal limits. Physical examination showed unilateral ptosis; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hematoma in the right frontal sinus. No intracranial lesions were observed and the pupillary reactions were normal. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable with full ocular motility. He was diagnosed with an isolated neurogenic blepharoptosis. Intervention and outcomes: He was managed conservatively without any specific treatment. Four weeks later, the patient had normal, symmetric lid height, and levator function was completely restored. Lessons: Isolated neurogenic blepharoptosis can be caused by blunt trauma, which might cause injury to the terminal branch of the oculomotor nerve. In this case, no special treatment was required, and complete resolution was achieved within 4 weeks.

To address this, we assessed the 6-month statin adherence using 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Of 991 patients, 65.6% were adherent to statin at 6-month after discharge. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that patients' awareness of hyperlipidemia (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.07-2.43), large artery stroke subtype (versus non-large artery stroke, OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.19-2.68), and alcohol drinking habits (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.06-2.53) were positively associated, while high statin dose (versus low dose, OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.40-0.90) and higher daily number of medication pills (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88-0.97) were found to have a negative association with self-reported good adherence to statin medication after acute ischemic stroke. However, stroke severity and diagnosis of hyperlipidemia were not associated with adherence. These results suggest that educational and motivational interventions may enhance statin adherence because modifiable factors were associated with statin adherence. ? 2018 2018 S.

The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea has also shown super-spreading events with a significantly high level of heterogeneity in generating secondary cases. It becomes critical to understand the mechanism for this high level of heterogeneity to develop effective intervention strategies and preventive plans for future emerging infectious diseases. In this regard, agent-based modeling is a useful tool for incorporating individual heterogeneity into the epidemic model. In the present work, a stochastic agent-based framework is developed in order to understand the underlying mechanism of heterogeneity. Clinical (i.e., an infectivity level) and social or environmental (i.e., a contact level) heterogeneity are modeled. These factors are incorporated in the transmission rate functions under assumptions that super-spreaders have stronger transmission and/or higher links. Our agent-based model has employed real MERS-CoV epidemic features based on the 2015 MERS-CoV epidemiological data. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out under various epidemic scenarios. Our findings highlight the roles of super-spreaders in a high level of heterogeneity, underscoring that the number of contacts combined with a higher level of infectivity are the most critical factors for substantial heterogeneity in generating secondary cases of the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission. ? 2018 by the authors.

Purpose: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic performance of DWI for differentiating benign and malignant GB lesions. Study Type: Meta-analysis. Population: Patients with GB lesions. Field Strength/Sequence: DWI at 3.0T or 1.5T. Assessment: PubMed and EMBASE were searched following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy guidelines. Statistical Tests: Bivariate modeling and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) modeling were performed to compare the overall diagnostic performance of DWI. Subgroup analyses were performed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the DWI. Meta-regression analyses were performed according to the characteristics of the patients, study, and MRI. Results: Eight studies (including 557 patients) were included. The DWI exhibited a pooled sensitivity of 91%, a pooled specificity of 87%, and HSROC of 0.95. In subgroup analyses, qualitative assessment (sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 87%; HSROC, 0.94) was more accurate than quantitative assessment (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 86 %; HSROC, 0.88). On meta-regression analysis, studies that used 3.0T field strength and thinner slices (?5 mm) reported a significantly higher sensitivity (P ? 0.02) than those using only 1.5T field strength and thicker slices (>5 mm). Data Conclusion: DWI can discriminate malignant from benign GB lesions with excellent diagnostic performance in both qualitative and quantitative assessments.

Design: The group of subjects consisted of 1800 hospital practitioners and 73 quarantined patients undergoing hemodialysis. The Impact of Events Scale–Revised (IES-R) was administered to the practitioners twice, once during the hospital shutdown and again one month after the shutdown. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to patients undergoing hemodialysis. Results: During the initial stages of the MERS outbreak, healthcare workers who performed MERS-related tasks scored significantly higher on the total IES-R and its subscales. In the second assessment of the high-risk group, the sleep and numbness subscale scores from the IES-R differed depending on the implementation of home quarantine, and the intrusion subscale scores differed depending on the performance of MERS-related tasks. Conclusion: Medical staff that performed MERS-related tasks showed the highest risk for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms even after time had elapsed. The risk increased even after home quarantine.

Method: A convenience sample of 369 family caregivers (151 males, 218 females) aged 20?years or older was recruited from 10 cities in the southern area of South Korea. Data were collected from November–December 2011. Measures of caregiver burden, perceived health status and emotional distress of caregivers related to the memory-behaviour problems of the care recipient were used to assess the outcomes of family caregivers of older adults with dementia. Results: The amount of caregiving tasks has a moderating effect on the relationships between caregivers’ characteristics (such as living with the recipient and duration of caregiving) and the caregiver burden. The interaction between the amount of caregiving tasks and status of living with recipient was significant in relation to the emotional distress of caregivers related to the memory-behaviour problems of the care recipient with dementia; however, there was no effect of the amount of caregiving tasks on the relationships between caregivers’ characteristics and perceived health status. Conclusion: The amount of caregiving tasks can have a moderating role in the caregiving stress model.

However, the link between race and plaque characteristics in patients with coronary artery disease remains largely unexplored. Thus, we aimed to investigate the detailed culprit plaque characteristics between East Asian and White patients using optical coherence tomography. Patients and methods A total of 101 East Asians were matched to 101 White patients. Matching parameters included age, sex, clinical presentation, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and lesion location. Results There were no differences in underlying pathology (rupture vs. erosion) of acute coronary syndrome (P=0.935). Lesion length was longer (18.0± 6.0 vs. 14.6± 5.4 mm; P<0.002), lipid length was greater (9.4± 4.6 vs. 7.2 ± 3.8 mm; P<0.023), lipid index was higher (1635 ±987 vs. 1104± 730; P=0.002), and mean reference area was larger (8.1 ±3.0 vs. 6.5± 2.4 mm2; P<0.021) in White patients compared with East Asian patients.

Several inhibitors of Aurora kinase have been developed as anti-cancer therapeutics. Here, we examined the effects of a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor, AMG900, against glioblastoma cells. AMG900 inhibited proliferation of A172, U-87MG, and U-118MG glioblastoma cells by upregulating p53 and p21 and subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and senescence. Abnormal cell cycle progression was triggered by dysregulated mitosis. Mitosis was prolonged due to a defect in mitotic spindle assembly. Despite the presence of an unattached kinetochore, BubR1, a component of the spindle assembly checkpoint, was not recruited. In addition, Aurora B was not recruited to central spindle at anaphase. Abnormal mitotic progression resulted in accumulation of multinuclei and micronuclei, a type of chromosome missegregation, and ultimately inhibited cell survival. Therefore, the data suggest that AMG900-mediated inhibition of Aurora kinase is a potential anti-cancer therapy for glioblastoma. ? 2018 The Authors.

However, NGE has not been widely investigated, and its efficacy and safety remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, histological analysis, blood analysis, reverse transcription-semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to verify the inhibitory effect of NGE on atopic dermatitis (AD) in BALB/c mice and on inflammatory effects in HMC-1 human mast cells. NGE suppressed the development of AD in mice, and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells, mast cells and CD4+ T cells into AD skin lesions. NGE also decreased leukocyte levels induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). NGE alleviated AD-like inflammatory symptoms in mice by suppressing the production of CD4+ T cells. NGE downregulated the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by DNCB. It also decreased the serum immunoglobulin E concentration and inflammatory cytokine levels in DNCB-treated BALB/c mice. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that NGE reduced the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate + ionomycin-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6 in HMC-1 cells. Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that NGE suppressed the progression of DNCB-induced AD in BALB/c mice and reduced inflammatory effects in HMC-1 cells. This suggests that NGE may be a useful drug for the treatment of AD. ? 2018 Spandidos Publications.

We sought to determine the clinical variables associated with conversion from prediabetes to normal glucose tolerance, with a focus on insulin secretory capacity, insulin sensitivity and body composition. Methods: We followed 1731 people with prediabetes at baseline from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study every 2?years for 10?years. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed, and muscle and fat mass were estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results: During 10?years of follow-up, 36% (623/1731) of people with prediabetes converted to normal glucose tolerance. Higher baseline fasting glucose, 2-h OGTT glucose and triglyceride levels were inversely associated with this conversion. Higher 60-min insulinogenic index (IGI60) at baseline was independently associated with this conversion [HR per sd (95% CI) 1.09 (1.02–1.17); P?=?0.01].

Thus, suicidal ideation serves to identify which groups are at more risk of suicide and has policy implications for targeting groups to prevent suicide. Aims: A substantial body of research has addressed potential determinants of suicide ideation in Korea. Little attention has been paid, however, to analyzing the extent to which socioeconomic attainments (education, household income, and employment status) are associated with risk of suicidal ideation, drawing on nationally representative data. Methods: Data were drawn from the 2012 Korea Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS). Among the 12,606 respondents, the findings are based on 1,500 young adults (age 18–35) and 3,469 middle-aged adults (age 36–55) who answered a question about suicidal ideation. Results: For young adults, respondents from 2-year and 4-year colleges and higher had lower probabilities of suicidal ideation compared with respondents from high school. People out of the labor force also exhibited an elevated risk of suicidal ideation compared with those in waged employment. Middle-aged adults displayed different patterns. Middle-aged respondents from 4-year colleges or higher had an increased likelihood of suicidal ideation. The likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation was predicted to decrease as household income increased only for middle-aged adults. Conclusions: The information about suicidal ideation was obtained from only one question of self-response, which limits the validity of the suicidal ideation measurement. The cross-sectional setting of the data prevents us from estimating causal relationships. Nevertheless, the findings imply that age-specific policy should be implemented to ameliorate differential risk for suicidal ideation and benefit public mental health in the long run. ?

Methods: Between 2010 and 2015, 79 patients who underwent COL with IONM recording were studied. Changes in motor evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials over an alarm criterion were defined as IONM change. Patients with IONM change were assigned to the alarm group, and the others were classified as the control group. Baseline data and radiographic measurements were compared between the 2 groups. Radiologic parameters including maximal compression level (MCL), area and diameter of the spinal canal and ventral compressive lesion, stenosis grade, and occupying ratio of area (ORA) and length at the MCL were measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Thirteen patients were assigned to the alarm group and 66 patients were assigned to the control group. Multivariate analysis identified ORA at the MCL (odds ratio, 1.520; 95% confidence interval, 1.192–1.37; P = 0.001) as an independent risk factor for IONM change. Immediately after decompression, the IONM change occurred. One of 4 patients who did not fully recover from the IONM change had postoperative motor deficits. Conclusions: IONM change during COL occurred immediately after decompression, and a risk factor of IONM change was ORA at the MCL.

Evidence is accumulating that glabridin, a flavonoid extracted from licorice, has beneficial effects on the regulation of glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated whether glabridin suppresses TCDD-induced loss of adipogenic action using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell culture model of wasting syndrome. Glabridin effectively suppressed TCDD-induced loss of lipid accumulation in this model. Pretreating cells with glabridin increased the gene expression of not only the adipogenesis-associated key transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, but also lipoprotein lipase in the presence of TCDD. TCDD decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which was effectively restored by pretreatment with glabridin. Glabridin also inhibited the TCDD-driven decreased production of insulin receptor substrate 1 and glucose transporter 4. TCDD increased the production of mitochondrial superoxides, prostaglandin E2, phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase-1 and intracellular calcium concentrations, while reducing the production of PPARγ coactivator 1 alpha and glycolysis. However, glabridin treatment reduced these TCDD-induced effects. We conclude that glabridin suppresses the TCDD-induced loss of lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by regulating the levels of PPARγ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, lipoprotein lipase, glucose uptake, prostaglandin E2 and energy metabolism. These results also provide in vitro evidence of the effects of glabridin on adipocyte metabolism, which suggests a protective effect against dioxin exposure in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; 3T3-L1 adipocyte; differentiation; glabridin; prostaglandin E2","2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; complementary DNA; cyclooxygenase 1; glabridin; glucose transporter 4; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; insulin; insulin receptor substrate 1; lactate dehydrogenase; lipoprotein lipase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; phospholipase A2; prostaglandin E2; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; superoxide; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; glabridin; isoflavone derivative; phenol derivative; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; adipogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antidiabetic activity; Article; calcium cell level; cell culture; clinical assessment; clinical effectiveness; concentration process; controlled study; energy metabolism; gene expression; glucose homeostasis; glucose transport; glycolysis; in vitro study; insulin signaling; lipid storage; nonhuman; priority journal; wasting syndrome; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipogenesis; animal; cell culture technique; cell survival; dose response; drug effect; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mouse; pollutant; toxicity; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Pollutants; Gene Expression; Isoflavones; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Phenols; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins",2-s2.0-85051029562

Aim of the study: To demonstrate the effects of DGSS on a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) for providing scientific evidence in clinical use. Materials and methods: TBI was induced in a mouse model using the controlled cortical impact method. Water extract of DGSS (50, 150, and 450 mg/kg) was administered twice a day for 8 d. Histological analyses were performed 8 d after TBI. Moreover, beam-walking, grip-strength, and novel object recognition (NOR) tests were conducted to evaluate the effects on motor function, muscle strength, and cognitive memory function, respectively. Result: DGSS inhibited body weight loss, hippocampal damage, and neuronal loss in the thalamic region. Furthermore, it reduced transverse time and foot faults in the beam-walking test at 3 d and increased the muscle strength in the grip-strength test at 3 and 8 d. It also improved the recognition index (%) in the NOR test. However, DGSS did not show protective effects against total damage. Conclusions: DGSS might improve sensory–motor and cognitive functions after TBI with partial protective effects against brain damage. The present findings provide a scientific basis for the clinical use of DGSS in TBI. ? 2018",Cognitive function; Controlled cortical impact; Dangguisusan; Sensory-motor function; Traumatic brain injury,"dangguisusan; neuroprotective agent; unclassified drug; neuroprotective agent; animal experiment; animal model; Article; beam walking test; body weight loss; cell death; controlled study; drug efficacy; experimental locomotor activity test; grip strength test; hippocampus; histology; Korean medicine; male; memory; motor performance; mouse; muscle strength; nerve cell; neuroprotection; nonhuman; novel object recognition test; parietal cortex; prescription; recognition index; traumatic brain injury; animal; animal behavior; disease model; drug effect; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; traumatic brain injury; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Disease Models, Animal; Hippocampus; Male; Mice, Inbred ICR; Neurons; Neuroprotective Agents",2-s2.0-85049990811

After obesity was induced by 20 weeks of 60% HFD feeding, treadmill exercise was performed for 12 weeks. Exercise ameliorated the obesity-induced increase in extramyocyte space and a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the skeletal muscle. In addition, it protected against increases in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in obese skeletal muscles. These results suggest that exercise as a protective intervention plays an important role in regulating skeletal muscle structure and apoptosis in obese skeletal muscles. ? 2018 by the authors.

The optimum conditions for a single-channel microchip were as follows: 4 kV for 0–9.5 s, 1.5 kV for 9.5–15.5 s, and 4 kV for 15.5–30 s. Next, these conditions were applied to another microchip that was constructed with many channels making possible simultaneous parallel detection. Finally, GST genes extracted from human blood were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were introduced into the multi-channel microchip. Target DNA molecules amplified by only 10 PCR cycles could be detected by the VP-based multi-channel ME method, but not by slab gel electrophoresis (SGE). In addition, the migration time for ME was <15 s, which was 700 times faster than conventional SGE.

Methods: Thirty-two patients with TS who underwent GKRS between January 1994 and January 2013 with at least 2?years of follow-up were enrolled in the study. Clinical charts and surgical records were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate factors affecting TCR and symptomatic outcomes. The median patient age was 57.5?years (max = 81, interquartile range [IQR] = 51–67), and the median tumor volume was 3.55?cm3 (max = 25.2?cm3, IQR = 2.0–6.2?cm3). The median marginal and maximum doses were 13.0?Gy (max = 18.0?Gy, IQR = 12.5–15?Gy) and 23.8?Gy (max = 35?Gy, IQR = 21.7–25.0?Gy), respectively. Results: At a median follow-up of 90.5?months (max = 281?months, IQR = 49–139.75?months), the actuarial 3-, 5-, and 10-year TCR were 93.8, 86.2, and 80.8%, respectively. Our data and multivariate analysis indicated that the target volume was the only significant factor determining TCR and that larger tumors (&gt; 5?cm3) were more likely to progress (p = 0.011). Cystic tumors had a higher incidence of transient enlargement and temporary symptom change compared to those in solid tumors. An unfavorable outcome of symptoms was observed in five patients (15.6%). Complications were observed in two patients (6.25%), including hydrocephalus and radio-induced trigeminal neuropathy, respectively. Conclusions: GKRS can be a safe and effective treatment modality for TS with long-term follow-up, especially for small tumors.

Although traditional old book stated its effects on body, there is no scientific evidence yet. Therefore, in the present study, we tested AGS on brain functions. Aim of this study: In this study, we tried to uncover the effect of on brain functions. To do this we examined the action of AGS on the hippocampal synaptic function and memory in mice. Materials and methods: To examine the effect of AGS on synaptic plasticity, we observed input-output curves (I/O curve), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and long-term potentiation (LTP) using mouse hippocampal slices. Moreover, to investigate the functional relevance of the effect of AGS on synaptic plasticity, we conducted passive avoidance, Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. To examine relevant mechanism, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and acetylcholine (ACh) level assay were also conducted. Results: In the basal synaptic transmission study, we found that AGS did not affect I/O curves and PPF. However, AGS facilitated hippocampal LTP in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, AGS blocked AChE activity (IC50 = 485 μg/ml). Moreover, ACh level was increased by AGS (100 μg/ml) treatment. Along with this, facilitating effect of AGS on hippocampal LTP also blocked by scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist.

Conclusions: These results suggest that AGS facilitates hippocampal LTP through activating cholinergic system and ameliorates cholinergic dysfunction-induced memory deficit. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Acetylcholine; Aubang Gahl Soo; Learning and memory; Long-term potentiation,"acetylcholine; acetylcholinesterase; cholinergic receptor stimulating agent; donepezil; herbaceous agent; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; scopolamine; acetylcholine; acetylcholinesterase; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; neuroprotective agent; scopolamine bromide; Amomum; animal experiment; animal model; Article; aubang gahl soo; beverage; brain function; cholinergic system; Cinnamomum cassia; clove; controlled study; enzyme activity; excitatory postsynaptic potential; facilitation; hippocampal slice; hippocampus; latent period; long term potentiation; male; maze test; memory; memory disorder; Morris water maze test; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; passive avoidance; passive avoidance test; satsuma; synaptic transmission; animal; avoidance behavior; chemically induced; drug effect; hippocampus; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; physiology; Acetylcholine; Acetylcholinesterase; Animals; Avoidance Learning; Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; Hippocampus; Long-Term Potentiation; Male; Maze Learning; Memory Disorders; Mice, Inbred ICR; Muscarinic Antagonists; Neuroprotective Agents; Scopolamine Hydrobromide",2-s2.0-85047778600

In this study, we explored the association between BDNF gene polymorphisms and FM susceptibility and the severity of symptoms. Methods: In total, 409 patients with FM and 423 healthy controls in 10 medical centers were enrolled from the Korean nationwide FM survey. The alleles and genotypes at 10 positions in the BDNF gene were genotyped. Results: The allele and genotype frequencies of BDNF rs11030104 differed significantly between the patients with FM and the controls (P = 0.031). The GG genotype of rs11030104 had a protective effect against FM (P = 0.016), and the G allele of rs11030104 was negatively associated with the presence of FM compared with the A allele (P = 0.013). In comparison, although the allele and genotype frequencies of BDNF rs12273539 did not differ between the two groups, the TT genotype of BDNF rs12273539 was associated with susceptibility to FM (P = 0.038). Haplotype analyses implied that some BDNF haplotypes have a protective effect against FM. Finally, several genotypes and haplotypes of the BDNF gene contributed to specific symptoms of FM. Conclusions: This study is the first to evaluate the associations between BDNF gene polymorphisms and FM. Our results imply that some BDNF single-nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes are associated with susceptibility to, and contribute to the symptoms of, FM. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Fibromyalgia; Genetics; Polymorphism,"BDNF protein, human; brain derived neurotrophic factor; adult; clinical trial; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; female; fibromyalgia; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; male; middle aged; multicenter study; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; South Korea; Adult; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fibromyalgia; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Republic of Korea",2-s2.0-85054411595

Lifestyle intervention and oral contraceptives are the first-line treatments for PCOS. Recent studies have suggested that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and mind-body therapy have the potential to alleviate the symptoms and/or pathology of PCOS and to improve the quality of life of women with PCOS. This metaanalysis aimed to quantitatively summarize the efficacy and safety of moxibustion combined with oriental herbal medicine (OHM), common CAM therapies, for treating PCOS. Methods: Four databases were searched from their inception to June 22, 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs using both OHM and moxibustion as experimental intervention, and western medication (WM) as control intervention were included. Studies involving OHM plus moxibustion combined with WM as the experimental intervention were also included. The quality of included studies was assessed using risk of bias tool. Results: Owing to the heterogeneity of reporting, meta-analysis was only performed for pregnancy rate, rate of normal biphasic basal body temperature (BBT), and total effective rate (TER). The results showed that compared to the WM group, the OHM combined with moxibustion group was associated with significantly higher pregnancy rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-2.47; I2 = 0%), normal biphasic BBT rate (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.34-2.05; I2 = 0%), and TER (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.31; I2 = 0%). When OHM combined with moxibustion was used as an adjunctive therapy to WM, pregnancy rate (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29-2.11; I2 = 0%), and TER (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.61; I2 = 43%) were significantly higher than those of the WM group. Conclusion: According to current evidence, OHM combined with moxibustion might be beneficial for treating PCOS. Moreover, the treatment might improve the therapeutic effects of conventional WMs including clomiphene citrate, oral contraceptives, and/or metformin. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution, owing to poor methodological quality of the included studies. Further larger, high-quality, rigorous RCTs should be conducted in this regard.

However, disinfection efficacy of these MPDS against Acanthamoeba cyst remain insufficient. 2, 6-dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB), a cellulose synthesis inhibitor, is capable of increasing the amoebical effect against Acanthamoeba by inhibiting its encystation. In this study, we investigated the possibility of DCB as a disinfecting agent to improve the amoebicidal activity of MPDS against Acanthamoeba cyst. Eight commercial MPDS (from a to h) were assessed, all of which displayed insufficient amoebicidal activity against the mature cysts. Solution e, f, and h showed strong amoebicidal effect on the immature cysts. Amoebicidal efficacy against mature cysts remained inadequate even when the 8 MPDS were combined with 100 μM DCB. However, 4 kinds of MPDS (solution d, e, f, and h) including 100 μM DCB demonstrated strong amoebicidal activity against the immature cysts. The amoebicidal activity of solution d was increased by addition of DCB. Cy-totoxicity was absent in human corneal epithelial cells treated with either DCB or mixture of DCB with MPDS. These results suggested that DCB can enhance the amoebicical activity of MPDS against Acanthamoeba immature cyst in vitro. ? 2018, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine.",Acanthamoeba; Amoebicidal effect; Cytotoxicity; DCB; MPDS,"dichlobenil; disinfectant agent; multipurpose contact lens disinfecting solution; unclassified drug; antiamebic agent; cellulose; contact lens solution; dichlobanil; nitrile; amoebicidal activity; Article; cornea epithelium; cyst (resting stage); drug cytotoxicity; drug effect; human; human cell; in vitro study; nonhuman; Acanthamoeba; cell culture; contact lens; drug effect; epithelium cell; metabolism; parasite encystment; parasitology; Acanthamoeba; Amebicides; Cells, Cultured; Cellulose; Contact Lens Solutions; Contact Lenses; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium, Corneal; Humans; Nitriles; Parasite Encystment",2-s2.0-85056307370

The data were analyzed using system dynamics methodology. Results: The rates of patients who were referred to a tertiary hospital, continued treatment, and were terminated treatment at a tertiary hospital were affected by the management fee and nursing staffing in a referral center that provided patient transfer counseling. Nursing staffing in a referral center had direct influence on the range of increase or decrease in the rates, whereas the management fee had direct influence on time. They were nonlinear relations that converged the value within a certain period.

The conceptual model was based on Bandura’s self-efficacy and social cognitive theories (1977; 1986) and Bowen’s (1976) family systems theory. Methods: From January 25 to March 5, 2016, 227 older adults living at home completed a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed to calculate the direct and indirect effects of factors affecting family life satisfaction. SPSS WIN 20.0 and AMOS 20.0 were used. Results: The hypothetical model was a good fit for the data. The model fit indices were χ2=78.05, χ2/df=1.35, RMSR=.02, GFI=.98, AGFI=.96, NFI=.94, CFI=.98, and RM-SEA=.05. Family life satisfaction was positively affected by perceived collective family efficacy, status of physical health, family communication, and family support. Depression resulted in a significant negative effect. Family differentiation had a significant indirect effect on family life satisfaction. The model explained 76% of variance in family life satisfaction. Conclusion: Perceived collective family efficacy, status of physical health, depression, family differentiation, family communication, and family support were significant factors explaining family life satisfaction among older adults staying at home. Further research should be conducted to seek intervention strategies to improve family life satisfaction among older adults living at home by focusing on the respective contributing factors. ? 2018 Korean Society of Nursing Science.",Aged; Communication; Family; Personal satisfaction,"aged; article; controlled study; differentiation; drug efficacy; family systems theory; female; health; human; human experiment; life satisfaction; male; prediction; Social Cognitive Theory; structural model; structured questionnaire; family relation; health status; questionnaire; satisfaction; social support; theoretical model; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Family Relations; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Personal Satisfaction; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85056281193

Methods: A total of 141 lesions in 138 women with pure DCIS who underwent preoperative breast ultrasonography were retrospectively reviewed. Ultrasonographic features were analyzed using the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) ultrasonography lexicon and the diagnostic criteria of the Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine. Pathologic features including the nuclear grade and presence of comedonecrosis were evaluated. Biological markers including estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, as well as the Ki-67 index, were recorded. Ultrasonographic features were compared with pathologic findings and biological markers using the chi-square test. P-values of <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Results: Of the 141 lesions, 75 (53.2%) were mass lesions, 56 (39.7%) were non-mass lesions, and 10 (7.1%) were not visible. The most common feature of the mass pattern was a mass with irregular shape (32.6%), an indistinct margin (27.7%), and hypoechogenicity (37.6%). Microcalcifications were observed in 48 cases (36.6%) as an associated feature. Calcifications outside of a mass were more common than calcifications within a mass. Ultrasonographic microcalcifications and ductal changes were frequently observed in non-mass lesions. Ultrasonographic non-mass lesions were associated with high-grade DCIS (P=0.004) and the presence of comedonecrosis (P=0.006). Microcalcifications were significantly associated with high-grade DCIS (P<0.001), the presence of comedonecrosis (P<0.001), an elevated Ki-67 (P<0.001), and HER2 positivity (P=0.003). Conclusion: The most common ultrasonographic feature of pure DCIS was an irregular, hypoechoic mass with an indistinct margin. Ultrasonographic microcalcifications and ductal changes were more frequent in non-mass lesions, which were correlated with poor prognostic factors, such as a high nuclear grade, comedonecrosis, HER2 positivity, and an elevated Ki-67 index. ? 2018 Korean Society of Ultrasound in Medicine (KSUM).",Biological markers; Breast; Ductal carcinoma in situ; Pathology; Ultrasonography,biological marker; biological product; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; Ki 67 antigen; progesterone receptor; adult; Article; blood flow; breast calcification; breast discharge; breast lesion; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer size; color Doppler flowmetry; comedonecrosis; controlled study; DNA probe; echomammography; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; intraductal carcinoma; major clinical study; mastalgia; middle aged; necrosis; partial mastectomy; retrospective study,2-s2.0-85055469022

However, the antiamnesic effects of O. ficus-indica var. saboten and its mode of action has not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, we explored the effects of the ethanolic extract of stems of O. ficus-indica var. saboten (EOFS) on cognitive performance in mouse and attempted to delineate its mechanism of action. We used the passive avoidance, Y-maze, and novel object recognition tests to assess its effects on cognitive functions in scopolamine-induced memory-impaired mice. We observed that EOFS (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) ameliorated scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction. We also explored its mechanism of action by conducting an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity assay using the mouse whole brain and Western blot using the mouse hippocampal tissue. Western blot analysis and the ex vivo study revealed that EOFS increased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. It also inhibited AChE activity in the brain. Our findings suggest that EOFS would be useful for the treatment of cholinergic blockade-induced cognitive dysfunction. ?

Even though Korean medicine (KM) treatments are commonly used for TMDs in clinical practice, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for TMDs in traditional KM have not yet been established. This evidence-based KM CPG on TMDs was therefore established. Methods: The key questions of the KM CPG on TMDs were determined based on clinical practice surveys on the use of KM for TMDs and expert opinion from the relevant academic societies by the CPG development committee. Then, a systematic literature review of KM treatments for TMDs was conducted for each key question, and the guideline draft was created in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) levels of evidence and grades of recommendation. Official consensus was achieved using the Delphi method on the draft, and the draft was further revised through external review to produce the final guideline, which was certified by the relevant academic societies. Results: A total of 15 recommendations are established to address the 13 key clinical questions about the clinical efficacy of 9 types of KM treatments for TMD, including grades and levels of evidence. Conclusions: The present guideline is expected to aid in the decision-making process of physicians and TMD patients, improve the overall quality of KM practice, and suggest subjects for future clinical research. ? 2018 The Authors",Clinical practice guideline (CPG); Evidence-based medicine; Korean medicine (KM); Systematic review; Temporomandibular disorder (TMD); Traditional medicine,analgesic agent; bee venom; acupuncture; Article; clinical decision making; clinical medicine; conservative treatment; Delphi study; evidence based practice; health survey; herbal medicine; human; jaw disease; kinesiotherapy; Korean medicine; low level laser therapy; manipulative medicine; meta analysis (topic); outcome assessment; pharmacopuncture; physiotherapy; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; sham procedure; systematic review; thermotherapy; thread embedding acupuncture; treatment indication,2-s2.0-85055019789

Bloodletting on ear apex (BEA) is a non-pharmacological treatment known to be useful in lowering high blood pressure in oriental medicine. This study was conducted to explore the evidence base to investigate whether this technique could help in the treatment of hypertension. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the antihypertensive effect of BEA. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by using Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Results: Eight RCTs comprising 543 participants were included. Compared with pharmacotherapy alone, BEA as a monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to pharmacotherapy showed significant results at 5 min to 1 h after intervention in lowering systolic blood pressure, but not for diastolic blood pressure. BEA as a monotherapy showed no favorable long-term antihypertensive effects compared with pharmacotherapy. However, the long-term antihypertensive effect of combination therapy was better than the pharmacotherapy alone. Only one study reported adverse events and these were not serious. The methodological quality of included studies was generally low. Conclusion: BEA as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy might have benefits in treating primary hypertension. Therefore, this treatment has the potential of non-pharmacological methods that can be used in patients attempting to withdraw antihypertensives or not responding to the conventional pharmacotherapy. However, since the number of studies included and the sample sizes were small, and the methodological quality was poor, these findings should be interpreted with great caution. Further well-designed studies need to be conducted to confirm these results. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Auriculotherapy; Bloodletting; Complementary therapies; Hypertension; Meta-analysis; Systematic review,antihypertensive agent; antihypertensive activity; bloodletting; clinical effectiveness; diastolic blood pressure; ear; ear apex; human; hypertension; meta analysis; monotherapy; patient safety; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; systolic blood pressure,2-s2.0-85054853127

We aimed to present normal reference data for those in a large-sized, selected group of healthy individuals. Methods: The current study was a part of the Normal echOcardiogRaphic Measurements in KoreAn popuLation (NORMAL), a prospective nationwide survey from 23 centers in Korea. We analyzed 447 subjects (age 48?±?15?years, 234 females) without any history of cardiovascular disease and presented the early and late DSRs (SRe and SRa, respectively) in a total and gender-/age-specified groups. Results: Among the total subjects, the mean SRe and SRa were 1.6?±?0.4?S?1 and 0.8?±?0.3?S?1, respectively. With increasing age, there were significant trends of decreasing SRe and increasing SRa. Although both gender groups showed comparable age, the female group presented significantly higher SRe compared to male subjects with age of 20–59?years, which diminished after the age of 60?years. However, the SRa was comparable between genders in all age groups. On multiple linear regression, age showed independent associations with both SRe (β?=??0.132, P?=.010) and SRa (β?=?0.440, P?&lt;.001), whereas gender did not show any association with SRe or SRa. Conclusion: We present normal reference data of a novel parameter, DSR, in a large-sized selected group with healthy Korean subjects. Additionally, we present significant age-related changes both in SRe and SRa without the impact of their gender. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",diastolic function; diastolic strain rate; normal reference,A wave; adult; age; aged; Article; cardiovascular parameters; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; diastolic strain rate; disease association; Doppler flowmetry; echocardiography; electrocardiography; female; heart cycle; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle mass; heart rate; human; image analysis; image quality; Korea; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prospective study; QRS complex; reference value; sex difference; systolic blood pressure; trend study; comparative study; diastole; heart; middle aged; physiology; procedures; reference value; sex factor; South Korea; Adult; Age Factors; Diastole; Echocardiography; Female; Heart; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Reference Values; Republic of Korea; Sex Factors,2-s2.0-85054778262

However, little is known about the prevalence of SH and its association with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a young population. The Nijmegen questionnaire (NQ), which measures severity of SH, had not previously been cross-culturally translated into Korean. In this study, the NQ was crossculturally translated into Korean (KNQ), using translation and back-translation methods. To examine the reliability and validity levels of the KNQ, as well as its association with HRQoL, 237 college students (21.38 ± 2.45 years) were asked to complete the KNQ, the Korean version of the general health questionnaire (K-GHQ-30) and the short form-36 (K-SF-36). The KNQ showed satisfactory reliability (Cronbach's α= 0.878). In the construct validity test, four factors (neuropsychological, respiratory, neurogastrointestinal, and neuromuscular) were extracted (% of total variance = 59.8). Using a KNQ cut-off score of 23 points, the prevalence of SH was 22.8%. Physical and mental HRQoL levels estimated by the K-GHQ-30 score and the 8 subscale scores of the K-SF-36 were lower in the SH group than in those of the non-SH group. It is concluded that the cross-culturally translated KNQ is reliable and valid, and management of SH may prevent a reduction in physical and mental HRQoL in a young population. ? 2018 Ok et al.

We also aimed to determine whether the severity or cause of the stiffness can affect the clinical outcome after surgery. This retrospective study included 122 knees (117 patients) with followup of more than 2 years (mean age, 64.3 years). TKA was performed using posterior-stabilized, varus-valgus constrained (VVC), and hinged prostheses. To determine the effect of the severity of stiffness on the clinical outcome, the subjects were divided into two groups: The severe group (preoperative ROM ? 50°; 18 knees) and the moderate group (preoperative ROM, 50°-90°; 104 knees). Then, clinical results and ROM were compared according to the severity or cause of preoperative stiffness. After surgery, preoperative ROM (mean, 78°; range, 25°- 90°) was improved (mean, 107°; range, 70°- 130°). The severe group more frequently used the VVC or hinged prostheses (72% vs. 18%). Furthermore, the severe group had worse knee and function scores as well as more complications (33% vs. 13%), even though the severe group had a greater ROM increment (47° vs. 27°) after surgery. Patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis showed better ROM and clinical results compared to patients with infectious or traumatic arthritis. Although TKA in stiff knees can be successful, the results are inferior in knees with severe stiffness and knees with infectious or traumatic arthritis. ? 2018 Lee et al.

Methods:: Photolithography was used to fabricate the microgrooved Ti, and amine funtionalization (silanization) was used for FN immobilization on titanium surfaces. Cell proliferation, gene expression and protein expression were analyzed, followed by multiple regression analysis for determining the influential factors on cell proliferation. Results:: FN-immobilized microgrooved Ti significantly enhanced the fibroblast proliferation in various timelines of culture, among which a burst of fivefold increase is induced at 96?h of culture compared to that on the control smooth Ti. We suggest a presence of the synergistic promotion effect of microgrooves and FN immobilization on fibroblast proliferation. Through a series of analyses on the expression of various genes and proteins involved in cell adhesion and proliferation, cyclin-dependent kinase 6, cyclin D1, integrin α5, oncogene c-Src, osteonectin, paxillin and talin-2 were determined as influential factors on promoting fibroblast proliferation induced by FN-immobilized microgrooved Ti.

DN causes cellular stress and inflammation, which induces death of renal cells and dysfunction of blood vessels. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small interfering RNAs that negatively regulate mRNA gene expression. Various human diseases are attributed to aberrant miRNAs expression, and miRNAs levels are used as markers for diagnosis and classification of diseases. However, the profile of miRNAs in DN mouse have not been fully explained, we analyzed miRNAs expression in the kidney of diabetic mice. Methods: C57BL6 male mice were injected with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body weight) for five consecutive days to induce DM. Mice were sacrificed after 16 weeks and RNAs were extracted from the kidneys and analyzed via microarray profiling. Results: Our results confirmed that 137 miRNAs expression was altered in DM. These miRNAs showed pairwise correlations with 48 mRNAs in DM kidney. Furthermore, Differential expressed miRNAs were characterized by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and signaling pathway using DAVID. Conclusion: Our findings may provide that changes in miRNA expression in mice with diabetic nephropathy influences disease progression and might provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DN. ? 2018, The Korean Society of Toxicogenomics and Toxicoproteomics and Springer Nature B.V.",Diabetic nephropathy; Microarray; miRNA,,2-s2.0-85053854253

However, the molecular mechanism by which ZKSCAN3 participates in carcinogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we evaluated ZKSCAN3 expression in uterine cervical cancers (CC) by immunohistochemistry using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 126 biopsy samples from 126 patients. The clinicopathological findings were analyzed and compared with ZKSCAN3 expression levels. ZKSCAN3 was strongly overexpressed in CCs compared to adjacent non-neoplastic cervical mucosa tissues. Moreover, a gene copy number assay showed amplified ZKSCAN3 in CC samples. ZKSCAN3 overexpression was also significantly associated with poor overall survival of the patients. Overall, our findings indicate that ZKSCAN3 overexpression is a frequent event in uterine CC and is correlated with a poor clinical outcome.

Pretibial myxedema (PTM) is a non-frequent manifestation of autoimmune thyroiditis, particularly Graves' disease. Lesions of myxedema occur most commonly on the pretibial surfaces, also develop at sites of previous injury or scars and other areas. A 49-year-old male presented with severe elephantiasis on the both pretibial areas, dorsum of the feet, ankles and toes. Twenty years previously, he had received radioactive iodine treatment for thyrotoxicosis. Laboratory tests showed that the patient's thyroid function was normal, but the level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies was very high (>40 IU/L). The biopsy confirmed PTM.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are usually initiated to control seizures despite their limited efficacy; however, accumulating clinical experience suggests a high incidence of adverse reactions to AEDs in anti-LGI1 encephalitis. We reviewed the medical records of patients who were diagnosed with anti-LGI1 encephalitis to analyze the adverse effects of AEDs in these patients. Among the 20 patients who were treated with AEDs, 10 (50%) changed their AEDs due to adverse cutaneous drug reaction. Eight of them presented with maculopapular eruption, one with drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, and one with eczema. Causative agents mostly consisted of aromatic AEDs. Oxcarbazepine was discontinued in two additional patients due to hyponatremia. Six patients (30%) discontinued their dose of levetiracetam because of psychiatric manifestations including irritability/aggressive behavior (four patients), insomnia (one patient), and depressive mood (one patient).

The aim of the current study was to determine the clinical characteristics of occluded culprit arteries and coronary collaterals in patients with NSTEMI and their impact on patient outcomes. A total of 345 patients diagnosed with NSTEMI via coronary angiography between February 2006 and May 2013 were evaluated in the present study. Patient demographics, procedural characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients were analyzed according to the presence of an occluded culprit artery and coronary collaterals. A total of 78 (22.6%) and 166 patients (48.1%) exhibited an occluded artery and coronary collaterals, respectively. The left anterior descending artery is a more common location of culprit arteries in patients with NSTEMI with patent artery (NSTEMIPA) and distal parts of the artery are more common location of culprit arteries in patients with NSTEMI with occluded arteries (NSTEMIOA). Patients with NSTEMIOA exhibited higher peak creatine kinase-MB (CKMB) and troponin-I levels compared with patients that had NSTEMIPA. The presence of coronary collaterals is associated with a lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction, higher regional wall motion score index and extensive coronary artery disease. However, the clinical outcomes of patients with collaterals did not differ, irrespective of the presence of an occluded culprit artery or coronary collaterals. In the current study, ~25% of patients with NSTEMI had an occluded culprit coronary artery whereas 50% of patients with NSTEMI had coronary collaterals. The presence of an occluded artery and/or coronary collaterals did not affect clinical outcomes. Further studies are required to evaluate the long-term prognostic impact of an occluded artery and collaterals. ? 2018, Spandidos Publications.

Beyond the role of human papilloma virus (HPV), no validated molecular marker of HNSCCs has been established. Thus, clinically relevant molecular subtypes are needed to optimize HNSCC therapy. The purpose of this study was to identify subtypes of HNSCC that have distinct biological characteristics associated with clinical outcomes and to characterize genomic alterations that best reflect the biological and clinical characteristics of each subtype. Materials and methods: We analyzed gene expression profiling data from pan-SCC tissues including cervical SCC, esophageal SCC, lung SCC, and HNSCC (n = 1346) to assess the similarities and differences among SCCs and to identify molecular subtypes of HNSCC associated with prognosis. Subtype-specific gene expression signatures were identified and used to construct predictive models. The association of the subtypes with prognosis was validated in two independent cohorts of patients. Results: Pan-SCC analysis identified three novel subtypes of HNSCC. Subtype 1 had the best prognosis and was similar to cervical SCC, whereas subtype 3 had the worst prognosis and was similar to lung SCC. Subtype 2 had a moderate prognosis. The 600-gene signature associated with the three subtypes significantly predicted prognosis in two independent validation cohorts. These three subtypes also were associated with potential benefit of immunotherapy. Conclusion: We identified three clinically relevant HNSCC molecular subtypes. Independent prospective studies to assess the clinical utility of the subtypes and associated gene signature are warranted. ? 2018",HNSCCs; Molecular subtypes; Pan-SCCs; RNAseq; TCGA,"adult; Article; cancer classification; cancer immunotherapy; cancer prognosis; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; copy number variation; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; female; gene expression profiling; gene mutation; genomics; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; predictive value; priority journal; squamous cell lung carcinoma; validation study; aged; classification; cluster analysis; gene dosage; genetics; head and neck tumor; immunotherapy; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; papillomavirus infection; prognosis; squamous cell carcinoma; treatment outcome; messenger RNA; RNA; Aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; Female; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Profiling; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Immunotherapy; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Papillomavirus Infections; Prognosis; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Neoplasm; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85051976327

Beef jerky without seasoning was inoculated with S. aureus producing enterotoxin A at a concentration of approximately 3–4 log cfu/g and stored aerobically at a temperature range of 10°C to 35°C. A modified Gompertz and Weibull model was used to obtain growth and survival kinetics, respectively, and SEA was measured using a Ridascreen SET Total Kit. Growth and survival of S. aureus on beef jerky was observed at temperatures above 21°C and below 19°C, respectively. The maximum population density was observed, but no SEA production was observed above 25°C. Despite the low Aw of beef jerky, the growth of S. aureus was observed above 21°C, indicating that additional safeguards should be considered to reduce the risk of S. aureus in beef jerky in the retail market. Practical applications: Staphylococcus aureus can survive in beef jerky with low Aw of 0.78 and even grow at temperatures above 21°C, indicating that beef jerky with low Aw may present a public health risk. Thus, distribution temperature must be reevaluated for the safety of beef jerky in the retail market. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-85051039702

In Korea, Jaungo is a traditional medicinal ointment, which is commonly used for treating skin wounds. Objective: Thus, we aim to explore the basic clinical efficacy and safety data for Jaungo in patients with AD. Methods: This study was a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center trial with three groups. The participants in treatment group 1 applied Jaungo to the lesion twice a day for 3 weeks. Those in treatment group 2 applied Jaungo and placebo ointments to the lesion once a day for 3 weeks. Those in the placebo group applied placebo ointments to the lesion twice a day for 3 weeks. The Eczema Area and Severity Index and SCORing Atopic Dermatitis scores, transepidermal water loss value, and Dermatology Life Quality Index score were assessed. The outcomes used to evaluate safety were the Draize score, blood test results, and expert opinion. Results: In total, 28 patients (82.4%) completed the study. During the study, significant decline of EASI scores in treatment group 2 and placebo group was observed (p < 0.05). And there was significant decline of SCORAD scores in treatment group1 and placebo group (p < 0.05). Patients in all groups showed decreased TEWL and DLQI scores with no significant difference. There was significant decline of IL-17 in all groups (p < 0.05). No serious adverse event was observed. Conclusion: This is the first study that has explored the potential therapeutic effect of Jaungo as a complementary therapy for AD. However, further large study with adjusting placebo ingredients is needed to confirm the effectiveness of Jaungo in patients with chronic-phase AD. ? 2018",Atopic dermatitis; Jaungo; SCORing atopic dermatitis; Topical herbal agents,"dermatological agent; interleukin 17; placebo; herbaceous agent; jaungo; aged; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; clinical article; controlled study; disease severity; dose response; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; dry skin; erythema; female; human; lichenoid eruption; male; medication compliance; pilot study; pruritus; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; skin edema; skin water loss; treatment duration; treatment withdrawal; urticaria; adolescent; adult; atopic dermatitis; middle aged; preschool child; topical drug administration; treatment outcome; young adult; Administration, Topical; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85050112191

In this study, cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (PTPN6) interacted with TRPM4 channels. We confirmed their interaction by performing co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays following heterologous PTPN6 and TRPM4 channel expression in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) image analysis confirmed TRPM4–PTPN6 binding. In addition, immunoblotting and Co-IP analyses revealed that TRPM4 expression significantly decreased in the membrane fraction of cells after PTPN6 was silenced with a specific short-hairpin RNA (shRNA-PTPN6). In agreement, TRPM4-induced changes in whole-cell currents were not detected in PTPN6-silenced HEK cells, in contrast to cells transfected with a scrambled RNA (scRNA) or in na?ve HEK cells. These data suggest that PTPN6 inhibits TRPM4 channel activity by disrupting TRPM4 expression. Furthermore, TRPM4 channels were expressed in the membrane of na?ve cells and scRNA transfectants, but not in those of PTPN6-silenced cells. These results indicated that PTPN6 is critically associated with TRPM4 trafficking. This role of PTPN6 in TRPM4 membrane localization was also demonstrated in HeLa cells. TRPM4 overexpression significantly enhanced cell proliferation in untreated HeLa cells, but not in HeLa cells with silenced PTPN6 expression. These findings indicate that PTPN6-dependent TRPM4 expression and trafficking to the plasma membrane is critical for cell proliferation in both HEK293 and HeLa cells. Therefore, PTPN6 is a novel therapeutic target for treating pathologic diseases involving TRPM4. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Membrane trafficking; PTPN6; RTK; TRPM4; Tyrosine phosphorylation,"protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 1; short hairpin RNA; transient receptor potential channel M4; protein binding; protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 1; PTPN6 protein, human; transient receptor potential channel M; TRPM4 protein, human; Article; cell proliferation; cell surface; controlled study; fluorescence analysis; gene expression regulation; gene overexpression; gene silencing; HEK293 cell line; HeLa cell line; heterologous expression; image analysis; immunoblotting; immunoprecipitation; priority journal; protein binding; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein transport; cell membrane; human; metabolism; Cell Membrane; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6; TRPM Cation Channels",2-s2.0-85048775037

Current methods of nutritional evaluation are mostly subjective, time-consuming, and cumbersome. Creatinine index (CI) and geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) are very simple and objective methods to assess the nutritional status of HD patients. The present study compares the performance of CI and GNRI as nutritional risk assessment tools. Methods: Eighty-eight patients with end-stage renal disease on HD were recruited from a single tertiary center. A clinical dietitian carried out individual interviews of all patients and made nutritional diagnosis. Demographic and clinical data were also used to derive GNRI and CI over 4 months. Findings: Thirty-eight out of 88 patients (44%) were diagnosed with normal nutritional status. Twenty-two patients (25%) were diagnosed with severe malnutrition and 27 (31%) had moderate malnutrition. Compared with patients with severe malnutrition, the normal group and those with moderate malnutrition showed significantly higher levels of body mass index and GNRI. Even though GNRI was associated with CI, protein intake, uric acid, and normalized protein nitrogen were not significantly correlated with GNRI, whereas the markers were highly associated with CI (P = 0.000). GNRI enable the identification of the severe malnutrition group but not the normal and moderate-malnutrition groups. However, based on CI, the normal group was distinguished while those with severe and moderate malnutrition were not. Discussion: Either CI or GNRI was a valid tool for longitudinal observation of nutritional status of patients on chronic HD and facilitated the screening of cases with malnutrition. Compared with GNRI, CI ranked higher in performance for the assessment and monitoring of nutritional status in HD patients. ? 2018 International Society for Hemodialysis",creatinine index; geriatric nutritional risk index; Hemodialysis; nutritional status,"creatinine; nitrogen; uric acid; creatinine; adult; Article; body mass; clinical assessment tool; comparative study; controlled study; creatinine index; demography; diagnostic test accuracy study; dietitian; disease marker; disease severity; end stage renal disease; female; geriatric nutritional risk index; hemodialysis patient; human; intermethod comparison; interview; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; nutritional status; patient assessment; protein intake; receiver operating characteristic; reference value; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; tertiary care center; aged; chronic kidney failure; complication; geriatric assessment; hemodialysis; metabolism; middle aged; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; pathology; physiology; procedures; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Creatinine; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Status; Renal Dialysis",2-s2.0-85047653585

Methods: The participants were 348 nurses who were working in a general hospital in a metropolitan area. The data were collected from December 16, 2012 to February 20, 2013. The hypothetical model of emotional intelligence, organizational citizenship behavior, leader trust, and value congruence was fitted to the actual data via structural equation modeling. Result: The leaders’ emotional intelligence had a direct positive effect on leader trust and value congruence; however, the nurses’ own emotional intelligence had a negative effect on these two variables. Furthermore, leader trust had a direct positive effect on organizational citizenship behavior; value congruence had no such relationship. The nurses’ emotional intelligence had a partial, indirect effect on organizational citizenship behavior via leader trust. Conclusion: In a nursing organization, it is necessary to build a system, such as mentoring, to be able to exchange emotions actively among the members in order to enhance emotional intelligence and have the same values between leaders and members throughout open communication.

Methods: This study randomized 45 overweight or obese but healthy adults (F = 26, M = 19; aged about 32 to 40 years) into 4 groups: ADCR (n = 13), exercise (n = 10), exercise plus ADCR (n = 12), and control (n = 10) for 8 weeks. Body composition, blood lipids profile, and insulin resistance were measured. The intention to treat (ITT) method was used to analyze all participants that were randomized. Results: A total of 35 participants completed the trial (78%). Body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, fat mass and percent body fat were reduced in the exercise plus ADCR group (- 3.3 ± 2.4 kg, p &lt; 0.01; - 1.3 ± 1.0 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.01; - 4.1 ± 3.9 cm, p &lt; 0.01; - 2.7 ± 2.0 kg, p &lt; 0.01; - 2. 5 ± 2.2%, p &lt; 0.01). Insulin, glucose, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance and triglyceride (- 2.9 ± 4.1 μIU/ml, p &lt; 0.05; - 10.9 ± 16.9 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.05; - 0.9 ± 1.3, p &lt; 0.05; - 43.8 ± 41.9 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.01) decreased in the exercise plus ADCR group only. Conclusions: ADCR and exercise both proved to be beneficial, but the combined intervention was most effective at inducing beneficial changes in body weight, body composition, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and triglyceride in overweight and obese adults.

DESIGN AND SETTING: We enrolled 1001 patients with cancer and 1006 caregivers from 12 large hospitals in Korea, 1241 members of the general population and 928 physicians from each of the 12 hospitals and the Korean Medical Association. We analysed the associations of demographic factors, attitudes towards death and the important components of a 'good death' with critical interventions at EoL care. RESULTS: All participant groups strongly favoured active pain control and withdrawal of futile LST but differed in attitudes towards the other four EoL interventions. Physicians (98.9%) favoured passive euthanasia more than the other three groups. Lower proportions of the four groups favoured active euthanasia or PAS. Multiple logistic regression showed that education (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.77, 95%?CI 1.33 to 2.36), caregiver role (aOR 1.67, 95%?CI 1.34 to 2.08) and considering death as the ending of life (aOR 1.66, 95%?CI 1.05 to 1.61) were associated with preference for active pain control. Attitudes towards death, including belief in being remembered (aOR 2.03, 95%?CI 1.48 to 2.79) and feeling 'life was meaningful' (aOR 2.56, 95%?CI 1.58 to 4.15) were both strong correlates of withdrawal of LST with the level of monthly income (aOR 2.56, 95%?CI 1.58 to 4.15). Believing 'freedom from pain' negatively predicted preference for passive euthanasia (aOR 0.69, 95%?CI 0.55 to 0.85). In addition, 'not being a burden to the family' was positively related to preferences for active euthanasia (aOR 1.62, 95%?CI 1.39 to 1.90) and PAS (aOR 1.61, 95%?CI 1.37 to 1.89). CONCLUSION: Groups differed in their attitudes towards the five EoL interventions, and those attitudes were significantly associated with various attitudes towards death. ?

Methods/design: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel two-arm pilot trial in Seoul, Korea. Altogether, 30 patients diagnosed with RA for at least 3 months and with a Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (DAS28) ? 3.2 will be enrolled. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups, the experimental group or the placebo group, in a 1:1 ratio and will make four scheduled visits. The participants will be administered geonchildan or a placebo three times per day for 12 weeks. The change in DAS28 will be examined as the primary efficacy outcome. The secondary efficacy outcomes include the proportion of patients achieving ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, and EULAR responses; the DAS28 sub-items; the consumption of medication; Korean Health Assessment Questionnaire scores; inflammatory parameters; and the Korean medical diagnostic pattern indicator. Adverse events and laboratory test results will be recorded to evaluate safety. The process, resources used, and management of the study will also be assessed to determine the feasibility of a large-scale trial. Discussion: This is the first clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of geonchildan in patients with active RA. If the superiority of geonchildan versus the placebo is demonstrated and the study design is feasible, this study could form the foundation for a large-scale clinical trial.

We present a new classification according to location and shape, and propose a system for coding the classifications. Methods This study was conducted by reviewing the records of 502 patients who underwent surgery for AA. AAs were classified into three anatomical types: intraauricular, preauricular, and buccal. Intraauricular AAs were divided into three subtypes: intracrural, intratragal, and intralobal. Preauricular AAs were divided into five subtypes: precrural, superior pretragal, middle pretragal, inferior pretragal, and prelobal. Buccal AAs were divided into two subtypes: anterior buccal and posterior buccal. AAs were also classified according to their protrusion pattern above the surrounding surface: pedunculated, sessile, areolar, remnant, and depressed. Pedunculated and sessile AAs were subclassified as spherical, ovoid, lobed, and nodular, according to their body shape. Cartilage root presence and family history of AA were reviewed. A coding system for these classifications was also proposed. Results The total number of AAs in the 502 patients was 1,003. Among the locations, the superior pretragal subtype (27.6%) was the most common. Among the protrusion patterns and shapes, pedunculated ovoid AAs were the most common in the preauricular (27.8%) and buccal areas (28.0%), and sessile lobed AAs were the most common in the intraauricular area (48.7%). The proportion of AAs with a cartilage root was 78.4%, and 11% of patients had a family history. The most common type of preauricular AA was the superior pretragal pedunculated ovoid AA (13.2%) with a cartilage root. Conclusions This new system will serve as a guideline for classifying and coding AAs. ? 2018 The Korean Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.",Accessory auricle; Accessory tragus; Classification; Ear abnormalities; Embryology,accessory auricle; adolescent; adult; Article; auricle; body build; cartilage; child; disease classification; external ear malformation; family history; female; human; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; prominent ear; social status,2-s2.0-85056477657

This study aims to examine the relationships between participation motivation and well-being among golfers in Korea. A questionnaire survey was conducted amongst 485 golf participants at various places such as golf practice range, private sport club, and golf courses in South Korea. The questionnaire consists of the four sections asking demographics and golf-related experience, participation motivation, subjective well-being (SWB), and psychological well-being (PWB), respectively. The data were examined by using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and linear regression analysis with SPSS 20.0. The results indicate that the majority of the respondents show a positive and favorable motivation, and also show fairly high levels of the PWB and the SWB. Golf participation motivation has a significant influence on both PWB and SWB. The Self-Determination Theory was employed for a theoretical framework and the Sport Motivation Scale to measure intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and amotivation. The results are as follows; firstly, among the three intrinsic motivation factors, ‘intrinsic motivation to know’ is significantly related to well-being. The PWB and the SWB are significantly positively affected by ‘intrinsic motivation to experience stimulation’ and ‘intrinsic motivation toward accomplishments’. Secondly, as for extrinsic motivation composed of three sub-dimensions of extrinsic, ‘external regulation’ has a significant positive effect on the SWB, while ‘introjected regulation’ does not significantly influence the SWB. Amotivation was expected to negatively affect the SWB. However, the results show that there is no significant relation between amotivation and SWB. Over all, both the PWB and the SWB of golf participants are significantly influenced by participation motivation.

This study aims to examine the relationship between emotional labor, a calling, and emotional dissonance. To fulfill the purposes of the present study, a questionnaire survey was conducted amongst 285 Taekwondo instructors in Korea. The questionnaire consists of the four sections, which are related to demographic statistics, emotional labor, Multidimensional Calling Measure (MCM), and emotional dissonance, respectively. The data were analyzed with SPSS 18.0 and AMOS 18.0, utilizing Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling. The results of path analysis are as follows; First, the multiformity of emotional labor has a positive effect on IP and TGF among the factors of calling (β=.164, t=2.025 and β=.222, t= 2.731, respectively) while the multiformity has no effect on SMVB (β=.114, t= 1.442). That is, the multiformity of emotional labor does not show any relation with SMVB. In addition, the frequency of emotional labor positively affects IP, SMVB, and TGF (β=.449, t= 5.259, β=.540, t= 6.361, and β=.437, t= 5.239, respectively). Second, IP and SMVB, the factors of calling, are likely to influence the emotional dissonance (β=-.234, t=-3.097 and β=-.689,t=-3.407, respectively), while TGF does not have an impact on the emotional dissonance (β=-.210, t=-1.162). In other words, the higher level a calling is, the less emotional dissonance is. Third, the multiformity and the frequency of emotional labor have positive effects on the emotional dissonance (β=.480, t=6.249 and β=.226, t= 2.877, respectively). This study is expected to contribute to developing effective strategies to reduce emotional dissonance caused by emotional labor of excessive service work. Further studies on larger scale assessments are required. ? 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Methods: Data were collected through a questionnaire survey among 150 elderly women in Seoul and Gyeong-gi Province. The measurement tools that were used include participation in leisure activities, perceived health status, Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form-Korea (GDSS-K), psychological well-being scale, and loneliness scale. The data were analyzed by using the Pearson correlation coefficients, t-test, analysis of variance ANOVA, and stepwise multiple regression with the SPSS/windows version 21.0 program. Results: The analysis shows that the affection for participation in leisure activities of the elderly women living alone who participated in the questionnaire survey is significant (F=14.6, p &lt; .001). The value of the adjusted R2 is 0.55, which accounts for the explanatory power of 55.4%. The predictor that has been found to have the greatest influence on the participation in leisure activities by the elderly women living alone include perceived health status, followed by monthly allowance (10,000 won), psychological well-being, economic status, religion, depression, family structure, and loneliness. Conclusion: The results suggest that in developing nursing interventions and practice for the participation in leisure activities by elderly women living alone, perceived health status, psychological well-being, depression, and loneliness should be considered. ? 2018 Korean Academy of Community Health Nursing.",Aged; Female; Leisure activities; Loneliness,,2-s2.0-85054802432

Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study among 1,049 patients who underwent curative resection and received AC for stage II and III gastric cancers between February 2012 and December 2013 at 29 tertiary referral university hospitals in Korea. To minimize the influence of potential confounders on selection bias, propensity score matching (PSM) was used based on binary logistic regression analysis. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were compared between patients who received AC administered by medical oncologists or surgical oncologists. Results: Between February 2012 and December 2013 in Korea, the most commonly prescribed AC by medical oncologists was tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (S-1, 47.72%), followed by capecitabine with oxaliplatin (XELOX, 16.33%). After performing PSM, surgical oncologists (82.74%) completed AC as planned more often than medical oncologists (75.9%), with statistical significance (P=0.036). No difference in the 3-year DFS rates of stage II (P=0.567) or stage III (P=0.545) gastric cancer was found between the medical and surgical oncologist groups. Conclusions: S-1 monotherapy and XELOX are a main stay of AC, regardless of whether the prescribing physician is a medical or surgical oncologist. The better compliance with AC by surgical oncologists is a valid reason to advocate that surgical oncologists perform the treatment of AC for stage II or III gastric cancers. ? 2018.

Oral administration of LJ alleviated scopolamine-induced memory impairment in passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks. Furthermore, LJ treatment increased scopolamine-suppressed BDNF expression and CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampi of the brain, as well as suppressed TNF-α expression and NF-κB activation. LJ also increased BDNF expression in corticosterone-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells and inhibited NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. However, LJ did not inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity.

Methods/design: This study is a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter, multidose, placebo-controlled, phase IIb clinical trial. A total of 165 obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30 kg/m2 or obese patients with a BMI of 27 to 29.9 kg/m2 and one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia will be enrolled. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups (high-dose, low-dose, or placebo) with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio and will have 4 scheduled visits during the 12-week treatment period. The participants will be administered 2 tablets of Hanslim or placebo, 2 times per day. The difference in the proportion of participants who lost weight by more than 5% from their baseline at 12 weeks compared to the placebo group will be examined as the primary efficacy outcome. Secondary efficacy outcomes include differences in body weight, BMI, body-fat percentage, fat mass, skeletal-muscle mass, edema index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip ratio, serum lipid, blood glucose, C-reactive protein, and total score of Korean version of obesity-related quality of life after 12 weeks of treatment. Adverse events, laboratory test results, vital sings, and electrocardiography will be recorded to evaluate safety. Discussion: This is the first prospective clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of Hanslim for obese patients. If the results provide the appropriate dosage of Hanslim, this study would contribute to the confirmatory evidence for the use of Hanslim as a treatment for obesity needed to conduct a large-scale, phase III clinical trial.

However, it requires a loading dose, which can result in transient hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, and/or sinus arrest. In addition, the time required to reach an appropriate depth of sedation may cause anxiety to the patients. Therefore, we examined whether an intravenous bolus of midazolam could replace the loading dose of dexmedetomidine for sedation during surgery in elderly patients who received spinal anesthesia. Methods: Patients aged over 60 years who scheduled to undergo total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomized into 2 groups. Patients in dexmedetomidine group (group D) (n = 20) were administered a loading dose of dexmedetomidine (1.0 mg/kg over 10 min) intravenously followed by dexmedetomidine maintenance (0.5 mg/kg/h). Patients in group MD (n = 20) were administered an intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) followed by dexmedetomidine maintenance (0.5 mg/kg/h) intravenously. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and patient state index (PSI) were recorded. Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) scores were evaluated at 10 minutes after drug administration and the end of surgery. Results: A total of 40 subjects were enrolled in the present study. At baseline, there was no between-group difference in HR. Ten minutes after drug administration, group D had lower HR than group MD (62.1 ± 9.4 versus 69.6 ± 13.4, P = .047). PSI was significantly lower in group MD at 10 minutes after drug administration (82.8 ± 13.0 versus 72.0 ± 16.0, P = .024); there was no between-group difference at 30 and 60 minutes, and lower values in group D at the end of surgery (70.2 ± 22.6 versus 79.7 ± 10.9, P = .011). The RSS score showed statistically significantly deeper sedation in group MD 10 minutes after drug administration, but no difference at the end of surgery. Conclusions: An intravenous bolus of midazolam is a viable alternative to dexmedetomidine loading for sedation during surgery in elderly patients who received spinal anesthesia. This is especially effective for patients who are at high risk for bradycardia or who want a faster sedation. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The purpose of this case report is to introduce conservative treatment with integrative Korean medicine (KM) as a possible alternative to surgery in patients with mild CSM. Patient concerns: An 81-year-old male with both hand weakness and dysesthesia was diagnosed with CSM and was recommended laminectomy. However, considering the patient’s age and the underlying disease, he refused immediate surgery and preferred KM treatment Diagnoses: The diagnosis of mild CSM was based on a modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score as well as the presence of compression on the spinal cord in magnetic resonance imaging findings Interventions: Integrative KM treatment consisting of acupuncture, acupotomy, Bee venom herbal acupuncture, cupping therapy, moxibustion, and herbal medicine was provided during the 12-week admission. Outcomes: Clinical improvement was detected with a mJOA score (11 to 17), a numerical rating scale for dysesthesia intensity (5 to 2), finger escape sign (+/+ to +/), grip and release test (11/14 to 32/31) and grasp power measured by dynamometer (3.1/9.7 to 10.8/18.3 kg) at 12 weeks. This improvement was maintained without surgery until 1 year. Lessons: This case suggests that integrative KM was a possible conservative management option for mild CSM.

Acupuncture is a source of pain relief that has been used for SIS; however, there is no clinical study about image-guided acupuncture for SIS. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fluoroscopy-guided acupuncture in patients with SIS. Methods: This is the protocol for a randomized, patient-assessor blind, parallel clinical trial comparing fluoroscopy-guided acupuncture to acupuncture without fluoroscopy. There will be a 1-week run-in period before random allocation to 2 groups. The total duration of the clinical trial will be 3 weeks including 2 weeks for the follow-up period. A total of 57 participants will be enrolled for the clinical trial. Acupuncture will be conducted in 2 sessions for each group, once at baseline and once at the 1-week mark. The primary outcome will be 100mm pain visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes will include the Neer and Hawkins test, the Modified Constant Murley Score scale, the Shoulder Pain And Disability Index, the patient satisfaction degree, and the accuracy rate of acupuncture. For the evaluation of safety, adverse events will be monitored. Discussion: We designed the clinical trial using image-guided acupuncture. This will be the first trial to study the effectiveness of image-guided acupuncture for SIS compared with acupuncture using the proportional measurements. ? 2018 the Author(s).",Acupuncture; Fluoroscopy; Randomized clinical trials; Subacromial impingement syndrome,acupuncture; adult; aged; analgesia; Article; controlled study; disease duration; female; fluoroscopy; follow up; functional status assessment; human; major clinical study; male; Modified Constant Murley Score Scale; outcome assessment; patient assessment; patient satisfaction; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; shoulder impingement syndrome; shoulder pain; Shoulder Pain and Disability Index; visual analog scale; acupuncture; clinical protocol; fluoroscopy; methodology; middle aged; pain measurement; procedures; shoulder impingement syndrome; single blind procedure; treatment outcome; Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Aged; Clinical Protocols; Female; Fluoroscopy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Research Design; Shoulder Impingement Syndrome; Single-Blind Method; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85054013031

It is mostly a benign entity, but some cases cause bone destruction and form non-healing chronic sinuses. In such cases, wound management becomes difficult and there is a potential risk of secondary infection. Patient concerns: A 60-year-old male was referred for evaluation of a pain, erythematous changes, and draining sinus of the anterolateral aspect of his left leg. He had an open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery owing to a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture. Diagnoses: A thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus. The radiographs of the left leg showed a large, fusiform-shaped, radiopaque soft tissue mass in the space between the tibia and fibula. We performed an incisional biopsy to differentiated soft tissue sarcoma and malignant cells were found. Pathologic evaluation revealed acute and chronic inflammation with dystrophic calcification. These findings led to the diagnosis of calcific myonecrosis. Interventions: We performed an extensive debridement of the anterior and deep posterior compartments to ensure definitive treatment. Upon performing extensive debridement, we inserted a drain tube and performed primary closure. Outcomes: The fluid continued to be discharged through the drain even after the surgery; delayed wound healing occurred 4 weeks following the surgery, and there was no recurrence at follow-up conducted 2 years later. Lessons: Calcific myonecrosis is mostly a benign entity, but some cases of calcific myonecrosis cause bone destruction and form non-healing chronic sinuses. In such cases, surgical treatment is required, during which the necrotic tissue and calcific material must be extensively debrided and drained. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s).

Methods: This 8-week, active-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose, multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled, and noninferiority trial was conducted at 17 cardiovascular centers in the Republic of Korea. Eligible patients had mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP) ?90 mm Hg despite monotherapy with valsartan 160 mg for 4 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with AML/VAL 5/160 mg FDC (AML/VAL) group or VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg FDC (VAL/HCTZ) group once daily for 8 weeks. A total of 238 patients were enrolled (AML/VAL group, n = 121; VAL/HCTZ group, n = 117), of whom 228 completed the study. Results: At 8 weeks after randomization, msDBP was significantly decreased in both groups (9.44 ± 0.69 mm Hg in the AML/VAL group and 7.47 ± 0.71 mm Hg in the VAL/HCTZ group, both P < .001 vs baseline). Between group difference was 1.96 ± 1.00 mm Hg, indicating that AML/VAL 5/160 mg FDC was not inferior to VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg FDC at primary efficacy endpoint. Control rate of BP defined as the percentage of patients achieving mean sitting SBP (msSBP) <140 mm Hg or msDBP <90 mm Hg (target BP) from baseline to week 8 was significantly higher in the AML/VAL group than that in the VAL/HCTZ group (84.3% [n = 102] in the AML/VAL group vs 71.3% [n = 82] in the VAL/HCTZ group, P = .016). At 8 weeks after randomization, mean uric acid level was significantly increased in the VAL/HCTZ group compared to that at baseline (0.64 ± 0.08 mg/dL; P < .001). However, it was slightly decreased from baseline in the AML/VAL group (0.12 ± 0.08 mg/dL; P = .085). The intergroup difference was significant (P < .001).

Oriental herbal medicine has been widely used in East Asia, and it has been considered as a promising alternative to conventional pharmacotherapy because of its efficacy in geriatrics. Moreover, since oriental herbal medicine acts on multiple targets, it may affect both hypertension and insomnia at the same time, which can reduce the risk of polypharmacy in this population. This systematic review will assess the efficacy and safety of oriental herbal medicine in the elderly with both insomnia and hypertension. Methods: Thirteen databases including English, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese databases will be searched from their inception to August 2018. We will include randomized controlled trials assessing oriental herbal medicine for insomnia in the elderly with hypertension. The methodological quality of the included studies will be evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool, and confidence in the cumulative evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation instrument. Results: This review will provide evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of oriental herbal medicine in the elderly with both insomnia and hypertension. Conclusions: Our results will help clinicians and health policy makers take informed decisions regarding the use of oriental herbal medicine in the elderly. It will also provide evidence-based oriental herbal medicine data for elderly patients suffering from multiple diseases and their families. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s).

Methods: From September 2012 to February 2014, 341 patients with AECOPD attending outpatient clinics were enrolled as part of a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody titers on the first day of the study and at 36 days post-enrollment. Multiplex PCR was used to test sputum samples for the presence of atypical pathogens. A urinary antigen test for L. pneumophila was performed on the first day. Results: Nineteen patients (5.6%) showed serological evidence of acute infection with M. pneumoniae. Also, one and seven patients (2%) showed serological evidence of acute infection with C. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, respectively. All DNA samples were negative for M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila according to PCR. Only one urine sample was positive for L. pneumophila antigen, but serologic evidence was lacking. Conclusions: Serological testing suggested that infection by atypical pathogens during AECOPD was relatively uncommon. In addition, PCR provided no direct evidence of infection by atypical pathogens. Thus, atypical pathogens may not be a major cause of AECOPD in South Korea. ? 2018 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.",Atypical pathogen; Chronic obstructive; Exacerbation; Polymerase chain reaction; Pulmonary disease; Serology,"bacterial antigen; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; moxifloxacin; zabofloxacin; adult; aged; antibody titer; Article; bacterium detection; Chlamydia pneumoniae; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; disease exacerbation; DNA determination; double blind procedure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; Legionella pneumophila; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; nonhuman; outpatient; polymerase chain reaction; post hoc analysis; randomized controlled trial; serology; sputum analysis; urinalysis; urinary antigen test; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical trial; isolation and purification; microbiology; serology; South Korea; Aged; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Legionella pneumophila; Male; Middle Aged; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Republic of Korea; Serologic Tests",2-s2.0-85053290679

However, little skin photoaging-related research has been done on the use of this agent. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of RN in UVB-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). RN treatment in UVB-irradiated skin models alleviated UVB-mediated photoaging through several mechanisms: Treatment with RN downregulated MAPK-related signaling models, such as those of activation protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). In addition, phase II gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was modulated by the increase in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the nuclear, and finally, transforming growth factor TGF-β was upregulated in vitro. Further study indicated that UVB-induced production of MMP-1 and IL-6 could be inhibited by PD 98059 (an inhibitor of ERK) and SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK). Thus, RN improved the expression of type I procollagen and inhibited UVB-induced MMP-1 and IL-6 secretion through inactivating MAPK cascades. Therefore, RN is a suitable target for further investigation as an antiphotoaging agent and may have applications in the skincare industry. ? 2018 The American Society of Photobiology",,anthocyanin; antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; biological marker; plant extract; radioprotective agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; cell line; chemistry; cutaneous parameters; cytology; drug effect; fibroblast; human; metabolism; radiation response; Ribes; skin; ultraviolet radiation; Anthocyanins; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Biomarkers; Cell Line; Fibroblasts; Humans; Plant Extracts; Radiation-Protective Agents; Reactive Oxygen Species; Ribes; Skin; Skin Aging; Ultraviolet Rays,2-s2.0-85053238294

In this study, we submitted Notoginseng stem-leaf (NGL) ginsenosides to an enzyme to create a reaction with the monomer products of ginsenoside C-Mx and then investigated the ability of ginsenoside C-Mx to protect the skin against ultraviolet B-induced injury in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). Ginsenoside C-Mx alleviated UVB-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), MMP-1 and IL-6 expression while accelerating TGF-β and procollagen type I secretion. In addition, ginsenoside C-Mx reversed UVB-induced procollagen type I reduction by regulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Moreover, ginsenoside C-Mx inhibited activation of AP-1 transcription factor, an inducer of MMPs. Ginsenoside C-Mx displayed an outstanding antioxidant capacity, increasing expression of cytoprotective antioxidants such as HO-1 and NQO-1 expression by enhancing the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. Interestingly, application of ginsenoside C-Mx treatment (1, 10, 20?μm) significantly diminished UVB-induced suppressed NF-κB expression, decreasing the over-released inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, our findings indicated that ginsenoside C-Mx may act as a promising natural cosmetic ingredient for prevention and treatment of UVB-induced skin damage. ? 2018 The American Society of Photobiology",,"antioxidant; radioprotective agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; chemistry; cutaneous parameters; dose response; drug effect; enzymology; fibroblast; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Panax; plant leaf; plant stem; procedures; radiation response; signal transduction; skin; ultraviolet radiation; Antioxidants; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fibroblasts; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Panax; Plant Leaves; Plant Stems; Radiation-Protective Agents; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Skin; Skin Aging; Ultraviolet Rays",2-s2.0-85053212332

Herein, we estimated a different target ADR for adults below 50 years old based on screening colonoscopy findings. Materials and Methods: Asymptomatic, average-risk adults below 50 years old who underwent screening colonoscopy were enrolled at 12 endoscopy centers in Korea between February 2006 and March 2012. Screening colonoscopies were stratified into low or high ADR groups with ADR levels of 20% and 25%, respectively. Results: The ADRs from 12 endoscopy centers ranged from 12.1% to 43.8% (median ADR, 24.1%) based on 5272 young adults receiving screening colonoscopies. Using 20% as an ADR level, the risks for metachronous adenoma and advanced adenoma were significantly higher in the low ADR group than the high ADR group (35.4% vs. 25.7%, P<0.001; 8.3% vs. 3.7%, P=0.001, respectively). However, using ADR level of 25%, the risk for metachronous neoplasia was similar in the high and low ADR groups in young adults according to screening colonoscopy. In subgroup analysis, similar findings were found in males, but not in females. Conclusions: Optimal target ADR may be different between younger and older populations, and the adoption of a 20% target ADR could be used as a performance indicator for young populations. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Adenoma detection rate; Colonoscopy; Quality; Screening; Young age,acetylsalicylic acid; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; metformin; adenoma; adenomatous polyp; adult; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer screening; colonoscopy; colorectal adenoma; colorectal carcinoma; dysplasia; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; rectum adenoma; retrospective study; South Korea; adenoma; clinical trial; colorectal tumor; early cancer diagnosis; mass screening; multicenter study; prevalence; procedures; Adenoma; Adult; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies,2-s2.0-85051929904

However, the application of the ACR guideline in Korea may not be appropriate, because many patients in Korea have active tuberculosis or pulmonary fibrosis due to previous tuberculosis. The Korean Society of Radiology and Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology have proposed a new guideline suitable for Korean practice. This new guideline was prepared through the consensus of a development committee, working party, and an advisory committee. The guideline proposal process was based on an evidence-based clinical imaging guideline proposed by the development committee. Clinical imaging guideline for adult patients with hemoptysis is as follows: Chest radiography is an initial imaging modality to evaluate hemoptysis. Contrast-enhanced chest CT is recommended in patients with two risk factors for lung cancer (> 40 years old and > 30 pack-year smoking history), moderate hemoptysis (> 30 mL/24 hours) or recurrent hemoptysis. Contrast-enhanced chest CT is also recommended in patients with massive hemoptysis (> 400 mL/24 hours) without cardiopulmonary compromise. ? 2018 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Computed tomography; Evidence; Guideline; Hemoptysis; Lung; Radiography; Republic of korea; Thorax; X-ray,"contrast medium; arterial embolization; bleeding; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic imaging; hemoptysis; human; inflammation; lung cancer; practice guideline; radiation dose; Review; smoking; thorax radiography; artificial embolization; bronchial artery; diagnostic imaging; hemoptysis; medical society; pathophysiology; practice guideline; South Korea; surgery; x-ray computed tomography; Bronchial Arteries; Embolization, Therapeutic; Hemoptysis; Humans; Radiation Dosage; Radiography, Thoracic; Republic of Korea; Societies, Medical; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85051397105

This study aimed to compare the symptom severity between classic and delayed OH and evaluate the efficacy of midodrine or pyridostigmine in patients with delayed OH. Methods: This was an adjunctive study of previously reported randomized, open-label clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of midodrine or pyridostigmine for classic OH. Seventeen patients with delayed OH were enrolled and also received midodrine (2.5 mg twice a day) or pyridostigmine (30 mg twice a day) alone or combined. Result of initial orthostatic vital sign and questionnaires were compared between the patients with delayed OH and previously reported 87 patients with classic OH. Delayed OH patients were followed up at 1 and 3 months post-treatment and the vital sign measurements and questionnaires were repeated during the follow-up period. Results: Questionnaire scores regarding OH-related symptoms, depression and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were comparable between the classic and delayed OH patients at baseline. OH-related symptoms and depression were significantly improved after 3 months of medical treatment. Conclusion: Patients with delayed OH exhibited orthostatic intolerance similar to that of classic OH. This study shows that these patients may benefit from medical treatment with either midodrine or pyridostigmine. ? 2018",Delayed orthostatic hypotension; Efficacy; Midodrine; Pyridostigmine; Treatment,"midodrine; pyridostigmine; midodrine; pyridostigmine; vasoconstrictor agent; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; cross-sectional study; delayed orthostatic hypotension; delayed orthostatic hypotension; depression; diastolic blood pressure; disease severity; drug efficacy; female; human; male; middle aged; observational study; orthostatic blood pressure; orthostatic hypotension; pharmaceutical care; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); symptomatology; systolic blood pressure; treatment duration; treatment response; combination drug therapy; follow up; orthostatic hypotension; pathophysiology; psychology; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypotension, Orthostatic; Male; Middle Aged; Midodrine; Pyridostigmine Bromide; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome; Vasoconstrictor Agents",2-s2.0-85049331069

HILI was analyzed using the Roussel Uclaf causality assessment method liver injury criteria and causality assessment. Multivariable analysis was performed to assess the relationship between patient characteristics and LEA in RD. The features of LEA were also examined in each RD. Among 352 patients included in this study, 105 patients showed LEA on admission, of which 6 had fulfilled the Roussel Uclaf causality assessment method criteria. The incidence risks of LEA and HILI were 12.55% and 0.58%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that LEA on admission and occasional use of alcohol could be risk factors for LEA on follow-up. In an additional analysis with each RD, all rheumatoid arthritis patients with LEA were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and 4 out of 5 gout patients with LEA were taking steroids. The use of herbal medicine in RD is relatively safe. However, regular monitoring of liver enzyme tests and examination of alcohol consumption are required.

Materials and Methods: The Korean National Diabetes Program was a prospective, multicenter observational cohort study of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Korea. Of the 3,950 patients enrolled in the study, we studied 998 who were continuously maintained on monotherapy for at least 90 days at six participating centers. To balance the baseline characteristics of patients in each group, we used propensity matching at a 1:1 ratio (metformin vs sulfonylureas) and 4:1 ratio (metformin vs meglitinides and metformin vs alpha-glucosidase inhibitors [aGIs]). The hazard ratios (HRs) of treatments (compared with metformin) were determined by Cox's proportional hazards regression modeling. Results: The median follow-up time was 56 months, and monotherapy failed in 45% of all patients. The annual incidences of failure were 15.6%, 21.3%, 27% and 9.6% in the metformin, sulfonylurea, meglitinide and aGI groups. Compared with metformin, sulfonylureas and meglitinides were associated with higher risks of monotherapy failure (HR 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.80; HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.13–3.27), and aGIs with risks similar to that of metformin (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.44–1.45). When analyzed by failure type, sulfonylureas, meglitinides and aGIs were associated with a higher risk of a switch to other agents (HR 4.43, 95% CI 2.14–9.17; HR 18.80, 95% CI 6.21–56.93; HR 4.25, 95% CI 1.49–12.13), and aGIs with a lower risk of prescription of add-on second agents (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04–0.64). Conclusions: Metformin was associated with a lower failure risk than were sulfonylureas and meglitinides, but a comparable aGI failure rate. ? 2018 The Authors.

However, its use is restricted by its potential to cause allergy. Thus, allergen-free R. verniciflua extracts are currently being marketed as a functional health food in Korea. In the present study, three different allergen-free R. verniciflua extracts (DRVE, FRVE, and FFRVE) were produced by detoxification of R. verniciflua, and their properties and constituents were compared. Methods: The main components and properties (antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, and hepatic lipogenesis inhibitory effects) of the three allergen-free extracts were compared. Moreover, the major phenolic constituents of R. verniciflua, including gallic acid, fustin, fisetin, and quercetin, were analyzed in the three extracts. Results: DRVE was superior to the two other extracts with regard to antioxidant activity, while FRVE was superior with regard to antimicrobial activity and suppression of hepatic lipogenesis. FRVE exhibited lipid-lowering effects by lowering sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and triglyceride levels, and promoting the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and AMP-activated protein kinase in an in vitro model of non-alcoholic fatty liver. Conclusions: Overall, our findings demonstrate various differences among the three extracts. This suggests that functional and bioactive compounds present in R. verniciflua could be altered by the detoxification process, and this property could be considered in the development of functional health foods in the future. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Detoxification; Fermentation; Fisetin; Fustin; Rhus verniciflua Stokes,"antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; ascorbic acid; fisetin; fustin; gallic acid; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; plant extract; quercetin; Rhus verniciflua extract; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; tannin; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; antioxidant; flavonoid; phenol derivative; plant extract; animal cell; antibacterial activity; antineoplastic activity; antioxidant activity; Article; comparative study; controlled study; drug detoxification; human; human cell; in vitro study; lipogenesis; male; mouse; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; biological model; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; fermentation; Rhus; tumor cell line; Anti-Infective Agents; Antioxidants; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Fermentation; Flavonoids; Humans; Lipogenesis; Models, Biological; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Phenols; Plant Extracts; Rhus",2-s2.0-85052601746

Additionally, it is unclear how risk of hypertension varies according to the change of glycemic state. Methods: Five thousand four hundred thirteen nondiabetic Koreans were dichotomized into normoglycemia (NG) and prediabetes group and followedup for 10 years. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) [adjusted HRs (95% CI)] for the development of hypertension. Subgroup analysis was conducted in subdivided glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with <5.7%, 5.7-5.9%, and 6.0-6.4% and 2 hour post-load glucose (2 hr-PG) with <140, 140-169, and 170-199 mg/dl. The glycemic states are NG, prediabetes, and diabetes mellitus (DM), which are used in evaluating the change of glycemic state during follow-up in baseline NG (NG → NG, NG → prediabetes, and NG → DM) and baseline prediabetes (prediabetes → prediabetes and prediabetes → DM). Results: Compared with NG, prediabetes was not significantly associated with the risk of hypertension [1.11 (0.997-1.23)]. HbA1c ?5.7% [1.13 (1.02-1.26)] and 2 hr-PG ?140 mg/dl [1.15 (1.004-1.31)] were marginally associated with the risk of hypertension. In subgroup analysis, only 2 hr-PG of 170-199 mg/dl showed the significantly increased risk of hypertension [1.37 (1.09-1.73)]. Compared with the maintaining glycemic state, the progression of glycemic state had the significantly increased risk of hypertension [NG → prediabetes; 1.41 (1.19-1.67), NG→DM; 1.77 (1.36-2.30), and prediabetes → DM; 1.32 (1.13-1.55)]. Conclusion: The progression of glycemic state was a strong determinant on the development of hypertension. c American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2018.

In this study, we first aimed to evaluate the effect of bright light exposure before bedtime on frontal lobe activity the following morning using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a Go/NoGo task. Second, we aimed to evaluate the effects of bright light exposure before bedtime on polysomnographic measures and on a frontal lobe function test the following morning. Methods: Twenty healthy, young males (mean age, 25.5?years) were recruited between September 2013 and August 2014. They were first exposed to control light (150 lux) before bedtime (from 20:00?h to 24:00?h) for 2?days and then to bright light (1,000 lux) before bedtime for an additional 5?days. We performed polysomnography (PSG) on the final night of each light exposure period (on nights 2 and night 7) and performed NIRS, which measures the concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (OxyHb and DeoxyHb, respectively), coupled with a Go/NoGo task the following morning (between 09:30?h and 11:30?h). The participants also completed frontal lobe function tests the following morning. Results: NIRS showed decreased hemodynamic activity (lower OxyHb and a tendency toward higher DeoxyHb concentration) in the right frontal lobe during the NoGo block after 1000-lux light exposure compared with that during the NoGo block after 150-lux light exposure. The commission error rate (ER) during the Go/NoGo task was higher after 1000-lux light exposure than that during the Go/NoGo task after 150-lux light exposure (1.24?±?1.09 vs. 0.6?±?0.69, P?=?0.002), suggesting a reduced inhibitory response. Conclusion: This study shows that exposure to bright light before bedtime for 5?days impairs right frontal lobe activation and response inhibition the following morning. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Artificial light; frontal lobe function; NIRS; response inhibition,"biological marker; deoxyhemoglobin; hemoglobin; oxyhemoglobin; adult; adverse event; blood; brain circulation; circadian rhythm; crossover procedure; executive function; frontal lobe; human; light; male; metabolism; near infrared spectroscopy; neuropsychological test; periodicity; polysomnography; radiation response; reaction time; sleep; time factor; vascularization; young adult; Activity Cycles; Adult; Biomarkers; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Circadian Rhythm; Cross-Over Studies; Executive Function; Frontal Lobe; Hemoglobins; Humans; Light; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxyhemoglobins; Polysomnography; Reaction Time; Sleep; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Time Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85044471290

We reported a case of ALK-positive ALCL with primary bone involvement, and reviewed the clinicopathological features of 22 previously reported cases. An ALCL with primary bone involvement mostly affects younger patients with a preponderant towards the involvement of axial-bone. The prognosis of an ALCL that primarily involves bone is unfavourable, compared with PBL generally.

In this research, we designed and evaluated a novel nanofiber nasal filter (NNF) capable of reducing personal exposure not only to large allergenic particles but also to ultrafine particles, thus reducing respiratory health risks. A new hybrid filter (HF) medium for the NNF was fabricated by overlaying a carbon filter substrate with nylon nanofibers produced by electrospinning. After optimizing the filter’s production parameters, the HF was produced using the Nylon-6 polymer solution with a concentration of 15 wt%, a substrate based on a MERV 5 carbon filter with a density of 61 kg m–3, and a nanofiber surface coating density of 0.72 g m–2 (or 0.54 g m–2 as a second choice). The new HF was tested with fluorescent polystyrene latex beads sized 0.026–3.1 ?m and at operating flow rates of 7.5–30 L min–1. The newly developed NNF showed more than a 90% collection efficiency for particles &gt; 1 ?m, representing bacteria and molds, and more than a 50% efficiency for particles &lt; 0.5 ?m, including ultrafine particles—about a 2.3-fold improvement compared to commercially available nasal filters. Thus, this NNF may serve as a useful tool to minimize our exposure to airborne pollutants. ?

Biomineralization is an important process in which living organisms produce biominerals, such as calcium phosphate (CaP), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and silica (SiO2), to strengthen their tissues, as found in the formation of bone and teeth. Introducing the artificial biomimetic mineralization process to nanobiotechnology has inspired researchers to develop smart stimuli-responsive nanoparticles for multiple purposes, such as improved therapeutic activity and activatable imaging of cancers. ?

The number of patients with cancer and socioeconomic costs of cancer continues to increase. SH003 is a novel herbal medicine consisting of Astragalus membranaceus, Angelica gigas and Trichosanthes Kirilowii Maximowicz. Preclinical studies have shown that SH003 has therapeutic anticancer effects. The aim of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of SH003 in patients with solid cancers. Methods and analysis This study is an open-label, dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of SH003. The traditional 3+3 dose-escalation design will be implemented. Patients with solid cancers will be recruited. According to dose level, the patients will receive one to four tablets of SH003, three times a day for 3 weeks. Toxicity will be evaluated using common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE). Dose-limiting toxicities are defined as grade 3 or higher adverse events based on CTCAE. The maximum tolerated dose will be determined by the highest dose at which no more than one of six patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the institutional review board of the Ajou University Hospital (reference AJIRB-MED-CT1-16-311).

Objective: This study aimed to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation management platform to improve physical activity and quality of life in patients with COPD. Methods: The study comprised the following 2 stages: (1) a pilot stage in which a prototype app was developed; and (2) a fully-fledged platform development stage in which 2 apps and 1 COPD patient monitoring website were developed. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of the apps developed in the second stage of the study. In addition, two 12-week exercise regimens (fixed and fixed-interactive) were tested for the trial. The clinical parameters of the respiratory function and patient global assessment (PGA) of the app were obtained and analyzed. Notably, Android was the chosen operating system for apps. Results: We developed 2 COPD rehabilitation apps and 1 patient monitoring website. For the clinical trial, 85 patients were randomized into the following 3 groups: 57 were allocated to the 2 intervention groups and 28 to the control group. After 6 weeks, the COPD assessment test scores were significantly reduced in the fixed group (P=.01), and signs of improvement were witnessed in the fixed-interactive group. In addition, the PGA score was moderate or high in all aspects of the user experience of the apps in both intervention groups. Conclusions: A well-designed mobile rehabilitation app for monitoring and managing patients with COPD can supplement or replace traditional center-based rehabilitation programs and achieve improved patient health outcomes. ?

This study is aimed to investigate treatment patterns of neuropathic pain in CLBP patients and to explore patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including quality of life (QoL) and functional disability by treatment patterns. Data were extracted from the neuropathic low back pain (NLBP) outcomes research. It was a multicenter and cross-sectional study in which 1200 patients were enrolled at 27 general hospitals, from 2014 to 2015. Of total, 478 patients classified as neuropathic pain were used for this subgroup analysis. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to treatment patterns (with vs. without the targeted therapy [TT] of neuropathic pain). Demographic and clinical features were collected by chart reviews and PROs were measured by patient’s survey. QoL was assessed by EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Functional disability was measured by the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (QBPDS). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to compare the PROs between TT group and non-targeted therapy (nTT) group. Among the NLBP patients (mean age 63years, female 62%), EQ-5D index, EuroQoL-Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS), and QBPDS Scores (mean ± standard deviation) were 0.40 ± 0.28, 54.98 ± 19.98, and 46.03 ± 21.24, respectively. Only 142 (29.7%) patients had pharmacological TT of neuropathic pain. Univariate analyses revealed no significant mean differences between TT group and nTT group in the EQ-5D index (0.41 ± 0.27 and 0.39 ± 0.28), EQ-VAS (56.43 ± 18.17 and 54.37 ± 20.69), and QBPDS (45.31 ± 21.32 and 46.31 ± 21.24). After adjustment with covariates, TT group had higher scores of EQ-5D index (b = 0.07; P < 0.01) and EQ-VAS (b = 4.59; P < 0.05) than the nTT group. The TT group’s QBPDS score was lower than the nTT group, although its statistical significance still has not been reached (b = 4.13; P = 0.07). We found that considerable proportion of the NLBP patients remains untreated or undertreated. Although TT group had significantly better QoL than nTT group, only 29.7% of NLBP patients had pharmacological TT. Therefore, clinicians should consider using TT for better QoL of neuropathic pain patients. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s).

Adult and maxillary rhabomyosarcoma with direct orbital extension has been rarely reported. To our knowledge, there is no reported case about adult patient with alveolar maxillary rhabdomyosarcoma and orbital extension survived 1 year with intact ocular function. Case presentation: A 21-year-old female presented with protrusion of the right eye and an obstructed nasal passage for the past month. Her symptoms were not relieved by oral antibiotic or irrigation. She was referred to our clinic. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a large homogenous well-enhanced mass with surrounding bony erosion and remodeling. The mass extended to the ipsilateral nasal cavity and orbit. Endoscopic biopsy of the nasal cavity confirmed alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The maxillary mass was excised using the Caldwell–Luc approach, and the orbital mass was excised using a transconjuctival and transcaruncular approach. A systemic work-up confirmed ipsilateral lymph node metastasis. The patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy with vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide, as well as 5120 cGy radiotherapy. Her ocular function was intact 1 year after treatment, and magnetic resonance imaging showed complete regression of the tumor. Conclusion: Rhabdomyosarcoma, which is usually an aggressive malignancy, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a rapidly growing orbital mass. Aggressive treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, can increase local remission rates and improve the prognosis. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s).

The purpose of this review was to discuss the current status of clinical research regarding the use of acupuncture as a part of traditional Korean medicine (KM) for various symptoms associated with breast cancer therapies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of acupuncture as a part of traditional KM to treat symptoms associated with breast cancer therapies. The following databases were searched for content up to February 2017: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, 4 Korean databases, and conference proceedings from major Korean medical societies. Results: Among the 1228 identified articles, 8 observational studies (3 case series and 5 case reports), and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) were included in this review. Among these studies, 3 investigated lymphedema, 2 investigated chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, 1 investigated hot flushes, 1 investigated constipation, and 2 investigated miscellaneous symptoms in breast cancer survivors; all studies concluded that acupuncture can alleviate the symptom in question. However, we identified only 1 relevant RCT, and the included studies had limitations in terms of reporting quality. Conclusion: There is a lack of conclusive evidence regarding the benefits of acupuncture for the treatment of breast cancer survivors in Korea. More rigorous RCTs are necessary in the future to establish stronger clinical evidence regarding the use of acupuncture to better reflect the clinical context of Korea.

There have been several clinical studies of its effects on allergic rhinitis (AR), but no trials comparing it with conventional treatment. We present the protocol for a feasibility trial to assess the safety and clinical effectiveness of SCRT in AR in comparison with cetirizine. Methods and analysis: This is a randomized, open-label, cetirizine-controlled clinical trial. A total of 30 AR patients who have signed informed consent forms will be recruited and randomly assigned to SCRT or cetirizine groups at a 1:1 ratio. The participants will visit the clinical research center every week and receive SCRT granules or cetirizine tablets. SCRT will be taken twice daily, cetirizine will be taken once daily, and treatment medication will be taken for 2 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, at week 2, and at week 4 after random allocation. The primary outcome will be the mean change in the total nasal symptom score from baseline to week 2. Secondary outcome measures will include the mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire and total serum immunoglobulin E. To assess the safety of SCRT, a liver and renal function test will be conducted before and after treatment, and the participants will be asked about any occurrence of adverse events at every visit. The recruitment rate, completion rate, and medication adherence will also be calculated to assess feasibility. Discussion: The findings of this study are expected to provide the basis for a full-scale randomized controlled trial to confirm the safety and effectiveness of SCRT for the treatment of nasal symptoms in patients with AR patients not controlled by conventional therapy. Trial registration: This study has been registered at the Korean National Clinical Trial Registry, Clinical Research Information Service (KCT0002380). ? 2018 the Author(s).

However, the ability of proteinuria parameters measured at various time periods to predict renal outcomes is unclear. Method This observational cohort study included 165 non-diabetic hypertensive CKD patients who took olmesartan medoxomil. We measured the albuminuria at five different time points (0, 2, 4, 26, and 38 months) and the mean levels. The mean albuminuria levels were calculated during 0–4 months, 0–26 months, and 0–38 months. The renal outcome was defined as a decline in eGFR 40% during the entire study period. Result The albuminuria at five different time points and the mean albuminuria levels were independent risk factors for a worse renal outcome after adjusting for age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at enrollment and were able to predict the renal outcome, although the performance of the estimation tended to be more effective using the mean albuminuria level at the 38-month follow-up time point. The risk of a decline in eGFR 40% was increased by 1.690-folds [95% CI 1.110–2.572, P = 0.014] per 500 mg/day increase in the mean albuminuria at 38 months. With a cut-off value of 897 mg/day for mean albuminuria at 38 months after treatment, a decline in eGFR 40% was predicted with a sensitivity of 88.9% and specificity of 81.3%. The ability of albuminuria to predict a renal event at different measurement points does not differ in CKD patients. Conclusion The time-averaged albuminuria cut-off of 900 mg/day during the 3-year follow-up period showed high sensitivity and specificity for predicting a decline in eGFR 40% in CKD patients, although the albuminuria at different measurement points did not predict a worse renal outcome. ? 2018 Yu et al.

Because lifestyles and body composition are quite different between Western and Asian countries, there is an urgent need to establish normative grip strength values for individuals of Asian descent. This study presents normative data for hand grip strength in a Korean population-representative sample. Methods A sample of 11,073 individuals (age 10–80 years) was included from the Sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2014–2015. Isometric grip strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer. Relative grip strength was calculated as the maximum absolute grip strength divided by body mass index. Means, standard error, and quintiles for grip strength and relative grip strength were analyzed per 5-year age group for each sex. To create growth charts for grip strength and relative grip strength, parametric quantile regression was used. Results In males, absolute grip strength increased quickly starting from 10 years of age until approximately 20 years of age. In females, there was gradual growth until approximately 15 years of age. Grip strength continued to increase until a peak between ages 30 and 39 years, and then declined from midlife onwards in both sexes. Our data showed that the prevalence of weak grip strength increased rapidly in late adult life based on a T-score of -2 standard deviations below the sex-specific peak mean (equivalent to 33 kg in males and 20 kg in females). Approximately 20% of subjects had weak grip strength at age 65–69 years. Conclusion This was the first study to establish normative reference values for grip strength across the lifespan in a Korean population aged 10–80 years. Percentiles of grip strength will inform clinical assessments and will help identify thresholds for the identification of muscle weakness. ? 2018 Kim et al.

The basic reproduction number and the global stability of the virus free equilibrium is carried out. The model is modified to include anti-retroviral treatment interventions and the controlled reproduction number is explored. Their effects on the HIV infection dynamics are investigated. Two different disease stage scenarios are assessed: early-stage and advanced-stage of the disease. Furthermore, optimal control theory is employed to enhance healthy CD4+ T cells, active cytotoxic immune cells and minimize the total cost of anti-retroviral treatment interventions. Two different anti-retroviral treatment interventions (RTI and PI) are incorporated. The results highlight the key roles of cytotoxic immune response in the HIV infection dynamics and corresponding optimal treatment strategies. It turns out that the combined control (both RTI and PI) and stronger immune response is the best intervention to maximize healthy CD4+ T cells at a minimal cost of treatments. ? 2018 by the authors.",Anti-retroviral treatment; Cytotoxic immune response; HIV transmission dynamics within a host; Optimal control theory,,2-s2.0-85051763196

However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1?XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1?XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-κB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"caspase 8; etoposide; fluorouracil; fn1 protein; gamma interferon; gelatinase B; glutathione transferase; heat shock cognate protein 70; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin heavy chain; interferon regulatory factor 1; interferon regulatory factor 3; interferon regulatory factor 7; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein; PUMA protein; Ras protein; small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; stress activated protein kinase 1; tnc protein; transcription factor RelA; tubulin; tumor necrosis factor; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; X linked inhibitor of apoptosis; X linked inhibitor of apoptosis associated factor 1; cytokine; etoposide; fluorouracil; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interferon regulatory factor 1; IRF1 protein, human; protein binding; signal peptide; small interfering RNA; tumor protein; XAF1 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; carboxy terminal sequence; carcinogenesis; cell stress; complex formation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; enzyme activation; histone ubiquitination; human; human cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; positive feedback; priority journal; promoter region; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; protein interaction; transcription initiation; tumor cell; tumor growth; tumor regression; animal; carcinogenesis; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; nude mouse; RNA interference; tumor cell line; ubiquitination; Animals; Apoptosis; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytokines; Etoposide; Fluorouracil; Humans; Interferon Regulatory Factor-1; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Proteins; NF-kappa B; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Ubiquitination",2-s2.0-85050645869

We evaluate whether door-to-balloon time (DBT) is associated with cardiac mortality in patients with total occlusion of the LCX. Patients and methods From the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry, patients with AMI who had total occlusion with a Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade of 0 were included. We determined the factors for delay in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (DBT>90 min) and evaluated cardiac mortality for a median period of 14 months. Results Mean DBT was 68 min (interquartile range=50-156 min), and the achievement rate of DBT less than or equal to 90 min was 66.9% in the entire study population. More than half of patients with total occlusion of LCX were presented as NSTEMI (57.7%). Among patients with total occlusion of the LCX, the mean DBT was 136 min (interquartile range=60-484 min), and the achievement rate of DBT less than or equal to 90 min was 42.8%. On multivariate analysis, LCX occlusion was an important factor for DBT more than 90 min (odds ratio: 1.766, P<0.001). Among patients with LCX occlusion, cardiac mortality was higher in patients with ST-segment elevation (6.2 vs. 11.0%, P=0.024). Conclusion This study showed that LCX occlusion was a significant factor for the delay in primary percutaneous coronary intervention on account of presenting as NSTEMI.

This is especially critical in patients with colorectal cancer, which requires a delicate combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy in order to achieve optimal outcome. In this study, we investigated the potential of phosphatidylserine-recognizing peptide 1 (PSP1) as an apoptosis-targeting probe, which identifies phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces. We first screened colon cancer cell lines for their sensitivity to radiation and selected two cell lines: HCT116 and HT29. Cell binding assay using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and optical imaging showed that HCT116 cells had better binding to PSP1 than HT29 cells. Thus, mouse xenograft model using HCT116 cells was generated and was topically irradiated with either single or fractionated dose of radiation followed by systemic administration of PSP1 for subsequent molecular optical imaging. We confirmed that the PSP1 probe was selectively bound to apoptosis-induced tumor in a radiation dose-dependent manner. We also observed that fractionated radiation regimen, which is recently being used in clinical situation, was more effective in inducing tumor apoptosis than corresponding single-dose radiation treatment. We then evaluated the correlation between tumor targeting of PSP1 and suppression effect of tumor development and found that tumor volume and fluorescence intensity were correlated before (correlation coefficient r2 = 0.534) and after (r2 = 0.848) radiation therapy. Our study shows that PSP1 peptide is an efficient index probe for deciding “go or no-go” for radiation therapy in colorectal cancer. ? 2018 The Authors",,fluorescent dye; peptide; phosphatidylserine recognizing peptide 1; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; binding assay; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer screening; carcinogenesis; cell surface; colorectal cancer; controlled study; fluorescence activated cell sorting; fluorescence imaging; HCT 116 cell line; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; infrared radiation; male; molecular imaging; mouse; nonhuman; radiation; radiation dose; radiation induced apoptosis; sensitivity analysis; tumor volume; tumor xenograft; TUNEL assay,2-s2.0-85049447368

Anti-thyroid drugs, including methimazole, are the most commonly selected treatment option for this condition. But for decades, no additional drug option has been added. Anemarrhena Bunge has been used in many herbal decoctions for patients who had hyperthyroidism-like symptoms, such as sweating, heat intolerance, and anxiety. In this case study, a patient with GD who had once achieved therapeutic goals with methimazole but then re-developed hyperthyroidism was treated with only herbal decoctions, and achieved euthyroidism, normalization of T3, T4 levels for 13 months and maintenance of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels for 8 months and TSH binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII)-negative status for 13 months (TSH and TBII level before treatment: 0.01 μIU/mL, 10.94 IU/L; TSH level normalization after 14 months from the initiation of the treatment: 0.75 μIU/mL, TBII level normalization after 9 months from the initiation of the treatment: 0.8 IU/L). The patient did not report any adverse effects related to this treatment. A herbal decoction with Anemarrhena Bunge might be effective in patients who are resistant to methimazole treatments, a finding which needs further investigation in future. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Anemarrhena bunge; Case report; Graves’ disease; Herbal decoction; Thyroid stimulating hormone; TSH binding inhibitory immunoglobulins,Anemarrhena bunge extract; autoantibody; diazepam; liothyronine; plant extract; thiamazole; thyrotrophin binding inhibitor immunoglobulin; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; plant extract; thiamazole; adult; Anemarrhena; Anemarrhena bunge; antibody blood level; Article; case report; clinical article; differential diagnosis; drug treatment failure; female; Graves disease; human; liothyronine blood level; recurrent disease; thyrotoxicosis; thyrotropin blood level; thyroxine blood level; treatment duration; treatment response; drug resistance; Graves disease; Adult; Anemarrhena; Drug Resistance; Female; Graves Disease; Humans; Methimazole; Plant Extracts,2-s2.0-85048718763

Present study reports GRP78-based design of novel anticancer agents using in-silico methods. As a first step toward the work, the interactions between GRP78 and 15 known ligands were modeled by docking simulation. The docked complex, GRP78-13, superior to other compounds with respect to its experimental activity and energy descriptors, was deduced into a structure-based pharmacophore. This hypothesis was applied as a screening filter to Asinex and Chemdiv databases. Finally, 23 hits were tested in vitro. Among these, VH1019 and VH1011 induced a concentration-dependent strong broad antiproliferative effect in glioma (U87-MG), breast cancer (MCF-7), and prostate cancer (DU-145) cell lines as compared to nontumorigenic control, neonatal foreskin fibroblast (HFF-1). These compounds showed preferential growth inhibition of cancer cells over normal cells.

In the present study, the protective effects of sciadopitysin against MG-induced oxidative cell damage were investigated in the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cell line, RIN-m5F cells. When exposed to MG for 48?hours, RIN-m5F cells experienced significant loss of viability and impaired insulin secretion; however, treatment with sciadopitysin protected RIN-m5F cells against MG-induced cell death and decreased insulin secretion. Treatment of RIN-m5F cells with sciadopitysin prevented MG-induced production of interleukin-1β, intracellular reactive oxygen species and cardiolipin peroxidation. Furthermore, sciadopitysin increased adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of RIN-m5F cells. Treatment of cells with sciadopitysin increased the activity of glyoxalase I and decreased the levels of MG-protein adducts, indicating that sciadopitysin protects against MG-induced protein glycation by increasing MG detoxification. Taken together, the results indicated the potential utility of sciadopitysin as an intervention against MG-induced cell damage in pancreatic β-cells.

However, no pathophysiology has been proposed. The purpose of this study is to present a review of the anatomical distribution of accessory skin appendages and provide a comprehensive review of their pathophysiology based on embryological development. Methods: We present four cases of a protruding skin appendage of the nasal columella or nostril sill. All lesions were present from birth with no family history of skin appendages. Three patients underwent surgical excision under local anesthesia. Results: The lesions were located at the upper and lower lateral borders of the nasal columella and the medial and lateral borders of the nostril sill. There has been no sign of recurrence over a mean follow-up of 11 months. Conclusions: Any obstacle or injury during the migration process of embryonic development may result in maldevelopment. If an obstacle or injury occurs during the medial migration of the medial nasal process, congenital polypoid remnant tissue may remain along the migration route, resulting in an accessory skin appendage of the nasal columella. The location of the accessory columellas ranged from the nostril sill to the soft triangle along the anterior border of the medial crus of the alar cartilage. These anatomical distributions correspond exactly to the migration route of the medial nasal process during embryonic development. We believe that it supports our suggested pathophysiology. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Congenital accessory skin appendage; Embryology; Lateral nasal process; Medial nasal process; Nasal columella,"anatomical variation; Article; bilateral cleft lip; case report; clinical article; congenital accessory skin appendage; congenital skin disease; craniofacial synostosis; embryo development; female; human; infant; local anesthesia; male; newborn; nose ala; nose cartilage; pathophysiology; priority journal; skin appendage; abnormalities; congenital skin disease; nose septum; Anatomic Variation; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Nasal Septum; Skin Abnormalities",2-s2.0-85042214393

A LEMON method which consists of following assessments; Look-Evaluate-Mallampati-Obstruction-Neck mobility is a fast and easy technique to evaluate patients' airways in the emergency situation. And a modified LEMON method, which excludes the Mallampati classification from the original LEMON score, also can be used clinically. We investigated the relationship between modified LEMON score and intubation difficulty score in adult trauma patients undergoing emergency surgery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records of 114 adult trauma patients who underwent emergency surgery under general anesthesia. All patients' airways were evaluated according to the modified LEMON method before anesthesia induction and after tracheal intubation; the intubating doctor self-reported the intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score. A difficult intubation group was defined as patients who had IDS scores >5. Results: The modified LEMON score was significantly correlated with the IDS score (P<0.001). The difficult intubation group showed higher modified LEMON score than the non-difficult intubation group (3 [2-5] vs. 2 [1-3], respectively, P=0.017).

This study aimed to investigate whether Jawoongo ameliorates Atopic dermatitis (AD)-like pathology in mice and to understand its underlying cellular mechanisms. Methods: AD was induced by 2, 4-Dinitrocholrlbenzene (DNCB) in BALB/c mice. Treatment with Jawoongo was assessed to study the effect of Jawoongo on AD in mice. Histological Analysis, blood analysis, RT-PCR, western blot analysis, ELISA assay and cell viability assay were performed to verify the inhibitory effect of Jawoongo on AD in mice. Results: We found that application of Jawoongo in an ointment form on AD-like skin lesions on DNCB-exposed BALB/c mice reduced skin thickness and ameliorated skin infiltration with inflammatory cells, mast cells and CD4+ cells. The ointment also reduced the mRNA levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-13 and TNF-α in the sensitized skin. Leukocyte counts and the levels of IgE, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 were decreased in the blood of the DNCB-treated mice. Furthermore, studies on cultured cells demonstrated that Jawoongo exhibits anti-inflammatory activities, including the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression, nitric oxide (NO) production, and inflammation-associated molecule levels in numerous types of agonist-stimulated innate immune cell, including human mast cells (HMC-1), murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells, and splenocytes isolated from mice. Conclusion: These findings indicate that Jawoongo alleviates DNCB-induced AD-like symptoms via the modulation of several inflammatory responses, indicating that Jawoongo might be a useful drug for the treatment of AD. ? 2018 The Author(s).","2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene; Atopic dermatitis; Cytokine; Inflammation; Jawoongo","antiinflammatory agent; cytokine; herbaceous agent; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; jawoongo; messenger RNA; nitric oxide synthase; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; 1 chloro 2,4 dinitrobenzene; antiinflammatory agent; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 13; interleukin 6; plant extract; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal cell culture; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; atopic dermatitis; Bagg albino mouse; blood analysis; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell infiltration; cell isolation; cell viability assay; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug effect; drug mechanism; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme synthesis; histology; HMC-1 cell line; inflammatory cell; innate immunity; leukocyte count; male; mast cell; mouse; nonhuman; ointment; protein expression; RAW 264.7 cell line; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; skin defect; skin sensitization; skinfold thickness; spleen cell; Western blotting; Angelica; animal; atopic dermatitis; chemically induced; chemistry; genetics; human; immunology; Lithospermum; macrophage; Angelica; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dinitrochlorobenzene; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Interleukin-13; Interleukin-6; Lithospermum; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Plant Extracts; RAW 264.7 Cells; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85050014637

Despite frequent food-borne outbreaks of V. parahaemolyticus, only 19 strains have subjected to complete whole-genome analysis. In this study, a novel strain of V. parahaemolyticus, designated FORC_022 (Food-borne pathogen Omics Research Center_022), was isolated from soy sauce marinated crabs, and its genome and transcriptome were analyzed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms. FORC_022 did not include major virulence factors of thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh) and TDH-related hemolysin (trh). However, FORC_022 showed high cytotoxicity and had several V. parahaemolyticus islands (VPaIs) and other virulence factors, such as various secretion systems (types I, II, III, IV, and VI), in comparative genome analysis with CDC_K4557 (the most similar strain) and RIMD2210633 (genome island marker strain). FORC_022 harbored additional virulence genes, including accessory cholera enterotoxin, zona occludens toxin, and tight adhesion (tad) locus, compared with CDC_K4557. In addition, O3 serotype specific gene and the marker gene of pandemic O3:K6 serotype (toxRS) were detected in FORC_022. The expressions levels of genes involved in adherence and carbohydrate transporter were high, whereas those of genes involved in motility, arginine biosynthesis, and proline metabolism were low after exposure to crabs. Moreover, the virulence factors of the type III secretion system, tad locus, and thermolabile hemolysin were overexpressed. Therefore, the risk of foodborne-illness may be high following consumption of FORC_022 contaminated crab. These results provided molecular information regarding the survival and pathogenesis of V. parahaemolyticus FORC_022 strain in contaminated crab and may have applications in food safety. ? 2018 Chung, Lee, Na, Lee, Ryu, Yoon, Lee, Kim, Kim, Jeong, Kim and Choi.",Crab; FORC_022; Genomic comparison; Transcriptome; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Virulence factors; Whole genome sequencing,arginine; cholera toxin; hemolysin; transcriptome; virulence factor; Article; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; bacterial survival; bacterium isolation; controlled study; crab; gene locus; gene overexpression; genome analysis; marker gene; nonhuman; pathogenesis; transcriptomics; type III secretion system; Vibrio parahaemolyticus,2-s2.0-85049631444

Furthermore, recently our study showed that anticancer drug has antiallergic inflammatory effect. An anticancer agent ABT-737 is an inhibitor of Bcl-2 and has an anti-inflammatory effect. However, the antiallergic inflammatory activity of ABT-737 is still unknown. Here, we aimed to explore the anti-atopic dermatitis (AD) activity and the mechanism of ABT-737 in AD models. Materials and methods: HaCaT cells were used for in vitro experiments. To evaluate the effect of ABT-737 in vivo model, BalB/c mice were orally administered ABT-737 for 6 weeks in 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced AD-like murine model. Major assays were enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reverse transcription-PCR, caspase-1 assay, histamine assay, and H&E staining. Results: ABT-737 significantly decreased thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) secretion and caspase-1 activity in activated HaCaT cells. In DNFB-induced AD mice, oral administration of ABT-737 alleviated clinical severity and scratching behavior. ABT-737 decreased levels of AD-related biomarkers including IgE, histamine, TSLP, and inflammatory cytokines. In addition, ABT significantly reduced caspase-1 activity in skin lesions of AD mice. Discussion and conclusions: ABT-737 elicited an anti-AD activity via suppression of caspase-1 activation in AD in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, this study provides important information regarding the use of anticancer drugs for controlling allergic inflammatory diseases. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",ABT-737; anti-cancer agent; atopic dermatitis; caspase-1; thymic stromal lymphopoietin,"4 [4 (4' chloro 2 biphenylylmethyl) 1 piperazinyl] n [4 [3 dimethylamino 1 (phenylthiomethyl)propylamino] 3 nitrobenzenesulfonyl]benzamide; biological marker; histamine; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; ABT-737; biphenyl derivative; caspase inhibitor; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; nitrophenol; piperazine derivative; sulfonamide; animal behavior; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; atopic dermatitis; cell activation; controlled study; cytokine release; disease severity; enzyme inhibition; female; HaCat cell line; human; human cell; immunopathogenesis; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; priority journal; scratching; treatment duration; animal; atopic dermatitis; Bagg albino mouse; cell culture; chemically induced; disease model; drug effect; enzyme activation; enzymology; keratinocyte; metabolism; pathology; Animals; Biphenyl Compounds; Caspase 1; Caspase Inhibitors; Cells, Cultured; Dermatitis, Atopic; Disease Models, Animal; Enzyme Activation; Female; Keratinocytes; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Nitrophenols; Piperazines; Sulfonamides",2-s2.0-85049145017

MSCs exert their effect through multi-lineage differentiation, immunosuppression, and anti-apoptosis, as proven in diseases like diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. However, transplantation of MSCs has some limitations; donor age plays an important role in determining their therapeutic activity. Aged MSCs have low proliferative and paracrine potential. Moreover, long-term culture in vitro triggers cellular senescence. Thus, a strategy to enhance cellular activity and block senescence during ex vivo culture is needed to develop efficacious MSC-based therapies. Methods: In this study, we examined the beneficial role of Substance P (SP) on paracrine activity in human bone marrow-derived MSCs from young or aged donors. During ex vivo culture, MSCs were treated with SP and their proliferation rates, cumulative cell numbers, cytokine profiles, and multi-differentiation abilities were analyzed. Results: In MSCs derived from young donors, longterm culture inhibited proliferation and cytokine secretion (TGF-β and VEGF), which were alleviated by the addition of SP. SP had a marked positive effect on the activity of aged MSCs. Conclusion: Collectively, SP can block the loss of therapeutic potential of MSCs by preserving their proliferative and paracrine potential. This study indicates the potential of SP as a supplement in stem cell culture for therapy. ? 2018, The Korean Society of Toxicogenomics and Toxicoproteomics and Springer Nature B.V.",Senescence; Stem cells; Substance-P,substance P; transforming growth factor beta1; vasculotropin; Article; bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell; cell aging; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cytokine release; ex vivo study; human; human cell; immunosuppressive treatment; paracrine signaling; protein expression; stem cell culture,2-s2.0-85060327812

We focused on the larvae that are utilized as a medical insect for the treatment of skin damage in Europe and America. This study was to investigate the pharmacological activities of novel antibacterial peptides isolated from Hermetia illucens larvae against the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella dysenteriae. The larvae were immunized by probiotics (Lactobacillus casei) for 24 h. The hemolymph from the immunized larvae was fractionated through reverse-phase chromatography. Peptides were purified using HPLC and the coomassie blue staining, and identified using Nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS system. Antibacterial activities of the peptides were evaluated by turbidometric assay, liquid broth dilution assay, resazurin assay, and agar disk diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the peptides were measured as 150 μg/mL through the turbidometric, liquid broth dilution, and resazurin assays. The peptides effectively inhibited their growth/proliferation as well as the survival rate of the tested bacteria. Furthermore, the immunized larvae exhibited overexpression of the peptides compared to non-immunized larvae. These results demonstrate that the peptides induced by H. illucens exert strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The results suggest that the activation of the humoral immunity induced by immunization functioned to enhance the production of antibacterial peptides from the insect and their antibacterial properties. This study indicates the potential of the peptides produced from larvae as antibacterial peptide substance for the development of novel antibacterial drugs. ? 2017 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",antibacterial peptide; immunization; Klebsiella pneumoniae; probiotics,,2-s2.0-85050623739

The gastrointestinal endoscopy satisfaction questionnaire (GESQ) was recently developed to assess patient satisfaction undergoing GIE in Europe; however, it was not validated in Asian countries. We aimed to translate and validate the GESQ in Korea and identify predictors for patient satisfaction during GIE. Translation of the original GESQ was performed according to accepted linguistic validation guidelines. Between March 2016 and July 2016, 350 consecutive patients were asked to complete a GESQ after GIE at Kyung Hee University Hospital. Total sum of scores was transformed from 0 to 100 by the formula: (Score-lowest possible/Score range) 100. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for construct validation reconfirmed that 4 factors were extracted from the Korean GESQ. Internal consistency reliability was acceptable with an overall Cronbach a score of 0.87. Female and nonsmoker were associated with less satisfaction with GIE (P = .021 and .006, respectively). Other factors, including age, alcohol, education or economic level, sedative endoscopy, gastroscopy with or without colonoscopy, experience of previous endoscopy, and additional examinations such as biopsy, were not associated with patient satisfaction during GIE. The Korean version of the GESQ was a valid and acceptable tool to measure satisfaction in patients who had undergone a GIE in Korea.

However, they undergo extensive cell cycle and expansion upon bone marrow transplantation or haematopoietic injury to reestablish the haematopoietic system. Molecular basis for the HSC activation and expansion is not completely understood. Here, we review the recent study elucidating the role of the developmentally critical Ets transcription factor Etv2 in reestablishing haematopoietic system upon injury through promoting HSC regeneration. Recent findings We recently demonstrated that the ETS transcription factor Etv2, a critical factor for haematopoietic and vascular development, is also required for haematopoietic regeneration. Etv2, which is silent in homeostatic HSCs, was transiently activated in regenerating HSPCs and was required for the HSC expansion and regeneration following bone marrow transplantation or haematopoietic injury. As such, while Etv2 is dispensable for maintaining HSCs in steady states, it is required for emergency haematopoiesis. Summary Etv2 has been identified as a novel regulator of haematopoietic regeneration. Comprehensive understanding of the upstream regulators and downstream effectors of Etv2 in haematopoietic regeneration would be critical for fundamental understanding of haematopoietic stem cell biology, and the findings will be broadly applicable to clinical practice involving haematopoietic regenerative medicine; bone marrow transplantation, gene therapy and in-vitro HSC expansion. ?

We evaluated whether the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B1 (ADGRB1, formerly BAI1, brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1) might contribute to dopaminergic neuronal loss. We used bioinformatic analyses, as well as in vitro and in vivo PD models. We report in this study that ADGRB1 is decreased in PD and that the ADGRB1 level is specifically decreased in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice. In primary mouse mesencephalic neurons and human neuroblastoma cell lines, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP + ), a toxic metabolite of MPTP, suppressed the expression of ADGRB1. Moreover, we applied a network generation tool, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ? , with the transcriptomics dataset to extend the upstream regulatory pathway of ADGRB1 expression. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was predicted as a regulator, and consequently, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, a specific activator of AMPK, reduced the ADGRB1 protein level. Finally, ADGRB1 overexpression decreased nuclear condensation induced by MPP + treatment. Taken together, we observed that decreased ADGRB1 by activation of AMPK induced neuronal cell death in MPTP/MPP + -mediated PD models, suggesting that ADGRB1 might potentially play a survival role in the neurodegenerative pathway of PD. These data offer new insights into dopaminergic cell death with therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disorders. ?

Methods: Web-based self-report questionnaires were developed. Invitations to participate were emailed to physicians who diagnosed and treated CRC from October 1 to November 15, 2015. The questionnaire consisted of the role doctors played in the surveillance, examination of surveillance, and duration of postoperative surveillance according to CRC stage or primary site of the cancer. Results: Ninety-one physicians participated in the online survey, and 78 completed the survey. Sixty-seven participants (13%) answered “up to 5 years” for stage I surveillance duration; and 11 (13%) responded with a duration of > 5 years for stage I.

For these reasons, specific regimens for patients with HPV-positive oral and oropharyngeal cancer are needed. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers were re-analyzed and categorized from public database. Then, druggable targets to HPV-positive oral and oropharyngeal cancer were identified and were validated with E6/E7, which is oncogene of HPV, transfected oral and oropharyngeal cancer cell lines and HPV infected cell lines. In DEG analysis, HPV-positive oral and oropharyngeal cancer showed distinct disease entity from HPV-negative cancers. Unlike HPV-negative oral and oropharyngeal cancer, thymidylate synthase (TS) and topoisomerase II (Topo II) were overexpressed in HPV-positive cancers. Transfection of Lenti-virus containing E6/ E7 to HPV-negative oral and oropharyngeal cancer cells induced upregulation of TS and Topo II in those cells. Although cisplatin, which is standard regimen in head and neck cancers, showed more effectiveness in HPV-negative cells, 5-FU and pemetrexed, which are TS inhibitors, or etoposide, which is Topo II inhibitors, worked more effectively in HPV-positive cells. In addition, cisplatin/etoposide and cisplatin/pemetrexed combination regimens showed synergic effects in HPV-positive cells. Pemetrexed or etoposide alone, or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, can be used as novel substitutes in a regimen of concurrent chemoradiotherapy or a palliative regimen for HPV-positive oral and oropharyngeal cancer patients.

Early treatment of the disease is essential to prevent severe visual loss among patients. But there are few therapeutic options available for early stage diabetic retinopathy. We present the case of an early stage diabetic retinopathy patient presented with retinal hemorrhages in the superior temporal area and disc hemorrhages of disc nasal area. The patient was diagnosed with mild NPDR on fundus examinations. After 6 months of taking modified-Goshaiinkigan (mGJG), the characteristic features of mild NPDR disappeared. Throughout three consecutive years of follow-ups, no evident lesions that could be diagnosed as DR were found during fundus examinations. Many components of mGJG have potential efficacy toward diabetic retinopathy. This study suggests that mGJG is a possible medication for early stage DR. Concerning the degenerative characteristics of DR, early management strategies are important in young DM patients and integrative care, such as in this case, are worth investigating further. ? 2018 The Authors",case study; diabetic mellitus; herbal decoction; Modified-Goshajinkigan; non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy,"goshajinkigan; goshajinkigan; herbaceous agent; adult; Article; case report; case study; clinical article; diabetic retinopathy; drug withdrawal; dry eye; eye photography; follow up; human; male; non proliferative diabetic retinopathy; non proliferative diabetic retinopathy; priority journal; retina hemorrhage; angiosperm; blindness; chemistry; diabetic retinopathy; pathology; phytotherapy; Poria; retina; Adult; Blindness; Diabetic Retinopathy; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Humans; Magnoliopsida; Male; Phytotherapy; Poria; Retina",2-s2.0-85047095553

On the contrary, perineural spread in pelvic malignancies has been rarely reported. This is the first report on perineural spread of the obturator nerve and the lumbosacral plexus from primary vaginal cancer. Case Description: A 50-year-old woman diagnosed with infectious spondylitis at an outside hospital was referred to our institution. She presented with persistent lower back pain and right anterior thigh pain. Magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed primary vaginal cancer with metastatic lymphadenopathy and perineural spread of the lumbosacral plexus, including L3, L4 nerve roots and branches, and obturator nerve along with soft tissue masses in the right psoas and proximal adductor muscles. Conclusions: Clinical diagnosis of perineural spread in pelvic malignancies is difficult to establish, as it has nonspecific symptoms as an initial manifestation. Clinicians should recognize the possibility of perineural spread of malignancies if radiologic findings, such as thickening of lumbosacral nerves and perineural mass, are observed on magnetic resonance imaging.

Administration of DLE stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, leading to the improvement of gene and protein expression related with insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis in db/db mice. Morphological changes and insulin depletion of pancreatic islets were also attenuated by treatment of DLE. Moreover, DLE treatment prevented the deterioration of retina by regulating not only the gene expression related with apoptosis and neovascularization, but also the level of activator protein-1 in retina. Therefore, DLE improves diabetic phenotype and retinal degeneration, suggesting that DLE could be a prospective agent for preventing diabetes and related eye complication. ? 2018",AMP-activated protein kinase; Db/db mice; Dendropanax morbifera; Glucose transporter; Retinal degeneration; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,,2-s2.0-85046662928

Global lipid profiling of pooled serum samples from 10 patients currently with MDD (cMDD), 10 patients with remitted MDD (rMDD), and 10 healthy controls revealed 37 differentially regulated lipids (DRLs). DRLs were further verified using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) in each of the 25 samples from the three groups of independent cohorts. Using multivariate analysis and MRM data we identified serum biomarker panels of discriminatory lipids that differentiated between pairs of groups: lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)(16:1), triglycerides (TG)(44:0), and TG(54:8) distinguished cMDD from controls with 76% accuracy; lysophosphatidylcholines(16:1), TG(44:0), TG(46:0), and TG(50:1) distinguished between cMDD and rMDD at 65% accuracy; and LPA(16:1), TG(52:6), TG(54:8), and TG(58:10) distinguished between rMDD and controls with 60% accuracy.

HPV in situ hybridization (HPV ISH) and FGFR1 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed using tissue microarray from 89 cases of TSCC. Fourteen of 89 (15.7%) TSCC cases had FGFR1 amplification, and HPV was detected in 59 of 89 (66.3%) cases. FGFR1 amplification status was not associated with HPV positivity (p=0.765). Outcomes were not significantly different between FGFR1 amplified and non-amplified patients. Although FGFR1 amplified patients (n=4) in the HPV ISH–negative group (n=30) had a tendency for poorer overall survival, no statistical significance was identified (p=0.150, log-rank).

However, immunological parameters induced by co-infection with these parasites remain unknown. In this study, for the first time, we investigated immunological profiles induced by co-infection with C. hepatica (CH) in C. sinensis (CS)-infected rats (Sprague-Dawley). Rats were infected primarily with 50 metacercariae of C. sinensis; 4 weeks later, they were subsequently infected with 1000 infective C. hepatica eggs. Significantly higher levels of C. sinensis- or C. hepatica-specific IgG antibodies were found in the sera of rats. Interestingly, no cross-reacting antibody was observed between C. sinensis and C. hepatica infections. Significantly raised eosinophil levels were found in the blood of C. sinensis/C. hepatica co-infected rats (CS + CH) compared to the blood of rats infected singly with C. sinensis. Co-infected rats showed significantly higher levels of lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production compared to a single C. sinensis infection. The worm burden of C. sinensis was significantly reduced in co-infected rats compared to the single C. sinensis infection. These results indicate that the eosinophils, lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production induced by subsequent infection with C. hepatica in C. sinensis-infected rats might contribute to the observed C. sinensis worm reduction. ?

Thus, protection of hepatocytes against alcohol-induced death is considered to be a critical approach to prevent development of liver disease. Substance P (SP) is capable of promoting cell proliferation and blocking cell death under diverse stresses, leading to beneficial effects in severe diseases, and is therefore likely to have a therapeutic application in hepatic injury. Main methods: To assess its effects on ethanol-induced hepatic damage in vitro and in vivo, SP was administered to ethanol-treated hepatocytes and a mouse model of this condition, respectively. The effect of SP was assessed based on cell viability, apoptosis, and Akt/GSK-3β signaling, and mouse liver histology and serum biochemical parameters. Key findings: SP was found to prevent hepatocyte death due to ethanol-induced oxidative stress by upregulating Akt/GSK-3β activation in vitro. In vivo, ethanol treatment elevated levels of serum alanine transaminase and also increased the number of apoptotic cell, exhibiting lipid accumulation in liver tissue, effects that were entirely negated by SP treatment. Taken together, our results revealed that SP is able to block hepatic damage due to ethanol-induced oxidative stress and exerts therapeutic effects in liver disease, including ALD. Our findings identify SP treatment as a potential therapy for hepatic damage. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Alcohol; Hepatotoxicity; Oxidative stress; Substance P,"alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alcohol; aspartate aminotransferase; fatty acid; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; protein kinase B; substance P; triacylglycerol; substance P; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; alcohol liver disease; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cell death; cell proliferation; cell stress; cell viability; controlled study; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; fatty acid blood level; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid storage; liver cell; liver protection; liver tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; signal transduction; triacylglycerol blood level; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; drug effect; toxic hepatitis; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Ethanol; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oxidative Stress; Signal Transduction; Substance P",2-s2.0-85046633735

Despite its increasing prevalence, the underlying pathogenesis still remains unclear, and treatment is generally symptomatic. Recently, numerous therapeutic options, including growth factors, stem cells, and gene therapy, were investigated in hopes of enhancing the healing potency of the degenerative tendon. However, the majority of these research studies were conducted only on animal models or healthy human tenocytes. Despite some studies using pathological tenocytes, to the best of our knowledge there is currently no protocol describing how to obtain human degenerative tenocytes. The aim of this study is to describe a standard protocol for acquiring human degenerative tenocytes. Initially, the tendon tissue was harvested from a patient with lateral epicondylitis during surgery. Then biopsy samples were taken from the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon corresponding to structural changes observed at the time of surgery. All of the harvested tendons appeared to be dull, gray, friable, and edematous, which made them visually distinct from the healthy ones. Tenocytes were cultured and used for experiments. Meanwhile, half of the harvested tissues were analyzed histologically, and it was shown that they shared the same key features of tendinopathy (angiofibroblastic dysplasia or hyperplasia). A secondary analysis by immunocytochemistry confirmed that the cultured cells were tenocytes with the majority of the cells having positive stains for mohawk and tenomodulin proteins. The qualities of the degenerative nature of tenocytes were then determined by comparing the cells with the healthy control using a proliferation assay or qRT-PCR. The degenerative tenocyte displayed a higher proliferation rate and similar gene expression patterns of tendinopathy that matched previous reports. Overall, this new protocol might provide a useful tool for future studies of tendinopathy. ? 2018, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

This observational study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of letrozole in postmenopausal Korean women with operable breast cancer. Methods: Self-reported quality of life (QoL) scores were serially assessed for 3 years during adjuvant letrozole treatment using the Korean version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast questionnaires (version 3). Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and serum cholesterol levels were also examined. Results: All 897 patients received the documented informed consent form and completed a baseline questionnaire before treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 684 (76.3%) subjects, and 410 (45.7%) and 396 (44.1%) patients had stage I and II breast cancer, respectively. Each patient completed questionnaires at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after enrollment. Of 897 patients, 749 (83.5%) completed the study. The dropout rate was 16.5%. The serial trial outcome index, the sum of the physical and functional well-being subscales, increased gradually and significantly from baseline during letrozole treatment (p< 0.001). The mean serum cholesterol level increased significantly from 199 to 205 after 36 months (p= 0.042). The mean BMD significantly decreased from –0.39 at baseline to –0.87 after 36 months (p< 0.001). Conclusion: QoL gradually improved during letrozole treatment. BMD and serum cholesterol level changes were similar to those in Western countries, indicating that adjuvant letrozole treatment is well tolerated in Korean women, with minimal ethnic variation. ? 2018 Korean Breast Cancer Society.

EFAA showed potent protective effects against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity through 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), 2′,3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the assay medium. EFAA treatment reduced the intracellular ROS level and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the mitochondria, and increased cell viability in Aβ-induced neuroblastoma MC-IXC cells. The administration of EFAA significantly attenuated Aβ-induced learning and memory deficits, which were evaluated by Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. Furthermore, EFAA showed the ameliorating effect of cholinergic functions by increasing acetylcholine (ACh) levels and decreasing acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and protected antioxidant systems by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreasing the oxidized glutathione (GSH)/total GSH and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the brain. Finally, EFAA prevented mitochondrial dysfunction via regulating apoptotic signaling molecules including phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), Bax, and cytochrome c in the brain tissues. Therefore, the present study suggests that EFAA might be a potential source of natural antioxidants with the ability to ameliorate Aβ-induced amnesia. ? 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Antioxidants; Brain; Enzymes; Mitochondria; Phosphorylation; 3-(4 ,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 ,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Acetylcholinesterase; Dichlorofluorescein; Lactate dehydrogenase; Learning and memory; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Natural antioxidants; Superoxide dismutases; Mammals; amyloid beta protein; glutathione; malonaldehyde; plant extract; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; Actinidia; Alzheimer disease; animal; brain; chemistry; drug effect; fruit; genetics; human; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; isolation and purification; learning; male; maze test; memory; metabolism; mouse; oxidative stress; psychology; Actinidia; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Brain; Fruit; Glutathione; Humans; Learning; Male; Malondialdehyde; Maze Learning; Memory; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase",2-s2.0-85048943631

Methods: A total of 370 Japanese Americans (163 men, 207 women) with NFG levels and no history of diabetes, aged 34 to 75 years, were enrolled. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at baseline, 2.5, 5, and 10 years after enrollment.

This study describes female infertility treatment programs that used traditional Korean medicine (TKM) and were conducted by local governments in Korea and evaluates its effectiveness and safety. Methods: The authors officially requested related information from the report of the infertility treatment programs and related sources from 2006 to 2016 from the Health & Welfare Ministry of Korea and the Association of Korean Medicine (AKOM). Additional information was obtained from six Korean databases. Data including basic information about the programs, participant information, interventions, and outcomes were abstracted. Results: A total of 9 reports, including multiple years of data from 6 programs (total 13 programs), were identified. In these 13 programs, a total of 1023 female subjects participated, and 205 of the 887 subjects who completed the program reported a successful pregnancy, indicating a 23.1% pregnancy rate. The programs lasted 3-9 months, and interventional elements, such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, fumigation, and massage, were identified. Significant adverse effects were not reported. Conclusions: This study suggests that infertility treatment programs with TKM interventions exhibited a positive effect on pregnancy in females with infertility. Thus, the infertility treatment programs with TKM interventions are expected to be useful and might serve as the primary treatment before assisted reproduction techniques. ?

However, the normal gait patterns of healthy children and adolescents remain uncharacterized. We sought to determine normal foot kinematics according to age in clinically normal female children and adolescents using a Foot 3D model. Methods: Fifty-eight girls (age 7–17 years) with normal function and without radiographic abnormalities were tested. Three representative strides from five separate trials were analyzed. Kinematic data of foot segment motion were tracked and evaluated using an MFM with a 15-marker set (Foot 3D model). As controls, 50 symptom-free female adults (20–35 years old) were analyzed. Results: In the hindfoot kinematic analysis, plantar flexion motion in the pre-swing phase was significantly greater in girls aged 11 years or older than in girls aged <11 years, thereby resulting in a larger sagittal range of motion. Coronal plane hindfoot motion exhibited pronation, whereas transverse plane hindfoot motion exhibited increased internal rotation in girls aged <11 years. Hallux valgus angles increased significantly in girls aged 11 years or older. The foot progression angle showed mildly increased internal rotation in the loading response phase and the swing phase in girls aged <11 years old. Conclusion: The patterns of inter-segment foot motion in girls aged 11 years or older showed low-arch kinematic characteristics, whereas those in girls aged 11 years or older were more similar to the patterns in young adult women. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Adolescents; Children; Foot; Kinematics; Multi-segment foot models (MFMs),"abduction; adolescent; Article; child; controlled study; female; foot; forefoot; gait; hallux valgus angle; human; joint mobility; kinematics; motion; musculoskeletal system parameters; normal human; priority journal; pronation; range of motion; adult; biomechanics; computer simulation; cross-sectional study; foot; joint characteristics and functions; physiology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Child; Computer Simulation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Foot; Gait; Humans; Range of Motion, Articular; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85048701890

Methods: Ninety-eight patients undergoing otolaryngologic surgery were randomly divided into 2 groups: group L using 0.3 mg/kg of rocuronium intravenously (n = 49) and group C using 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium (n = 49). Sixty seconds after rocuronium administration, tracheal intubation was performed using a video laryngoscope. The overall intubation condition was evaluated along with specific conditions, including laryngoscopy condition, vocal cord position, and intubation response. Intubation profiles, including Cormack-Lehane grade, 1st attempt success rate, and intubation time, were also evaluated. Results: Overall intubation conditions showed a significant difference between group L and group C (P = .003). Although the incidence of vigorous response after tracheal intubation was higher in group L than in group C (P = .022), laryngoscopy condition and vocal cord position were similar between the 2 groups (P = .145 and.070, respectively). Intubation profiles showed no differences between the 2 groups. The frequency and amount of additional rocuronium administration during surgery were also similar. Conclusions: Low-dose rocuronium provided significantly worse overall intubation conditions compared to the conventional dose of rocuronium for rapid tracheal intubation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the antiviral effects of 30% ethanol extract of SO (SOE) and its major compounds (ziyuglycoside I and II) against HBV in HepG2.2.15 cells and HepG2 cells transfected with HBV genotype C. Methods: The antiviral activities of SOE were evaluated by ELISA and quantitative RT-PCR assay in in vitro models. In addition, its effect on HBsAg level was compared to entecavir (ETV), and its co-treatment with ETV was performed to observe combination efficacy. After HPLC analysis of ziyuglycoside I and II, the effects of those compounds on HBsAg levels were measured. Results: SOE, ziyuglycoside I, and II significantly reduced HBsAg excretion and the pgRNA levels in HepG2.2.15 cells. In particular, SOE treatment of 100 μg/ml showed an inhibitory effect on HBsAg excretion similar to the levels found with ETV treatment of the same concentration. Additional use of 125 μg/ml of SOE in combination with 80 μM of ETV inhibited HBsAg production up to the level that is diminished by 320 μM ETV treatment in HepG2.2.15 cells. Among SOE, ziyuglycoside I, II, and ETV, ziyuglycoside II had the lowest inhibitory concentration of 50% against genotype D, and it was more potent against HBV genotype C than D in down-regulating HBsAg secretion. Conclusion: Taken together, SOE noticeably inhibited replication and antigen secretion of HBV, which was at least in part attributed to ziyuglycoside II, thus presenting the possibility of developing therapeutic candidates for the treatment of HBV-related diseases. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Genotype C; Hepatitis B virus; HepG2.2.15; Sanguisorba officinalis; Ziyuglycoside I; Ziyuglycoside II,antivirus agent; circular DNA; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; plant extract; Sanguisorba officinalis extract; unclassified drug; ziyuglycoside i; ziyuglycoside ii; antiviral activity; Article; clinical evaluation; comparative study; concentration response; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug screening; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Hep-G2 cell line; Hep-G2/2.2.15 cell line; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; Hepatitis B virus genotype D; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; in vitro study; inhibitory concentration; male; priority journal; protein secretion; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Sanguisorba officinalis,2-s2.0-85047630607

In the extension study, ezetimibe 10 mg was also administered to subjects who had received rosuvastatin (5, 10, and 20 mg) alone in the main study, and the same treatment was continued for subjects who had received a combination of rosuvastatin with ezetimibe in the main study. Findings: At the end of the main study (week 8), LDL-C levels were significantly lower in subjects receiving combination therapy than in those receiving rosuvastatin monotherapy. Other lipid profiles also significantly improved in the combination therapy group. These improvements continued in the extension study. The combination therapy of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe was generally well tolerated. At the end of the main study, more subjects achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goal in the combination therapy group than in the monotherapy group. The increased dosage of rosuvastatin was also well tolerated in the combination treatment. Implications: Combination therapy of ezetimibe 10 mg with varying doses of rosuvastatin that are commonly used in the clinical field improved the lipid profile and allowed more subjects to reach the LDL-C goal in primary hypercholesterolemia compared with rosuvastatin monotherapy. In addition, the efficacy of the combination therapy was maintained for the extended period. Additional beneficial changes were also achieved with combination therapy even in patients who responded well to rosuvastatin monotherapy.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the traditional herbal medicine Gamiguibi-tang (GGBT) in patients with cancer-related sleep disturbance. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, wait-list-controlled, open-label pilot clinical trial on cancer-related sleep disturbance. Patients with cancer experiencing poor sleep quality with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index of at least 6 were randomly assigned to the GGBT and wait-list groups to receive GGBT and conventional care, respectively, for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score. Fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairment were assessed as the secondary endpoints by using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Results: Thirty participants who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled. Sleep disturbance assessed using the ISI improved significantly more in the GGBT group than in the wait-list group (?5.5 ± 4.4 vs 0.1 ± 1.1, P <.001). Fatigue level determined using the BFI also improved significantly more in the GGBT group than in the wait-list group (?0.8 ± 0.8 vs 0.0 ± 0.3, P =.002). The BDI and MoCA scores showed no significant changes. Adverse events were reported in two patients in the GGBT group and consisted of mild dyspepsia and mild edema. Conclusion: GGBT may be a potential treatment option for cancer-related sleep disturbance. Further research is needed to investigate the efficacy and safety of GGBT. ? 2017, ?

Hiziki extract increased alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized nodule formation in hPDL cell. In western blot analysis, hiziki extract resulted in increased expression of osteoblast markers, including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) in hDPL cells. Additionally, expression of osteoclast markers and inflammatory cytokines was inhibited, which were receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), RANK receptor (RANKL) and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). Hiziki extract also prevented alveolar bone loss in a ligature-induced periodontitis rat model through reducing the distance between cementoenamel junction and alveolar bone crest (CBJ-ABC) and furcation involvement.

Therefore, this study examined disturbed eating tendencies, health-related behaviors, and depressive symptoms among university students in Korea. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey on a total of 637 students (279 men and 358 women), and the Korean version of the Beck depression rating scale (K-BDI) was used to evaluate the students’ depression status. Results: Of the 637 students, 419 (65.8%) had no depressive symptoms (normal: K-BDI < 10), whereas 136 (21.4%: K-BDI 10–16), 69 (10.8%: K-BDI 17–29), and 13 (2.0%: K-BDI ? 30) had mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression showed that depressive symptoms (K-BDI ? 10) were associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR] = 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26 to 2.76; p =.002), high level of life stress (OR = 4.37, 95% CI = 2.23 to 8.55; p <.001), and disturbed eating behaviors (Korean version of Eating Attitude Test-26 ? 20; OR = 5.14, 95% CI = 2.52 to 10.5; p <.001).

Here, we ascertained whether HM0601 and its major compound rutin reduce proliferation of human mast cell line, HMC-1, under thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulation. Therapeutic rutin or HM0601 treatment considerably reduced proliferation of mast cells without exposing activated HMC-1 cells to any cytotoxicity. Reduced levels of mouse double minute 2 and phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 were accompanied by treatment with rutin or HM0601. In TSLP-stimulated cells, rutin or HM0601 treatment significantly impaired levels of interleukin (IL)-13 and Bcl2 expression. Notably, rutin or HM0601 treatment returned Bax and phosphorylated p53 protein levels and caspase-3 activities impaired by TSLP. In addition, levels of inflammatory cytokine were considerably reduced by treatment with rutin or HM0601 on TSLP-stimulated cells.

Methods: The responses of 406 caregivers of terminal cancer patients enrolled in a trial determining the efficacy of a decision aid focused on the disclosure of terminal disease status were included in this secondary analysis. The outcomes include the change scores of the Decision Conflict Scale (DCS) and depression and anxiety subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at the 1 and 3 months from baseline. The linear mixed model was employed to discover the impact of caregivers’ decisional role preference on the outcomes. Findings: Of the 406, 137 (33.7%) showed an active role preference and 269 (66.3%) showed a passive role preference. In the post hoc analysis of the adjusted differences of change scores between passive caregivers who received decision aid (passive-decision aid) and active caregivers with decision aid (active-decision aid), non-significant differences were observed in the DCS. However, at the 3-month, the change scores of the HADS depression subscale increased by 4.43 (effect size, 0.71) and those of the HADS anxiety subscale increased by 4.14 (effect size, 0.61) in the passive-decision aid group than in active-decision aid group, showing moderate to large difference.

Methods: Between January 2010 and July 2015, we retrospectively evaluated 383 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction, who underwent CT scans immediately after surgery, and who were available at 2 years of follow-up. The absence or presence of a Segond fracture was confirmed using CT. The following parameters were evaluated in all patients at the 2-year follow-up visit: clinical scores (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score) and knee joint stability (anterior drawer test, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation on Telos stress radiographs). Results: Among 383 patients with primary ACL tears, a Segond fracture was confirmed in 8.9% (n = 34) using 3-dimensional CT. We placed 349 patients into the group with ACL tears without Segond fractures (group A) and the other 34 into the group with ACL tears with Segond fractures (group B). Between the 2 groups, there were no significant differences in the postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score (P =.97), Lysholm score (P =.17), or Tegner activity score (P =.95).

This study evaluated the effect of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on survival outcomes in this rare malignancy. Methods: We identified patients who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed before and after propensity score matching. Results: Among the 701 eligible patients, 116 (17%) underwent PORT. There were no significant differences in OS and DSS according to receipt of PORT in the unmatched population (P?=?0.982 and 0.496, respectively), whereas the propensity-matched analysis showed improved OS and DSS with PORT (P?=?0.053 and 0.019, respectively). No receipt of PORT was an independent poor prognostic factor in multivariate analysis of both OS (P?=?0.022) and DSS (P?=?0.005). The potential survival benefits of PORT were observed in subgroups of T4 stage, larger tumor size, higher lymph node ratio, and total/radical resection. Conclusions: We provide useful insights into the therapeutic role of PORT in adenocarcinoma of the duodenum.

In the post hoc analysis, first peak KAMs were significantly lower during LOSS walking than during conventional shoe walking (p = 0.001), but there were no differences in peak KAMs between barefoot and LOSS walking (p = 0.784). In the subgroup analysis, patients with grades 2 and 3 OA showed significantly lower first peak KAMs during LOSS walking than during conventional shoe walking (p = 0.029 and p = 0.011, respectively). Both the peak eversion ankle angle and moment of barefoot walking showed a significant increase compared with LOSS and conventional shoe walking, while there was no significant difference between LOSS and conventional shoe walking (p = 0.612 and p = 0.197, respectively). Our results suggest that LOSS wearing caused significant KAM reductions compared with conventional shoe wearing. Since LOSS wearing does not cause changes in the peak eversion ankle angle and moment during the load response, it may be an effective method to reduce the KAM in women with knee OA. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

However, multiple cervical artery dissection simultaneously involving the anterior and posterior circulation is uncommon. Here, we would like to report a case of a patient with bilateral vertebral artery (VA) and internal carotid artery dissection (ICA) after a use of systemic steroid due to peripheral facial palsy. Case presentation: A 44-year-old man with hypertension visited emergency department due to recurrent vertigo. He was receiving methyl prednisolone for two weeks for the treatment of right peripheral type facial palsy which occurred after retro-orbital headache. Neurologic examination revealed severe ataxia at left side. Sensory for pain and temperature was declined in the right arm and leg. Diffusion-weighted image showed an acute ischemic lesion at the whole territory of posterior-inferior cerebellar artery. Severe stenosis was observed from bilateral VAs and ICAs on conventional magnetic resonance angiography. Intramural hematoma and intimal flap was observed from the high-resolution MRI. Conclusions: Peripheral type facial palsy is an unusual presentation of carotid dissection. Steroids aggravate arterial dissection by increasing blood pressure and blood vessel fragility by its negative effect on connective tissue strength. Use of steroid in patients with peripheral type facial palsy with severe headache may need caution. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Bell's palsy; Cervical artery dissection; Systemic steroid,"amlodipine; antithrombocytic agent; fimasartan; methylprednisolone; steroid; antiinflammatory agent; methyl prednisolonate; prednisolone; adult; artery dissection; Article; ataxia; Bell palsy; brain ischemia; case report; clinical article; digital subtraction angiography; disease severity; drug use; facial nerve paralysis; follow up; headache; hematoma; high resolution computer tomography; Horner syndrome; human; hypertension; internal carotid artery occlusion; male; medical history; miosis; neurologic disease assessment; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ptosis; recurrent disease; time of flight mass spectrometry; vertebral artery stenosis; vertigo; analogs and derivatives; carotid artery; complication; dissecting aneurysm; drug effect; facial nerve paralysis; pathophysiology; Adult; Aneurysm, Dissecting; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Carotid Arteries; Facial Paralysis; Humans; Male; Prednisolone",2-s2.0-85047635703

Despite the fact that increased α-SYN levels are considered one of the key contributors in developing PD, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of α-SYN still needs to be elucidated. Since the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have important roles in translation, localization, and stability of mRNAs through RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), it is important to identify the exact length of 3′UTRs of transcripts in order to understand the precise regulation of gene expression. Currently annotated human α-SYN mRNA has a relatively long 3′UTR (2529 nucleotides [nt]) with several isoforms. RNA-sequencing and epigenomics data have suggested, however, the possible existence of even longer transcripts which extend beyond the annotated α-SYN 3′UTR sequence. Here, we have discovered the novel extended form of α-SYN 3′UTR (3775 nt) in the substantia nigra of human postmortem brain samples, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons, and other human neuronal cell lines. Interestingly, the longer variant reduced α-SYN translation. The extended α-SYN 3′UTR was significantly lower in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from sporadic PD patients than controls. On the other hand, α-SYN protein levels were much higher in PD cases, showing the strong negative correlation with the extended 3′UTR. These suggest that dysregulation of the extended α-SYN 3′UTR might contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. ? 2018 The Author(s).",3′ untranslated region (3′UTR); Alpha-synuclein; mRNA; Parkinson's disease,"alpha synuclein; messenger RNA; RNA binding protein; alpha synuclein; histone; lysine; messenger RNA; RNA binding protein; SNCA protein, human; 3' untranslated region; adult; aged; Article; brain; controlled study; dopaminergic nerve cell; gene linkage disequilibrium; human; human cell; human tissue; neuronal cell line; Parkinson disease; pluripotent stem cell; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; SNCA gene; substantia nigra; translation regulation; brain; genetics; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; tumor cell line; 3' Untranslated Regions; alpha-Synuclein; Base Sequence; Brain; Cell Line, Tumor; Histones; Humans; Lysine; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Binding Proteins",2-s2.0-85047505549

Our previous study demonstrated that substance P (SP) preserves β-cell populations in mice with streptozotocin-induced T1D. Here, we demonstrated that chronic systemic treatment with SP restored the mass of β-cells both in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice with T1D or db/db mice with T2D. SP delayed the onset of T1D in NOD mice via immune modulation. SP inhibited immune infiltration into islets and the salivary glands of NOD mice. In db/db mice, SP treatment rescued glucose intolerance. Moreover, SP inhibited apoptosis, as well as the activation of pancreatic stellate cells in pancreatic islets of db/db mice. SP downregulated the number of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expressing cells in db/db pancreatic islets. Cleaved-caspase-3 expression was reduced in islets of SP-treated db/db mice compared to that in the control. Therefore, these results suggested that SP may preserve pancreatic β-cells through immune modulation and protection from the stimulated activation of pancreatic stellate cells and apoptosis in T1D and T2D, respectively. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Pancreatic β-cells; Substance P; Type 1 diabetes; Type 2 diabetes,"substance P; animal; apoptosis; complication; drug effect; experimental diabetes mellitus; female; hyperglycemia; immunology; immunomodulation; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonobese diabetic mouse; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreatic stellate cell; pathology; Animals; Apoptosis; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Hyperglycemia; Immunomodulation; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Male; Mice, Inbred NOD; Pancreatic Stellate Cells; Substance P",2-s2.0-85045081299

The prognosis associated with splint use has not been fully investigated. In this study, we investigated the outcomes of traumatic injuries in primary teeth treated with splinting. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analysed 137 children with root fractures and lateral and extrusive luxation injuries to their primary teeth who were treated with semi-rigid splints between 2010 and 2016. Treatment outcomes were analysed in patients with follow-up periods of >6 months. The outcomes of splinting were based on clinical and radiographic evaluations performed during follow-up examinations. Results: In total, 182 primary teeth were examined, and of these, 90 teeth were treated using semi-rigid splints. In the splint group, pathological root resorption (31.1%) was the most common complication, whereas pathological tooth loss (25.0%) was found most common in the observation group. Splinting in root fractures showed a good prognosis, whereas in lateral and extrusive luxations, it did not (p <.05). There were no relationship between treatment delay and prognosis (p >.05). Conclusions: Depending on the type of luxation, splint therapy results in acceptable outcomes and may be a feasible treatment option. ? 2017 Acta Odontologica Scandinavica Society.",luxation injury; primary dentition; Splints; traumatic dental injury,"child; complication; deciduous tooth; female; follow up; human; injuries; male; preschool child; prognosis; retrospective study; splint; tooth disease; tooth injury; tooth pulp disease; treatment outcome; utilization; Child; Child, Preschool; Dental Pulp Necrosis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Root Resorption; Splints; Tooth Avulsion; Tooth, Deciduous; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85037728485

Design A randomised, active-controlled, assessor-blinded trial. Participants Patients with recurrent or persistent LBP, defined as a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of ?50 mm, with or without leg pain after back surgery. Interventions Patients were randomised to an EA plus usual care (UC) group or to a UC alone group at a 1:1 ratio. Patients assigned to each group received UC, including drug therapy, physical therapy and back pain education, twice a week for 4 weeks; those assigned to the EA plus UC group additionally received EA. Outcome measures The primary outcome was severity of LBP as measured by VAS. Secondary outcomes included back pain-related disability, assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and quality of life, assessed using the EuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using paired and independent t-tests. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Thirty-nine patients were allocated to receive EA plus UC (n=18) or UC alone (n=21). There was no statistically significant difference in VAS or EQ-5D scores between the two groups, but there was a significant decrease in ODI scores (p=0.0081). Using G?Power, it was calculated that 40 participants per group would be needed for a future trial according to VAS scores. Considering for a 25% dropout rate, 108 participants (54 per group) would be needed. Conclusions A future trial addressing the risk of bias and including the estimated sample size would allow for better clinical assessment of the benefits of EA plus UC in treatment of patients with non-acute pain after back surgery. ?

Results: PCD progressed more frequently from inflammatory to complicated behavior than NPCD. Moreover, corticosteroids were prescribed in 102 patients with PCD and only 57 with NPCD (82.9% vs 58.2%, p<0.001), immunosuppressants in 89 and 42 (72.4% vs 42.9%, p<0.001), and anti-tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in 37 and 12 (30.1% vs 12.2%, p=0.002).

However, it is not well known whether muscle mass depletion is associated with poor outcome in sepsis. We hypothesized that muscle mass depletion is associated with poor outcome in sepsis. Methods: Retrospective observational study was conducted in an emergency department during a 9-year period. Medical records of 627 patients with sepsis were reviewed. We divided the patients into 2 groups according to 28-day mortality and compared the presence of muscle mass depletion assessed by the cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on abdomen CT scans. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of scarcopenia on the outcome of sepsis. Results: A total of 274 patients with sepsis were finally included in the study: 45 (16.4%) did not survive on 28 days and 77 patients (28.1%) were identified as having muscle mass depletion. The presence of muscle mass depletion was independently associated with 28-day mortality on multivariate logistic analysis (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.35-5.74, p = 0.01).

Methods: An open-label, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study was conducted at 11 hospitals in the Republic of Korea. A total of 168 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with >4 mg of glimepiride and 1000 mg of metformin by using free or fixed-dose combination therapy for at least 2 weeks were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive GM-SR 4/1000 mg once-daily or GM-IR 2/500 mg BID for 24 weeks. Adherence was compared by using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Findings: A significant difference in adherence was observed between the 2 groups. Overall adherence, defined by the number of container openings divided by the number of prescribed doses, was 91.7% in the GM-SR group and 88.6% in the GM-IR group (P < 0.001). The percentage of treatment days with the correct number of doses taken was 85.3% in the GM-SR group and 75.1% in the GM-IR group (P < 0.001). The percentage of missed doses was 11.7% in the GM-SR group and 15.3% in the GM-IR group (P < 0.001). The percentage of doses taken in the correct time window and therapeutic coverage were higher in the GM-SR group (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in glycosylated hemoglobin changes or number of adverse events between the 2 groups. A total of 168 patients randomized to receive GM-SR once daily (86 patients) or GM-IR twice daily (82 patients). Mean Age were 57.8 ± 9.6 years old. Male: female ratio was 47.6: 52.4 %. Body mass index were 66.3 ± 12.0 kg/m2, Diabetes duration were 10.5 ± 6.6 years.

To quantify symptoms, use of questionnaire is ideal, so we adopted a simple and easily writable visual analogue scale for irritable bowel syndrome questionnaire (VAS-IBS). The aim of this study was to develop and validate the Korean version of VAS-IBS questionnaire (Korean VAS-IBS) that can adequately reflect the defecation pattern. Methods: This study translated English VAS-IBS into Korean using the forward-and-back translation method. Korean VASIBS was performed on 30 patients, who visited the outpatient clinic and had no possibility of special defecation pattern. Detailed past medical history and Bristol stool chart was added to the questionnaire. The survey was conducted twice, and the median interval between the 2 surveys was 10 days (8-11 days). Cronbach α for internal consistency reliability and intraclass correlation coefficients for test-retest reliability were analyzed. Results: Korean VAS-IBS achieved acceptable homogeneity with a Cronbach α coefficient of 0.66-0.79 showing adequate internal consistency reliability. In addition, intraclass correlation coefficients showed significant test-retest reliability with 0.46-0.80 except for the question assessing the ""perception of psychological wellbeing."" Conclusion: The Korean VAS-IBS is a valid and reliable questionnaire for the measurement of the symptoms of defecation pattern changes. ? 2018, the Korean Surgical Society.",Defecation; Surveys and questionnaire; Translations; Visual analog scale,,2-s2.0-85046490514

However, it is not fully identified how body fat percentage (BF%) has an impact on the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Thus, this study was to evaluate the incidental risk for T2DM according to BF% level. Methods: In a community-based Korean cohort, 5972 Korean adults were divided into quintile groups by BF% and followed up for 10 years to monitor the development of T2DM. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the hazard ratios (HRs) for T2DM according to BF% quintile. Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted by low and high level of BF% (cut-off: 25 in men and 35 in women) and body mass index (BMI). Results: In adjusted model, compared to the BF% quintile 1 group, the risk for T2DM significantly increased over BF% of 22.8% in men and 32.9% in women (?quintile 4). The level of BF% related to the increased risk for T2DM was lower in non-obese men (22.8%) than obese men (28.4%). In subgroup analysis, men with low BMI (<25) and high BF% (?25) had the highest risk for T2DM than other subgroups (HRs: 1.83 (1.33–2.52)). However, this association did not show the statistical significance in women (HRs: 1.63 (0.98–2.72)). Conclusion: The incidental risk for T2DM significantly increased over the specific level of BF%, which was lower in non-obese population than obese population. Gender difference was suggested in the incidental relationship between BF% and T2DM. ? 2018 European Society of Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain.",,"adult; Article; body fat; body mass; confidence interval; controlled study; female; follow up; hazard ratio; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; proportional hazards model; risk factor; sex difference; adipose tissue; blood; genetics; genome; longitudinal study; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physiology; risk factor; South Korea; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genome; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85046126505

It is considered a lethal disease causing death in thousands of people at the late stage of life. Dendropanax morbifera Leveille is a subtropical broad-leaved prevalent species in Korea. Extracts of the leaves, stems, roots, and seeds of D. morbifera have been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of numerous diseases such as diabetes, atherogenesis, skin disorders, and headaches. However, the anti-osteoporosis effects of D. morbifera have not been examined. The primary objectives of this study were to elucidate the anti-osteoporosis effect of D. morbifera extract through an in vitro study using pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. We found that D. morbifera strongly increased the expression of bone metabolic markers such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, type I collagen (Col-I) level, and mineralization. Additionally, D. morbifera extract also upregulated the mRNA expression levels of osteogenic genes including ALP, osteocalcin (OCN), osterix (Osx), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in MC3T3-E1 cells via upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)/p38 MAPK/JNK and Smad1/5/8 signaling pathways. Moreover, addition of D. morbifera significantly suppressed the inhibitory effect of SB203580 (p38 inhibitor). In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that D. morbifera extract significantly increased osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells by regulating BMP-2/p38/JNK and Smad1/5/8.

However, not all patients improve or maintain heart function following primary PCI, and certain patients may experience decreased heart function. The present study investigated factors associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and improvement or deterioration of LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at follow-up echocardiography following successful primary PCI. The clinical outcomes following primary PCI were also investigated. The present study assessed 4,044 patients who underwent primary PCI following a diagnosis of STEMI between January 2008 and March 2012. A total of 1,736 patients who underwent echocardiography between 30 days and 1 year after STEMI and PCI, and who had completed clinical follow-up, were included in the present study. A total of 243 patients (14.0%) demonstrated LV dysfunction at follow-up echocardiography. Multivariate analysis revealed that LV dysfunction (?40%) at index STEMI, LVEF at index admission, renal insufficiency (creatinine ?1.4 mg/dl), peak creatine kinase (CK) and peak CK MB isoenzyme (CKMB) were independent predictors of LV dysfunction at follow-up. Independent predictors for the deterioration of LVEF at follow-up were dyslipidemia, LVEF at index admission, LVEF ?40% at index admission, peak CK and peak troponin-I. Furthermore, being male, having no history of coronary artery disease, pre-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, LVEF at index admission, LVEF ?40% at index admission, peak CKMB and peak troponin I were independent predictors of LVEF improvement at follow-up. One-year major adverse cardiac events were significantly increased in the LV dysfunction group compared with patients who did not exhibit LV dysfunction according to Cox regression analysis (13.6 vs. 20.4%; P=0.017). Therefore, the present study may provide valuable prognostic information for clinicians to advise patients who experience LV dysfunction despite having undergone successful primary PCI. Additional management is required in patients with these high-risk features following STEMI. ? 2018, Spandidos Publications.

Although lesions are usually restricted to the lateral medullary area, some patients have additional infarcts in other parts of the brain. The clinical features and prognosis of isolated LMI (pure LMI, LMIpr) have been investigated. However, it remains unclear whether clinical characteristics, prognosis and factors associated with prognosis differ between patients with LMIpr and those with additional lesions (LMI plus, LMIpl). Methods: Patients with LMI identified by MRI were enrolled. The demographic and clinical characteristics, in-hospital outcome (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, pneumonia and modified Rankin scale [mRS] at discharge), and long-term residual symptoms (vertigo/dizziness, sensory disturbances, dysphagia) and outcomes (occurrence of stroke, acute coronary syndrome [ACS], death, and mRS at follow-up) were compared between LMIpr and LMIpl patients. Factors associated with poor functional outcome (mRS 2-6) at the follow-up were analyzed. Results: Among 248 LMI patients, 161 (64.9%) had LMIpr and 87 (35.1%) had LMIpl. During admission, patients with LMIpl more frequently experienced ICU care, pneumonia and had a higher discharge mRS (3 vs. 2; p < 0.001) than LMIpr patients. The occurrence of stroke, ACS, frequency of death and functional outcome was not different during follow-up. However, residual neurologic symptoms such as dizziness (p = 0.002), dysphagia (p = 0.04) and sensory symptoms (p < 0.001) were more frequent in LMIpr than in LMIpl patients. In LMIpr patients, the rostral location of LMI was associated with poor functional outcome (p = 0.041), whereas in LMIpl patients, the presence of medial posterior-inferior cerebellar artery lesion was associated with good functional outcome (p = 0.030). Conclusion: Although the short-term outcome is poorer in LMIpl than LMIpr patients, long-term residual symptoms are more common in LMIpr patients. The location of the LMI and extra-medullary lesion affects the long-term functional outcome of LMIpr and LMIpl patients respectively. ? 2018 S.

Materials and methods: This retrospective study enrolled 225 breast lesions from 225 patients, including 159 benign lesions, 38 high risk lesions and 28 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed by US-guided CNB. Quantitative SWE parameters of breast lesions were measured before CNB and compared according to histopathologic results (benign, high risk and DCIS) and lesion size (&lt;20 mm and &gt;20 mm). Clinico-radiologic and pathologic factors were compared between upgrade and non-upgrade groups after surgical excision or follow-up US. Results: After surgical excision or follow-up US after more than one year, 29 lesions were upgraded for an overall upgrade rate of 12.9% (29/225). There were significant differences between upgrade and non-upgrade groups in age, mammographic category, US category, and sonographic features, including shape, margin, orientation, imaging-histologic correlation and E ratio. Patients with lesion upgrade were much older and had lesions characterized by significantly higher mammographic and US category (&gt;4b), irregular shape, nonparallel orientation, microlobulated or angular margin, calcification in a mass, larger size on US (&gt;20 mm) and greater imaging-histologic discordance.

This study was based on the data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2012–2014. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 10,359 subjects aged 19–64 years were selected, and 432 subjects (74 men, 358 women) were included in the physician-diagnosed depression group. Several cardiovascular risk factors were associated with higher odds of clinical depression. For men, high waist circumference (?91.3 cm) and body mass index (?25.0 kg/m2) were significantly associated with increased odds of depression, and high physical activity (?50 MET h/week) was associated with decreased odds of depression. Men with dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome had 2.43-fold and 2.0-fold higher odds of depression than those without the diseases. For women, current smokers had 2.25-fold higher odds of depression than nonsmokers, and frequent alcohol drinkers (?4 times/week) also had 2.88-fold higher odds of depression than nondrinkers. Korean adults with clinical depression had a higher prevalence of some risk factors for cardiovascular diseases than those without depression. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Body mass index; Cardiovascular disease; Depression; Metabolic syndrome,adult; Article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; comparative study; depression; drinking behavior; dyslipidemia; female; human; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; physical activity; priority journal; risk assessment; smoking; South Korea; waist circumference; cardiovascular disease; depression; dyslipidemia; exercise; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; nutrition; pathophysiology; physiology; risk factor; young adult; Adult; Body Mass Index; Cardiovascular Diseases; Depression; Dyslipidemias; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Waist Circumference; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85042704740

However, the degree to which BP categories are associated with depression has been less well described. Thus, this study was to investigate the association of depression with BP categories. A total of 90,643 men and 68,933 women were enrolled in this study. They were stratified into four groups (normal, prehypertension, newly diagnosed hypertension, and recognized hypertension) according to the BP levels and the history of hypertension. Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression was used to evaluate the depressive symptom, and the degree of depression was evaluated by the cutoff of Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression (mild: 16–20, moderate: 21–24, severe: ?25). The multivariate logistic regression was used in calculating odds ratios for depression according to the four BP categories, with adjustment for multiple confounding factors. Subgroup analysis was conducted by gender and age. The adjusted odds ratios for depression tended to decrease from normal to newly diagnosed hypertension, but significantly increased in recognized hypertension (normal: reference, prehypertension: 0.85 [0.80–0.91], newly diagnosed hypertension: 0.75 [0.65–0.86], recognized hypertension: 1.11 [1.03–1.20]). Subgroup analysis also indicated the similar pattern of relationship, which was more prominent in male and middle-aged subgroup than any other subgroups. Depression was inversely associated with elevated BP. However, recognized hypertension had the increased likelihood of depression in male and young age group. These findings suggest that the association between depression and BP may be moderated by the chronicity of hypertension in men and young individuals. ? 2018 American Society of Hypertension",Blood pressure; depression; hypertension,adult; Article; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; chronicity; cohort analysis; depression; diastolic blood pressure; female; groups by age; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; population; prehypertension; priority journal; sex difference; South Korea; systolic blood pressure,2-s2.0-85042586613

However, there is limited information on the pattern of relationship between the risk for T2DM and body mass index (BMI) categories including underweight and overweight. Thus, this study was to evaluate the risk of T2DM according to BMI categories defined by Asian-specific cutoff of BMI. Methods: 7660 non-diabetic Koreans were grouped into five BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese and severe obese) defined by Asian-specific cutoff of BMI and followed up for 10?years to monitor the development of T2DM. With a reference of normal BMI group, Cox proportional hazards assumption was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals for T2DM in five groups. Subgroup analysis was conducted by gender and age (40–59?years and 60–69?years). Results: Baseline mean value of metabolic factors like fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol and the proportion of impaired fasting glucose increased proportionally to the level of BMI categories. Underweight group had the higher proportion of impaired glucose tolerance than normal and overweight group. In all subgroups, underweight, overweight, obese and severe obese group had the higher HRs for T2DM than normal group, but statistical significance was only found in overweight, obese and severe obese group. Conclusions: The risk of T2DM tends to increase proportionally to the level of BMI categories from overweight to severe obese group. Further studies should be considered to identify the incidental relationship between underweight and T2DM. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.",Body mass index; Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus; Underweight,"cholesterol; glucose; adult; aged; Article; body mass; controlled study; disease association; disease course; disease severity; female; follow up; hazard ratio; homeostasis model assessment; human; impaired glucose tolerance; Korean (people); male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; risk factor; underweight; Asian continental ancestry group; complication; glucose intolerance; human genome; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; risk factor; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; underweight; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genome, Human; Glucose Intolerance; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Thinness",2-s2.0-85042094534

Methods: Newly diagnosed drug-na?ve patients with T2DM from 8 outpatient diabetes centres were randomized to receive either IIT (n = 50; glargine/glulisine) or COAD (n = 47; glimepiride/metformin) as intensive treatment until the termination criteria to ensure euglycaemia were met. After intensive treatment, the patients completed a follow-up period with either lifestyle modification (LSM) alone or rescue therapy to maintain target glycated haemoglobin levels of <7% (53 mmol/mol) up to week 104. The primary outcomes were analysed after excluding participants who were anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody-positive. Results: Both intensive treatment methods were effective for short-term glycaemic control, but improvements in the disposition index (DI) were significantly greater in the IIT group than in the COAD group (P =.021). During the follow-up period after intensive treatment, the two groups significantly differed in rescue method regarding the maintenance of comparable levels of glycaemic control (P =.010) and more participants who received IIT exhibited well-controlled glycaemia with LSM alone. Additionally, the IIT group maintained a higher DI than the COAD group during the follow-up period. Cox regression analysis showed that the IIT method was associated with a 52.5% lower risk of failing to maintain drug-free glycaemic remission compared with the COAD method (P =.015). Conclusions: The findings indicate that outpatient clinic-based IIT to ensure euglycaemia in newly diagnosed patients with T2DM might be an effective initial therapeutic option for improvements in β-cell function and glycaemic control over the long term, without serious adverse events. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",blood glucose; combination; drug therapy; glimepiride; hyperglycaemia; hypoglycaemic agents; insulin glargine; insulin glulisine; Korea; type 2 diabetes mellitus,"glimepiride; glutamate decarboxylase antibody; glycosylated hemoglobin; insulin glargine; insulin glulisine; metformin; antidiabetic agent; glimepiride; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; insulin; metformin; sulfonylurea derivative; adult; aged; Article; cell function; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; follow up; glycemic control; hemoglobin blood level; human; human cell; hypoglycemia; intensive care; lifestyle modification; long term care; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outpatient department; pancreas islet beta cell; randomized controlled trial; remission; risk factor; short course therapy; treatment outcome; blood; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; comparative study; drug effect; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; insulin release; insulin resistance; metabolism; middle aged; multidrug resistance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas islet beta cell; South Korea; university hospital; Adult; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Resistance, Multiple; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Hospitals, University; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Insulin Secretion; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; Republic of Korea; Sulfonylurea Compounds",2-s2.0-85040770368

This study aimed to investigate the incidence of poor motion recovery after RTSA and to identify factors that may cause poor outcomes. Methods: Seventy-six patients who underwent primary RTSA with a reverse-type Aequalis prosthesis (Tornier, Montbonnot, France) were allocated to a satisfactory or unsatisfactory group on the basis of their postoperative active anterior elevation. The average age of the patients was 69 ± 8 years (range, 42-82 years); average follow-up period was 34 ± 12 months (range, 24-93 months). Results: Fifty-eight patients had a satisfactory outcome (satisfactory group) and 18 had an unsatisfactory outcome (unsatisfactory group). Twenty-seven patients (46.6%) in the satisfactory group and 10 (55.6%) in the unsatisfactory group had preoperative pseudoparalysis (P =.504). Pre-existing medical comorbidities, such as thyroid disease, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, showed no significant differences. Anterior deltoid muscle belly volume also did not significantly differ between the satisfactory and unsatisfactory groups. However, mean postoperative lateral humeral offset (LHO) was ?2 ± 6 mm in the satisfactory group and 3 ± 5 mm in the unsatisfactory group (P =.001). Conclusion: Satisfactory improvement of active anterior elevation was achieved in three-quarters of patients who underwent RTSA using a prosthesis designed to be medialized. Of the factors we investigated, only postoperative LHO was found to be a significant risk factor for poor postoperative active anterior elevation. Therefore, surgeons should attempt to avoid increasing postoperative LHO when performing RTSA using an implant designed to be medialized. ? 2017 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",lateral humeral offset; medialized prosthesis; poor anterior elevation; reverse total shoulder arthroplasty; risk factors; Shoulder,"active anterior elevation; adult; aged; Article; case control study; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; convalescence; coracoid process; deltoid muscle; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; human; hypertension; incidence; infection complication; joint characteristics and functions; lateral humeral offset; locomotion; major clinical study; male; motor dysfunction; muscle mass; musculoskeletal system parameters; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteoarthritis; paralysis; patient satisfaction; postoperative period; posttraumatic arthropathy; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; pseudoparalysis; range of motion; retrospective study; reverse shoulder arthroplasty; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; rotator cuff tear arthropathy; shoulder fracture; smoking; thyroid disease; visual analog scale; arthropathy; humerus; joint characteristics and functions; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; reoperation; risk factor; shoulder; shoulder replacement; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Shoulder; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Humerus; Joint Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Range of Motion, Articular; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Shoulder Joint; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85038874468

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed whole-mount slides of 58 patients who underwent total mesorectal excision for mid and low rectal cancer. The rate of tumor-positive CRM was compared according to the circumferential tumor location. In 31 patients, morphometric analyses of whole-mount specimens were performed to measure the depth of tumor invasion according to circumferential tumor location. Results: Among 58 patients, 50% of tumors were anterior tumor and 50% were nonanterior. A tumor-positive CRM was more observed frequently in anterior tumors than in nonanterior tumors (41.1% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.007). In a multivariate analysis, anterior tumor was the only independent risk factor for a positive CRM (odds ratio 4.725, 95% confidence interval 1.102–20.261, p = 0.037).

Method: A total of 2000 RA patients aged > 20 years, treated with DMARDs for at least 6 months, and signed informed consent, were enrolled in this non-interventional, multicenter, cross-sectional observational study from December 2012 to June 2013. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using EuroQuol 5D (EQ-5D) and functional disability was measured using the Korean Health Assessment Questionnaire (KHAQ). Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to determine the association between patient characteristics and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Results: Of all RA patients, 84% were female, patients with low Disease Activity Score of 28 joints erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS-28-ESR < 3.2) was 54%, while moderate (DAS-28-ESR 3.2–5.1) and high disease activity score (DAS-28-ESR > 5.1) were 38% and 7.6%, respectively. Mean EQ-5D index score and KHAQ score were 0.6 ± 0.28 and 0.7 ± 0.67, respectively.

Methods: Data from the Second Korean National Environmental Health Survey (2012-2014) were analyzed. Urine cotinine was analyzed by public transport behavior, secondhand smoke exposure, socioeconomic factors, and health-related factors. Participants were 1322 adult females; those with the top 75% urine cotinine concentrations were assigned to the high exposure group. A logistic regression analysis was performed considering appropriate weights and stratification according to the sample design of the Second Korean National Environmental Health Survey. Results: The geometric mean of urine cotinine concentrations differed according to public transportation modes: subway (1.66 μg/g creatinine) bus (1.77 μg/g creatinine), and taxi (1.94 μg/g creatinine). The odds ratio [OR] was calculated for the high exposure group. The OR of the taxi (2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-5.69) was statistically significantly higher than the subway value (reference), and marginally significant after adjusted with life style, sociodemographic factors and involuntary smoking frequency (2.42, 95% confidence interval, 0.97-6.04). Conclusions: The odds ratio of passengers who mainly used taxis was marginally significantly higher than those of passengers who used subways and buses after adjusted with life style and sociodemographic factors. Implementation of supplementary measures and further studies on exposure to environmental tobacco smoking in taxis are warranted. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Cotinine; Environmental tobacco smoking; Korean national environmental health survey; Public transportation,cotinine; creatinine; adult; aged; Article; concentration (parameters); female; gender; health survey; human; major clinical study; obesity; passive smoking; priority journal; questionnaire; socioeconomics; traffic and transport; urinalysis,2-s2.0-85045562244

Riluzole, the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for ALS, provides minimal benefit, prolonging patient life by only 2-3 months. Previous studies have found a neuro-protective and anti-neuroinflammatory effect of Mecasin, with retrospective studies providing suggestive evidence for a beneficial effect of Mecasin. The aim of this study was to develop a protocol to determine the proper dosage of Mecasin. Methods: This is a phase II-A, multi-center, randomized study with three arms. Thirty-six patients with ALS will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, each receiving the standard treatment with 100 mg of riluzole in addition to one of 1.6 g of Mecasin, 2.4 g of Mecasin, or a placebo. The Primary outcome is the Korean version of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised result after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes include results of the Short Form Health Survey-8, Medical Research Council Scale, Visual Analogue Scale for Pain, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Fatigue Severity Scale, Patient Global Impression of Change, pulmonary function test, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and its ratio to forced vital capacity, creatine kinase, and body weight. The frequencies of total adverse events and serious adverse events will be described and documented. The trial protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Wonkwang University Gwangju and Sanbon Hospital (2016-5-4 and 2016-34-01, respectively). An Investigational New Drug status (30731) was granted by the Korea Food and Drug Administration. Discussion: This trial will aim to identify the optimal dosage of Mecasin. Additionally, it will test the efficacy and safety of Mecasin in conjunction with standard treatment, riluzole, for alleviating the functional decline in patients with ALS. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; KCHO-1; Mecasin; Motor neuron disease; Protocol; Randomized controlled trial,"Aconitum carmichaelii extract; Atractylodes extract; Chaenomeles sinensis extract; creatine kinase; Curcuma longa extract; Gastrodia elata extract; Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract; herbaceous agent; mecasin; Paeonia lactiflora extract; placebo; plant extract; Polygala tenuifolia extract; riluzole; Salvia miltiorrhiza extract; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; neuroprotective agent; plant extract; riluzole; Aconitum carmichaelii; adult; aged; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised Korean version; Article; Atractylodes; Atractylodes lancea; body weight; Chaenomeles sinensis; clinical article; clinical assessment tool; clinical outcome; clinical protocol; controlled study; Curcuma longa; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; Fatigue Severity Scale; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; Gastrodia elata; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; low drug dose; lung function test; male; Medical Research Council Scale; medicinal plant; multicenter study; optimal drug dose; outcome assessment; Paeonia lactiflora; Patient Global Impression of Change; phase 2 clinical trial; Polygala tenuifolia; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; Salvia miltiorrhiza; Short Form Health Survey 8; treatment duration; university hospital; Visual Analogue Scale for Pain; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; combination drug therapy; disease exacerbation; health status; middle aged; multicenter study (topic); pathophysiology; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); randomized controlled trial (topic); South Korea; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Disease Progression; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Neuroprotective Agents; Plant Extracts; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Republic of Korea; Riluzole; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85045396707

Methods: Participants were 121 middle aged couples living in Seoul, Gyeonggi-do and Daegu City, Korea. All measures were self-administered. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 and AMOS 20.0. Results: 1) Wife’s self efficacy and marital satisfaction showed direct actor and partner effects on retirement preparation in middle aged couples. Wife’s health status showed an indirect actor effect through wife’s self efficacy and marital satisfaction on wife’s retirement preparation, and showed an indirect partner effect through husband’s self efficacy on husband’s retirement preparation. 2) Husband’s self efficacy and marital satisfaction showed only direct actor effect on retirement preparation. Health status among the husbands showed an indirect actor effect on husband’s retirement preparation through their self efficacy and marital satisfaction, and an indirect partner effect through wife’s marital satisfaction on wife’s retirement preparation. 3) The actor effect size of health status on self efficacy and marital satisfaction was larger among husband’s than wife’s. Additionally, the partner effect size of health status on self efficacy and marital satisfaction was different between the two groups; however, the actor and partner effect size of self efficacy and marital satisfaction on retirement preparation was the same for husband and wife. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that nursing intervention strategies for improving self efficacy and marital satisfaction are strongly needed to enhance retirement preparation of middle aged couples in Korean community. ? 2018 Korean Society of Nursing Science.",Health status; Middle aged; Retirement; Self efficacy,"adult; article; controlled study; data analysis software; effect size; female; health status; human; husband; male; marriage; middle aged; nursing intervention; retirement; self concept; South Korea; wife; economics; psychology; questionnaire; retirement; satisfaction; theoretical model; Adult; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Marriage; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Personal Satisfaction; Republic of Korea; Retirement; Self Efficacy; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85046548627

Bellflower is widely consumed as both food and medicine owing to its high nutritional value and potential therapeutic effects. Since foodborne disease outbreaks often come from vegetables, understanding the public health risk of microorganisms on fresh vegetables is pivotal to predict and prevent foodborne disease outbreaks. We investigated the microbial communities on the bellflower root (n = 10). 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing targeting the V6-V9 regions of 16S rRNA genes was conducted via the 454-Titanium platform. The sequence quality was checked and phylogenetic assessments were performed using the RDP classifier implemented in QIIME with a bootstrap cutoff of 80%. Principal coordinate analysis was performed using the weighted Fast UniFrac distance. The average number of sequence reads generated per sample was 67,192 sequences. At the phylum level, bacterial communities from the bellflower root were composed primarily of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria in March and September samples. Genera Serratia, Pseudomonas, and Pantoea comprised more than 54% of the total bellflower root bacteria. Principal coordinate analysis plots demonstrated that the microbial community of bellflower root in March samples was different from those in September samples. Potential pathogenic genera, such as Pantoea, were detected in bellflower root samples. Even though further studies will be required to determine if these species are associated with foodborne illness, our results indicate that the 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing approach can be used to detect pathogenic bacteria on fresh vegetables. ? 2018 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.",Bellflower root; Microbiota; Platycodon grandiflorum,"DNA; RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; RNA 16S; virulence factor; Actinobacteria; Article; controlled study; DNA sequence; Firmicutes; gene sequence; microbial community; microbial diversity; microflora; nonhuman; Pantoea; phylogeny; plant root; Platycodon; population abundance; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas; seasonal variation; Serratia; South Korea; species richness; bacterial gene; bacterium; classification; food poisoning; genetics; isolation and purification; microbial consortium; microbiology; nucleotide sequence; Platycodon; sequence analysis; vegetable; Bacteria; Base Sequence; DNA, Bacterial; Foodborne Diseases; Genes, Bacterial; Microbial Consortia; Microbiota; Phylogeny; Plant Roots; Platycodon; Republic of Korea; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis; Vegetables; Virulence Factors",2-s2.0-85046115784

After propensity score matching, 2,130 patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer, identified by screening detection (SD) and clinical detection (CD), were included. We compared the survival rates of patients identified by SD and CD in the early and advanced stages of thyroid cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality between the two groups. Of the 1,065 patients in each group, 12 (1.1%) died in the SD group, compared to 44 (4.1%) in the CD group, during an average 9.4 years (p<0.001). For early stage, there was no significant difference in all-cause and thyroid cancer-specific mortality between the two groups (p = 0.08, p = 0.0502). However, for advanced stage, the survival rates in the SD group were significantly higher than in the CD group (p<0.001, p = 0.004). Moreover, after adjusting for covariates, the HRs of all-cause mortality of the SD group was significantly lower than that of the CD group for the advanced stage patients (HRs: 0.37 [95% CIs: 0.17–0.80]), while no significant difference was observed in the early stage. While screening for thyroid cancer was not beneficial for early stage patients, our findings suggest that detection via screening is associated with better survival for patients with advanced stage cancer. However, the effects of selection bias and lead time bias could not be entirely excluded. ? 2018 Jung et al.

A protein in the foods, plants or pollen is usually the problem. This causes the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. There are a few cases where allergies are cause by proteins derived from herbal medicine, but we do not know yet what protein causes the immune react to IgE. Methods: Here, we demonstrate to confirm if the Pueraria Radix at the proteomic level triggers IgE immunoreactivity. Finally, we present the molecules of the Pueraria Radix-derived protein that trigger the IgE immune response. To prove our hypothesis, we used proteomic tools and SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue and identified proteins using LC-MS/ MS. Proteins were separated from Pueraria Radix and allergic reaction sera were selected. Results: We found three positive sera that showed an immune response to Pueraria Radix protein. Positive sera demonstrated a similar pattern of IgE reactivity and mostly restricted to a 50-70 kDa band. Therefore, we have identified number of different IgE binding proteins. Therefore, IgE binding proteins were identified such as enolase, hypothetical protein, DING protein and glycosyl transferase. Conclusion: The results imply that Pueraria Radix can act as an allergen given the identification of IgE binding proteins among the isolated proteins of Pueraria Radix. ? 2018, The Korean Society of Toxicogenomics and Toxicoproteomics and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Allergy; Herbal medicine; Immunoglobulin E; Pueraria Radix,allergen; anazolene sodium; binding protein; enolase; glycosyltransferase; immunoglobulin E; protein; allergenicity; allergic reaction; Article; blood analysis; herbal medicine; human; immune response; immunoreactivity; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein analysis; protein isolation; proteomics; Pueraria; Pueraria radix,2-s2.0-85044463514

The purpose of this article is to present a new surgical option for the reconstruction of primary or recurrent ischial pressure sores using a simple hamstring-adductor magnus advancement flap and direct closure. Methods After horizontal fusiform skin excision, complete bursa excision and ischiectomy were performed. The tenomuscular origin of the adductor magnus and the conjoined tenomuscular origin of the biceps femoris long head and semitendinosus were isolated and completely detached from the inferior border of the ischial tuberosity. They were then advanced in a cephalad direction without detachment of the distal tendon or muscle and securely affixed to the sacrotuberous ligament. The wound was directly closed without further incision or dissection. Results Twelve ischial pressure sores (6 primary and 6 recurrent; 12 patients) were surgically corrected. The follow-up period was 12 to 65 months. All patients healed successfully without early postoperative complications, such as hematoma, seroma, infection, wound dehiscence, or partial necrosis. Late complications included wound disruption 5 weeks after surgery that spontaneously healed in 1 case and recurrence 3 years later in another case. Conclusions The new surgical option presented herein, which involves hamstring-adductor magnus advancement flap and direct closure, is a simple and reliable method for providing sufficient muscle bulk to fill the dead space and proper padding to the bone stump while preserving the main vascular perforators and pedicles as well as future surgical options. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Two patients who both recalled an operational history of hair transplantation visited our department with their frontal and both temporal hair loss. Physical examination of the both patients showed localized but diffuse hair loss, especially in the frontal and temporal scalp. Histopathological examination of biopsy specimen taken from their temporal scalp revealed normal follicular density and increased numbers of telogen hair follicles without any inflammatory cell infiltration around follicles. These clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with telogen effluvium. Both of them were reassured and placed on close follow-up without any treatment.

Topical tacrolimus has particular use at sensitive areas such as the face, anogenitals, and skin folds of neck and extremities. However, many AD patients also experience aggravated symptoms on trunk. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of topical tacrolimus for AD patients with truncal lesions. Methods: AD patients with truncal lesions who were aged ?2 years were recruited from 20 centres in Korea. They received treatment with topical tacrolimus ointment twice daily during 4 weeks. The primary end point was change of the local eczema area and severity index (EASI) of the trunk from baseline to day 28. The secondary end points were changes in the patient global assessment (PGA) score and itch visual analogue scale (VAS) score of the trunk between baseline and day 28. Results: Two hundred and ninety-one patients were recruited, and 176 patients completed the full 4-week treatment course. By the end of the treatment, the mean local EASI of the trunk (2.2±4.71) was significantly decreased from that at baseline (4.71±4.03, p<0.001). PGA (1.71±1.15) and itch VAS score of the trunk (2.61±2.19) on day 28 were also profoundly decreased compared with the baseline (2.96±1.07 and 5.15±2.47, respectively).

Methods: The medical records of 24 patients with DDD were retrospectively reviewed and their demographic and clinical characteristics recorded. They were grouped into two according to the therapeutic intervention. The disability and pain intensity of the low back were measured using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). The rate of improvement was studied retrospectively to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture-related modalities as part of combination therapy. Result: Of the 24 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 11 (45.8%) received integrative treatment. There were significant reductions in the disability and pain intensity in 11 patients who received an integrative package care (P < 0.05). Additionally, clinically relevant changes in the mean differences and improvement rates of ODI and NRS were observed in both groups; however, the differences in ODI and NRS (11.09 and 2.18, respectively) and improvement rates (33.82% and 39.09%, respectively) were greater in integrative treated patients than in conventionally treated ones. Conclusions: This study describes the use of acupuncture-related modalities and raises the possibilities of their use in combination therapy for the improvement of function and pain management in patients with DDD. In light of these promising results, future clinical trials with attention to appropriate patient selection, guidelines for integrative treatment, and optimal standards for outcome measurement are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of integrative treatment. ? 2018",Acupuncture; Case series; Degenerative disc disease; Integrative therapy; Low back pain,eperisone; gabapentin; herbaceous agent; lidocaine; nortriptyline; paracetamol; tramadol; triamcinolone acetonide; zaltoprofen; acupuncture; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; degenerative disc disease; degenerative disease; female; herbal medicine; human; integrative medicine; low back pain; lumbar spine; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; numeric rating scale; Oswestry Disability Index; outcome assessment; pain intensity; patient selection; priority journal; retrospective study; South Korea,2-s2.0-85042846613

Dermatofibroma is one of the most common dermal lesions. Experiences in ultrasound examinations of dermatofibromas have been accumulated. Purpose: To evaluate sonographic findings of dermatofibroma and to correlate them with pathologic findings. Material and Methods: A total of 18 dermatofibromas in 15 patients were included. Sonographic findings were assessed for location, depth, size, shape, margin, spiculation, echogenicity, internal hyperechoic dots, change in echogenicity of adjacent soft tissue, and vascularity, by two musculoskeletal radiologists in consensus. Pathologic findings were evaluated by one pathologist. Ultrasonographic characteristics were correlated with the pathologic findings by discussion between one radiologist and one pathologist. Results: On ultrasound, all lesions were found to be located in the dermis, and 14 lesions (78%) extended into the subcutaneous layer. Mean size was 7 mm (range = 3 to 10 mm). Characteristic findings were ill-defined margins (n = 15, 83%), spiculated margins (n = 12, 67%), change in echogenicity of adjacent soft tissue (n = 14, 78%), and no Doppler flow (n = 14, 78%). Histologically, depth, margin, and spiculation were correlated with sonographic findings. Reactive fibrosis and chronic inflammation were seen in adjacent dermis and subcutaneous fat layer of echogenicity change. Conclusion: On ultrasound, dermatofibromas are usually visible as avascular dermal lesions with extension into the subcutaneous layer, and are characterized by ill-defined margins, marginal spiculation, and change in echogenicity of surrounding soft tissues. ? 2017, ?

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) induces mast cell proliferation and inflammatory reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory effect of NG on TSLP-induced mast cell proliferation and inflammatory reactions using human mast cell line (HMC-1) cells. HMC-1 cells were pre-treated with NG and then treated with TSLP. HMC-1 cells proliferation was determined by quantifying bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Levels of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors were analyzed by western blot analysis. The productions and mRNA expressions of interleukin (IL)-13 and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were analyzed by ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR. We found that NG significantly attenuated HMC-1 cells proliferation and Ki-67 mRNA expression promoted by TSLP. NG significantly suppressed mRNA expression of TSLP receptor and IL-7 receptor α in TSLP-treated HMC-1 cells. NG significantly down-regulated levels of phosphorylated-signal transducer and activation of transcription 6 and murine double-minute 2 in TSLP-treated HMC-1 cells, up-regulated levels of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase and p53 in TSLP-treated HMC-1 cells. Furthermore, NG significantly decreased the productions and mRNA expressions of IL-13 and TNF-α in TSLP-treated HMC-1 cells. These results suggest NG has an inhibitory effect on mast cell-mediated allergic inflammatory reactions. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",inflammation; mast cells; naringenin; proliferation; thymic stromal lymphopoietin,"broxuridine; interleukin 13; Ki 67 antigen; messenger RNA; naringenin; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein MDM2; protein p53; STAT6 protein; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; flavanone derivative; interleukin 13; interleukin 7 receptor; interleukin-7 receptor, alpha chain; naringenin; protein MDM2; STAT6 protein; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytokine production; down regulation; enzyme activation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme phosphorylation; HMC-1 cell line; human; human cell; inflammation; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulatory mechanism; upregulation; Western blotting; chemically induced; cytology; drug effect; immunology; inflammation; mast cell; metabolism; phosphorylation; tumor cell line; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cytokines; Flavanones; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukin-13; Mast Cells; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2; Receptors, Interleukin-7; STAT6 Transcription Factor; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85036499464

In this study, topically applied substance P (SP) significantly alleviated AD-like clinical symptoms in 2, 4, 6-trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB)-induced dermatitis in NC/Nga mice. This effect was nullified by pretreatment of the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonist CP99994. SP treatment significantly reduced the infiltration of mast cells and CD3-positive T cells as well as inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), in AD-like skin lesions and decreased the levels of IgE and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine in serum. This SP-induced alleviation of allergic inflammatory responses was also confirmed as reduced activation in the axillary lymph nodes (aLN) and spleen, suggesting the systemic effect of SP on immune responses in TNCB-induced NC/Nga mice. Furthermore, SP-mediated TSLP reduction was confirmed in human keratinocyte culture under pro-inflammatory TNF-α stimulation. Taken together, these results suggest that topically administered SP may have potential as a medication for atopic dermatitis. ? 2017 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors leading to complications of this procedure. Patients and Methods: The medical records of 200 patients who had undergone intraoral removal of sialoliths from January 2006 through June 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. A telephone survey was used to check postoperative symptoms. Dry mouth, wound infection, lingual nerve dysfunction, and recurrence were considered complications. Computed tomograms of the neck were reviewed for location, shape, number, and size of the stone. Results: Forty-four patients reported a complication. The incidence of complications was significantly higher in patients with stones in the proximal region of the salivary duct (proximal group) than in those with middle or distally located stones (middle/distal group; P <.05). The average stone size was larger in the proximal group; the operation time and length of admission also were longer in the proximal group, with a statistically significant difference (P <.05). Complaints of lingual nerve dysfunction were significantly higher in the proximal group than in the middle/distal group (P <.05).

However, no prior studies have defined the relationship between neuroimaging parameters and clinical measurements in children and adolescents with HPD. The purposes of this study were to determine the correlation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices and clinical measurements in children and adolescents with HPD, and to compare HPD patients with age- and sex- matched healthy controls (HC). Pediatric HPD patients (n = 9) and HC subjects (n = 10), aged 9–17 years, were recruited. Three-dimensional T1-weighted structural MRI (3D T1W) and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) scans were obtained for each subject. Gray matter and white matter volumes were calculated from 3D T1W. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and average diffusion coefficients (D av ) were mapped from DTI. Voxel-based and region-of-interest correlations between MRI indices and clinical measurements were analyzed. In addition, two-sample t-tests were used to compare voxel-based tissue volumes, FA, and D av maps between the two groups. Alterations in both brain tissue volume and white matter integrity were associated with symptom severity, especially in the precuneus, anterior cingulate, temporal cortex, and frontal cortex regions. FA values in HPD patients were significantly higher than those observed in HC subjects, particularly in the cerebellum and cuneus regions. Alterations of brain tissue volumes and microstructural changes are associated with severity of clinical symptoms in children and adolescents with HPD. Fractional anisotropy is the most sensitive method to distinguish pediatric HPD patients from healthy children. The results of this study can facilitate use of MRI indices to follow the transition from pediatric HPD to adult HPD. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",brain tissue volume; child and adolescent; correlation; Hair pulling disorder; white matter integrity,"anterior cingulate; Article; brain function; brain mapping; brain size; child; Child Behavior Checklist; claustrum; clinical article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; diffusion coefficient; diffusion tensor imaging; disease severity; electron spin resonance; female; fractional anisotropy; frontal cortex; gray matter; human; human tissue; inferior parietal lobule; kernel method; male; middle temporal gyrus; National Institute of Mental Health Symptom Severity Scale; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; posterior cingulate; precuneus; priority journal; severity of illness index; superior temporal gyrus; temporal cortex; three dimensional imaging; trichotillomania; voxel based morphometry; white matter; adolescent; brain; diagnostic imaging; diffusion tensor imaging; organ size; pathology; psychological rating scale; trichotillomania; Adolescent; Brain; Child; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Organ Size; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Severity of Illness Index; Trichotillomania; White Matter",2-s2.0-85016444750

A nationwide online survey was conducted by 92 Korean physicians. Thirteen questions on Korean physician’s assessment, prescription, patient education practices, and knowledge regarding BTcP were administered. Based on their responses, physicians were divided using two methods: (1) by their patient education practices, where the “education group” always explained the distinction between background pain and BTcP and the “less education group” which explained it less frequently; and (2) by their definition of BTcP, as occurring “after control of background pain” or “regardless of background pain.” We compared practice patterns using Fisher’s exact test or Student’s t test and performed multiple logistic regression analysis. The “education group” (65 physicians, 70.7?%) was more likely than the “less education group” to assess BTcP meticulously (odds ratio [OR] 17.13, 95?% confidence interval [CI] 4.98–58.94), prepare rescue medications in advance (OR 3.67, 95?% CI 1.36–9.90), and give explicit instructions regarding medications (OR 36.68, 95?% CI 5.63–239.15). Physicians who defined BTcP as occurring “after control of background pain” were more likely to explain how to take rescue medication (P?<?0.05) than physicians who defined BTcP as occurring “regardless of background pain.” Korean physicians’ BTcP practice patterns may be affected by whether they consistently educate patients on the distinction between background pain and BTcP, regardless of their knowledge of the definition of BTcP. ? 2016, American Association for Cancer Education.",Breakthrough pain; Health knowledge; Physician practice patterns,"adult; backache; breakthrough pain; cancer pain; clinical practice; complication; differential diagnosis; female; human; male; middle aged; neoplasm; patient education; questionnaire; standards; Adult; Back Pain; Breakthrough Pain; Cancer Pain; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patient Education as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84987644152

We introduce a retrospective head motion estimation method by which we can estimate the motion waveform from the projection images without employing any external motion monitoring devices. We compute the cross-correlation between every two successive projection images, which results in a sinusoid-like displacement curve over the projection view when there is no patient motion. However, the displacement curve deviates from the sinusoid-like form when patient motion occurs. We develop a method to estimate the motion waveform with a single parameter derived from the displacement curve with aid of image entropy minimization. To verify the motion estimation method, we use a lab-built micro-CT that can emulate major head motions during dental CT scans, such as tilting and nodding, in a controlled way. We find that the estimated motion waveform conforms well to the actual motion waveform. To further verify the motion estimation method, we correct the motion artifacts with the estimated motion waveform. After motion artifact correction, the corrected images look almost identical to the reference images, with structural similarity index values greater than 0.81 in the phantom and rat imaging studies. ? 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",CBCT; dental CT; motion correction; motion estimation,"Computerized tomography; Entropy; CBCT; Cross correlations; Displacement curve; Monitoring device; Motion artifact corrections; Motion correction; Projection views; Structural similarity indices; Motion estimation; algorithm; animal; artifact; dentistry; diagnostic imaging; head; human; image processing; imaging phantom; movement (physiology); procedures; rat; retrospective study; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Animals; Artifacts; Dentistry; Head; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Movement; Phantoms, Imaging; Rats; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85044820670

ASD was mainly diagnosed based on the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and DSM-5. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated the current status of KMDs' diagnosis and treatment of ASD. In future clinical trials and clinical practice guidelines, these findings will provide meaningful information on the actual practice patterns of KMDs. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Autism spectrum disorder; Complementary therapies; Health surveys; Korean traditional medicine,"herbaceous agent; acupuncture; adult; Article; autism; clinical practice; clinical research; disease classification; DSM-5; DSM-IV; female; general practitioner; health care survey; herbal medicine; human; Korean (people); male; middle aged; moxibustion; pediatrician; physician; practice guideline; prescription; psychiatrist; psychotherapy; questionnaire; autism; clinical practice; physician; protocol compliance; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physicians; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85043486859

However, there are few reports of interventional bronchoscopy in patients with MCAOs due to extra-pulmonary malignancy. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate treatment outcomes and prognostic factors for bronchoscopic intervention in patients with MCAO due to extra-pulmonary malignancy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive 98 patients with MCAO due to extra-pulmonary malignancy who underwent interventional bronchoscopy between 2004 and 2014 at Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea). Results: The most common primary site of malignancy was esophageal cancer (37.9%), followed by thyroid cancer (16.3%) and head & neck cancer (10.2%). Bronchoscopic interventions were usually performed using a combination of mechanical debulking (84.7%), stent insertion (70.4%), and laser cauterization (37.8%). Of 98 patients, 76 (77.6%) patients had MCAO due to progression of malignancy, and 42 (42.9%) patients had exhausted all other anti-cancer treatment at the time of bronchoscopic intervention. Technical success was achieved in 89.9% of patients, and acute complications and procedure-related deaths occurred in 20.4% and 3.1% of patients, respectively. Reduced survival was associated with MCAO due to cancer other than thyroid cancer or lymphoma, mixed lesions, and not receiving adjuvant treatment after bronchoscopic intervention. Conclusions: Bronchoscopic intervention could be a safe and effective procedure for MCAO due to end-stage extra-pulmonary malignancies. In addition, we identified possible prognostic factors for poor survival after intervention, which could guide clinicians select candidates that will benefit from bronchoscopic intervention. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Extra-pulmonary malignancy; Interventional bronchoscopy; Malignant central airway obstruction,adult; aged; airway obstruction; Article; bronchoscopy; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer prognosis; cauterization; clinical outcome; cytoreductive surgery; disease exacerbation; endoscopic therapy; esophagus cancer; extra pulmonary malignancy; female; granulation tissue; head and neck cancer; human; laser surgery; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; malignant central airway obstruction; malignant neoplasm; mixed tumor; mortality rate; mucosal disease; mucostasis; patient safety; pneumothorax; respiratory distress; respiratory tract hemorrhage; retrospective study; stent migration; survival rate; thyroid cancer; airway obstruction; bronchoscopy; complication; epidemiology; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; neoplasm; severity of illness index; South Korea; survival analysis; time factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Airway Obstruction; Bronchoscopy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasms; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85043467051

Method: In this multicenter, open-label clinical trial, the study population consisted of healthy Korean children (aged 6 years) who participated in the previous JE vaccine trial. All subjects were subcutaneously vaccinated once for the booster immunization with Boryung Cell Culture Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine? (JE-VC). Result: Approximately 4 years after the 1st booster dose of JE-VC, the seroprotection rate (SPR) and geometric mean titer (GMT) of the neutralizing antibody were 100% and 1113.8, respectively. In children primed and given a 1st booster dose of JE-MB, the SPR and GMT were 88.5% and 56.3, respectively. After the 2nd booster dose of JE-VC, all participants primed and given a 1st booster dose of either JE-MB or JE-VC were seroprotective against JE virus. The GMT of the neutralizing antibody was higher in children primed and given a 1st booster dose of JE-VC (8144.1) than in those primed and given a 1st booster dose of JE-MB (942.5) after the vaccination (p < 0.001). In addition, the 2nd booster dose of JE-VC showed a good safety profile with no serious vaccine-related adverse events. Conclusion: The 1st booster dose of JE-VC and JE-MB showed long-term immunogenicity of at least 4 years, and the 2nd booster dose of JE-VC showed a good safety and immunogenicity profile in children primed and given a 1st booster dose of either JE-VC or JE-MB.

The prevention of secondary neurological damages through relapse prevention and the rehabilitation of stroke patients suffering from morbidities are crucial to improve the prognosis of patients with stroke. Pulse examinations can be used to determine the stroke progression. This study will investigate the differences and changes in radial artery pressure-pulse waves during the treatment of hemiplegia caused by stroke. Methods/design: This study protocol is for a prospective matched case-control study. A total of 84 participants will be recruited, 56 patients with hemiplia caused by stroke, and 28 control patients matched by age, gender, and body mass index. The primary outcome of this study will be the differences and changes in the radial augmentation index. Discussion: The results of the study will help to determine the differences and changes in radial artery pressure-pulse waves during the treatment of hemiplegia caused by stroke. The findings will provide information about the physiological and hemodynamic mechanisms. Conclusion: This will be the first study to analyze the pulse wave of the radial artery (PWRA) on the affected side and on the normal side in stroke patients with hemiplegia. This study will clarify whether the radial artery pressure pulse wave can be used to evaluate the result of stroke treatment objectively. The results of the study will be available in February 2019.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of A. eupatoria L. aqueous extract (AEE) on 80 subjects with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week study. This trial was conducted between January 2013 and July 2013 at the Oriental Medical Hospital (Jecheon) of Semyung University. The trial included subjects aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with mildly to moderately elevated ALT levels (between 45 and 135 IU/L). Subjects received two capsules of placebo or AEE twice a day for 8 weeks. Adverse events were recorded. Eighty subjects were randomized to placebo or AEE groups who had similar baseline characteristics. During the 8 weeks of treatment, 11 subjects were excluded from the analysis for protocol violation or consent withdrawal; efficacy of treatment was, therefore, evaluated in 69 subjects (placebo = 35, AEE = 34). The AEE group showed a significant reduction in ALT and serum triglyceride (TG) at 8 weeks compared with the placebo group (ALT P = .044, TG P = .020). Significant group and time interactions were found in ALT (P = .038), aspartate aminotransferase (P = .040), and TG (P = .010). Alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were not different between the two groups. There were no reported severe adverse events during this study, and total protein, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine, and total cholesterol levels were normal in both groups.

Since the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in Korea in 2007, the prevalence of rotaviral gastroenteritis has decreased. However, little is known on the economic burden of rotavirus infection and its variations in Korea. Here, we estimated the economic costs of rotavirus infection from 2009 to 2012 using nationwide data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) claims. Socioeconomic costs were subdivided into direct and indirect and measured with a prevalence-based approach. Costs were converted from Won to United States dollars (US$). The number of children <5 years old infected with rotavirus decreased from 21,437 to 10,295 during the study period, representing a decrease in prevalence from 947 to 443 per 100,000. The sum of direct and indirect costs also decreased, from $17.3 million to $9.6 million, and the days of admission decreased from 76,000 to 38,000. However, per capita expenditures slightly increased, from $809 to $934. Thus, the economic burden of rotavirus infection decreased after implementation of rotavirus vaccination. Including the vaccine as part of the national essential vaccination program could reduce the prevalence of and economic loss from rotavirus infection in Korea. ? 2018 Lee et al.

To investigate the clinical significance of the time from symptom onset to laboratory diagnosis, we reviewed the clinical characteristics of adult patients with influenza who had an early laboratory diagnosis (ED) or a late laboratory diagnosis (LD) at one of four tertiary care centers during a seasonal outbreak of influenza. Methods: Clinical data were collected from 1,405 adults during the 2013 to 2014 influenza season. A patient was regarded as receiving an ED or LD if he/she received an influenza diagnostic test at 0 to 1 or 4 to 7 days after symptom onset, respectively. Early NAI therapy and late NAI therapy were defined as the administration of NAI ? 2 or > 2 days after symptom onset, respectively. Results: Nearly half of the patients (47.0%) received an ED (n = 661), whereas 13.5% (n = 190) received a LD. Patients with a LD had initial symptoms of cough, sputum production, and dyspnea and experienced pneumonia, antibiotic therapy, hospitalization, and admission to the intensive care unit more often than those with an ED. NAI therapy and early NAI therapy were less frequent in patients with a LD than those with an ED. Of the analyzed baseline characteristics, age ? 50 years, influenza B infection, and diagnosis using a polymerase chain reaction test were significantly associated with a LD. Conclusions: LD was associated with inappropriate antiviral therapy and complicated presenting features in adult patients with seasonal influenza. ED of influenza should be emphasized, especially for older adults. ? 2018 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.",Antiviral agents; Diagnosis; Human; Influenza,"sialidase inhibitor; antivirus agent; adult; antibiotic therapy; Article; clinical feature; controlled study; coughing; delayed diagnosis; diagnostic test; dyspnea; early intervention; epidemic; female; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; influenza A; influenza B; intensive care unit; laboratory diagnosis; major clinical study; male; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; seasonal influenza; seasonal variation; sputum; adolescent; aged; delayed diagnosis; epidemic; influenza; retrospective study; season; South Korea; Adolescent; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Delayed Diagnosis; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Influenza, Human; Male; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Seasons; Seoul",2-s2.0-85043523209

Results: The net ESD time per patient was longer in double ESD group than in single ESD group (104.0±36.2 vs. 59.1±39.2 min, p<0.001). The net ESD time per lesion tended to be shorter in double ESD group than in single ESD group (49.6±30.0 vs. 59.1±39.2 min, p=0.077). The en bloc resection and curative resection rates did not differ between double ESD and single ESD groups (93.8 % vs. 98.4%, p=0.262; 90.6 % vs. 84.4 %, p=0.534, respectively). The intra- and postprocedural bleeding rates were 12.5% and 0% in double ESD group and 15.6% and 3.1% in single ESD group, respectively. Perforation occurred in two (6.3%) in double ESD group and in six (9.4%) in single ESD group (p=0.715). Conclusion: Compared with the single ESD, two simultaneous colorectal ESD procedures in a patient did not increase complications; the en bloc and curative resection rates were similar when performed a single ESD procedure and two simultaneous ESD procedures. ?

We identified the characteristics of “frequent ED users” among Korean patients with type?2 diabetes mellitus. Materials and methods: We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service National Patient Sample, which is a nationally representative sample. Patients (n?=?109,412) with type?2 diabetes mellitus as a primary or secondary diagnosis at one of their visits were included. Individuals were classified into three groups according to the number of ED visits: frequent (?4 visits), occasional (<4 visits) and non-users of the ED. The characteristics of the patients that distinguished frequent users from the other groups were investigated. Results: Frequent ED users were mainly men (P?<?0.001), with longer treatment duration (P?<?0.001), more frequent comorbidities (cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease) and primary diagnosis made by surgery (P?=?0.0028). They had higher mortality (P?=?0.0085), longer hospitalization duration (P?<?0.001), higher costs per visit (P?<?0.001) and more often required medical protection (P?<?0.001). These patients were treated more frequently with sulfonylurea, insulin, meglitinide and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (P?<?0.05). Conclusions: The present findings suggest that frequent users of the ED with type?2 diabetes mellitus have serious health conditions, a poor socioeconomic situation and tend to take some medicines (sulfonylurea, etc.), which often are associated with hypoglycemia. Attention should be given to therapy, and to patients with renal and cardiovascular diseases to decrease the dependency of these patients on the ED. ? 2017 The Authors.

Wearable devices such as accelerometers are inexpensive, easily accessible tools provide valuable information in gait analysis and offer the potential to assess asymmetry without restriction to cost-ineffective laboratory settings. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using an accelerometer in assessment of force asymmetry in gait. To this end, the relationship between asymmetry measured from force platforms and a skin-mounted accelerometer on the lower back was studied during normal walking as well as five different levels of self-induced simulated asymmetry. Results show that there is a positive overall correlation between the asymmetry indices measured by the two methods (r=0.73, p<0.0001). Future study is needed to investigate factors such as age, gender, and anthropometric properties that can help develop a predictive model. ? 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Accelerometer; asymmetry index; gait asymmetry; wearable sensor,Accelerometers; Gait analysis; Wearable sensors; Wearable technology; asymmetry index; Force plate; Force platform; gait asymmetry; Normal walking; Predictive modeling; Wearable devices; Walking aids,2-s2.0-85042759797

The functional view of the body does not match well with dissection, but Huangdineijing that was compiled in the formative period of East Asian Medicine contains records probably related to dissection in two of its treatises. There are two hypotheses about the motive for dissection that are widely accepted; one is to prove the correspondence between the macrocosm and the microcosm and the other is to establish the standard model of body through measurements of organs. This article examined a novel hypothesis that the main motive for human body dissection was to establish the functional properties of the body upon objective anatomical data; anatomical measures were directly used to explain the circulation of qi and the digestive processes as a physiological metabolism. The purpose of anatomical dissection was to integrate physiology and anatomy as the obtained anatomical knowledge played a pivotal role in establishing the functional view of the body in East Asian Medicine. ? 2018, Institute of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Anatomy; Dissection; Huangdineijing; Lingshu; The Bogao School,anatomy; anthropometry; Antiquity; Article; body meridian; circulation; dissection; human; hypothesis; medical record; metabolism; priority journal; traditional medicine,2-s2.0-85042619354

Before surgery, 2 patients were diagnosed with closed tendon ruptures that occurred after nonunion of hamate hook fractures. The other 10 patients were diagnosed with spontaneous tendon ruptures of unknown cause. In 2 of the 10 patients with spontaneous tendon rupture, the cause of the rupture was not found. In the other 8 patients, there was rough surface with deficient overlying soft tissue on the radial side of the hamate hook. In all cases, the ruptured flexor digitorum profundus was reconstructed by applying overtension on the tendon graft, causing greater flexion than for the other normal digits. Hamate hook excision was also performed on 10 subjects with abnormalities. Postoperatively, the patients were followed for an average of 22.5 months (range, 12-64 months). At the final follow-up, the mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire score was 5.7 (range, 3.3-8.3). There were excellent results in all 14 digits according to Strickland and Glogovac criteria. The mean total active motion was 167 degrees (range, 160-180 degrees). There were no surgical complications, including infection, adhesions, or tendon rerupture. There were excellent clinical results with the interposition tendon graft using palmaris longus for closed tendon rupture in zone III or IV of the hand.

A recent genomewide association study (GWAS) suggested that GAREM1 was linked to the PR interval on electrocardiograms. This study was designed to validate this correlation using additional subjects and examined the function of Garem1 in a mouse model. We analyzed the association of rs17744182, a variant in the GAREM1 locus, with the PR interval in 5646 subjects who were recruited from 2 Korean replication sets, Yangpyeong (n = 2471) and Yonsei (n = 3175), and noted a significant genomewide association by meta-analysis (P = 2.39 × 10-8). To confirm the function of Garem1 in mice, Garem1 siRNA was injected into mouse tail veins to reduce the expression of Garem1. Garem1 transcript levels declined by 53% in the atrium of the heart (P = 0.029), and Garem1-siRNA injected mice experienced a significant decrease in PR interval (43.27 ms vs. 44.89 ms in control, P = 0.007). We analyzed the expression pattern of Garem1 in the heart by immunohistology and observed specific expression of Garem1 in intracardiac ganglia. Garem1 was expressed in most neurons of the ganglion, including cholinergic and adrenergic cells. We have provided evidence that GAREM1 is involved in the PR interval of ECGs. These findings increase our understanding of the regulatory signals of heart rhythm through intracardiac ganglia of the autonomic nervous system and can be used to guide the development of a therapeutic target for heart conditions, such as atrial fibrillation. ? 2017 The Japan Society of Human Genetics.",,"adrenergic nerve cell; adult; aged; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cardiac ganglion; cholinergic nerve cell; controlled study; electrocardiography; GAREM1 gene; gene; gene expression; gene locus; genetic association; genome-wide association study; heart atrium; human; immunohistology; major clinical study; middle aged; mouse; nonhuman; PR interval; allele; animal; atrial fibrillation; cell line; cytology; disease model; female; gene silencing; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; heart muscle conduction system; male; metabolism; pathophysiology; single nucleotide polymorphism; GAREM protein, human; growth factor receptor bound protein 2; small interfering RNA; Adult; Aged; Alleles; Animals; Atrial Fibrillation; Cell Line; Disease Models, Animal; Electrocardiography; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Silencing; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Genotype; GRB2 Adaptor Protein; Heart Atria; Heart Conduction System; Humans; Male; Mice; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; RNA, Small Interfering",2-s2.0-85038866024

This study aimed to identify the relationship between health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured by the Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy–General (FACT-G) and survival in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Methods. The clinical characteristics and FACT-G scores were retrospectively reviewed in mCRC patients who visited the Cancer Center of Korean Medicine. The overall survival (OS) was calculated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed based on clinical characteristics and FACT-G scores. To identify significant differences in answer frequency, χ2 tests and Fisher’s exact tests were used. Results. A total of 58 patients were reviewed. The proportion of patients who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group–Performance Status ? 2 was 43.1%, multiple distant metastatic sites was 77.6%, liver metastases was 43.1%, been previously treated was 89.7%, and received more than the second-line chemotherapy was 75.5%. The mean total FACT-G score was 65.3 (median 65.6). The median OS was 7 months. There was no significant difference in OS between the 2 groups divided by the median values of FACT-G total and subscores. In univariate analyses, functional well-being (FWB) score had a significant impact on survival. In multivariate analyses, presence of liver metastasis, FACT-G total score, and FWB score were significant prognostic predictors of survival. No statistically different answer frequency was observed for any question regarding FWB. Conclusions. This study found that FACT-G total and FWB scores were potential prognostic factors for predicting OS in relapsed or refractory mCRC patients treated with Korean Medicine. ? 2016, ?

Angiopoietins (ANGPTs) are vascular growth factors that play an important role in vascular stabilization. We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase is one of the key determinants of vascular endothelium disruption/destabilization and affects angiopoietins expression after spinal cord injury. To test this, tubule formation and angiopoietins expression were assessed in endothelial cells exposed to different concentrations of recombinant neutropil elastase. Then, the expression of angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and neutrophil elastase was determined at 3 h and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in a clinically relevant model of moderate compression (35 g for 5 min at T10) spinal cord injury. A dichotomy between the levels of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 was observed; thus, we utilized a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (sivelestat sodium; 30 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.) after spinal cord injury. The expression levels of neutropil elastase and angiopoietin-2 increased, and that of angiopoietin-1 decreased after spinal cord injury in rats. The sivelestat regimen, optimized via a pharmacokinetics study, had potent effects on vascular stabilization by upregulating angiopoietin-1 via the AKT pathway and preventing tight junction protein degradation. Moreover, sivelestat attenuated the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines after spinal cord injury and hence subsequently alleviated secondary damage observed as a reduction in glial scar formation and the promotion of blood vessel formation and stabilization. As a result, hindlimb locomotor function significantly recovered in the sivelestat-treated animals as determined by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale and footprint analyses. Furthermore, sivelestat treatment attenuated neuropathic pain as assessed by responses to von Frey filaments after spinal cord injury. Thus, our result suggests that inhibiting neutropil elastase by administration of sivelestat is a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit glial scar and promote functional recovery by upregulating angiopoietin-1 after spinal cord injury. ?

The exposure levels of individual environmental chemicals to the general population are far lower than in the case of environmental disasters such as chemical plant explosion, military personnel exposures, and occupational exposures. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic chemicals that accumulate in adipose tissue and are hard to eliminate from contaminated environments and human bodies. Prior to Baillie-Hamilton's report, there have been many anecdotal reports linking exposure to POPs and development of diabetes. Some POPs are known to induce adverse effects on various biological systems via binding to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a cytosolic nuclear receptor present in most vertebrate tissues.

However, there is no substantive evidence supporting which treatment strategy is superior. Taping with Kinesiotape (KT) is a new method that is used as an alternative to the more established taping and bracing techniques used for the prophylaxis and treatment of ankle sprains. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of KT on ankle sprain by comparing acupuncture combined with KT (AcuKT) with acupuncture alone in patients with acute lateral ankle sprains. Methods/design: This study is a prospective, multi-center (DongShin University Gwangju Oriental Hospital, DongShin University Mokpo Oriental Hospital, and KyungHee Korean Medicine Hospital), outcome assessor-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants (n = 60) with a lateral ankle sprain occurring within 1 week of the study will be randomly assigned to either an acupuncture group (n = 10 at each center (total n = 30)) or an AcuKT group (n = 10 at each center (total n = 30)). The acupuncture group will receive acupuncture treatment at ST36, ST41, BL60, BL62, KI3, KI6, GB39, and GB40 once per day, 5 days per week (excluding Saturday and Sunday) for 1 week. The AcuKT group will receive acupuncture treatment at ST36, ST41, BL60, BL62, KI3, KI6, GB39, and GB40 and the ankle meridian tendino-musculature and a figure-of-eight shape form of KT treatment once per day, 5 days per week (excluding Saturday and Sunday) for 1 week. The primary outcome will be pain evaluation assessed according to a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), while Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), edema, European Quality of Life Five Dimension-Five Level Scale (EQ-5D-5 L) score, and number of recurrent ankle sprains will be considered as secondary outcome measures. VAS, FAOS, and edema measurements will be performed at baseline (before intervention), 5 days after the first intervention (i.e., at the end of the intervention), and 4 weeks after the completion of intervention. EQ-5D-5 L measurements will be conducted at baseline, 5 days after the first intervention, 4 weeks after the completion of intervention, and 26 weeks after the completion of intervention. The number of recurrent ankle sprains will be determined at 4, 8, 12, and 26 weeks after the completion of the intervention. Discussion: This study will provide data regarding the efficacy of KT for the treatment of acute lateral ankle sprain. The results may lead to insights into the usefulness of KT in the treatment of acute lateral ankle sprain. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Acupuncture; Ankle sprain; Kinesiotape; Randomized controlled trial; Study protocol,"acupuncture; adult; analgesia; ankle edema; ankle lateral ligament; ankle sprain; Article; clinical protocol; clinical study; controlled study; Foot and Ankle Outcome Score; human; major clinical study; multicenter study; pain assessment; prospective study; quality of life assessment; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; single blind procedure; South Korea; treatment duration; treatment outcome; university hospital; visual analog scale; acute disease; adverse device effect; ankle injury; athletic tape; health care quality; multicenter study (topic); outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial (topic); statistical analysis; Acupuncture Therapy; Acute Disease; Adult; Ankle Injuries; Athletic Tape; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Prospective Studies; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",2-s2.0-85042187940

The pathogenesis of endometriosis, however, has not yet been elucidated. The immunological differences between endometriosis and malignant gynecologic tumors were analyzed by assessing C-type lectin receptors, which are associated with innate immunity, and immunoglobulin secretion, which is associated with B cell adaptive immunity, in the peritoneal fluid of these patients. Peritoneal fluid samples were obtained from 42 patients with benign masses (control group), 38 with endometriosis, and 43 with gynecologic (ovarian, uterine, and cervical) cancers. The levels of expression in these samples of mRNAs encoding the C-type lectin receptors Dectin-1, MR1, MR2, DC-SIGN, Syk, Card 9, Bcl 10, Malt 1, src, Dec 205, Galectin, Tim 3, Trem 1, and DAP 12, were measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the concentrations of IgG, IgA and IgM were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Findings in the three groups were compared. The level of galectin mRNA was significantly lower, and the levels of MR2 and DAP 12 mRNAs significantly higher, in the endometriosis than in the control group (p<0.05 each). Compared with the gynecologic cancer group, the level of Bcl 10 mRNA was significantly lower, and the levels of MR1, MR2, Syk, Card 9, Malt 1, Dec 205, Tim 3, and DAP 12 mRNAs significantly higher, in the endometriosis group (p<0.05 each). The levels of MR2 and DAP 12 mRNAs were significantly higher in the endometriosis than in the control group (p<0.05 each), whereas the level of galectin mRNA was similar in the endometriosis and gynecologic cancer groups. IgA and IgG concentrations in peritoneal fluid were significantly lower in the gynecologic cancer than in the control group (p<0.05 each). However, concentrations of all three immunoglobulins in the endometriosis group did not differ from those in the other two groups (p>0.05). C-type lectin receptors and immunoglobulins act cooperatively and are closely associated in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The decreased expression of galectin mRNA in the peritoneal fluid of the endometriosis group suggests that endometriosis and gynecologic cancers have similar immunologic characteristics. ?

We aimed to compare screening strategies including VFA and spine radiography (X-ray) for detecting VF in terms of clinical effectiveness, cost and radiation exposure. Methods: Three screening strategies: 1) X-ray following VFA, 2) VFA only, and 3) X-ray only were compared using a Markov model based on administrative data from South Korea in a population aged ?50 years. We compared the incidence of new VFs, cost-effectiveness of reducing new VFs and radiation exposure in each strategy. Results: The incidence of new VFs was reduced in all screening strategies compared to no screening: 29.4% for women and 12.5% for men in both X-ray following the VFA and VFA only strategies and 35% for women and 17.5% for men in the X-ray only strategy. The X-ray following VFA strategy had the lowest cost, followed by the X-ray only, and VFA only strategies. The radiation doses for X-ray only were 2,647-2,989 μSv and 3,253-3,398 μSv higher than in the X-ray following VFA and VFA only strategies. The new VF prevention effect was greater in women, and more prominent in older people (women ? 70, men ? 80) than people ? 50 years. Conclusions: The X-ray following VFA strategy is a cost-effective option for screening prevalent VF to prevent new VF in people aged ?50 years due to its high effectiveness, lowest cost, and least radiation exposure. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Cost effectiveness; Diagnostic imaging; Radiation; Radiography; Spinal fracture,"adult; Article; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; female; health care cost; human; incidence; intermethod comparison; male; musculoskeletal disease assessment; prevalence; radiation dose; radiation exposure; sensitivity analysis; South Korea; spine fracture; spine radiography; Vertebral Fracture Assessment; aged; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; mass screening; middle aged; procedures; radiography; spine fracture; standards; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Radiography; Republic of Korea; Spinal Fractures",2-s2.0-85041997726

As HB results from long-term inadequately treated negative emotions, its symptoms are complex, intractable and concomitant with other psychiatric disorders. Therefore, studies aiming to develop effective and safe treatment options for HB are needed. We plan to conduct a pilot study for a future, full-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an optimal acupuncture procedure using semi-individualized acupuncture points that consider participants' personal disposition and type of emotional stress. Method/design: This randomized, sham-controlled, participant- and assessor-blinded pilot trial aims to determine the study feasibility of acupuncture for HB and to explore its clinical effects and safety. This clinical trial will be conducted with two groups: one treated with real acupuncture and the other with sham acupuncture for 10 sessions over 4 weeks. The experimental group (EG) will receive semi-individualized acupuncture, whereas the control group (CG) will receive sham acupuncture, namely minimal acupuncture on non-acupuncture points. The recruitment, compliance, and completion rate and clinical evaluations, including a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Korean version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the short form of the Stress Response Inventory (SRI-short form) and the Instrument of the Oriental Medical Evaluation for HB (IOME-HB), will be assessed to evaluate feasibility and possible effects and safety. Four weeks after completing treatment, follow-up assessments will be performed. Discussion: As this is a pilot study mainly aiming to investigate trial feasibility, the results of this study will be analyzed descriptively and interpreted for the study purposes. Cohen's d will be reported to determine the effect of acupuncture for HB and to enable comparisons with other treatment methods. This protocol is significant in that it provides optimal semi-individualized acupuncture treatment. We expect this study to offer information about the feasibility of this treatment and data about the possible effects and safety. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Acupuncture; Anger syndrome; Hwa-byung; Psychiatric disorder; Randomized controlled trial,acupuncture; adult; aged; anger; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; clinical article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; emotional stress; female; follow up; human; Hwa byung; male; parallel design; patient compliance; pilot study; psychosomatic disorder; randomized controlled trial; stress assessment; Stress Response Inventory short form; visual analog scale; anger management therapy; feasibility study; mental disease; middle aged; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial (topic); South Korea; time factor; treatment outcome; young adult; Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Aged; Anger; Anger Management Therapy; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Republic of Korea; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85041812778

We investigated the incidence and causes of hospital-acquired fever (HAF) and the characteristics of febrile inpatients in Oriental medical hospitals (OMHs). Methods: Patients hospitalized in two OMHs of a university medical institute in Seoul, Korea, were retrospectively reviewed from 2006 to 2013. Adult patients with HAF were enrolled. Results: There were 560 cases of HAF (5.0%). Infection, non-infection, and unknown cause were noted in 331 cases (59.1%), 109 cases (19.5%), and 120 cases (21.4%) of HAF, respectively. Respiratory tract infection was the most common cause (51.2%) of infectious fever, followed by urinary tract infection. Drug fever due to herbal medicine was the most common cause of non-infectious fever (53.1%), followed by procedure-related fever caused by oriental medical procedures. The infection group had higher white blood cell count (WBC) (10,400/mm3 vs. 7000/mm3, p &lt; 0.001) and more frequent history of antibiotic therapy (29.6% vs. 15.1%, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.08-2.56, p = 0.020), history of antibiotic therapy (OR 3.17, C.I. 1.85-5.41, p &lt; 0.001), and WBC &gt; 10,000/mm3 (OR 2.22, C.I. 1.85-3.32, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with infection. Conclusions: Compared to previous studies on HAF in Western medicine, the incidence of HAF in OMHs was not high. However, Oriental medical treatment does play some role in HAF. Fever in patients with history of antibiotic therapy, or high WBC was more likely of infectious origin. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Etiology; Fever; Hospital-acquired; Traditional oriental medicine,"antiinfective agent; age; aged; chemically induced; female; fever; hospital; hospital patient; human; incidence; leukocyte count; male; middle aged; odds ratio; oriental medicine; respiratory tract infection; retrospective study; South Korea; urinary tract infection; Age Factors; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Female; Fever; Hospitals; Humans; Incidence; Inpatients; Leukocyte Count; Male; Medicine, East Asian Traditional; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Republic of Korea; Respiratory Tract Infections; Retrospective Studies; Urinary Tract Infections",2-s2.0-85041667296

In this study, we evaluated the potential genotoxicity of SOCG using three standard batteries of tests as part of a safety evaluation. Methods: SOCG was evaluated for potential genotoxic effects using the standard three tests recommended by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) of Korea. These tests were the bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test), in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration test using Chinese hamster lung cells, and in vivo micronucleus test using ICR mice. Results: The Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 and the Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA(pKM101) showed that SOCG did not induce gene mutations at any dose level in all of the strains. SOCG did not induce any chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test (for both the 6 and 24 h test) and the in vivo micronucleus test. Conclusions: Based on the results of these tests, it was concluded that SOCG does not exhibit any genotoxic risk under the experimental conditions of this study. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Bacterial reverse mutation test; Chromosomal aberration test; Genotoxicity; Korean medicine; Micronucleus test; So-ochim-tang-gamibang; SOCG,"Cyperus rotundus extract; Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract; Lindera strychnifolia extract; plant extract; Platycodon grandiflorus extract; Saussurea lappa extract; so ochim tang gamibang extract; sour orange extract; unclassified drug; mutagenic agent; plant extract; so-ochim-tang-gamibang; Ames test; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; bacterial strain; CHL cell line; chromosome aberration; controlled study; drug safety; Escherichia coli; food and drug administration; gene mutation; genetic screening; genotoxicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; Korea; Lindera; male; micronucleus test; mouse; nonhuman; Platycodon; Platycodon grandiflorus; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; toxic concentration; toxicity testing; animal; cell line; Cricetulus; drug effects; hamster; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; Korean medicine; micronucleus; mutagen testing; Animals; Cell Line; Chromosome Aberrations; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Escherichia coli; Male; Medicine, Korean Traditional; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective; Micronucleus Tests; Mutagenicity Tests; Mutagens; Plant Extracts; Salmonella typhimurium",2-s2.0-85041462526

Sexual dysfunction in the diabetes mellitus is due to a selective defect of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) within paraventricular nucleus (PVN). c-Fos is an immediate ear-ly gene and c-Fos expression represents neuronal activity in response to various stimuli. In the present study, we investigated the effects of treadmill exercise on sexual behaviors and the expressions of NOS and c-Fos in the PVN were evaluated using streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes mellitus was induced by intraperitoneal injection of STZ. The rats in the treadmill exercise groups were made to run on a treadmill for 30 min once a day during 4 weeks. Male sexual behaviors were evaluated by recording the number of mounting, intromission, and ejaculation frequency. The present results revealed that treadmill exer-cise ameliorated sexual dysfunction in the STZ-induced diabetic rats. Treadmill exercise restored the contents of NOS and c-Fos in the PVN. The improving effect of treadmill exercise on sexual function can be considered as the neuronal activating effect of exercise through in-creasing expressions of NO and c-Fos. ? 2018 Korean Society of Exercise Rehabilitation.",C-Fos; Diabetes mellitus; Nitric oxide; Paraventricular nucleus; Sexual dysfunction; Treadmill exercise,,2-s2.0-85043721000

Methods To examine the diagnostic incidence, we selected patients who were under 10-year-old and who had at least one medical claim containing a 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) code for RAD (F94.1 and F94.2) and who had not been diagnosed in the previous 360 days, from 2010 to 2012. In this study, we used the term ‘reactive attachment disorder’ representing for both RAD per se and Disinhibited social engagement disorder. Comorbid disorders were categorized according to ICD-10. Results Among 14,029,571, the total population under 10-year-old during 2010–2012, incident cases of RAD were 736. The mean diagnostic incidence of RAD was 5.25 per 100,000 annually. Language disorders (F80-84) were the most common psychiatric comorbidities in both boys and girls in age groups 0–3 years and 4–6 years, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was the most common in both sex aged 7–9 years. In non-psychiatric comorbidities, diseases of the respiratory system (J00–99) were the commonest in both sex in all age groups, and diseases of the digestive system (K00–99) were the next.

However, the anti-atopic dermatitis (AD) activity of BS has not been described yet. In the present study, we examined the preventive effect of BS on AD. The effect of oral administration of BS was tested in a 2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced AD animal model, by histological analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, caspase-1 assay, and Western blotting analysis. BS administration reduced the total clinical severity and scratching frequencies, compared with the AD group. In the serum of DNFB-induced AD mice, the levels of IgE, histamine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin (IL)-5, and IL-13 were significantly reduced by BS treatment. BS significantly reduced the protein and mRNA expression of TSLP, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the AD skin lesions. BS markedly reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Furthermore, the activation of caspase-1 was reduced by BS in the AD skin lesions. Our results suggested that BS should be considered as a candidate treatment for allergic inflammatory diseases including AD. ? 2018 China Pharmaceutical University",Atopic dermatitis; Bamboo salt; Caspase-1; Thymic stromal lymphopoietin,"1 fluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene; antiinflammatory agent; bamboo salt; dexamethasone; histamine; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 13; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; natural product; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; 1 fluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene; bamboo salt; histamine; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 13; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; interleukin 5; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; atopic dermatitis; bamboo; controlled study; cytokine release; drug effect; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; eosinophil; female; gene expression; histamine release; histology; immunoglobulin production; inflammatory infiltrate; mast cell; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; treatment outcome; Western blotting; administration and dosage; animal; atopic dermatitis; Bagg albino mouse; chemically induced; disease model; genetics; human; immunology; salt intake; Animals; Caspase 1; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dinitrofluorobenzene; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Histamine; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Interleukin-13; Interleukin-5; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Sodium Chloride, Dietary",2-s2.0-85042140778

However, their mode of action (MoA) remains unclear, and drugresistant HCV strains are rapidly emerging. It is critical to characterize the behaviour of the NS5A protein in solution, which can facilitate the development of new classes of inhibitors or improve the efficacy of the currently available DAAs. Using biophysical methods, including dynamic light scattering, size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking experiments, we showed that the NS5A domain 1 from genotypes 1b and 1a of the HCV intrinsically self-associated and existed as a heterogeneous mixture in solution. Interestingly, the NS5A domain 1 from genotypes 1b and 1a exhibited different dynamic equilibria of monomers to higher-order structures. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we studied the structural dynamics of the various states of the NS5A domain 1 in solution. We also tested the effect of daclatasvir (DCV), the most prominent DAA, on self-association of the wild and DCV-resistant mutant (Y93H) NS5A domain 1 proteins, and demonstrated that DCV induced the formation of large and irreversible protein aggregates that eventually precipitated out. This study highlights the conformational variability of the NS5A domain 1 of HCV, which may be an intrinsic structural behaviour of the HCV NS5A domain 1 in solution. ? 2018 The Authors.",Conformational variation; Daclatasvir; Direct-acting antivirals; Drug resistance; Hepatitis C virus; NS5A protein,"daclatasvir; nonstructural protein 5A; antivirus agent; BMS-790052; imidazole derivative; NS-5 protein, hepatitis C virus; viral protein; antiviral resistance; Article; cross linking; drug effect; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1a; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1b; nonhuman; photon correlation spectroscopy; precipitation; priority journal; protein conformation; size exclusion chromatography; X ray crystallography; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; comparative study; conformation; drug effect; genetics; genotype; Hepacivirus; protein domain; small angle scattering; Antiviral Agents; Chromatography, Gel; Drug Resistance, Viral; Dynamic Light Scattering; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Imidazoles; Molecular Conformation; Protein Domains; Scattering, Small Angle; Viral Nonstructural Proteins",2-s2.0-85041809007

Recently, the treatment of subclinical atherosclerosis is important for preventing cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of the Korean herbal medicine, Geiji-Bokryung-Hwan (GBH), on carotid arterial elasticity in healthy male subjects. Methods: This study was conducted with a pilot randomized controlled, cross-over design. Subjects were enrolled in Kyung Hee Medical Center visitors, with meeting criteria, and allocated to the two groups; One group received GBH with water, and the other group received only water at the first phase. The measurements were repeated three times at 2 hourly intervals. After one week of wash-out period, the two groups were repeated using the same procedure. Common carotid strain, erythrocyte deformability, carotid intima-media thickness, blood pressure and pulse rate values of each subjects were measured before administration and 2, 4 h after administration. Results: Fifteen subjects were enrolled into this study. Common carotid arterial circumference strain after GBH administration showed a significantly different interaction effect as compared to water administration (p < 0.05). There was no statistically difference between the two groups in terms of erythrocyte deformability, carotid intima-media thickness, pulse pressure or pulse rate. Conclusions: This preliminary study suggests that GBH could improve vascular endothelial wall function by increasing the common carotid artery elasticity in healthy male subjects. ? 2018",Atherosclerosis; Common carotid artery elasticity; Common carotid strain (CCS); Erythrocyte deformability; Geiji-Bokryung-Hwan (GBH),Geiji Bokryung Hwan; herbaceous agent; unclassified drug; adult; arterial wall thickness; Article; blood pressure; common carotid artery; controlled study; crossover procedure; drug effect; elasticity; erythrocyte deformability; human; human experiment; male; normal human; pilot study; priority journal; pulse rate; randomized controlled trial; vascular endothelium,2-s2.0-85041427214

However, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) that employ evidenced-based medicine (EBM) methodology for traffic-related injuries have not been established in TKM. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a CPG for the treatment of traffic-related injuries in TKM by conducting a systematic literature review following EBM. Methods: First, a network of experts was established to develop the CPG. Then, a systematic search of TKM treatments for traffic-related injuries was conducted using the Patients/Populations–Intervention–Comparison–Outcome method. To measure the methodological quality of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the assessment of multiple systematic reviews was used. The Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias tool was used to assess the randomised controlled trials. Results: The CPG for the treatment of traffic-related injuries in TKM consisted of three parts: diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. In total, 13 recommendations were developed, with two regarding diagnosis, 10 regarding treatment, and one regarding prognosis. Conclusions: This CPG was developed by conducting a systematic literature review of randomised controlled trials. Therefore, this CPG can be adapted to different clinical status for traffic-related injuries. Specifically, it can be useful reference for traditional Chinese medicine and Kampo medicine practitioners using the same or similar interventions. In addition, the CPG can serve as an EBM model for countries unfamiliar with the complementary and alternative medicine treatment of traffic-related injuries. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Clinical practice guidelines (CPG); Evidence-based medicine (EBM); Systematic review; Traditional korean medicine (TKM); Traffic-related injuries,acupuncture; allopathy; Article; evidence based medicine; herbal medicine; human; injury; Korean medicine; manipulative medicine; moxibustion; oriental physiotherapy; physiotherapy; practice guideline; priority journal; prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review (topic); traffic accident,2-s2.0-85041426787

In order to that, our present study was focused on the fermentation of soybean hull (SH) by Monascus pilosus KCCM 60084 to enhance the secondary metabolite monacolin K and produce isoflavones such as daidzein and genistein (phytoestrogens). These isoflavones have effect on reducing cholesterol level, anticancer, and anti-osteophorosis. Furthermore, the anti-adipogenesis effect of fermented soybean hull (FSH) and nonfermented soybean hull (NFSH) was investigated by evaluating the molecular signaling at in vitro level (on 3T3-L1 preadipocyte) as well as by the in s?lico study. Results found that FSH had effect on the reduction of lipid accumulation without exerting any cytotoxicity compared with NFSH at cellular level at 100 ?g/mL. In addition, we noticed that it significantly downregulated the mRNA levels of adipogenic transcriptional genes including jak2, STAT3, CEBPα, PPARγ, CEBPβ, and aP2 at same concentration as well as suppressed the protein expression p-STAT3, PPARγ, CEBPα, and aP2. Also, molecular docking studies show that monacolin K, daidzein, and genistein interact with PPARγ reducing lipid accumulation highly than NFSH. We hypothesized that the newly produced isoflavones such as daidzein and genistein and the high amount of secondary metabolite monacolin K conjointly work on reducing lipid accumulation in adipocyte mature cells. Practical applications: Soybean product had been used as a food along to functional food for its nutritional value. During the processing of this product the soybean hull (SH) is removed and discarded, since the used is high being a constant problem for soybean processing industries. In this study, we found a possible use for this SH which include its fermentation by Monascus pilosus KCCM 60084. This process gives as a result the transformation of SH metabolite and Isoflavones content increasing the possible uses of SH as a functional food or supplement since exhibits lower toxicity than nonfermented SH. In addition, SH in vitro effect was enhanced after fermentation suggesting a possible a possible preventive or therapeutic use for obesity. The results in this study, not only give us a new process option for soybean hull, but also shown that this fermentation increase its anti-lipogenic effect. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",molecular docking; Monascus pilosus; obesity; PPAR-γ; preadipocytes; soybean hull,Biomolecules; Fermentation; Functional food; Gene expression; Metabolites; Molecular modeling; Nutrition; Molecular docking; Monascus pilosus; obesity; Preadipocytes; Soybean hull; Flavonoids,2-s2.0-85041355886

The rate of amyloid/lacune progression, cortical thinning and cognitive decline were evaluated in subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI) patients. Methods: Seventy-two svMCI patients were divided into early stage (ES-svMCI, n = 39) and late stage (LS-svMCI, n = 33) according to their Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score. Patients were annually followed up with neuropsychological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging for 3 years, and underwent a second [11C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography scan within a mean interval of 32.4 months. Results: There was no difference in the rate of increase in PiB uptake or lacune number between the ES-svMCI and LS-svMCI. However, LS-svMCI showed more rapid cortical thinning and cognitive decline than did the ES-svMCI. Conclusions: We suggest that, whilst the rate of change in pathological burden did not differ between ES-svMCI and LS-svMCI, cortical thinning and cognitive decline progressed more rapidly in the LS-svMCI. ? 2017 EAN",cognition; cortical thickness; early stage; late stage; subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment,"Pittsburgh compound B; aged; Article; Clinical Dementia Rating; cognitive defect; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); disease severity; early stage subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment; executive function; female; follow up; human; late stage subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal; prospective study; brain cortex; cerebrovascular disease; cognitive defect; complication; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; pathophysiology; procedures; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cerebral Cortex; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Positron-Emission Tomography",2-s2.0-85040811670

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is linked to atherosclerotic stroke, and it is an important cause of death during the perioperative and follow-up periods after CEA. We aimed to investigate mortality and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with IHD compared with patients who do not have IHD. Methods We consecutively enrolled 229 patients who underwent CEA procedures from 2000 to 2011. Of these patients, 45 had known or probable IHD defined by history or medical record of myocardial infarction, stable/unstable angina, previous coronary revascularization such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, or positive stress test. Long-term outcome was identified by using death certificates from the Korean National Statistical Office and telephone interviews by June 2013. We investigated predictors of early (?30 days) and long-term mortality and MACEs (stroke, myocardial infarction, and death). Results Mean follow-up period was 49 months. Cox proportional analysis adjusted for potent predictors revealed symptomatic stenosis (hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–2.88; P = 0.042) and presence of IHD (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–3.42; P = 0.025) as significant predictors of long-term MACEs. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower rate of survival (P = 0.030) and MACE-free survival (P = 0.003) in the IHD group. Conclusions In this study, a poor long-term outcome was observed in patients with IHD and symptomatic stenosis but not in patients with conventional high-risk factors for surgery. Therefore, appropriate evaluation and treatment of IHD before and after CEA might be helpful for better outcome. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Carotid; Endarterectomy; Ischemic heart disease; Risk assessment; Survival analysis,"adult; Article; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; carotid artery obstruction; carotid endarterectomy; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; comparative study; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; death certificate; female; follow up; heart infarction; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle revascularization; human; long term survival; major clinical study; male; medical history; medical record; middle aged; percutaneous coronary intervention; postoperative complication; postoperative period; stable angina pectoris; surgical patient; survival; telephone interview; unstable angina pectoris; aged; coronary artery obstruction; heart muscle ischemia; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Coronary Stenosis; Endarterectomy, Carotid; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Ischemia; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85039053842

Methods: A three-dimensional finite element model was developed for predicting tooth movement, and a mechanical model based on the beam theory was constructed for clarifying the force systems. Results: When using a running loop without bends, the molar tipped mesially 14.4° and lingually 0.6°, rotated counterclockwise 4.1°, and the incisors retracted 0.02?mm and intruded 0.05?mm. These angles were about the same as those estimated by the beam theory. When the amount of tip back and toe-in angles was 11.0°, mesial translation of the molar was achieved, and incisors retracted 0.10?mm and intruded 0.30?mm. Conclusions: Mesial translation of a mandibular second molar without any significant movement of anterior teeth was achieved during protraction by controlling the tip back and toe-in angles and enhancing anterior anchorage with the combined use of a running loop and indirect skeletal anchorage. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Xanthohumol is a prenylated flavonoid found in hops (Humulus lupulus) and beer. In the present study, we investigated the effects of xanthohumol on MG-induced cytotoxicity in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Xanthohumol attenuated MG-induced cytotoxicity, as evidenced by improved cell viability, and prevented MG-induced MG-protein adducts, inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide production. In addition, xanthohumol increased glyoxalase I activity, glutathione, heme oxygenase-1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 levels in the presence of MG. Pretreatment with xanthohumol before MG exposure reduced MG-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, xanthohumol treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy induced by MG. Notably, the autophagy-reducing effect of xanthohumol was abolished after the addition of Ex527, a selective inhibitor of sirtuin 1, suggesting that xanthohumol is an effective sirtuin 1 activator for reducing autophagy. Taken together, our findings suggest xanthohumol as a promising new strategy for preventing diabetic osteopathy.

Methods: The main study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, phase IIIb study in which 50 mg of gemigliptin (N = 66) or placebo (N = 66) was administered to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and moderate or severe renal impairment over a 12-week period. Patients with a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7% to 11% and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 were enrolled in the main study. After 12 weeks, patients in the gemigliptin group continued to receive gemigliptin (N = 50), whereas patients in the placebo group were transitioned from placebo to linagliptin (N = 52). Each group received the indicated treatment over the subsequent 40-week period. A total of 102 patients consented to participate in the extension study, and 79 patients ultimately completed the study. Results: The HbA1c levels of both groups were significantly reduced at week 52 compared with baseline. Specifically, the adjusted mean change ± standard error in HbA1c level in the gemigliptin and placebo/linagliptin groups was 1.00% ± 0.21% and 0.65% ± 0.22% lower at week 52 than at baseline (P &lt;.001 and P =.003), respectively. No significant difference in the change in HbA1c level was found between the 2 groups (P =.148). Trends in fasting plasma glucose, fructosamine and glycated albumin levels in the 2 groups were similar to trends in HbA1c levels. The eGFR of both groups was also significantly lower at week 52 than at baseline, and no significant difference in change in eGFR was found between the 2 groups. In contrast, both drugs had little effect on urinary albumin excretion, although both drugs significantly reduced the urinary type IV collagen level. The overall rates of adverse events were similar between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Gemigliptin and linagliptin did not differ with respect to safety and efficacy in patients with T2DM and renal impairment. The 2 drugs had similar glucose-lowering effects, and the changes in eGFR and albuminuria were also similar. Additionally, the risk of side effects, including hypoglycaemia, was similar between the 2 groups. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",diabetic nephropathy; DPP-IV inhibitor; phase III study; type 2 diabetes mellitus,"collagen type 4; fructosamine; gemigliptin; glucose; glycosylated albumin; hemoglobin A1c; linagliptin; placebo; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; insulin; LC15-0444; linagliptin; piperidone derivative; pyrimidine derivative; sulfonylurea derivative; adult; albumin blood level; albuminuria; Article; controlled study; disease association; drug efficacy; drug safety; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; fructosamine blood level; glucose blood level; homeostasis model assessment; human; hypoglycemia; informed consent; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; side effect; treatment outcome; trend study; unspecified side effect; urinary excretion; aged; blood; chronic kidney failure; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; comparative study; complication; diabetic nephropathy; double blind procedure; drug effect; drug monitoring; follow up; hyperglycemia; kidney; middle aged; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; patient dropout; randomized controlled trial; severity of illness index; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Nephropathies; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Double-Blind Method; Drug Monitoring; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Kidney; Linagliptin; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Dropouts; Piperidones; Pyrimidines; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Severity of Illness Index; Sulfonylurea Compounds",2-s2.0-85028863059

Harmful effects of population-based colonoscopy screening may include complications induced by colonoscopy itself and by sedation, psychosocial distress, potential over-diagnosis and socioeconomic burden. In addition, harmful effect of colonoscopy may increase with age and comorbidity. As the adverse event risk in population-based colonoscopy screening may offset benefit of the screening colonoscopy, the adverse events associated with screening colonoscopy should be well managed and monitored. To adopt population-based colonoscopy screening, consensus for the risk and benefits of screening colonoscopy should be formed for its potential harms, patient preference, socioeconomic considerations, quality improvement of colonoscopy as well as its efficacy for CRC prevention. As the suboptimal colonoscopy quality is a major pitfall of population-based colonoscopy screening, adequate training and provider regulation for screening colonoscopists should be the first step to minimize the variation of quality between colonoscopists.

Methods: We analyzed nationally representative secondary data collected from Korean adolescents (N?=?72,435). To investigate substance use patterns, we conducted latent class analysis using seven behaviors linked to alcohol, cigarette, and e-cigarette use. After choosing the best latent class model, we investigated predictors of latent class membership (LCM) for substance use, using demographics and mental health conditions. Results: A four-latent class model best fit the data. Non-users (74%) had low likelihoods of reporting lifetime and current use of alcohol, cigarette, and e-cigarette. Experimenters (10%) had high likelihoods of reporting lifetime alcohol and cigarette use. Current drinkers (10%) had high likelihoods of reporting lifetime and current alcohol use. Multi-substance users (6%) had high likelihoods of reporting lifetime and current use of alcohol and cigarettes, lifetime e-cigarette use, and current binge drinking. Additionally, demographics (gender, grades, socioeconomic status, co-residence with family members, and grade point average) and mental health conditions (depression, suicidal ideation, and subjective unhappiness) successfully predicted LCM. Conclusions: In developing interventions for addressing substance-related issues, health professionals should focus on adolescent substance use patterns and take into account factors predicting LCM. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Adolescence; drinking; latent class analysis; smoking; substance use,adolescent; adolescent behavior; alcohol consumption; Article; cigarette smoking; depression; electronic cigarette; female; human; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; priority journal; sex difference; social status; South Korea; substance use; suicidal ideation; unhappiness,2-s2.0-85028554318

Several studies have reported that thread-embedding acupuncture (TEA) is effective in the treatment of LHIVD. However, these studies were of low quality and there is therefore little clinical evidence for the effectiveness of TEA in this regard. The aim of the present study is to establish the clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of TEA in the treatment of pain, function, and quality of life in patients with LHIVD. The study uses a rigorously designed, full-scale, randomized clinical trial (RCT) protocol. Method/design: This is a multicenter, randomized, patient-assessor blinded, sham-controlled trial with two parallel arms. Seventy patients with LHIVD who have lower back pain more severe than 40 mm on the 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and who are aged 19-70 years, will be recruited and randomly allocated to a TEA group and sham TEA (STEA) group. Both groups will receive treatment on 23 predefined acupoints once a week for eight weeks; needles with the thread removed will be used in the STEA group, while normal TEA will be employed in the TEA group. Changes in the 100-mm VAS for lower back pain after eight weeks will be assessed as the primary outcome. Furthermore, the 100-mm VAS for radiating pain, Oswestry Disability Index, Roland-Morris disability questionnaire, EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels, and global perceived effect will be measured and analyzed as secondary outcomes. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after screening.

The medications presently available to treat osteoporosis have side effects, and the development of safer and more effective treatments is urgently needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BHH10, a traditional Korean herbal medicine, in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Methods/Design: This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial and will include 168 postmenopausal women aged 55 years and older with osteoporosis. The participants will be recruited competitively from two sites of the Acupuncture and Moxibustion Department of Kyung Hee University Hospital of Korean Medicine, either Hoegidong or Gangdong in Seoul, Korea. Participants will be assigned randomly to one of two groups, the BHH10 group or the placebo group, in a 1:1 ratio, and will have five scheduled visits. Participants will take two tablets of BHH10 or placebo three times daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome is the change in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (L1-4) between baseline (visit 1) and 12 weeks after randomization (visit 5). Other outcome variables include changes in bone turnover markers, the Deficiency Syndrome of the Kidney Index, EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire score, and laboratory parameters, as well as adverse events. Discussion: To our knowledge, this will be the first clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of BHH10 in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. It is anticipated that the results will contribute to the development of traditional herbal medicines that can be used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women in Korea.

Previous studies have identified the anti-melanogenic effects of the extract of A. tenuissima root fermented by Aspergillus oryzae (FAT). This study investigated the protective effects of FAT against ultraviolet light B exposure (UVB; 30 mJ/cm2) in HaCaT (human keratinocyte) or Hs68 (human foreskin fibroblast) skin cells. FAT treatment was able to stimulate wound healing rate at the basal condition. FAT also favored the maintenance and/or improvement of extracellular matrix impairment caused by UVB irradiation through: 1) upregulation of procollagen Type-1 synthesis and secretion; 2) suppression of MMP-1 and elastase expression. FAT was able to play a role in the attenuation of inflammatory responses caused by UVB irradiation via upregulation of photo-protective hemeoxygease-1 and suppression of proinflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 expression. After further verification of the anti-photoaging potential of FAT, it could be utilized as an effective ingredient in anti-aging and anti-wrinkle cosmetics. ? 2018 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.",Angelica tenuissima; Extracellular matrix; Fermentation; Hemeoxygenase-1; Photoaging; Ultraviolet light B,"Angelica root extract; Angelica tenuissima root extract; cyclooxygenase 2; elastase; heme oxygenase 1; interstitial collagenase; procollagen C proteinase; unclassified drug; cyclooxygenase 2; heme oxygenase 1; HMOX1 protein, human; interstitial collagenase; MMP1 protein, human; pancreatic elastase; plant extract; procollagen; PTGS2 protein, human; radioprotective agent; antiaging activity; Article; controlled study; enzyme repression; extracellular matrix; foreskin cell line; human; human cell; keratinocyte; photoaging; protein secretion; protein synthesis; skin fibroblast; skin protection; ultraviolet B radiation; upregulation; wound healing; wrinkle; Angelica; Aspergillus oryzae; cell motion; chemistry; cutaneous parameters; cytology; drug effect; fermented product; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; oxidative stress; plant root; radiation response; secretion (process); transformed cell line; ultraviolet radiation; Angelica; Aspergillus oryzae; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Movement; Cyclooxygenase 2; Fermented Foods; Gene Expression Regulation; Heme Oxygenase-1; Humans; Keratinocytes; Matrix Metalloproteinase 1; Oxidative Stress; Pancreatic Elastase; Plant Extracts; Plant Roots; Procollagen; Radiation-Protective Agents; Skin Aging; Ultraviolet Rays; Wound Healing",2-s2.0-85065436212

We investigated gray matter volume (GMV) differences, TPH1 rs1800532 and rs1799913 polymorphisms previously found to be associated with depressive disorder and SB, and the relationship between the two markers. Methods Thirteen depressive disorder patients with suicidal attempts (SA) and twenty healthy controls were included. We examined GMV differences using a voxel-based morphometry and regions of interest analysis. Direct sequencing was used for genotyping. Results The patients showed significant GMV reduction in left cerebral region including middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex; in right middle temporal gyrus; in left cerebellar tonsil; and in right cerebral region including precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus (corrected p<0.005). The right precentral and postcentral gyri GMV values of AA and CA genotypes patients were significantly decreased compared to those of CC genotype subjects (corrected p=0.040). Conclusion These findings show the possibility that both GMV reductions and TPH1 rs1800532/rs1799913 A allele may be involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorder patients with SA. ? 2018 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.",Depressive disorder; Gray matter volume; Suicidal attempt; TPH1 gene,genomic DNA; tryptophan hydroxylase; adult; anterior cingulate; Article; Barratt Impulsiveness Scale; Beck Hopelessness Scale; behavior change; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; depression; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genotype; gray matter; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; ICD-10; inferior frontal gyrus; male; middle temporal gyrus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; polymerase chain reaction; postcentral gyrus; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; suicidal behavior; suicide attempt; voxel based morphometry,2-s2.0-85064636625

The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of clinical findings including medial tenderness, swelling, and ecchymosis, combined with the gravity stress test and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in the assessment of ankle mortise stability in association with isolated SER-type lateral malleolar fractures. The external rotation (ER) stress test was used as the reference with which the methods of assessment were compared. Methods: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled prospectively. Using the ER stress test as a reference, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and post-test probability of instability when using clinical examination, the gravity stress test, and MRI for diagnosing ankle mortise instability after an isolated SER lateral malleolar fracture. Results: The positive LR for clinical findings ranged from 1.45 to 2.54, and the negative LR ranged from 0.25 to 0.70, shifting the pre-test probability to a rarely important degree. In contrast, the positive LR for the gravity stress test was 5.71 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.52 to 21.48, a moderate shift from the pre-test probability, and the negative LR was 0.33 (95% CI = 0.16 to 0.66), indicating a small shift. In cases with a deep deltoid ligament disruption identified on MRI, the positive LR was 3.05 (95% CI = 1.03 to 9.02) and the negative LR was 0.53 (95% CI = 0.31 to 0.91), demonstrating a small but sometimes important shift. Conclusions: The gravity stress test is a reliable method for diagnosing ankle mortise instability in patients with an isolated SER lateral malleolar fracture. Nevertheless, this test alone would not qualify as a replacement for the ER stress test. However, when the gravity stress test result is consistent with the clinical or MRI findings, its diagnostic value is almost equivalent to that of the ER stress test. ? 2018 BY THE JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY, INCORPORATED.",,"adult; age; ankle instability; Article; body movement; clinical article; clinical examination; diagnostic value; exercise test; external rotation stress test; female; gravity stress test; human; male; malleolus fracture; musculoskeletal disease assessment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prospective study; reliability; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; supination; supination external rotation; adolescent; aged; ankle; ankle fracture; ankle injury; complication; injury scale; joint instability; middle aged; rotation; supination; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ankle Fractures; Ankle Injuries; Ankle Joint; Female; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Joint Instability; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Rotation; Supination; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85064135336

It is caused by genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression without changes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences. The gene expression change is due to methylation on DNA. Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) uniquely classifies patients with asthma according to their symptoms. The present study is investigated to find a novel epigenetic marker of diagnosis for Korean asthma patients using Korean differentiation syndrome category in TKM. We recruited 62 patients with asthma from departments of respiratory medicine in hospitals. They are classified by symptom diagnosis and questionnaire to the deficiency syndrome (DS) group and excess syndrome (ES) group. And their DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. To investigate novel epigenetic markers on classification by Korean differentiation syndrome category, methylation analysis was performed using next generation sequencing (NGS), Agilent SureSelect Human Methyl-Seq which is a tool from Agilent Technologies company. In analysis of differential methylated epigenetic markers between the DS group and the ES group, total of 8 sites in exon region in [meprin (a cell surface glycoprotein), A5 antigen (a developmentally-regulated cell surface protein), and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase mu (MAM) domain containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 1] (MDGA1) gene were considered to be closely associated with differentiation syndrome category in Korean asthma patients. The methylation within MDGA1 gene could be regarded as an epigenetic candidate marker for Korean differentiation syndrome category in Korean asthma patients.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of high-fat diet-induced obesity on tissue zinc concentrations and zinc transporter expressions in mice. Methods: C57BL/6J male mice were fed either a control diet (10% energy from fat, control group) or a high-fat diet (45% energy from fat, obese group) for 15 weeks. The zinc concentrations in the serum, stool, and various tissues were measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-atomic emission spectrophotometry or ICP-mass spectrophotometry. The levels of zinc transporter mRNAs in the liver, duodenum, and pancreas were measured by real-time RT-PCR. The levels of serum adipokines, such as leptin and IL-6, were determined. Results: The total body weight, adipose tissue weight, and hepatic TG and cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in the obese group, as compared to the control group. The obese group had significantly higher levels of serum leptin and pro-inflammatory IL-6 concentrations, and had significantly lower levels of serum alkaline phosphatase activity. The zinc concentrations of the liver, kidney, duodenum, and pancreas were all significantly lower in the obese group than in the control group. On the other hand, the fecal zinc concentrations were significantly higher in the obese group than in the control group. The serum zinc concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups. The ZnT1 mRNA levels of the liver and the pancreas were significantly higher in the obese group, as compared to the control group. Hepatic Zip10 mRNA was also increased in the obese group. Conclusion: Our study findings suggest that obesity increases fecal zinc excretion and lowers the tissue zinc concentrations, which may be associated with alterations in the zinc transporter expressions. ? 2018 The Korean Nutrition Society.",Adipokine; Mouse; Obesity; Zinc; Zinc transporters,,2-s2.0-85062909909

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) plays an important role as a mediator of various inflammatory responses in chronic periodontitis. Several studies have investigated the potential relationship between IL-1β polymorphism (rs16944) and susceptibility to chronic periodontitis; inflammatory process is involved, but conclusions is still controversial. Objective. The aim of this study was to determine whether the IL-1β polymorphism (rs16944) is associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis. Material and Methods. For the case-control study, 51 patients with chronic periodontitis and 33 healthy control patients were recruited in the study. Genotyping was conducted by direct sequencing. SNPStats and SPSS 18.0 were used for the analysis of genetic data and to evaluate odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and P values; logistic regression models were used. And to perform meta-analysis, studies about IL-1β polymorphism (rs16944) and chronic periodontitis were searched in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS) electronic databases until July 2017. Results. In our case-control study, no significant relationship was revealed between IL-1β polymorphism (rs16944) and chronic periodontitis (P 0 05 in each model).

Notably, the gut microbiota are believed to mature in early life. In this context, we compared the gut microbiota diversity in Korean adolescent healthy samples (KAHSs) to healthy Korean adults (HKAs) as well as the Human Microbiome Project healthy samples (HMPHSs), the latter being one of the largest adult cohorts, based on organismal composition, alpha- and beta-diversities, function/pathway prediction analysis, and co-occurrence networks. We found that the gut microbiota compositions, including the ratios of firmicutes to bacteroidetes, between KAHSs and HMPHSs were different, and the diversities of KAHSs were less than those of HMPHSs. The predicted functions, for example, secondary bile acid synthesis and insulin signaling of KAHSs and HMPHSs, were also significantly different. Genus-level networks showed that co-occurrences among different taxa more frequently happened in HMPHSs than in KAHSs. Even though both KAHSs and HMPHSs represent healthy microbiomes, comparisons showed substantial differences, likely implicating different diets, environments, and demographics. Interestingly, we observed lower microbial diversities and less frequent co-occurrences among different taxa in KAHSs than adult HMPHSs and HKAs. These new findings collectively suggest that the adolescent gut microbiota in the present Korean sample did not reach the extent of maturity of adult microbiota diversity. In all, further population studies of microbiome variation across geographies and developmental stages are warranted, and should usefully inform future diagnostics and therapeutics innovation targeting the microbiome.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum levels of Sema3A and Sema4D and to investigate their clinical significance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The serum levels of Sema3A and Sema4D were measured in 130 patients with RA and 65 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals. Circulating levels of biomarkers of RA-related inflammation and bone turnover such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α, interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-22, IL-34, osteopontin, Dkk-1, and sclerostin were also measured. Disease activity was determined by the 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28), and radiographic joint damage was assessed by the modified Sharp van der Heijde score (SHS). The serum levels of Sema3A were significantly higher in patients with RA than those in healthy controls (p < 0 001), whereas serum4D levels did not differ between the two groups. The levels of Sema4D showed a positive correlation with C-reactive protein (p = 0 001) and IL-6 (p < 0 001) levels, whereas the levels of Sema3A showed a negative correlation with Dkk-1 (p = 0 007) and TNF-α (p = 0 001). Even though Sema3A and Sema4D levels were comparable between RA patients with DAS28> 3.2 and with DAS28 ? 3.2, RA patients with radiographic progression (ΔSHS change/year ? 1) had significantly higher baseline levels of Sema4D than those without progression (p = 0 029). Additionally, when RA patients were divided into 3 groups using tertiles of Sema4D levels, the percentage of progressors was significantly increased (p = 0 045). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, serum Sema4D levels were an independent risk factor for radiographic progression. Our results suggest that the baseline levels of Sema4D might be a useful marker to identify RA patients with subsequent radiographic progression and that Sema4D may be an active mediator involved in RA-induced joint damage.

However, the toxicological effects of BN on erythrocytes and blood coagulation remain uninvestigated. OBJECTIVE: The aims of our study were to synthesize glycol chitosan (GC)- and hyaluronic acid (HA)-coated BNs, and to investigate the effects of these BNs on human cancer cells, erythrocytes, and whole blood. METHODS: We prepared hemocompatible forms of BN coated with GC and HA, and evaluated them using cell uptake/viability tests, hemolysis analysis and FE-SEM, as well as through hemorheological evaluation methods such as RBC deformability and aggregation, and blood coagulation. RESULTS: GC/BN and HA/BN were both ?200 nm, were successfully taken into cells, and emitted blue fluorescence. Both BNs were less toxic than bare BN, even at higher concentrations. The aggregation index of human red blood cells (RBCs) after 2 h incubation with BN, GC/BN, and HA/BN was greatly influenced, whereas RBC deformability did not dramatically change. CONCLUSIONS: We found that GC/BN affected the intrinsic coagulation pathway, whereas both GC/BN and HA/BN affected the extrinsic pathway. Therefore, HA/BN is less detrimental to RBCs and blood coagulation dynamics than bare BN and GC/BN. ? 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

We analyzed the clinical outcomes of post-SEMS insertion for malignant colorectal obstruction based on carcinomatosis status. Methods Stent- and patient-related clinical outcomes were compared for carcinomatosis status in a retrospective review involving 323 consecutive patients (colorectal cancer 198 patients; extracolonic malignancy 125 patients) who underwent palliative SEMS placement for malignant colorectal obstruction from January 2005 to March 2012.?Severity of carcinomatosis was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Results Carcinomatosis was observed in 190 patients (58.8?%). The rates of technical (84.7 vs. 94.7?%; P ?=?0.005) and clinical (73.2 vs. 83.5?%; P ?=?0.03) success were lower in patients with vs. without carcinomatosis. Rates of early (2.1?% vs. 3.0?%; P ?=?0.72) and delayed (1.6?% vs. 6.0?%; P ?=?0.08) perforation and stent failure (27.9?% vs. 26.3?%; P ?=?0.75) showed no difference. Technical and clinical success rates were significantly different based on the severity of carcinomatosis (technical success rate: mild 90.7?%, moderate 97.4?%, severe 76.3?%, P ?=?0.003; clinical success rate: mild 83.3?%, moderate 82.1?%, severe 63.9?%, P ?=?0.01). In multivariate analysis, severe carcinomatosis was identified as an independent factor related to technical (odds ratio [OR] 0.18, 95?% confidence interval [CI] 0.06?-?0.56) and clinical (OR 0.33, 95?%CI 0.15?-?0.74) success. Conclusions Peritoneal carcinomatosis was associated with decreased technical and clinical success rates in patients receiving SEMS for malignant colorectal obstruction. Moreover, the presence of severe carcinomatosis was an independent factor determining these clinical outcomes. ? 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",,antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer palliative therapy; carcinomatous peritonitis; clinical outcome; colon obstruction; colon perforation; colorectal disease; controlled study; device failure; disease severity; female; female genital tract cancer; follow up; head and neck cancer; human; major clinical study; male; malignant colorectal obstruction; middle aged; priority journal; retrospective study; sigmoid; stent migration; stomach cancer; urogenital tract cancer; colorectal tumor; complication; intestine obstruction; palliative therapy; pathology; peritoneum tumor; prosthesis complication; risk factor; secondary; self expandable metallic stent; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; tumor invasion; tumor volume; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Palliative Care; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Prosthesis Failure; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Self Expandable Metallic Stents; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Burden,2-s2.0-85057440656

Methods: A randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, two-way crossover study with a 7-day washout period was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and bioequivalence between an FDC of fimasartan/rosuvastatin and the separate co-administration of fimasartan and rosuvastatin in healthy Korean volunteers. The plasma concentrations of fimasartan and rosuvastatin were analyzed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, for which serial blood samples were collected for up to 48 hours post-administration of fimasartan and 72 hours post-administration of rosuvastatin, in each period. The PK parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental method. Results: A total of 78 subjects completed the study. All the 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) fell within the predetermined acceptance range. The GMR and 90% CI for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurement (AUC 0-t ) and the maximum plasma concentration (C max ) for fimasartan were 0.9999 (0.9391-1.0646) and 1.0399 (0.8665-1.2479), respectively. The GMR and 90% CI for the AUC 0-t and C max for rosuvastatin were 1.0075 (0.9468-1.0722) and 1.0856 (0.9944-1.1852), respectively. Treatment with fimasartan and rosuvastatin was generally well tolerated without serious adverse events. Conclusion: The new FDC formulation of 120 mg fimasartan and 20 mg rosuvastatin can be substituted for the separate co-administration of fimasartan and rosuvastatin, for the advantage of better compliance with convenient therapeutic administration. ? 2018 Kang et al.",Bioequivalence; Fimasartan; Fixed-dose combination; Pharmacokinetics; Rosuvastatin,"alanine aminotransferase; angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist; bilirubin; creatine kinase; fimasartan; fimasartan plus rosuvastatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; rosuvastatin; unclassified drug; biphenyl derivative; fimasartan; pyrimidine derivative; rosuvastatin; tetrazole derivative; adult; area under the curve; Article; bioequivalence; blood sampling; controlled study; crossover procedure; diarrhea; dizziness; drug blood level; drug clearance; drug formulation; drug half life; drug tolerability; dyspepsia; headache; human; human experiment; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; maximum concentration; maximum plasma concentration; myalgia; normal human; open study; patient compliance; pharmacokinetic parameters; pharmacokinetics; plasma concentration-time curve; protein urine level; randomized controlled trial; side effect; single drug dose; South Korean; tablet formulation; time to maximum plasma concentration; volunteer; blood; comparative study; dose response; drug combination; middle aged; oral drug administration; South Korea; therapeutic equivalence; young adult; Administration, Oral; Adult; Biphenyl Compounds; Cross-Over Studies; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Combinations; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pyrimidines; Republic of Korea; Rosuvastatin Calcium; Tetrazoles; Therapeutic Equivalency; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85056943809

Bleeding-related side effects that occurred immediately after removal of acupuncture needles were recorded. Three hundred and sixteen patients underwent 10,177 acupuncture sessions during the study period. Microbleeding (bleeding that ceased within 30 s) occurred at a rate of 3.9% in the NOAC group, 5.6% in the antiplatelet group, and 5.1% in the control group. There were no between-group differences in the microbleeding rate. No serious adverse events, including major bleeding, were detected.

Infantile colic is a common condition causing considerable deterioration in the quality of life of both infants and their parents. Minimal acupuncture, a gentle needling technique without strong muscle stimulation, has primarily been used to treat this condition, but the clinical evidence of its efficacy and safety is yet to be established. The objective of this review was to assess clinical evidence of the safety and efficacy of acupuncture for infantile colic. Methods. To identify studies for inclusion, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, Wanfang, and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System were searched until January 2017. Only randomised controlled trials of infantile colic in patients aged 0 to 25 weeks, who were treated with acupuncture, were included. To assess the quality, the risk of bias was determined for each study by two authors. The intention was to perform a meta-analysis, but this was not possible in this study due to considerable clinical heterogeneity among the included studies. Results. Of the 601 studies identified, only four randomized controlled trials were included in this review. All included studies were conducted in northern European countries. Most studies showed a low risk of bias in most domains. Minimal acupuncture on LI4 or ST36 without strong stimulation was used in all studies. From the narrative analysis, acupuncture appears to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of colic, including crying and feeding and stooling problems, and may have only minor adverse effects. However, clinical evidence could not be confirmed owing to considerable clinical heterogeneity and the small sample sizes of the included studies. Conclusion. There is currently no conclusive evidence on the safety and efficacy of acupuncture for infantile colic. Rigorous full-scale randomized controlled trials will be necessary in future. ? 2018 Dabin Lee et al.",,acupuncture; Article; clinical effectiveness; crying; defecation disorder; feeding disorder; human; infantile colic; patient safety; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review,2-s2.0-85056256181

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cell cycle arrest by this compound in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are unknown. Our study found that panaxydol treatment induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in NSCLC cells. The cell cycle arrest was accompanied by down-regulation of the protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and decrease in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Furthermore, up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1 was observed in panaxydol-treated NSCLC cells. In addition, panaxydol also induced accumulation of intracellular Ca2 + ([Ca2 +]i).

These results demonstrated that the anti-proliferative effects of panaxydol were caused by cell cycle arrest, which is closely linked to the up-regulation of [Ca2 +]i and represents a promising approach for the treatment of lung cancer. ? 2018 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Calcium; Cell cycle; Non-small cell lung cancer; Panax ginseng; Panaxydol,"antineoplastic agent; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase 2; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin dependent kinase 6; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cyclin E; ethylene glycol 1,2 bis(2 aminophenyl) ether n,n,n',n' tetraacetic acid; panaxydol; retinoblastoma protein; unclassified drug; alkyne derivative; calcium; CCNE1 protein, human; CDK6 protein, human; cell cycle protein; cyclin dependent kinase 6; cyclin E; fatty alcohol; oncoprotein; panaxydol; plant extract; retinoblastoma protein; A-549 cell line; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; bioaccumulation; calcium cell level; controlled study; down regulation; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; ginseng; human; human cell; lung cancer cell line; NCI-H358 cell line; non small cell lung cancer; phytochemistry; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; upregulation; cell cycle; cell cycle G1 phase; chemistry; drug effect; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; Panax; pathology; phytotherapy; Calcium; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cyclin E; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6; Diynes; Fatty Alcohols; G1 Phase; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Oncogene Proteins; Panax; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Retinoblastoma Protein; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85055848609

We defined ACO by a positive bronchodilator response (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, FEV1 &gt;12% and &gt;200 mL from baseline) or based on a previous history of asthma. Plasma levels of NGAL were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Results: Among the 137 subjects, 77 were ACO and 60 were non-ACO COPD. Overall, the plasma NGAL levels were 15.9±7.9 and 15.6±6.6 ng/mL for non-ACO and ACO subjects respectively, and not significantly different. However, NGAL levels were significantly higher in female subjects with ACO (17.0±6.4 vs. 11.1±4.5, P=0.01). In female subjects, NGAL levels showed a good predictive ability to discriminate between ACO and non-ACO COPD [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), 0.77]; the predictive ability was similar to that of the blood eosinophil count (AUROC, 0.79). There was a higher probability of discriminating ACO from non-ACO among subjects in the highest tertile of NGAL levels (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–4.28; P for trend =0.01). Conclusions: NGAL levels were significantly higher in ACO compared to non-ACO COPD in female subjects. After adjusting for gender as a confounding factor, the ability to distinguish ACO was better at higher levels of NGAL. ? Journal of Thoracic Disease.

A slight injury heals naturally through the normal healing process, while severe injury causes serious health implications. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to treat and repair various tissue defects. Recently, tissue engineering approaches have attracted a rapidly growing interest in biomedical fields to promote and enhance healing and regeneration of large-scale tissue defects. On the other hand, with the recent advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology, various nanomaterials have been suggested as novel biomaterials. Graphene, a two-dimensional atomic layer of graphite, and its derivatives have recently been found to possess promoting effects on various types of cells. In addition, their unique properties, such as outstanding mechanical and biological properties, allow them to be a promising option for hard tissue regeneration.

The extract of Ligularia fischeri leaves (LFE) is traditionally used as a folk medicine for treating inflammatory diseases in Korea as well. In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of MCE combined with LFE on antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic potentials. Based on the α-glucosidase inhibitory effect and promotion of adipocyte differentiation in the 3T3-L1 cell line, the MLM was prepared with MCE:LFE (8:2 weight:weight). MLM showed the synergistic effects in the promotion of the glucose uptake rate, suppression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) mRNA expression, upregulation of an insulin receptor substrate and glucose transporter type-4 expression, and an increase in insulin-associated signaling in C2C12 cells. In addition, the efficacy of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonism and glucose uptake rate by MLM supplementation was significantly enhanced in vitro. Then, the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects of MCE, LFE, and MLM at the dose of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day (n = 6 per each group) were determined in streptozotocin (STZ)-insulted mice fed an atherogenic diet (ATH) for 4 weeks. In addition, MLM (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day, n = 5 per each group) was supplemented in ATH-fed db/db mice for 10 weeks. Compared with MCE or LFE alone, MLM supplementation led to a more significant reduction of glucose levels in both STZ/ATH and db/db/ATH mice as well as lowered lipid profiles in STZ/ATH mice. In addition, the stimulation of islet of Langerhans regeneration was more pronounced by MLM supplementation in both mice models. In conclusion, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects were strengthened by the combined extracts of L. fischeri and M. charantia (MLM) in diabetes-mimicking mice. ? 2018 Hyun Jin Baek et al.",,alcohol; alpha glucosidase; cholesterol; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; fatty acid; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucose; glucose transporter 4; insulin; insulin receptor substrate; insulin receptor substrate 1; Ligularia fischeri extract; messenger RNA; Momordica charantia extract; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; plant extract; protein kinase B; rosiglitazone; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; antilipidemic effect; Article; atherogenic diet; cell differentiation; cell regeneration; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; dose response; drug activity; drug mixture; drug potentiation; enzyme inhibition; gene expression; glucose blood level; glucose transport; histology; in vitro study; Ligularia fischeri; male; medicinal plant; Momordica charantia; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas islet; plant leaf; protein expression; signal transduction; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; upregulation,2-s2.0-85055516207

To improve the environment, huge amounts of data are gathered, manipulated, analyzed, and utilized, and these data might include noise, uncertainty, or unexpected mistreatment of the data. In some datasets, the class imbalance problem skews the learning performance of the classification algorithms. In this paper, we propose a case-based reasoning method that combines the use of crowd knowledge from open source data and collective knowledge. This method mitigates the class imbalance issues resulting from datasets, which diagnose wellness levels in patients suffering from stress or depression. We investigate effective ways to mitigate class imbalance issues in which the datasets have a higher proportion of one class over another. The results of this proposed hybrid reasoning method, using a combination of crowd knowledge extracted from open source data (i.e., a Google search, or other publicly accessible source) and collective knowledge (i.e., case-based reasoning), were that it performs better than other traditional methods (e.g., SMO, BayesNet, IBk, Logistic, C4.5, and crowd reasoning).

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by persistent upper dyspeptic symptoms without organic lesions. There is no standard therapy for FD. Yukgunja-Tang (YGJT) is an herbal medicine used for treating upper gastrointestinal symptoms in Asia. Studies on the effect of YGJT on FD have been conducted. However, the results were inconsistent. In Hyungsang medicine, traditional Korean medicine, FD patients are classified into bladder body (BB) or gallbladder body (GB) subtypes by the shape and angle of their faces. Each subtype may have different characteristics, physiology, and pathology of the same disease. YGJT is more effective for patients with BB subtype. The three-dimensional facial shape diagnostic system (3-FSDS) was shown to be effective in diagnosing BB or GB subtypes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of YGJT on FD patients classified using the 3-FSDS. Materials and Methods. The current study was a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized, two-center trial. Eligible patients were diagnosed with either BB or GB FD subtype using the 3-FSDS. Ninety-six participants (48 BB and 48 GB subtypes) were randomly allocated to treatment or control groups in a 2:1 ratio. YGJT or placebo was administered for eight weeks. The primary outcome was assessed using the total dyspepsia symptom scale (TDS), while the secondary outcomes were assessed using the single dyspepsia symptom scale (SDS), proportion of responders, visual analog scale, Nepean dyspepsia index, functional dyspepsia-related quality of life, and spleen qi deficiency questionnaire. Results and Discussion. The result of TDS showed the superior effect of YGJT on BB over GB subtype. The subgroup analysis of TDS and SDS scores showed the superior effect of YGJT over placebo. Other outcome variables did not show any significant differences between groups. Conclusion. YGJT may be considered for FD patients diagnosed with BB subtype using 3-FSDS. ? 2018 Seok-Jae Ko et al.",,herbaceous agent; placebo; rikkunshito; unclassified drug; yukgunja tang; adult; Article; bladder; controlled study; digestive system disease assessment; disease classification; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; dyspepsia; face; functional dyspepsia related quality of life questionnaire; gallbladder; herbal medicine; human; major clinical study; multicenter study; Nepean Dyspepsia Index; outcome assessment; patient compliance; qi deficiency; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; single dyspepsia symptom scale; spleen qi deficiency questionnaire; total dyspepsia symptom scale; visual analog scale,2-s2.0-85055355465

Aim: First, we explored the redistribution of 2011 GOLD groups by reference to the 2017 GOLD criteria. Second, we investigated the characteristics of GOLD B patients and the natural course of GOLD B patients according to the 2017 GOLD guidelines. Methods: In total, 2,010 COPD patients in the Korean COPD Subgroup Study cohort were analyzed at baseline and 1 year after enrollment. Results: The 2011 GOLD C patients were redistributed to the 2017 A (64.5%) and C (35.4%) groups. The 2011 GOLD D patients were redistributed to the 2017 B (61.6%) and D (38.6%) groups. The GOLD B patients constituted 62.7% of all patients according to the 2017 classification. Such patients exhibited higher % predicted FEV 1 values, longer six-minute walk distances, fewer symptoms, and lower inflammatory marker levels than GOLD D patients. Most GOLD B patients remained in that group (69.1%), but 13.8% progressed to group D at 1-year follow-up. The factors associated with progression from GOLD B to GOLD D were older age, higher modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) and St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) symptom scores, and a lower % predicted FEV1 value. Conclusion: Severe symptoms, poorer health status, and greater airflow limitation increased patients’ risk of exacerbation and progression from group B to group D when the 2017 GOLD criteria were applied. ? 2018 Choi et al.",COPD; GOLD B; Progression,"biological marker; C reactive protein; age; aged; airflow; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; disease classification; disease course; disease exacerbation; disease severity; dyspnea; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; neutrophil count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; prospective study; quality of life; six minute walk test; airway obstruction; chronic obstructive lung disease; disease exacerbation; health status indicator; longitudinal study; lung function test; middle aged; pathophysiology; practice guideline; procedures; prognosis; recurrent disease; risk assessment; severity of illness index; South Korea; Aged; Airway Obstruction; Disease Progression; Female; Guidelines as Topic; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Republic of Korea; Respiratory Function Tests; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Symptom Flare Up",2-s2.0-85055157290

Methods—We included 81 consecutive thyroid nodules with US-guided biopsy by a 20-gauge core needle and 86 consecutive thyroid nodules with US-guided biopsy by an 18-gauge core needle during 2 years. The rate of inconclusive results, including nondiagnostic or atypia/follicular lesion of undetermined significance, was compared. The diagnostic performance for malignancy was assessed in nodules with a final diagnosis. The complication rate and CNB specimen yield were also compared. Results—Eighteen-gauge CNB showed a lower rate of nondiagnostic results (1.2% versus 8.6%; P5.024) than 20-gauge CNB; however, the rates of atypia/follicular lesion of undetermined significance and inconclusive results were not significantly different between the groups (P>.05). In addition, 18-gauge CNB showed higher sensitivity (75.0% versus 66.7%), a higher negative predictive value (83.9% versus 75.9%), and higher accuracy (78.3% versus 74.4%) for detecting malignancy than 20-gauge CNB, although the results did not achieve statistical significance. No major complications occurred in either of the CNB groups. The 18-gauge needle group had significantly fewer CNBs and larger specimen diameters (P<.001). Conclusions—Core needle biopsy with an 18-gauge needle could be more effective for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules than CNB with a 20-gauge needle. ? 2018 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.",Core needle biopsy; Diagnostic efficacy; Head and neck; Invasive techniques; Thyroid nodules; Thyroid/parathyroid; Ultrasound,"Biopsy; Ultrasonics; Core-needle biopsies; Diagnostic efficacy; Head and neck; Invasive techniques; Thyroid nodule; Thyroid/parathyroid; Needles; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; female; human; image guided biopsy; interventional ultrasonography; large core needle biopsy; male; middle aged; needle; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; retrospective study; thyroid gland; thyroid nodule; Biopsy, Large-Core Needle; Female; Humans; Image-Guided Biopsy; Male; Middle Aged; Needles; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Nodule; Ultrasonography, Interventional",2-s2.0-85055151266

Type 1 diabetic mice were induced in C57/BL6J mice by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. The mice were sacrificed at 16 weeks after STZ injection. Tissues and plasmas were obtained to determine the expression levels of Tβ4 using ELISA, real time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. The average serum glucose level was increased to approximately 400 mg/dL beginning 2 weeks after the five injections of STZ and lasting for at least 13 weeks until sacrifice. The plasma and tissue levels of Tβ4 in the age-matched control mice were not significantly different from those of the diabetic mice. In conclusion, the Tβ4 expression level in the plasmas and tissues of diabetic mice was not affected by diabetic conditions. It indirectly suggests that the therapeutic effect of Tβ4 on diabetic complications is due to its regenerative effects on damaged tissue but not to the changed expression level of Tβ4 in plasma and tissues of diabetes. ? 2018 Kyung Sook Cho et al.",,"biological marker; glucose; streptozocin; thymosin; thymosin beta4 protein; timbetasin; unclassified drug; streptozocin; thymosin; thymosin beta(4); animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; Article; body weight; controlled study; drug effect; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; glucose blood level; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; injection; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; mouse; nonhuman; plasma; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; serum; spleen cell; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; tissues; animal; blood; experimental diabetes mellitus; intraperitoneal drug administration; metabolism; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Injections, Intraperitoneal; Mice; Streptozocin; Thymosin",2-s2.0-85053370842

However, current medications for obesity are limited because of their adverse effects. Interest in natural products for the treatment of obesity is thus rapidly growing. Korean medicine is characterized by the wide use of herbal formulas. However, the combination rule of herbal formulas in Korean medicine lacks experimental evidence. According to Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica, the earliest book of herbal medicine, Bupleuri Radix (BR) and Scutellariae Radix (SR) possess the Sangsoo relationship, which means they have synergistic features when used together. Therefore these two are frequently used together in prescriptions such as Sosiho-Tang. In this study, we used the network pharmacological method to predict the interaction between these two herbs and then investigated the effects of BR, SR, and their combination on obesity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. BR, SR, and BR-SR mixture significantly decreased lipid accumulation and the expressions of two major adipogenic factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBP), and their downstream genes, Adipoq, aP2, and Lipin1 in 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, the BR-SR mixture had synergistic effects compared with BR or SR on inhibition of adipogenic-gene expressions. BR and SR also inhibited the protein expressions of PPARγ and C/EBP. Furthermore, the two extracts successfully activated AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK ), the key regulator of energy metabolism. When compared to those of BR or SR, the BR-SR mixture showed higher inhibition rates of PPARγ and C/EBP, along with higher activation rate of AMPK. These results indicate a new potential antiobese pharmacotherapy and also provide scientific evidence supporting the usage of herbal combinations instead of mixtures in Korean medicine. ? 2018 Jueun Lee et al.",,"adipocyte protein 2; adiponectin; apigenin; baicalein; baicalin; beta eudesmol; camphor; capsaicin; caspase 3; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; coumarin; farnesol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; kaempferol; lipin 1; messenger RNA; palmitic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; pinene; prostaglandin G; prostaglandin synthase; protein; protein bcl 2; quercetin; radix bupleuri; scutellarein; Scutellariae radix; sitosterol; unclassified drug; wogonin; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipogenesis; Article; cell viability; controlled study; drug mechanism; drug potentiation; energy expenditure; enzyme activation; gene expression; lipid storage; obesity; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting",2-s2.0-85053038550

Because these machines are expensive, most animal hospitals do not perform radiotherapy. This study evaluated the ability of relatively inexpensive kilovoltage X-ray machines to treat companion animals. A simulation study based on a commercial treatment-planning system was performed for tumors of the brain (non-infectious meningoencephalitis), nasal cavity (malignant nasal tumors), forefoot (malignant muscular tumors), and abdomen (malignant intestinal tumors). The results of kilovoltage (300 kV and 450 kV) and megavoltage (6 MV) X-ray beams were compared. Whereas the 300 kV and 6 MV X-ray beams provided optimal radiation dose homogeneity and conformity, respectively, for brain tumors, the 6 MV X-rays provided optimal homogeneity and radiation conformity for nasal cavity, forefoot, and abdominal tumors. Although megavoltage X-ray beams provided better radiation dose distribution in most treated animals, the differences between megavoltage and kilovoltage X-ray beams were relatively small. The similar therapeutic effects of the kilovoltage and 6 MV X-ray beams suggest that kilovoltage X-ray beams may be effective alternatives to megavoltage X-ray beams in treating cancers in companion animals. ? 2018 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science.",Companion animals; Radiation therapy; X-ray,abdominal tumor; animal; brain tumor; dog; dog disease; muscle tumor; nose tumor; radiotherapy dosage; veterinary medicine; Abdominal Neoplasms; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Muscle Neoplasms; Nose Neoplasms; Radiotherapy Dosage,2-s2.0-85050797954

Eligible subjects received either the Bretol? patch (test drug) or Hokunalin ? patch (reference drug) in sequence according to their allocated group. Serial blood samples for PK analyses were collected for up to 48 hours after tulobuterol TDS application. The PK parameters, including the maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration time (AUClast), were estimated by using noncompartmental analysis.

Pharmacoacupuncture is a new acupuncture treatment that stimulates acupuncture points by injecting herbal medicine into them. Recently, pharmacoacupuncture has been widely used in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease in traditional East Asian medicine. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacoacupuncture in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Methods. The following electronic databases were searched for studies published in or before December 2016: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, OASIS, and CNKI, without language restriction. The main outcome assessed was the total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. The details of the pharmacoacupuncture intervention, such as the herbal medicine and acupuncture points used, were also investigated. Results. From 138 studies, 3 randomized controlled trials were included; the number of patients analyzed was 134. Most of the studies showed considerable methodological flaws. There was heterogeneity of the intervention type and treatment duration in the included studies. Therefore, we could not conduct a meta-analysis. In one study, adjunctive bee venom pharmacoacupuncture therapy significantly improved total UPDRS scores compared with conventional therapy alone. Another study, which used adjunctive Kakkonein pharmacoacupuncture, did not reveal significant improvement compared with conventional therapy alone. A third study reported that Mailuoning pharmacoacupuncture was able to significantly improve the modified Webster Symptom Score when compared with no treatment. Adverse events related to the pharmacoacupuncture were reported in only one case, itching caused by the bee venom. Conclusions. Our findings regarding the efficacy of pharmacoacupuncture as a therapy for idiopathic Parkinson's disease are currently inconclusive. Further large and rigorous clinical trials are needed. ? 2018 Ki-Ho Cho et al.",,bee venom; acupuncture; acupuncture point; bibliographic database; comparative study; disease duration; disease severity; East Asian; herbal medicine; human; idiopathic disease; in vitro study; in vivo study; meta analysis; moxibustion; outcome assessment; Parkinson disease; pharmacoacupuncture; Review; risk assessment; screening test; systematic review; treatment duration; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale,2-s2.0-85049860870

Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from the websites of Statistics Korea and the National Cancer Center. The total diagnosed cases were compared from 1999 to 2012, and five-year survival rates from 1993 to 2011. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) for each type of cancer were compared from 1999 to 2012. The authors also compared these data according to the spread status of the disease. Percentage changes in incidence rates for all three cancers according to age group were compared from 1999 to 2011 in four-year intervals. Results: The highest ASR for cervical cancer was 18.6 per 100,000 in 1999, whereas for ovarian and uterine corpus cancer they were 6.5 and 5.9 per 100,000 in 2012, respectively. Five-year survival rates of cervical and ovarian cancer showed no significant improvement, but that of uterine corpus cancer slightly improved. Most patients with cervical cancer (79%) and uterine corpus cancer (84%) were diagnosed at either localized or regional spread status. The age-specific incidence rates for cervical cancer decreased in all age groups except the 20-29-year-old and above 85-year-old age groups. Conclusion: The decreasing trend of incidence of cervical cancer may be the result of well-organized and an improved participation rate in the national cancer screening program. This review could be a reference for predicting the future status of these cancers among women in less developed countries. ? 2018 S.O.G. Canada Inc.

Although traditional herbal medicines have long been used to treat colorectal cancer, the incidence and mortality in patients with colorectal cancer has continued to increase. Danggui-Sayuk-Ga-Osuyu-Saenggang-Tang (DSGOST) has long been used for treatment of chills, while few studies have reported its anticancer effect. This study aimed to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of DSGOST on TNF-α-mediated invasion and migration of colorectal cancer HCT116 cell lines. MTT was used to measure cell viability. Wound healing and Transwell invasion assay were used to detect migration and invasion of cells, respectively. The intracellular localization of proteins of interest was assessed by immunocytochemistry. Western blotting was performed to determine the expression level of various proteins. A non-toxic dose of DSGOST (50 μg/ml) on HCT116 cells was determined by MTT assay. Furthermore, DSGOST prevented the TNF-α-induced invasive phenotype in HCT116 cells. DSGOST inhibition of the invasive phenotype was also associated with increased expression of EMT markers. Furthermore, DSGOST treatment blocked TNF-α-induced migration and invasion of HCT116 cells. In addition, DSGOST treatment inhibited TNF-α-mediated nuclear translocation of Snail. DSGOST treatment also downregulated TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase-3β.

This is a prospective, pragmatic, assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed at testing the efficacy and safety of adjuvant Chuna Manual Therapy (CMT) in patients with cervicogenic dizziness under usual care treatments. Fifty patients with cervicogenic dizziness will be randomly allocated to CMT or usual care (UC) groups in a 1: 1 ratio. Extensive screening procedures, including examinations for central nervous system problems and nystagmus, will be applied to exclude other dizziness-inducing disorders. The eligible participants will receive 12 sessions of CMT plus UC or only UC over 6 weeks. CMT includes mandatory and discretionary techniques, whereas UC includes electrotherapy, thermotherapy, and patient education. The efficacy will be evaluated primarily as Dizziness Handicap Inventory score. The severity and frequency of dizziness, the level of neck pain or stiffness, and the cervical range of motion will also be evaluated. Safety will be assessed by adverse events.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and treatment-related mortality (TRM) remain significant challenges to improving survival after HSCT. Here, we analyzed the outcome of TM and SCD patients, who received allogeneic HSCT with myeloablative conditioning at our institution. Methods Twenty-two patients (15 TM, 7 SCD), with a median age of 9 years (range, 1.6-16.9), underwent allogeneic HSCT using busulfan, cyclophosphamide and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin-based conditioning. Cells were derived from either the bone marrow (8 patients), or peripheral blood stem cells (14 patients). The majority of patients received HSCT from a matched sibling donor (N=18). GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine and short course methotrexate. Results All patients achieved donor engraftment. Two SCD patients died from TRM-related grade IV gut GVHD (N=1) or severe bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) (N=1). Cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was 36.4% and 32.7%, respectively. Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in 8 patients (36.4%), but resolved in all instances. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) occurred in 1 patient. The overall survival (OS) was 90.9% (TM 100%, SCD 71.4%), with all patients achieving transfusion independence, while 8 achieved complete donor chimerism. Conclusion Busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and ATG-based conditioning for HSCT of TM and SCD patients did not result in graft failure, although modifications may be required to reduce VOD incidence. Further changes to donor type and cell source prioritization are necessary to minimize TRM and morbidity caused by GVHD. ? 2018 Korean Society of Hematology.",Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Myeloablative conditioning; Sickle cell disease; Thalassemia major,aciclovir; alteplase; busulfan; cotrimoxazole; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; defibrotide; fluconazole; ganciclovir; methotrexate; micafungin; prostaglandin E1; recombinant antithrombin III; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; rituximab; thymocyte antibody; acute graft versus host disease; adolescent; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; bone marrow cell; bronchiolitis obliterans; child; chimera; chronic graft versus host disease; clinical article; continuous infusion; cytomegalovirus infection; disseminated intravascular clotting; engraftment; Epstein Barr virus; female; graft versus host reaction; hemoglobinopathy; human; male; myeloablative conditioning; overall survival; peripheral blood stem cell; posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease; retrospective study; sibling; sickle cell anemia; survival; thalassemia major; treatment outcome; vein occlusion,2-s2.0-85049043808

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the principal active components of these plant parts and their pharmacological properties. Repeated SiO2 and octadecyl SiO2 column chromatography with the aerial parts of M. Verticillata led to isolation of four phenolic compounds; these compounds were identified as benzyl-α-D-galactopyranoside (1), (-)-secoisolariciresinol-9'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (2), transferulic acid (3), and trans-ferulic acid methyl ester (4) on the basis of physicochemical and spectroscopic analyses including infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy. Compounds 1-4 were first isolated from M. Verticillata in this study. Furthermore, compounds 1-4 recovered alloxan-induced PI damage in zebrafish. Especially, compound 3 recovered the size of the injured PIs by 83.8% (p=0.0007) compared to the alloxaninduced group, while compound 4 by 33.4% (p=0.0072).

Since recent studies implicate an HP extract in suppressing inflammation, we investigated whether an aqueous HP extract can ameliorate inflammation that occurred in the lungs. When administered with a single intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS), C57BL/6 mice developed an acute neutrophilic lung inflammation along with an increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. However, this was diminished by the administration HP extract via an intraperitoneal route 2 h after LPS treatment. Western blot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that while suppressing the activity of a proinflammatory factor NF-κB marginally, the HP extract strongly activated an anti-inflammatory factor Nrf2, with concomitant expression of Nrf2-dependent genes. Mechanistically, the HP extract suppressed the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Nrf2, functioning similarly to a 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Collectively, these results suggest that the HP extract suppresses inflammation in mouse lungs, which is in part related to the HP extract perturbing the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Nrf2 and thus increasing the function of Nrf2. ? 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Anti-Inflammation; Hominis placenta; Neutrophilic Inflammation; NF-κ B; Nrf2,"antiinflammatory agent; benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; lipopolysaccharide; placenta extract; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor Nrf2; ubiquitin; autacoid; cytokine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lipopolysaccharide; Nfe2l2 protein, mouse; tissue extract; transcription factor Nrf2; ubiquitin; animal cell; animal cell culture; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; aqueous solution; Article; controlled study; female; gene expression; HEK293 cell line; Hominis placenta; human; human cell; human cell culture; human tissue; lung lavage; mouse; nonhuman; placenta; pneumonia; protein degradation; RAW 264.7 cell line; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; ubiquitination; Western blotting; animal; C57BL mouse; chemically induced; Chinese medicine; drug effect; genetics; intraperitoneal drug administration; metabolism; neutrophil; pneumonia; pregnancy; Animals; Cytokines; Female; Gene Expression; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Injections, Intraperitoneal; Lipopolysaccharides; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neutrophils; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; NF-kappa B; Placenta; Pneumonia; Pregnancy; RAW 264.7 Cells; Tissue Extracts; Ubiquitin",2-s2.0-85046736947

Results-After the QA evaluation, 542 of 685 hospitals and 1340 of 1985 private clinics passed the test. The evaluation of private clinics and hospitals showed substantial differences in the frequency of adequacy or mean scores between the pass and fail groups for all QA items, even requirements. Among 233 participants in the hands-on workshops, 187 physicians (80.2%) responded to the questionnaire. Results revealed that physicians had deficient knowledge and experience about liver US. Conclusions-The quality of liver US for hepatocellular carcinoma screening remains suboptimal. Education for physicians who perform liver US examinations is unsatisfactory in Korea. We should make an effort to improve the quality of liver US and teach basic US techniques to physicians. ? 2017 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.",Abdominal; Education; Hepatobiliary; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Quality assurance; Screening; Ultrasound,"Diagnosis; Diseases; Education; Hospitals; Quality assurance; Screening; Surveys; Ultrasonics; Abdominal; Cancer screening; Clinical images; Follow up; Hepatobiliary; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Knowledge and experience; Medical institutions; Quality control; adult; aged; clinical competence; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; echography; female; health care quality; human; liver; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; middle aged; procedures; program evaluation; reproducibility; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Clinical Competence; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Program Evaluation; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Reproducibility of Results; Republic of Korea; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-85045744458

However, the effects of AG on periodontitis have not been clarified yet. In this study, we investigated the ameliorative effects of AG against ligature-induced periodontitis. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups; non-ligatured (normal), ligatured and treated with vehicle (ligatured), ligatured and treated with 1 mg mL-1 AG (AG1), and ligatured and treated with 100 mg mL-1 AG (AG100). 70% ethanol extracts of AG were topically applied onto both sides of the first molar daily for 14 days. In addition, human dermal fibroblast cells were treated with 1, 10 and 100 μg mL-1 AG to characterize the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9). Topical AG treatment reduced alveolar bone resorption, as assessed by methylene blue staining. The structures of soft gingival tissues (periodontal pocket) were recovered in the AG-treated groups. The expression of MMP-9 was decreased, and that of type 1 collagen was significantly increased in AG-treated gingival tissues. In addition, AG treatment inhibited the activity of MMP-9 in LPS-treated human dermal fibroblast cells. This study reveals that topical AG treatment has the potential to ameliorate the destruction of gingival tissues by inhibiting MMP-9 activity. AG may be a candidate for the treatment of periodontitis. ? 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Aromatic compounds; Biomaterials; Cell culture; Data mining; Diseases; Fibroblasts; Histology; Angelica gigas; Ethanol extract; Gingival tissue; Human dermal fibroblasts; Metallopeptidases; Methylene blue staining; Periodontal disease; Sprague-Dawley rats; Tissue,2-s2.0-85045515521

We retrospectively evaluated the incidence of PPCs and their risk factors in LPPPD. In 191 patients who underwent LPPPD, the incidence of PPCs was 28.8% (n=55). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors for PPCs were male sex [odds ratio (OR), 2.518; P=0.008], high body mass index (OR, 1.172; P=0.024), and low preoperative serum albumin level (OR, 0.390; P=0.032).

On the other hand, however, more complex technology and/or services inhibit users' satisfaction and,consequently,the intention to adopt SST, because such SST can instill fear in users. Nevertheless, at present, patients and other people who are interested in their own health and well-being are paying great attention to healthcare robots (as a form of SST)and,consequently, it has become crucial to investigate how these healthcare robots can positively influence users' satisfaction with them. Hence, this study aims to empirically investigate the factors that affect users' satisfaction with healthcare robots, especially in regard to human-robot interaction (HRI). Methods/Statistical analysis: We focused on the theory of heterophily and applied a series of factors identified in previous robot-adoption studies.Uniquely, this study focuses on users' heterophily with healthcare robots, examining heterophily through three fundamental ele-ments, empathy, professionalism, and personality, which we considered to be suitable fordetermining user satisfaction with HRI-based communication.To prove the validity of our hypotheses, we conducted an empirical testthat involved participants receiving a short health assessment from a robot. Findings: The findings of our empirical test supported our hypothesis that the lower the difference in empathy between a user and robot, the higher the level of user satisfaction with the humanoid-style healthcare service. Further, our results also suggest that heterogeneity between a user and healthcare robot is positively associated with user satisfaction. Improvements/Applications: First, to increase user satisfaction,robots must be provided with the ability to somehow recognizea user's personality and adjust their own accordingly before beginning the robot-based healthcare service. Secondly, users' behavior patterns should be analyzed by the healthcare robot. Overall, our study empirically shows the importance of ensuring thatprofessionalism is present in healthcare-domain-related HRI. ? 2018 Ohbyung Kwon at.al.",Health-care robot; Heterogeneity; Human-robot interaction; Humanoid; User satisfaction,,2-s2.0-85045016067

Methods: Preoperative demographic, clinicopathologic, and laboratory variables were reviewed in patients with an ovarian mass that was subsequently diagnosed as either epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) or a benign ovarian mass on histologic analysis. The differences between variables of the two groups were further evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate variables to predict the presence of EOC. Results: According to the analysis of 229 patients with EOC, 120 (52.4%) patients had serous adenocarcinoma. Of the 229 patients, 110 (48.1%) patients had stage I or II disease and 119 (52.0%) had stage III or IV disease. There was a significant difference between EOC and benign ovarian mass in median values of variables such as age, white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) (all P < 0.001, except for WBC count [P = 0.009]). In addition, there was significant difference in median values of these continuous variables among early-stage EOC, advanced-stage EOC, and benign ovarian mass (P < 0.001 for all variables). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age (odds ratio [OR] = 4.14, P < 0.001), CA125 levels (OR = 9.87, P < 0.001), NLR (OR = 1.76, P = 0.049), PLR (OR = 2.41, P = 0.004), and LMR (OR = 0.51, P = 0.024) were found to significantly predict the presence of EOC.

However, poor compliance and decreased risk of exposure to malaria necessitate that control strategies be reestablished. Methods: To predict the incidence of malaria according to a control strategy, we proposed a mathematical model for its transmission using epidemiological data from 2010 to 2012. The benefit component included in the analyses was the averted cost with each control strategy, and the cost components were the cost of implementing chemoprophylaxis and early diagnosis. Results: The chemoprophylaxis regimen with hydroxychloroquine sulfate and primaquine was Intervention 1, the regimen with primaquine only was Intervention 2, and diagnosis with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kit within 5 days of fever was Intervention 3. The simulation indicated that the combined control program with chemoprophylaxis and early diagnosis would be the most effective strategy, whereas sole early diagnosis would be the least effective strategy. However, the cost-benefit ratio of chemoprophylaxis was less than Intervention 1, irrespective of the varying range of chemoprophylaxis compliance, and that of early diagnosis was more than Intervention 1, regardless of the varying early diagnosis rate and demand for the RDT kit. Although chemoprophylaxis would be more effective at reducing the incidence of malaria than early diagnosis, it is less economical due to the higher cost. Conclusion: Our results support the introduction of early diagnosis with a RDT kit to control malaria in the Republic of Korea Army. ? 2018 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Chemoprophylaxis; Cost-Benefit analysis; Malaria; Rapid diagnostic test kit,"hydroxychloroquine; chemoprophylaxis; cost benefit analysis; diagnostic kit; early diagnosis; economics; human; malaria; soldier; theoretical model; Chemoprevention; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Early Diagnosis; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Malaria; Military Personnel; Models, Theoretical; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic",2-s2.0-85042940544

The study aims to identify and classify determinants used to make judgement for the strength of recommendations among 56 Korean clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and explore strong recommendations based on low quality of evidence. Methods: Determinants used in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach among 34 CPGs which have reported both strength of recommendations and level of evidence were reviewed. Results: Five of 34 CPGs (14.7%) considered quality of evidence, benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, and costs. And 24 of 34 CPGs (70.6%) considered both magnitude of effect and feasibility as additional determinants. Judgement table was not widely provided for use to translate evidence into recommendations. Eighty-two of 121 recommendations (67.8%, ranged 20.0% to 100.0%) among 11 CPGs using the same judgement scheme showed 'strong' strength of recommendations based on low or very low quality of evidence. Among 5 paradigmatic situations that justify strong recommendations based on low or very low evidence, situation classified as 'potential equivalence, one option clearly less risky or costly' was 87.8% for 82 strong recommendations. Situation classified as 'uncertain benefit, certain harm' was 4.9%. Conclusion: There is a need to introduce and systematize an evidence-based grading system. Using judgement table to justify the strength of recommendations and applying the 5 paradigmatic situations mentioned above is also recommended in the near future. ? 2018 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Clinical practice guidelines; Grade approach; Judgement table; Quality of evidence; Strength of recommendations,classification; evidence based medicine; human; practice guideline; South Korea; standards; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Republic of Korea,2-s2.0-85042467219

SIRT1 is known for its regulatory roles in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and circadian rhythms. This study was designed to determine whether WHC can increase and mimic the biological reactions of SIRT1 activation. Ten-month-old male mice were divided into four groups: nontreated normal diet (ND), nontreated high-fat diet (HFD), WHC-treated ND, and WHC-treated HFD. Body weight and cognitive functions were evaluated after treatment. The hippocampal expressions of SIRT1 and PGC-1α were also measured. The components of WHC were identified by liquid chromatography. High-fat diet-fed mice gained more weight and demonstrated greater deficits in short-term and long-term cognitive functions. WHC suppressed the deleterious effects of a HFD on weight gain and cognitive decline, but showed no prominent effects on animals fed NDs. The herbal treatment also increased the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1α in the hippocampus. Despite the induction of hippocampal SIRT1 expression by WHC, resveratrol was not present among the natural compounds identified.

Harmful effects of population-based colonoscopy screening may include complications induced by colonoscopy itself and by sedation, psychosocial distress, potential over-diagnosis, and socioeconomic burden. In addition, harmful effects of colonoscopy may increase with age and comorbidities. As the risk of adverse events in population-based colonoscopy screening may offset the benefit, the adverse events should be managed and monitored. To adopt population-based colonoscopy screening, consensus on the risks and benefits should be developed, focusing on potential harm, patient preference, socioeconomic considerations, and quality improvement of colonoscopy, as well as efficacy for CRC prevention. As suboptimal colonoscopy quality is a major pitfall of population-based screening, adequate training and regulation of screening colonoscopists should be the first step in minimizing variations in quality.

The aim of the current study was to translate the English version of the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Sleep (SCOPA-S) into the Korean version of SCOPA-S (K-SCOPA-S), and to evaluate its reliability and validity for use by Korean-speaking patients with PD. Methods: In total, 136 patients with PD from 27 movement disorder centres of university-affiliated hospitals in Korea were enrolled in this study. They were assessed using SCOPA, Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2), Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADS), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39), Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (NOHQ), and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire (RBDQ). The test-retest reliability was assessed over a time interval of 10-14 days. Results: The internal consistency (Cronbach's a-coefficients) of K-SCOPA-S was 0.88 for nighttime sleep (NS) and 0.75 for daytime sleepiness (DS). Test-retest reliability was 0.88 and 0.85 for the NS and DS, respectively. There was a moderate correlation between the NS sub-score and PDSS-2 total score. The NS and DS sub-scores of K-SCOPA-S were correlated with motor scale such as HYS, and non-motor scales such as UPDRS I, UPDRS II, MADS, NMSS, PDQ39, and NOHQ while the DS sub-score was with RBDQ. Conclusion: The K-SCOPA-S exhibited good reliability and validity for the assessment of sleep problems in the Korean patients with PD. ? 2018 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Parkinson's Disease; Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Sleep; SCOPA-Sleep; Validation,aged; complication; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; middle aged; Parkinson disease; pathology; questionnaire; reproducibility; severity of illness index; sleep disorder; South Korea; translating (language); validation study; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Reproducibility of Results; Republic of Korea; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep Wake Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translating,2-s2.0-85040739743

However, there is concern about worse outcomes of surgery performed by inexperienced residents. We investigated surgical outcomes and patient safety in laparoscopic appendectomy performed by residents. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive patients operated on for acute appendicitis in a single tertiary hospital. A total of 971 patients who had laparoscopic appendectomy on an emergency basis between December 2010 and 2014 were analyzed. An attending, fellow, or resident with or without supervision performed the surgery. Surgical outcomes were compared among the four groups according to operator type. Results: Laparoscopic appendectomy was successfully performed in 965 patients (99.4%) and was converted to open surgery in 6 patients. The conversion rate and incidence of complications were not different among the four groups. Operating time and length of hospital stay were significantly shorter in the attending group than in the fellow or resident groups, but did not differ between the fellow and resident groups. Unsupervised residents or fellows more often placed abdominal drainage than attending surgeons. Patients with drainage had a significantly longer hospital stay compared to patients without drainage (3.64 days versus 6.33 days, P ? .0001), as well as a longer mean time to gas passage (1.17 days versus 1.61 days, P ? .0001). Conclusions: Resident-performed laparoscopic appendectomy was safe, but was associated with significant prolongations in hospital stay and operation time. These differences were not clinically relevant with regard to complications. ?

The polysaccharides extracted from Phellinus linteus (PLGL) have been widely used in treating cancers. However, the mechanism by which PLGL antagonizes cancerous growth has not been fully investigated. The current study demonstrated that human colon cancer HCT116 and HT29 cells became highly susceptible to cell death when being co-treated with PLGL and low dose of camptothecin11 (CPT11, a topoisomerase inhibitor-based drug), the efficacy of which was comparable as that generated by the high dose of CPT11. However, the co-treatment, unlike high doses of CPT11, was not cytotoxic to the control immortalized colon Caco-2 cells. The co-treatment caused high percentages of the colon cancer cells to accumulate in S phase of the cell cycle, which was also seen in the same cells received the high dose of CPT11 treatment. Chk1 was phosphorylated, and then rapidly degraded in the cancer cells treated with the high dose of CPT11 or co-treatment, but not in the cells treated with PLGL alone or low doses of CPT11. PLGL appeared enhancing CPT11 inhibitory effect on topoisomerase, and Chk1 degradatopm in the cancer cells. Furthermore, cyclin E (clnE) became unstable at the transcription level in co-treated or PLGL-treated colon cancer cells. The data suggested that PLGL functions in two ways to achieve its lethal synergy with CPT11 in colon cancer cells. Our findings are of potential significance as PLGL represents a promising medicine for overcoming the side effects of CPT11 and perhaps also for improving other CPTs-based regimens. ?

However, the benefit of colonoscopy screening may be blunted by low participation rates in population-based screening programs. Harmful effects of population-based colonoscopy screening may include complications induced by colonoscopy itself and by sedation, psychosocial distress, potential over-diagnosis, and socioeconomic burden. In addition, harmful effects of colonoscopy may increase with age and comorbidities. As the risk of adverse events in population-based colonoscopy screening may offset the benefit, the adverse events should be managed and monitored. To adopt population-based colonoscopy screening, consensus on the risks and benefits should be developed, focusing on potential harm, patient preference, socioeconomic considerations, and quality improvement of colonoscopy, as well as efficacy for CRC prevention. As suboptimal colonoscopy quality is a major pitfall of population-based screening, adequate training and regulation of screening colonoscopists should be the first step in minimizing variations in quality. Gastroenterologists should promote quality improvement, auditing, and training for colonoscopy in a population-based screening program. ? 2018.

A previous pharmacogenomic study revealed the importance of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity in a response on paclitaxel. However, a subsequent research showed that the expression level of CDK1 failed to show significant correlation with delayed apoptosis and patient survival. Rather, the expression and phosphorylation of capase-9, the downstream target molecule of CDK1, appeared to determine drug resistance. Our results suggest that treatment with the CDK1 inhibitor alsterpaullone reduces phosphorylation of caspase-9. Its phosphorylation level was dependent on CDK1 activity and it directs paclitaxel resistance. This observation was reproducible in xenografted tumors. Thus, the regulation of caspase-9 may be a novel therapeutic strategy to reverse paclitaxelinduced resistance in ovarian cancer cells. ?

However, it is unclear whether surgical treatment improves long-term outcomes. We investigated the effects of mitral valve (MV) surgery in patients with DCM and FMR. Methods and Results: Of 525 patients with DCM hospitalized due to heart failure between January 1996 and September 2014, 70 who had severe FMR despite receiving optimal medical therapy were enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 16 underwent surgery for FMR (surgery group; repair=14, replacement=2); the remaining 54 who refused or decided not to undergo surgery were classified as the medication group. There were no differences in age, sex, medication, or echocardiographic parameters between the 2 groups (P>0.05). During the mean follow-up period of 53.6±43.6 months, the occurrence of clinical outcomes (i.e., all-cause death or left ventricular assist device implantation) was 54.3%; the occurrence of clinical outcomes was lower in the surgery group (P=0.008, log-rank test). Multivariate Cox regression analysis using clinical data revealed that MV surgery (hazard ratio [HR] 0.257, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.103–0.640; P=0.004) and diabetes mellitus (HR 2.924, 95% CI 1.243–6.876; P=0.014) were independent predictors of clinical outcomes after adjusting for age and sex.

The present study aimed to identify differences in clinical nutrition service provisions between JCI accredited acute care hospitals and non-accredited acute care hospitals. A survey questionnaire was sent to all 43 acute care hospitals in South Korea. Methods: A total of 35 sets of clinical nutrition service surveys, 234 sets of clinical dietitian job satisfaction surveys, and five-day daily work logs from 129 clinical dietitians were received. We used Fisher's exact test and independent t-test to analyze differences between acute care hospitals based on JCI accreditation. Study Design: Nationwide cross-sectional survey. Results: JCI accredited acute care hospitals (N=8) showed a higher, but not significantly higher, nutritional intervention rate of 12.7% among malnourished patients, compared with 7.0% in non-JCI accredited acute care hospitals (N=27). Analysis of work hours of clinical dietitians indicated time spent on direct care was higher (p < 0.05), while time spent on outpatient care was lower (p < 0.05) among JCI accredited acute care hospitals relative to non-JCI accredited acute care hospitals.

Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence and distribution of subcortical cysts near the attachments of the meniscus or cruciate ligaments and evaluate pathologies of the meniscus or cruciate ligaments using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material and Methods: We reviewed 1009 knee MRIs for the presence of subcortical cysts near the meniscus or cruciate ligament attachments and evaluated their size, location, edema of the adjacent bone marrow, and integrities of the medial and lateral meniscus and anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments. Results: The 110 cysts were found in either the middle (n = 56), posterior (n = 52), or anterior (n = 2) subspinous regions. Sixty-two were at meniscal root insertion, including seven at the lateral meniscus anterior horn, five at the lateral meniscus posterior horn, 48 at the medial meniscus posterior horn, and two at the medial meniscus anterior horn. All were associated with an adjacent meniscal pathology. Of the 34 cysts at the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insertion, 28 had ACL pathology. Nine cysts had surrounding edema in the adjacent bone marrow. Conclusion: Subcortical cysts at the subspinous region of the knee were seen in 9.6% of knee MRI examinations. Most were in close proximity to the meniscal or cruciate ligaments with associated pathologies, suggesting that abnormal stress on the bone induces cyst formation. ? 2017, ?

Cysteine is a well-known amino acid which exhibits anti-inflammatory activities. However, the effect and mechanism of cysteine on TSLP production have not been investigated. Thus, we hypothesized that cysteine may regulate TSLP production from mast cells. To test this hypothesis, the anti-inflammatory effects and signaling pathways of cysteine were investigated in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 4 and calcium ionophore A23187 (PMACI)–stimulated human mast cell line HMC-1. Cysteine dramatically attenuated the levels of TSLP of both mRNA and protein without cytotoxicity. Moreover, cysteine suppressed caspase-1 activation and nuclear factor–κB translocation. The phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase was downregulated in all cases in PMACI-stimulated HMC-1 cells treated with cysteine. In addition, cysteine decreased PMACI-induced proinflammatory cytokines in terms of both protein and mRNA levels. In conclusion, cysteine regulates TSLP production by blocking caspase-1, nuclear factor–κB, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase–dependent pathways in activated HMC-1 cells, suggesting its potential as a regulator of allergic inflammatory diseases. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Caspase-1; Cysteine; Human mast cell; Nuclear factor–κB; Thymic stromal lymphopoietin,"cysteine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; stress activated protein kinase; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor; calcium ionophore; cysteine; cytokine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; messenger RNA; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; stress activated protein kinase; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; allergic reaction; Article; cell nucleus; cellular distribution; controlled study; cytokine production; HMC-1 cell line; human; human cell; mast cell; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; biosynthesis; cell line; chemically induced; hypersensitivity; inflammation; mast cell; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; signal transduction; Calcium Ionophores; Caspase 1; Cell Line; Cysteine; Cytokines; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Inflammation; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Mast Cells; NF-kappa B; Phosphorylation; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate",2-s2.0-85038385049

An online survey on the status and perception of Korea's medical physicists on risk management in radiation therapy was carried out. A total of 40 domestic radiation oncology departments participated. This survey is divided into three categories: (1) work environment; (2) risk management status; and (3) opinions on how to improve risk management. Based on the results of the survey, the conclusions that can be derived are (1) the majority of respondents have a high interest in the risk management of radiation therapy; (2) the lack of staffing is one cause of risk management difficulties; (3) a risk-related terminology and classification system at the national or professional association level are required; (4) each hospital should create a voluntary reporting system for the handling of incidents; (5) medical physicists should establish incident reporting, analysis and countermeasures; and (6) government should develop education and training programs. It was confirmed that the current risk management system should be changed by education in the hospital and at the national level in order to improve risk management related to radiation therapy. In addition, it was recognized that a dedicated staff and a risk management certification system and organization for patient safety in radiotherapy are needed. ? 2017 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","medical radiation; physics, medical; radiation, medical; risk analysis","health care quality; health personnel attitude; health physics; hospital; human; manpower; patient safety; procedures; questionnaire; radiotherapy; risk management; safety; South Korea; standards; Attitude of Health Personnel; Health Physics; Hospitals; Humans; Patient Safety; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Radiotherapy; Republic of Korea; Risk Management; Safety Management; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85038106665

Materials and Methods: A total of 1000 ACS patients with 1251 lesions who underwent implantation of BESs at 22 centers in Korea were enrolled between May 2011 and July 2013. We assessed major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as the composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and clinical-driven target vessel revascularization at 12 months. Results: Patient mean age was 62.6±11.4 years. 72.8% of the patients were male, 28.5% had diabetes, 32.8% had multi-vessel disease (MVD), and 47.9% presented with acute MI (AMI). The mean global registry of acute coronary events risk score of all patients was 103.0±27.6. The number of stents per patient was 1.3±0.6. The incidences of MACE and definite stent thrombosis at 12 months were 3.9% and 0.2%, respectively. On multivariate Cox-regression analysis, age ?65 years was identified as an independent predictors of 1-year MACE (hazard ratio=2.474; 95% confidence interval=1.202?5.091). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant differences in the incidence of MACE between patients with and without diabetes (4.3% vs. 3.7%, p=0.667), between those who presented with and without AMI (4.4% vs. 3.4%, p=0.403), and between those with and without MVD (4.6% vs. 3.5%, p=0.387).

In this study, we developed an ApoE genotyping and one-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based-capillary electrophoresis (CE) method for the enhanced diagnosis of Alzheimer's. The primer mixture of ApoE genes enabled the performance of direct one-step multiplex PCR from whole blood without DNA purification. The combination of direct ApoE genotyping and one-step multiplex PCR minimized the risk of DNA loss or contamination due to the process of DNA purification. All amplified PCR products with different DNA lengths (112-, 253-, 308-, 444-, and 514-bp DNA) of the ApoE genes were analyzed within 2 min by an extended voltage programming (VP)-based CE under the optimal conditions. The extended VP-based CE method was at least 120–180 times faster than conventional slab gel electrophoresis methods In particular, all amplified DNA fragments were detected in less than 10 PCR cycles using a laser-induced fluorescence detector. The detection limits of the ApoE genes were 6.4–62.0 pM, which were approximately 100–100,000 times more sensitive than previous Alzheimer's diagnosis methods In addition, the combined one-step multiplex PCR and extended VP-based CE method was also successfully applied to the analysis of ApoE genotypes in Alzheimer's patients and normal samples and confirmed the distribution probability of allele frequencies. This combination of direct one-step multiplex PCR and an extended VP-based CE method should increase the diagnostic reliability of Alzheimer's with high sensitivity and short analysis time even with direct use of whole blood. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Alzheimer's; Apolipoprotein E (ApoE); Capillary electrophoresis; Diagnosis; Direct one-step multiplex PCR,"Blood; Blood vessels; Capillary electrophoresis; Diagnosis; Diseases; DNA; Electrophoresis; Fluorescence; Genes; Lipoproteins; Neurodegenerative diseases; Probability distributions; Purification; Reliability analysis; Alzheimer's; Apolipoprotein E (apoE); Coronary artery disease; Distribution probability; Laser induced fluorescence; Multiplex pcr; Slab gel electrophoresis; Voltage programming; Polymerase chain reaction; apolipoprotein E; DNA fragment; ApoE protein, human; apolipoprotein E; Alzheimer disease; Article; capillary electrophoresis; comparative study; DNA extraction; electrophoretic mobility; gel electrophoresis; gene frequency; genotype; human; molecular size; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; normal human; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Alzheimer disease; blood; capillary electrophoresis; genetics; genotype; genotyping technique; limit of detection; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; procedures; reproducibility; statistical model; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoproteins E; Electrophoresis, Capillary; Genotype; Genotyping Techniques; Humans; Limit of Detection; Linear Models; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reproducibility of Results",2-s2.0-85036471172

Methods: We retrospectively examined demographic, clinicopathologic, and laboratory parameters in a cohort of 233 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB and IIA cervical cancer who underwent surgical resection. We further assessed the effects of the WBC count and DC-derived hematologic parameters on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after controlling for other parameters. Results: Patients were followed up for a median of 46.6 months (range, 9-142 months). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS and OS at 5 years were 88.5% and 92.3%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, we identified the absolute monocyte count (AMC) (hazard ratio [HR], 11.78; P < 0 . 001) and tumor size (HR, 5.41; P = 0.003) as the strongest prognostic factors affecting PFS. We also identified AMC (HR, 23.29; P < 0 . 001), tumor size, (HR, 5.27; P = 0.033), and lymph node involvement (HR, 3.90; P = 0.027) as the strongest prognostic factors affecting OS. AMC remained prognostic with respect to PFS or OS in a Cox model that controlled for the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio or lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, although neither ratio was a significant prognostic factor for survival. Conclusions: Monocytosis and an increased tumor size were found to be independent prognostic factors affecting both PFS and OS in patients with stage IB and IIA cervical cancer. ?

Methods To develop SSQD, we extracted major symptoms of Stomach Qi Deficiency (SQD) syndrome and requested an expert group to take part in a Delphi survey. The questionnaire was modified by the opinion of the expert group. For the analysis of reliability and validity and investigation of cut-off value, 30 participants who had dyspepsia and diagnosed as SQD and 30 healthy control participants were evaluated. Results Of the 13 questions in the SSQD, 1 question had negative effects on reliability and validity, therefore, it was excluded on further inspection. Overall Cronbach's α coefficient of SSQD was 0.87. Construct validity was analyzed by factor analysis resulting 3 major factors. Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal cut-off value of SSQD was defined as 14, and its sensitivity and specificity were 93.33% and 86.67%, respectively. There were statistically significant positive correlation between SSQD and other dyspepsia severity scales. Conclusions The newly developed SSQD can provide fundamental reliability and validity as a specific pattern diagnosis questionnaire and can help diagnosing SQD. However, further studies will be needed to further confirm its specificity. ? 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Delphi; Dyspepsia; Pattern identification; Questionnaire; Stomach Qi Deficiency; Survey; Validation study,adult; Article; Chinese medicine; clinical article; construct validity; controlled study; Cronbach alpha coefficient; Delphi study; diagnostic test accuracy study; digestive system disease assessment; disease severity assessment; dyspepsia; female; human; male; pattern identification scale for stomach qi deficiency; priority journal; quality of life assessment; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; validation process,2-s2.0-85034818866

Study population was stratified by three groups according to BP and presence of hypertension (normal, <130/80 mmHg; prehypertension, ?130/80 mmHg without hypertension; hypertension, ?140/90 mmHg or history of hypertension). The odds ratios (ORs) of impaired LV diastolic function and LV remodeling were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The adjusted mean values of echocardiographic parameters related to LV diastolic function and remodeling were also evaluated. Result When normal group was set as reference, the adjusted ORs [95% confidential interval (CI)] for impaired LV diastolic function was 2.45 (95% CI 1.84–3.24) in prehypertension, 3.51 (95% CI 2.57–4.80) in hypertension group. Adjusted ORs for LV remodeling only showed significant result in hypertension group [1.82 (95% CI 1.23–2.69)]. The adjusted mean value of LV diastolic function and structure also demonstrated LV deterioration in prehypertension and hypertension groups. Conclusion Our study showed the adverse influence of prehypertension and hypertension on subclinical LV deterioration. This finding suggested the potential clinical benefits of intensive BP control (<130/80 mmHg) in patients with DM. ? 2017 Japanese College of Cardiology",Diabetes mellitus; Hypertension; Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; Left ventricular remodeling; Prehypertension,"adult; Article; blood pressure regulation; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; female; human; hypertension; laboratory test; left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; major clinical study; male; physical examination; prehypertension; risk assessment; transthoracic echocardiography; Asian continental ancestry group; blood pressure; diastole; echocardiography; heart left ventricle function; heart ventricle remodeling; hypertension; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Pressure; Diabetes Mellitus; Diastole; Echocardiography; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Remodeling",2-s2.0-85028355439

Methods Data of suicide attempters aged over 15 years, who visited the ED from January 2013 to June 2016, were retrospectively collected and they were divided into the hospitalization and discharge groups. We evaluated the Risk-Rescue Rating Scale (RRRS) and Self-Inflicted Injury Severity Form (SIISF) for lethality and Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) for intent, respectively. The predictive abilities of these scales for hospitalization were compared in terms of performance (AUCs) and goodness-of-fit (the Bayesian information criterion [BIC]). Results A total of 382 suicide attempters were enrolled, of which 233 (61%) were hospitalized. The scores of all psychological scales were significantly higher in the hospitalization group and all scales were identified as independent predictors of hospitalization. The AUC of the RRRS tended to be higher than those of the SIS and SIISF; similarly, the RRRS demonstrated the best overall fit (the lowest BIC). The AUC of combined the RRRS and SIS was superior to that of any of the individual scales alone. While the AUC of combined the SIISF and SIS was superior to that of either individual scale, it was comparable to that of the RRRS. Conclusions The psychological scales can be helpful for predicting suicide attempter's hospitalization in emergency settings. Especially, the RRRS seemed to have a superior predictive ability. Moreover, combining the scales had significantly better predictive performance than use of the individual scale alone did. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Attempted suicide; Emergency departments; Hospitalizations; Intent; Lethality; Scales,"adult; Article; emergency health service; emergency ward; female; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; injury severity; lethality; major clinical study; male; mental disease assessment; mental health; middle aged; priority journal; psychiatric diagnosis; Risk Rescue Rating Scale; Self Inflicted Injury Severity Form; suicide attempt; Suicide Intent Scale; Bayes theorem; comparative study; hospital emergency service; hospitalization; injury scale; psychological rating scale; psychology; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; South Korea; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; suicide attempt; young adult; Adult; Bayes Theorem; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Suicide, Attempted; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85025069237

Background: Sex differences in KRAS mutations and predictors for KRAS codon 13 mutations in colorectal cancer (CRC) are unclear. Study: Between October 2007 and May 2016, 328 patients underwent surgery for CRCs that were analyzed for KRAS mutations at a referral university hospital. Sex differences in the rates and distributions of KRAS mutations, and factors predictive of overall KRAS and KRAS codon 13 mutations were analyzed. Results: KRAS mutations were significantly more common in women than men patients (46.0% vs. 34.4%, P<0.033). However, no sex differences were detected for KRAS mutations by codon subtypes (P=0.592). The Gly13Asp (GGC>GAC) point mutation was identified only within codon 13 in both sexes. For right-sided CRC, KRAS mutations were twice as frequent in men as in women (univariate analysis; P=0.016, multivariate analysis; P=0.019). High-plasma cholesterol level was an independent predictive factor of KRAS codon 13 mutations by univariate (odds ratio, 1.013; 95% confidence interval, 1.003-1.023) and multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.011; 95% confidence interval, 1.001-1.021). Conclusions: Sex differences may affect the presentation of KRAS mutations, as they were more frequently detected in women and in right-sided CRC in men. KRAS codon 13 mutations were significantly associated with high-plasma cholesterol. Further studies are needed on the clinical implications of this finding. ?

In this study, we investigated the effects of limonene on MG-induced damage in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Pretreating cells with limonene prevented MG-induced protein adduct formation, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 release, mitochondrial superoxide production, and cardiolipin peroxidation. In addition, limonene increased glyoxalase I activity, and glutathione and heme oxygenase-1 levels in the presence of MG. Pretreatment with limonene prior to MG exposure reduced MG-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by preventing mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation and adenosine triphosphate loss, and reduced the levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator 1α, and nitric oxide.

Respiratory syncytial virus-induced severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome in immunocompetent adults has been rarely described. Unfortunately, optimal treatment has not been established for this potentially fatal condition. We report a case of respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome occurring in a previously healthy man successfully treated with orally administered ribavirin. Case presentation: An 81-year-old previously healthy Korean man presented with cough, dyspnea, and febrile sensation. He had hypoxemia with diffuse ground glass opacity evident on chest radiography, which progressed and required mechanical ventilation. All microbiological tests were negative except multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using respiratory specimen, which was positive for human adenovirus. Under the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, orally administered ribavirin was administered and he recuperated completely without complications. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the potential usefulness of orally administered ribavirin as a therapeutic option for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, at least in an immunocompetent host. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Case report; Respiratory syncytial virus; Ribavirin,"carbapenem; methylprednisolone; oxygen; prednisolone; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; ribavirin; antivirus agent; ribavirin; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; case report; clinical article; community acquired pneumonia; computer assisted tomography; coughing; crackle; drug effect; dyspnea; fever; human; Human adenovirus C; Human respiratory syncytial virus; Human respiratory syncytial virus B; hypoxemia; immunocompetence; male; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; pleura effusion; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory syncytial virus infection; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thoracocentesis; thorax radiography; very elderly; adult respiratory distress syndrome; complication; genetics; immunocompetence; oral drug administration; Pneumovirus; respiratory syncytial virus infection; treatment outcome; virology; Administration, Oral; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Humans; Immunocompetence; Male; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Viruses; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribavirin; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85041261686

The U. S. Public Health Service ran this study on more than 300 people without notifying the participants about their disease nor treating them even after the introduction of penicillin. The study included recording the progress of disease and performing an autopsy on the deaths. This paper explores historical backgrounds enabled this infamous study, and discusses three driving forces behind the Tuskegee Study. First, it is important to understand that the Public Health Service was established in the U. S. Surgeon General's office and was operated as a military organization. Amidst the development of an imperial agenda of the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the PHS was responsible for protecting hygiene and the superiority of ""the American race"" against infectious foreign elements from the borders. The U.S. Army's experience of medical experiments in colonies and abroad was imported back to the country and formed a crucial part of the attitude and philosophy on public health. Secondly, the growing influence of eugenics and racial pathology at the time reinforced discriminative views on minorities. Progressivism was realized in the form of domestic reform and imperial pursuit at the same time. Major medical journals argued that blacks were inclined to have certain defects, especially sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, because of their prodigal behavior and lack of hygiene. This kind of racial ideas were shared by the PHS officials who were in charge of the Tuskegee Study. Lastly, the PHS officials believed in continuing the experiment regardless of various social changes. They considered that black participants were not only poor but also ignorant of and even unwilling to undergo the treatment. When the exposure of the experiment led to the Senate investigation in 1973, the participating doctors of the PHS maintained that their study offered valuable contribution to the medical research. This paper argues that the combination of the efficiency of military medicine, progressive and imperial racial ideology, and discrimination on African-Americans resulted in the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. ?

Numerous bone needles, stone needles, and other medical devices were found in the Xiaoyingzi excavation. The stone needles from Xiaoyingzi can be categorized into three grades, based on length, of 8cm, 12-15cm, and 18cm. A set of round stones for massage were also discovered, along with obsidian blades. These relics were carefully stored in the middle of the body in the stone coffin. In addition to Xiaoyingzi, stone needles were also excavated along the lower valley region of the Tuman (Tumen) River. These facts indicate that the owner was involved in medical practice, and that medical procedures using stone needles were quite popular at the time. This article carefully investigates that the relics have nothing to do with weaving textile or military use. Current research on the origin of acupuncture has been confined either to stone needles from the prehistoric age or to bronze needles, as well as to literature from the Warring States period to the Han China, during which acupuncture technology was considerably expanded. However, substantial knowledge on the ""gap"" between stone needles and metal needles has been procured through the analysis of Xiaoyingzi, Yanji. The findings of Xiaoyingzi are also significant in providing a more detailed reconstruction of the development of acupuncture in East Asia and emergence of acupuncture throughout history. A large amount of medical items (stone and bone needles, cases for needles, massage stone type bianshi, and etc.), have been excavated from Xiaoyingzi and other neighbouring sites, Along with geographic and ecological factors, this archeological data strongly suggests the medical tradition of using acupuncture needles was practiced around Tumen River basin in the Bronze Age (10th century B.C.). ?

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of tracking moving target test with center of gravity (COG) as a predictive factor of falls. Methods: This study was conducted at an elderly welfare center in Seoul and the participants were aged 65 years or older. Success rate in tracking moving target was measured by using a newly developed Fall Risk Assessment (FRA) device (InBody Co?) and fall rates for 6 months were evaluated by telephone survey. Results: In the univariate analysis, the proportion of subjects experiencing falls was significantly lower with increasing success rate in tracking moving target in the left-right and diagonal B directions (p=0.0017, p=0.0203, respectively). In the left-right direction, relative to quartile 1 of success rate in tracking moving target, adjusted ORs of falling for the six-months for quartiles 2, 3, and 4 decreased to 0.36, 0.28, and 0.11, respectively (p=0.015). Conclusions: Success rate in tracking moving target in the diagonal B directions was not a significant predictor of falling after controlling the confounding variables of age, sex, current smoking status, alcohol drinking, physical activity, BMI, and histories of falling and chronic diseases, and sleeping disorders. Therefore, success rate in tracking moving target in the left-right direction well predicted a lower six-month fall rate.

It appears primarily above the age of 40 years and is rare at younger ages. Spontaneous corneal perforation in TMD is a rare, but serious complication that may occur in childhood. Patient concerns: This review presents the case of a 16-year-old girl presented with blurred vision in the right eye on awakening in the morning. Slit-lamp examination revealed superior corneal thinning with a corneal perforation. Diagnoses: The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were 5 and 18mm Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively, measured using a noncontact tonometer. Slit-lamp examination revealed superior corneal thinning with superficial pannus. A 1-mm corneal perforation was observed at the 11 o'clock position. The anterior chamber of the right eye was flat and the Seidel test result was positive. The left eye showed no apparent abnormality on slit-lamp examination. Corneal topography showed 4.3 D of against-the-rule astigmatism, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography revealed superior corneal thinning. We diagnosed it as childhood onset TMD. Interventions: Multilayered amniotic membrane transplantation was performed over the perforation site and a bandage contact lens was placed. Outcomes: At 1 week postoperatively, the BCVA of the right eye improved to 20/32, the amniotic membrane graft was well-attached, and the anterior chamber remained deep. At 2 months postoperatively, the BCVA was 20/25 and the anterior chamber depth was maintained. Lessons: Spontaneous corneal perforation due to TMD is rare, but may occur in childhood. The possibility of corneal perforation should be considered even in childhood and good surgical results can be obtained with amniotic membrane transplantation. ? 2017 Copyright the Author(s).",amniotic membrane transplantation; childhood; spontaneous corneal perforation; Terrien's marginal degeneration,adolescent; amnion; Article; astigmatism; blurred vision; case report; clinical article; cornea dystrophy; cornea perforation; cornea thickness; corrected distance visual acuity; disease association; female; human; keratometry; priority journal; slit lamp microscopy; spontaneous perforation; Terrien marginal corneal degeneration; tissue transplantation; complication; cornea disease; cornea perforation; pathology; visual acuity; Adolescent; Corneal Diseases; Corneal Perforation; Female; Humans; Visual Acuity,2-s2.0-85039729251

However, atypical biliary pain presents a clinical challenge and there is no literature evaluating the factors of the gallbladder (GB) wall related to abnormal ejection fraction of cholescintigraphy in such patients. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate characteristics of the GB wall in patients with abnormal gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) on cholescintigraphy and atypical biliary pain. Patients who underwent cholescintigraphy for atypical biliary pain and subsequent cholecystectomy were initially recruited for this study. Medical records and pathologic findings of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Parameters that were significant on univariate analysis, including factors of GB wall and cholescintigraphy, were subsequently tested by multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors for abnormal GBEF. Abnormal or low GBEF was defined as GBEF <35%. A total of 41 adult patients were divided into a low GBEF (n=15) and a high GBEF group (n=26) based on the cutoff value of 35%. In univariate analysis mean muscle thickness, muscle to total layer ratio, and muscle to fibrosis layer ratio were significantly higher in the low GBEF group than in the high GBEF group. In multivariate analysis, the muscle to fibrosis layer ratio was found to be an independent risk factor for abnormal GBEF (odds ratio=3.514, 95% confidence interval=1.058-11.673, P=.04). The fibrosis to total layer ratio was negatively correlated with GBEF in the low GBEF group (r=-0.657, P<.01). Muscle to fibrosis layer ratio was significantly associated with decreased GBEF. The fibrosis thickness ratio also seems to play an important role in patients with decreased GBEF. ? 2017 the Author(s).",biliary pain; cholescintigraphy; ejection fraction; gallbladder,"mebrofenin tc 99m; adult; biliary tract pain; cholecystectomy; chronic cholecystitis; comparative study; female; fibrosis; gallbladder; gallbladder ejection fraction; gallbladder muscle; gallbladder scintiscanning; hepatobiliary parameters; histopathology; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; muscle thickness; priority journal; Review; abdominal pain; cohort analysis; diagnostic imaging; gallbladder disease; gallbladder emptying; immunohistochemistry; multivariate analysis; needle biopsy; pathology; physiology; predictive value; procedures; retrospective study; scintiscanning; severity of illness index; South Korea; statistical model; Abdominal Pain; Adult; Biopsy, Needle; Cohort Studies; Female; Gallbladder Diseases; Gallbladder Emptying; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Radionuclide Imaging; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index",2-s2.0-85039703648

Hypothesis: We sought to evaluate the target achievement rate and associated variables in Korean patients with FH after maximal statin-based LLT. Methods: We enrolled 146 patients with heterozygous FH, and 90 patients were finally analyzed. Patients were initially prescribed rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg, and the regimen was adjusted to achieve the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target of 100 mg/dL. The primary evaluation point was the achievement rate of the LDL-C targets at 12 months: LDL-C < 100 mg/dL and ?50% LDL-C reduction. The associations between clinical variables and target achievement were also analyzed. Results: At 12 months, 58% of patients were receiving high-intensity regimens, whereas 46% were receiving combination therapy. The mean pre- and post-treatment LDL-C levels were 229 and 118 mg/dL, respectively. Twenty-eight percent of patients achieved LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and 47% achieved ?50% LDL-C reduction. Pretreatment LDL-C and high-intensity regimens indicated a negative tendency toward the attainment of LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Conversely, pretreatment LDL-C and diabetes mellitus were positively associated with a higher rate of ?50% LDL-C reduction. Conclusions: The target achievement of LDL-C < 100 mg/dL was low, and 50% LDL-C reduction was moderately achieved in Korean patients with FH receiving maximal statin-based LLT. Pretreatment LDL-C levels and diabetes mellitus were associated with target achievement. Our results provide rare and informative data on FH treatment in Asian patients. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Ezetimibe; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Therapeutics,"atorvastatin; ezetimibe; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nicotinic acid; pitavastatin; pravastatin; resin; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; atorvastatin; biological marker; cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hypocholesterolemic agent; rosuvastatin; adult; Article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; heterozygote; human; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; prescription; atherosclerosis; blood; clinical trial; complication; dose response; familial hypercholesterolemia; follow up; incidence; medical society; middle aged; multicenter study; oral drug administration; South Korea; treatment outcome; Administration, Oral; Anticholesteremic Agents; Atherosclerosis; Atorvastatin Calcium; Biomarkers; Cholesterol; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Rosuvastatin Calcium; Societies, Medical; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85037993099

A total of 797 patients (306 [38%] women) were analyzed, with a mean age of 64?±?10?years. Female sex, hypertension; higher left ventricular ejection fraction, effective arterial elastance, and pulse wave velocity; and lower total arterial compliance were significantly related to HTR. Patients with HTR had higher relative wall thickness, ratio of early diastolic mitral inflow and annular velocity, and diastolic elastance (all P??.05). In multivariable analysis, indices of arterial stiffness such as pulse wave velocity, arterial elastance, total arterial compliance, and systemic vascular resistance were more strongly related in women, while in men, index of sympathetic activation was additionally related to HTR (all P??.05). Female sex and lower total arterial compliance in older patients (?65?years) and higher systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular relative wall thickness in younger patients were more strongly related to HTR.

After a human cancer cell, HeLa cell line, was seeded on AAO membranes with various pore sizes ranging from 18 to 150 nm, the adhered cell population and 3-(4,5-dimethyltiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were measured. The cell adhesion and viability on the membrane with small pores (18 nm) were similar to those on the nonporous reference; however, they gradually decreased as the pore size increased. The decreased viability involves cell death as well as poor cell adhesion. We found that cyclo(l-arginylglycyl-l-α-aspartyl-d-phenylalanyl-l-cysteinyl), a well-known integrin receptor antagonist, drastically decreased the cell adhesion to the membranes. The data indicate that the cell adhesion to the nanoporous membranes may be mediated by integrin on the cell surface, plausibly explaining the pore size dependence of the cell adhesion and viability.

Reporter gene activation by each compound was examined using a human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell-based transactivation assay. Proliferative activity was also examined using MCF-7 cells. Reporter gene activation in MCF-7 cells by cirsimaritin was significantly suppressed by co-administration of the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780, indicating that cirsimaritin is an ER agonist. Under experimental conditions simulating postmenopausal syndrome (i.e., a low concentration of estrogen), cirsimaritin exerted beneficial effects on MCF-7 cells by increasing estrogenic activity.

Thereafter, the interactions of prime Aβ-binding LD residues—Tyr101, Thr108, and Thr110—were translated into specific pharmacophore features and this hypothesis subsequently used as a virtual screen query. ELISA-based screening of 20 hits identified two promising lead candidates, VC15 and VC19 with an IC50 of 4.4?±?0.3 and 9.6?±?0.1?μm, respectively. They productively reversed Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions such as mitochondrial membrane potential loss (JC-1 assay), toxicity (MTT assay), and ATP reduction (ATP assay) in addition to increased cell viabilities. This is the first reporting of LD hot spot-centric in silico scheme to discover novel compounds with promising ABAD-Aβ inhibitory potential. These chemotypes are proposed for further structural optimization to derive novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S",ABAD-Aβ inhibitors; ABAD-Aβ modeling; in silico design; LD hot spots; pharmacophore,"alcohol dehydrogenase; amyloid beta peptide binding alcohol dehydrogenase; amyloid beta protein; unclassified drug; 3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; adenosine triphosphate; amyloid beta protein; fused heterocyclic rings; HSD17B10 protein, human; ligand; protein binding; VC15 compound; VC19 compound; animal cell; assay; ATP assay; cell viability; computer model; disorders of mitochondrial functions; Editorial; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme structure; HT22 cell line; IC50; in vitro study; JC-1 assay; mitochondrial membrane potential; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; priority journal; Alzheimer disease; animal; binding site; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effects; genetics; half life time; human; metabolism; mitochondrion; molecular docking; nuclear magnetic resonance; protein tertiary structure; site directed mutagenesis; X ray crystallography; 3-Hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenases; Adenosine Triphosphate; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Binding Sites; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Crystallography, X-Ray; Half-Life; Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Ligands; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mice; Mitochondria; Molecular Docking Simulation; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary",2-s2.0-85026323599

A 62-year-old healthy man was admitted to our hospital with left abdominal pain that started one month ago. Neither abdominal tenderness nor rebound tenderness was present on physical examination. His vital signs and all other test results were within normal limits. However, a 2.5 cm curved radiopaque material within his thickened small intestine was incidentally detected on an abdominal computed tomography. He underwent laparoscopic small bowel resection, which revealed foreign body in the distal small intestine. Edema, perforation, and adhesions with the surrounding tissues were also noticed in the distal small intestine. Foreign body was turned out to be PTP, and this was considered to be responsible for the small bowel perforation and fistula formation.

The aim of this study was to analyze the demographic characteristics, medical service use and related costs for these disorders, and the results are expected to help inform practitioners, researchers, and policy-makers. Methods: The present study aimed to evaluate incidence and patient characteristics, and to assess current medical service use, usual care, and medical expenses of knee disorders by analyzing 2014 national patient sample data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Data was extracted using 3% stratified sampling from all Korea national health insurance claims submitted in 2014, and analyzed. Usual care for M17 knee osteoarthritis and S83 knee meniscal and ligament injury codes of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) were determined by investigating total number of patients, sociodemographic characteristics, days in care, number of visits, and expenses. Results: Knee OA showed the highest incidence in females aged ?60 years, whereas meniscal and ligament injuries of the knee were most prevalent among patients aged <20 years and young adults. Total inpatient care expenses exceeded the cost of ambulatory care for both disorders. Ambulatory care was mainly provided at primary care clinics, with 90% of these visits made to orthopedic specialists. Medical expenses for knee OA and meniscal and ligament injuries were largely due to procedures/surgeries and injections, and procedures/surgeries and hospitalizations, respectively. Total replacement arthroplasty was the most commonly performed surgery for knee OA, while meniscectomy and cruciate ligament reconstruction were the most often performed surgeries for meniscal and ligament injuries. Intra-articular injection rates were 55% in knee OA patients and 3% in meniscal and ligament injury patients. Aceclofenac, diclofenac, and tramadol were the most frequently prescribed analgesics. Conclusions: The current findings may be used as basic data for establishing medical policies and can benefit researchers and clinicians in recognizing trends and patterns of treatment for knee disorders. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Knee meniscal and ligament injury; Knee osteoarthritis; Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-National Patient Sample (HIRA-NPS) data; Medical service use; Usual care,"aceclofenac; diclofenac; tramadol; adult; ambulatory care; analgesia; Article; cross-sectional study; female; health care cost; health care policy; health care utilization; health insurance; hospital care; hospitalization; human; ICD-10; incidence; knee cruciate ligament; knee ligament injury; knee meniscus rupture; knee osteoarthritis; Korea; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; medical research; meniscectomy; physiotherapy; prevalence; primary health care; radiodiagnosis; sex difference; susceptible population; total knee arthroplasty; aged; economics; health service; knee injury; knee osteoarthritis; middle aged; South Korea; utilization; young adult; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Services; Humans; Incidence; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Prevalence; Republic of Korea; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85033562934

In central nervous system, astrocytes regulates neuronal function via the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity, secretion of growth factors, uptake of neurotransmitters and regulation of extracellular ion concentrations and metabolic support of neurons. Therefore, C6 astroglial cells have been used to study the in vitro PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP+). In this study, pre-treatment of insulin inhibited MPP+-induced cell membrane damages on LDH and NO releases, which also inhibited the iNOS and Cox-2 levels. Insulin also up-regulated the PI3K and p-GSK-3β protein expressions in C6 cells. In addition, MPP+ and/or insulin enhanced the autophagy by increasing LC3-I to LC3-II conversion. Furthermore, MPP+-induced toxicity diminished the integrin β3, αV, syndecan-1 and -3. Insulin pre-treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of integrin-linked kinase and further induced the integrin and syndecan molecules. These findings suggest that insulin prevents MPP+-induced toxicity through activation of PI3K, p-GSK-3β, autophagy, integrins and syndecans pathways in C6 glial cells. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Autophagy; GSK-3β; integrins; Parkinson’s disease; syndecans,"alpha5 integrin; beta3 integrin; cyclooxygenase 2; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; inducible nitric oxide synthase; insulin; integrin; integrin linked kinase; lactate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; microtubule associated protein 1; microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 I; microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 II; nitric oxide; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; syndecan; syndecan 1; syndecan 3; unclassified drug; 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridinium; beta3 integrin; CD51 antigen; insulin; nitric oxide; syndecan 1; syndecan 3; animal cell; Article; astrocyte; autophagosome; autophagy; cell membrane; cell viability; comparative study; concentration response; controlled study; enzyme induction; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme release; gene expression regulation; in vitro study; membrane damage; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; protein expression; rat; animal; apoptosis; astrocyte; cell line; chemically induced; disease model; drug effect; genetics; human; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; signal transduction; 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; Animals; Apoptosis; Astrocytes; Autophagy; Cell Line; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Insulin; Integrin alphaV; Integrin beta3; Nitric Oxide; Parkinson Disease; Parkinson Disease, Secondary; Phosphorylation; Rats; Signal Transduction; Syndecan-1; Syndecan-3",2-s2.0-85028547193

This study investigated the effects of limonene, a terpene found in citrus fruits, on the function of the murine pre-osteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1 cells. The results showed that limonene treatment significantly elevated collagen synthesis, alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin synthesis, and mineralization in osteoblastic cells. Methylglyoxal (MG), a highly reactive dicarbonyl metabolite, is a major precursor of advanced glycation end products, which are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic osteopathy. We therefore investigated the effects of limonene on MG-induced cytotoxicity. Pre-treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with limonene prevented MG-induced cell death and apoptosis. Limonene also reduced MG-triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by decreases in the levels of the ER-localized transmembrane signal transducers ATF-6 and IRE1. Furthermore, limonene treatment significantly reduced MG-induced autophagic activity and reactive oxygen species release. These results suggest that limonene may prevent the development of diabetic osteopathy. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cytotoxicity; Limonene; methylglyoxal; mitochondrial function; osteoblasts,,2-s2.0-85020729649

Methods Thirty-three female patients (mean age, 16.8 ± 3.8 years) who began orthodontic treatment using fixed appliances were examined. In the pilot study, male patients were less likely to use the PEMF device (epatchQ; Speed Dental, Seoul, Korea) and answer a survey consistently, so eligibility criteria were female patients who were periodontally and systemically healthy at the initiation of treatment and had no history of dental pain in the prior 2 weeks or who used no medications (anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs) during the experiment period. Each patient had brackets bonded on the maxillary teeth, and a 0.014-in nickel-titanium archwire was tied with elastomeric rings. Their maxillary arches were randomly divided into left and right sides in a split-mouth design: a normal PEMF device (experimental group) was used on 1 side, and a PEMF device with an inversely inserted battery (placebo group) was used on the opposite side of the arch for 7 hours on 3 consecutive nights. A Google survey link was sent to the patients’ mobile phones via text message, and they were instructed to record their current pain on the survey. The survey was sent a total of 6 times after insertion of the initial archwire at 0 (T0), 2 (T1), 6 (T2), 24 (T3), 48 (T4), and 72 (T5) hours. Patients recorded the degree of pain in resting and clenching states using a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). PEMF devices were used after T2. Generalized linear mixed models, along with ancillary pairwise analyses, were used to model and evaluate the differences in pain reported over 72 hours. Results The NRS scores did not differ across the groups during the before-PEMF phase for resting (mean difference, ?0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], ?0.73 to 0.59; P = 0.842) and clenching (mean difference, ?0.28; 95% CI, ?1.11 to 0.56, P = 0.513). During the after-PEMF phase, NRS scores in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group during both resting (mean difference, ?1.46; 95% CI, ?2.06 to ?0.85; P = <0.001) and clenching (mean difference, ?1.88; 95% CI, ?2.74 to ?1.02, P = <0.001). The NRS scores did not differ across the groups during the before-PEMF phase for either state but were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the placebo group at T3, T4, and T5 (P <0.01). The average NRS score in the clenching state was significantly greater than in the resting state. Conclusions PEMF was effective in reducing orthodontic pain caused by initial archwire placement.

However, with regards to the fourth industrial revolution, which is expected to be completed in the next 10 to 20 years, deep fears are present in the midst of coexisting expectations and worries. Unemployment and the polarization of wealth are problems that the fourth industrial revolution is expected to bring about, and the medical world will also face considerable and fundamental difficulties due to the emergence of artificial intelligence. Based on a review of several arguments and predictive theories that have been presented thus far, the author would like to make the following proposals. The fact that the emergence of artificial intelligence will revolutionize the foundations of the medical world should be clearly recognized. With regards to medical treatment using artificial intelligence, we should be very concerned about whether doctors will be the masters or the slaves of artificial intelligence, and if we are to become the main agents of the age of artificial intelligence, now is the time to engage in careful introspection about what we should do. Medicine will be transformed into predictive medicine in the future thanks to the fusion of information and communications technology with precision medicine, supported by the development of genomics, proteomics, and cytomics. As we enter the age of the fourth industrial revolution, doctors should recognize the fact that only emotionally sensitive approaches to treating patients and interdisciplinary collaboration will protect us. ? 2017 Korean Medical Association.",Artificial intelligence; Big data; Clinical medicine; Medical education; The 4th industrial revolution,adult; artificial intelligence; clinical medicine; genomics; human; introspection; medical education; personalized medicine; proteomics; slave; theoretical study,2-s2.0-85037528459

Although pulmonary complications are not common, vEDS cases complicated by pneumothorax, hemothorax, or intrapulmonary hematoma have been reported. When a patient initially presents only with pulmonary complications, it is not easy for clinicians to suspect vEDS. Patient concerns: We report a case of an 18-year-old high school student, with a past history of cryptorchidism, presenting with recurrent pneumothorax. Diagnoses: Routine laboratory findings were unremarkable. Chest high resolution computed tomographic scan showed age-unmatched hyperinflation of both lungs, atypical cystic changes and multifocal ground glass opacities scattered in both lower lobes. His slender body shape, hyperflexible joints, and hyperextensible skin provided clue to suspicion of a possible connective tissue disorder. Interventions: The histological examination of the lung lesions showed excessive capillary proliferation in the pulmonary interstitium and pleura allowing the diagnosis of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH)-like foci. Genetic study revealed COL3A1 gene splicing site mutation confirming his diagnosis as vEDS. Outcomes: Although his diagnosis vEDS is notorious for fatal vascular complication, there was no evidence of such complication at presentation. Fortunately, he has been followed up for 10 months without pulmonary or vascular complications. Lessons: To the best of our knowledge, both cryptorchidism and PCH-like foci have never been reported yet as complications of vEDS, suggesting our case might be a new variant of this condition. This case emphasizes the importance of comprehensive physical examination and history-taking, and the clinical suspicion of a possible connective tissue disorder when we encounter cases with atypical presentation and/or unique chest radiologic findings especially in young patients. ? 2017 the Author(s).

The present study describes a simple, rapid, reproducible, and reliable LC-MS/MS method to determine mazindol concentrations in human plasma. Method: After one-step liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) using ethyl acetate: hexane = 8: 2, mazindol and fluoxetine (internal standard, IS) were eluted on a Kinetex HILLIC column (50.0 × 2.1mm i.d. 2.6 ?m) with an isocratic mobile phase, which consisted of 20 mM ammonium formate in water: acetonitrile (20:80, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The calibration curve was linear (correlation coefficient were > 0.99) over the concentration range (0.05-10 ng/mL). Results: The intraday and interday precisions ranged 0.74 - 8.78% and 4.49- 7.49%, respectively, and its accuracies ranged 92.00 - 108.48% and 97.73 - 105.20%, respectively. The stability of mazindol was evaluated by the addition of buffer to the plasma.

Materials and Methods We conducted a Web-based survey among members of the Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group regarding their treatment of LMS. Results In total, 77 (27.8%) of 277 members responded to the survey. For surgical treatment of stage I LMS, 26.8% indicated total hysterectomy only and 16.9% indicated total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Also, lymph node dissection was indicated by 54.9% of respondents, whereas 46.5% stated that bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy could be omitted in young patients. More than half (57.7%) of the respondents recommended against adjuvant treatment. For stage I LMS diagnosed after morcellation, 79.2% of the respondents recommended lymph node dissection and 56.4% recommended adjuvant therapy. As for advanced-stage LMS, in cases of complete resection, adjuvant chemotherapy was preferred by 63.1%. For incomplete resection, combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy was the most preferred adjuvant therapy (63.1%). Conclusions Among Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group members, there are many discrepancies in the clinical management of LMS. A large-scale prospective study to establish treatment guidelines is needed. ? 2017 by IGCS and ESGO.",Survey; Treatment; Uterine leiomyosarcoma,"carboplatin; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; dacarbazine; docetaxel; doxorubicin; gemcitabine; ifosfamide; paclitaxel; vincristine; abdominal hysterectomy; adult; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer surgery; controlled study; female; health survey; human; hysterectomy; leiomyosarcoma; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; male; morcellation; multimodality cancer therapy; myomectomy; omentectomy; priority journal; salpingectomy; salpingooophorectomy; web browser; clinical practice; leiomyosarcoma; middle aged; questionnaire; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; uterus cancer; Adult; Female; Humans; Leiomyosarcoma; Male; Middle Aged; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Uterine Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85032931982

This cross-sectional study included 139 individuals between 40 to 86 years old who were physically healthy and cognitively intact. Eleven markers (total-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, insulin, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, total protein) and five derived indicators (estimated glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance rate, insulin-resistance, average glucose, and cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio) were obtained from blood sampling. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to evaluate white matter tissue health. Blood markers were clustered into five factors. The first factor (defined as insulin/high-density lipoprotein factor) was associated with markers of integrity in the deep white matter and projection fiber systems, while the third factor (defined as kidney function factor) was associated with different markers of integrity in the periventricular and watershed white matter regions. Differential segregated associations for insulin and high-density lipoprotein levels and serum markers of kidney function may provide information about distinct mechanisms of brain changes across the lifespan. These results emphasize the need to determine whether therapeutic modulation of systemic health and organ function may prevent decline in brain structural integrity. ? 2016, ?

Oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis are the important mechanisms of cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the extracts of morning glory on nephrotoxicity by cisplatin in human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK-293) and mice. Previous studies have reported that morning glory extracts showed potent activity on anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant. However, the protective effects of the n-hexane layer of morning glory seed (MGs-Hx) on nephrotoxicity and its mechanisms have not been clearly understood. Oral administration with MGs-Hx showed protective effects in vivo experiments test and the treatment of MGs-Hx in a concentration of 100 mg/kg/day had significant effect both of decreasing serum creatinine, BUN, serum uric acid level and reduced iNOS, COX-2 mRNA expressions with low side-effect. Moreover, cell viability was restored by MGs-Hx treatment compared to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxic HEK-293 cells. Co-treatment with MGs-Hx and cisplatin showed the significant effect to reduce inflammatory enzyme, iNOS expression and continuous production of NO. In addition, it exhibited a tendency to decreasing expression of apoptosis-related proteins, caspase-3, 8 and 9, and NF-κB translocation to nucleus as well as phosphorylation of p38, JNK, ERK in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxic HEK-293 cells. Our study provides insight into the underlying mechanisms of MGs-Hx and suggests that MGs-Hx might be a potential therapeutic agent to modulate inflammation and apoptosis in nephrotoxicity. ? 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",Apoptosis; Cisplatin; Human embryonic kidney cells 293; Inflammation; Morning glory seed; Nephrotoxicity,"caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; cisplatin; creatinine; cyclooxygenase 2; hexane; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inducible nitric oxide synthase; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; morning glory n hexane; plant extract; stress activated protein kinase; synaptophysin; unclassified drug; uric acid; alcohol; antiinflammatory agent; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; cisplatin; hexane; n-hexane; plant extract; animal experiment; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; cell viability; controlled study; Convolvulaceae; creatinine blood level; drug mechanism; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; plant seed; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; renal protection; urea nitrogen blood level; uric acid blood level; animal; chemically induced; chemistry; drug effect; inflammation; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; Ipomoea nil; isolation and purification; kidney disease; oxidative stress; plant seed; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Cisplatin; Ethanol; HEK293 Cells; Hexanes; Humans; Inflammation; Ipomoea nil; Kidney Diseases; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Seeds",2-s2.0-85029694180

We anticipate that naming tests with the consideration of response time can provide more informative and distinct neuropsychological profiles of individuals with MCI. Methods: Naming tests were administered to 76 elderly individuals with MCI and 149 healthy elderly (HE). We analyzed the impact of MCI on naming performance and occurrence of ""delayed"" response. We also validated the predictive power of naming tests with a time-constrained scoring system. Results: MCI participants performed poorer on the noun naming test than HE participants (p = 0.014). MCI was significantly associated with the occurrence of ""delayed"" response on the noun (odds ratio [OR] = 3.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.78-7.17) and verb naming tests (OR = 4.66; 95% CI = 2.07-10.46). The time-constrained naming scores were significantly better able to distinguish the MCI from the HE group than the conventional spontaneous naming score on both the noun (p < 0.001) and verb (p = 0.002) naming tests. Conclusions: Our findings broaden the knowledge related to the naming ability in individuals with MCI, with respect to the response time.

Methods In this prospective cohort study, The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology collected baseline data in 2008 and follow-up data in 2012 for participants from the Itabashi Ward of Tokyo, Japan. Participants were asked at each time point if they had been diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. The baseline evaluation was conducted with 1289 community-dwelling women aged 75–85 years, of which 992 reported no history of knee osteoarthritis. The follow-up survey targeted these 992 participants; we obtained history of knee osteoarthritis from 867 of these participants. The baseline evaluation also included collection of anthropometric, fitness, hematologic, and lifestyle data. Results We performed logistic regression analysis of the cross-sectional data at baseline. Participants who reported fewer light exercise sessions (?2–4?days/week) had lower odds ratios for history of self-reported knee osteoarthritis than those who reported more frequent exercise (?5–6?days/week). Logistic regression analysis of the longitudinal data revealed that slow walking speed (?<?65.22?m/min), low serum albumin levels (?<?4.10?g/dL), and low frequency of soy product consumption (?1 time per 2?days) at baseline resulted in higher odds ratios for incidence of self-reported knee osteoarthritis during the 4-year follow-up period. Conclusions The results suggest that slow walking speed, low serum albumin, and insufficient consumption of soy products are predictors for knee osteoarthritis in elderly Japanese women. These results could help in the design of knee osteoarthritis prevention programs for elderly women. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Epidemiology; Knee osteoarthritis; Predictors,"albumin; serum albumin; aged; albumin blood level; anthropometry; Article; cohort analysis; community living; controlled study; cross-sectional study; exercise; female; fitness; follow up; food intake; health survey; hematology; human; incidence; Japan; knee osteoarthritis; lifestyle; longitudinal study; major clinical study; medical history; predictor variable; priority journal; prospective study; self report; soy food; walking speed; women's health; independent living; knee osteoarthritis; statistical model; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Independent Living; Japan; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Prospective Studies; Self Report; Serum Albumin; Walking Speed",2-s2.0-85026918350

The virus outbreak provoked public fear, which resulted in a mass reduction in transit use in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). Its effect differed among socioeconomic groups and geographical areas. A typical way to analyze this is to associate individual reactions to the disaster with socioeconomic characteristics. However, a more structured approach, which considers behavioral characteristics resulting from the societal position of an individual, would identify the basic reason for such associations. The study hypothesized that the degree of fixity that individuals have in their daily life may elucidate these associations. When fear is prevalent, people having the flexibility to change their lifestyle will make more changes in daily activities and travels. The study examined the influence of public fear of a pandemic disease on travel behavior and the effect of life fixity on individual response to the fear. To this end, smart card data of transit use and changes in travel behavior during the MERS period were examined. The study found that fear was powerful and influenced travel behavior differently depending on life fixity levels and regional characteristics. ? 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",disaster management; fear; life fixity; MERS; travel behavior,Disaster prevention; Disasters; Human resource management; Smart cards; Viruses; Disaster management; fear; life fixity; MERS; Travel behaviors; Transportation,2-s2.0-85012273183

The aim of this observational study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of exenatide twice a day in Korean patients with T2DM who are suboptimally controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents.METHODS: This study was a post hoc analysis of multi-center (71 centers), prospective, observational, single-arm, post-marketing study of short-acting exenatide 5 to 10?μg twice a day from March 2008 to March 2014 and analyzed those who finished the follow-up over 20?weeks of medication. Changes of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body weight values before and after exenatide treatment were analyzed. Adverse events and adverse drug reactions were estimated in patients who were treated with exenatide at least once and for whom follow-up for safety has been completed.RESULTS: After 20?weeks treatment with exenatide, mean HbA1c and body weight were significantly reduced from 8.4% to 7.7% and from 83.4?kg to 80.2?kg, respectively (both p?<?0.001). Subjects with higher baseline glucose and HbA1c levels showed an independent association with a greater reduction in glucose level. In addition, short duration of diabetes less than 5?years was an independent predictor for the improvement in glucose level. The majority of study subjects showed a reduction in both body weight and glucose level (63.3%) after exenatide treatment. In terms of safety profile, exenatide treatment was generally well-tolerated and the incidence of severe adverse event was rare (0.8%). The gastrointestinal side effects were most common and hypoglycemia was reported in 1.7% of subjects.CONCLUSION: In real clinical practice, 20?weeks treatment with short-acting exenatide was well tolerated and showed a significant body weight and glucose reduction in Korean patients with T2D who are suboptimally controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTirals.gov , number NCT02090673 , registered 14 February 2008.",Adverse event; Exenatide; GLP-1 analogue; Glucose; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,"antidiabetic agent; exendin 4; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; peptide; venom; adult; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; body weight; clinical trial; drug effect; female; glucose blood level; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prospective study; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Peptides; Prospective Studies; Venoms",2-s2.0-85049546521

However, at the same time, the low back torsional loads during this phase can have a considerable effect on golf-related low back pain (LBP). Previous efforts to quantify the transition phase were hampered by problems with accuracy due to methodological limitations. In this study, vector-coding technique (VCT) method was proposed as a comprehensive methodology to quantify the precise transition phase and examine low back torsional load. Towards this end, transition phases were assessed using three different methods (VCT, lead hand speed and X-factor stretch) and compared; then, low back torsional load during the transition phase was examined. As a result, the importance of accurate transition phase quantification has been documented. The largest torsional loads were observed in healthy professional golfers (10.23?±?1.69?N · kg?1), followed by professional golfers with a history of LBP (7.93?±?1.79?N · kg?1), healthy amateur golfers (1.79?±?1.05?N · kg?1) and amateur golfers with a history of LBP (0.99?±?0.87?N · kg?1), which order was equal to that of the transition phase magnitudes of each group. These results indicate the relationship between the transition phase and LBP history and the dependency of the torsional load magnitude on the transition phase. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",coordination between pelvis and thorax; golf swing; lower back complaints; torsional load; Transition phase,adult; biomechanics; golf; human; injuries; low back pain; lumbosacral region; male; movement (physiology); pathophysiology; pelvis; physiology; task performance; thorax; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Golf; Humans; Low Back Pain; Lumbosacral Region; Male; Movement; Pelvis; Thorax; Time and Motion Studies,2-s2.0-84995633337

Two hundred and fifty-four Korean adolescents were asked to complete the Korean version of the CADI (K-CADI), the Phlegm Pattern, the Cold-Heat Pattern, and the Korean version of the General Health Questionnaires. A clinician estimated acne severity for the adolescents, using the Korean Acne Grading System. Finally, reliability and validity of the K-CADI was examined, and the relationships between acne severity, Phlegm, Cold, and Heat patterns, and QoL level were examined via pathway analysis. The K-CADI had satisfactory internal consistency (α=0.827). The examination of construct validity indicated that the K-CADI had one factor (explaining 59.6% of the total variance). Pathway analysis showed satisfactory model fit (normal fit index=0.960 and comparative fit index=0.983), and acne-related QoL was determinant to Phlegm, Heat, and Cold patterns (0.13-0.27 of β), and Phlegm and Heat patterns lowered one's QoL level (0.17-0.34 of β). The K-CADI is a valid and reliable instrument. Phlegm and Heat patterns should be managed when treating acne since they have a moderating effect on general QoL aggravation. ? 2017 JTCM.

Then, how did the elite in these two East Asian countries recognize and understand Western public health movement in the 19th Century? Answering this question could provide historical knowledge about the background of starting modern hygiene administration in East Asia. Methods: To understand the birth of modern public health system in East Asia, Japanese and Korean elite’s records on Western countries were reviewed. The documents examined were The Iwakura Embassy 1871-73 published in 1878 as an account of Japanese Meiji government’s special ambassador sent to the United States and Europe, and Seoyugyeonmun (observations on travels in the West) published in 1895 by a Korean intelligent. Results: The Iwakura Embassy 1871-73 suggested modern water supply and drainage, roadside trees, and parks, to prevent contagious diseases and improve urban hygiene. Seoyugyeonmun emphasizes that hygiene is an important task that civilized government has to be in charge. So, specific tasks of public health should be imposed on sanitary police. Conclusion: Public health was one of the major factors that contributed to national prosperity in the 19th century. Such recognition enabled organization of hygiene administration to be part of the project pursuing enlightenment, modernization, and civilization at the end of the 19th century in Japan and Korea. ? 2017, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

The present study aims to determine the incidence of pneumothorax following thoracentesis in ED settings and evaluate the association of specific demographics, clinical, and procedure factors with thoracentesis-related pneumothorax. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 3,067 thoracentesis cases in the ED of a tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital between January 2009 and December 2014. To evaluate the factors associated with the occurrence of pneumothorax following thoracentesis, matched controls were used with a case to control ratio of 1:5. Results: Of the 3,067 cases that received thoracentesis, 19 cases of pneumothorax were observed (0.62%). Patients with pneumothorax had significantly lower weight and body mass index (BMI) than those without pneumothorax (51.0 vs. 61.2 kg, 20.0 vs. 22.6; P < 0.001, respectively). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, being underweight, defined as a BMI of < 18.5 [OR, 5.2 (95% CI, 1.3-21.2); P=0.021] was significantly associated with the occurrence of pneumothorax. Conclusions: The incidence of pneumothorax following thoracentesis was very low in the present study. However, clinicians should be aware of the risk of pneumothorax in underweight patients during thoracentesis. Further prospective studies are required to clarify the results of the present study. ?

There are many structural and functional varieties of LTA, which vary according to the different species of gram-positive bacteria that produce them. In this study, we examined whether LTA isolated from Staphylococcus aureus (aLTA) affects the expression of junction proteins in keratinocytes. In HaCaT cells, tight junctionrelated gene expression was not affected by aLTA, whereas adherens junction-related gene expression was modified. High doses of aLTA induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2, which in turn induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HaCaT cells. When cells were given a low dose of aLTA, however, NF-?B was activated and the total cell population increased. Taken together, our study suggests that LTA from S. aureus infections in the skin may contribute both to the outbreak of EMTmediated carcinogenesis and to the genesis of wound healing in a dose-dependent manner. ? 2017 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.",Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Keratinocytes; Lipoteichoic acid; Staphylococcus aureus; Toll-like receptor; Wound healing,"immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lipoteichoic acid; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; tight junction protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lipopolysaccharide; lipoteichoic acid; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; teichoic acid; toll like receptor 2; adherens junction; Article; cell proliferation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; drug isolation; enzyme phosphorylation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression; HaCat cell line; human; human cell; nonhuman; protein expression; skin carcinogenesis; Staphylococcus aureus; tight junction; wound healing; biosynthesis; cell line; drug effect; epithelial mesenchymal transition; isolation and purification; keratinocyte; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; phosphorylation; signal transduction; skin disease; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; wound healing; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Gene Expression; Humans; Keratinocytes; Lipopolysaccharides; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; NF-kappa B; Phosphorylation; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; Skin Diseases; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Teichoic Acids; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Wound Healing",2-s2.0-85035123726

Decreased distant visual acuity is the most common symptom and visual field defect is the second most common symptom. Hemianopsia is rarely reported. In an atypical situation of FVL, it is important to prove that no organic pathology exists, through detailed history taking and appropriate examinations. Patient concerns: This review presents the case of a 48-year-old male patient presented with decreased bilateral visual acuity and visual field defect after a traffic accident 3 weeks ago. Visual field test showed atypical features of FVL in which visual field change from binasal hemianopsia to left homonymous hemianopsia. Diagnosis: The best corrected visual acuities (BCVA) were 20/63 in both eyes and binasal hemianopsia was observed on a Humphrey visual field test. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormalities in the brain and optic chiasm. Two weeks after presentation, however, the patient's visual field defect changed from binasal hemianopsia to left homonymous hemianopsia. We diagnosed it as FVL due to conversion disorder. Intervention and outcomes: We decided to cooperate with a psychiatrist for cognitive behavioral therapy and the patient is under observation. Lessons: Binasal hemianopsia and homonymous hemianopsia are rare; however, it may occur simultaneously in 1 patient with FVL. The possibility of FVL should be considered when there is atypical visual field defect and no organic abnormalities are observed. Repeated Humphrey field test and VEP may be helpful in diagnosis of FVL. ? 2017 the Author(s).

Cupping is a traditional medical treatment used in several societies in East Asia and it is frequently used for controlling pain including migraine. There have been no systematic reviews on the treatment effects of cupping on migraine. Furthermore, related studies have had many limitations, making it unclear whether cupping intervention is beneficial for migraine. We propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to consider the evidence related to the effect of cupping on migraine. Methods We developed a protocol describing the essential reporting items based on the PRISMA for systematic review protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015) (Registration number: CRD42017054979). We will search eight databases and include data from prospective randomized controlled clinical trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials that used cupping interventions for the treatment of migraine. The risk of bias will be assessed with the “Risk of bias” tool from the Cochrane Handbook. Using improved effectiveness and the change in headache pain intensity as graded on the visual analogue scale as the primary outcomes, we will compare these outcomes between the cupping intervention and control groups.

Students’ perception and demand are important in education. The aim of our study was to conduct a nationwide online survey about EBM in traditional Korean Medicine (KM) education. Methods An online questionnaire was developed, comprising categories about EBM education in KM. Student's experience, achievement, satisfaction, understanding and expectation in EBM education were surveyed. Face validity of the developed questionnaire was tested before survey and online links were sent through SurveyMonkey to all KM college students in Korea. Results Among the total 4649 students nationwide, 1292 agreed to participate in the survey (response rate: 27.8%) within 10 days. Self-appraisals about the achievement, satisfaction, and understanding of EBM were relatively low. In addition to this, 30% of students answered they did not learn about EBM in regular school curriculum. Expectation of extension of further EBM education curriculum was comparatively high. Most respondents agreed that EBM knowledge would be useful for clinical practice and the undergraduate curriculum. Barriers to enhance EBM education were perceived to be lack of resources and appropriate contents. Conclusion This first nationwide survey in Korea investigated the experience, perception, and demand for EBM education by KM college students. The importance of EBM education in the KM curriculum needs further improvement and curriculum development based on the students' experiences and perceptions. Additionally, online survey in smartphone environment, which was conducted thorough involvement of student's representatives seems to be an eligible strategy for a survey of students. ? 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Clinical education; Curriculum development; Evidence based medicine; Korean Medicine; Quantitative research methods,achievement; adult; Article; college student; curriculum development; evidence based medicine; experience; face validity; female; human; knowledge base; Korean medicine; male; medical education; perception; priority journal; questionnaire; satisfaction; smartphone,2-s2.0-85029501488

Materials and methods: From January 2010 to September 2016, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained to evaluate cerebral manifestations in patients with underlying pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis. We also included patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis. MRI findings of tuberculous meningitis and tuberculoma were classified as typical; other MRI findings were classified as atypical. Demographic data, risk factors, and drug regimens were collected and analyzed. Results: Twenty-two patients were diagnosed with cerebral tuberculosis. Cerebral tuberculosis was due to hematogenous spread from pulmonary tuberculosis (10 patients), spinal tuberculosis (8 patients), disseminated tuberculosis (3 patients), and unknown causes (1 patient). There were six patients with typical MRI findings (three patients with typical meningitis involving the basal cistern and supratentorium, one patient with tuberculomas, and two patients with both) and seven patients with atypical MRI findings [five patients with evidence of early meningitis, such as high signal intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) along the cerebellar folia, and two patients with only hydrocephalus]. Conclusion: Besides the typical sites of meningeal involvement, overlooked findings such as FLAIR abnormalities along the cerebellar folia or hydrocephalus should be checked for early detection of cerebral tuberculosis and initiation of the appropriate treatment against disseminated tuberculosis. ? 2017 Hwang, Lee, Park, Kim, Kim, Choi and Yang.",Atypical tuberculosis meningitis; Disseminated tuberculosis; Post-contrast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; Tuberculoma; Tuberculous meningitis,Article; basal cistern; central nervous system tuberculosis; cerebellar folia; cerebellar tissue; clinical article; disease classification; drug resistant tuberculosis; extrapulmonary tuberculosis; female; fluid attenuated inversion recovery; human; hydrocephalus; image processing; intracranial tuberculoma; male; miliary tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radiological parameters; supratentorial region; tuberculous meningitis; tuberculous spondylitis,2-s2.0-85029612842

Diverse bioactive molecules involved in the long-term survival of TsM might contribute to disease progression. Fasciclin (Fas) is an extracellular protein that mediates adhesion, migration and differentiation of cells by interacting with other molecules. We hypothesized that TsMFas might bind to calcareous corpuscle (CC) through its adhesive property and participate in crucial protein-protein interactions, thus contributing to the creation of a symbiotic interactome network. Methods: Two paralogous TsMFas (TsMFas1 and TsMFas2) were isolated, and their molecular properties were characterized. The co-localization pattern of TsMFas1 and TsMFas2 with CC was determined. CC-TsMFas binary complex was generated by incubating CC with recombinant proteins (rTsMFas1 and 2). In vitro binding assay of CC-rTsMFas1 or CC-rTsMFas2 binary complex with TsM cellular proteins extracted from scolex and neck was conducted. Their binding partners were identified through proteomic analysis. Integrated protein-protein interaction networks were established. Results: TsMFas1 (6072 bp long) was composed of 15 exons (841 amino acid polypeptide) interrupted by 14 introns. TsMFas2 (5201 bp long) comprised of 11 exons (597 amino acids) and 10 intervening introns. These proteins displayed 22% amino acid sequence identity to each other, but tightly conserved Fas-related domains. Several isoforms of Fas1 and Fas2 proteins might have been expressed through post-translational modifications. They showed adhesion activity with other cells. TsMFas proteins were largely distributed in parenchymal regions of the scolex and bladder wall. These molecules were co-localized with CC, a unique organelle found in platyhelminths. Subsequent proteome analysis of CC-Fas binary complex mediated protein-protein interactions revealed seven protein ligands in the TsM cellular proteins. Their functions were mainly segregated into carbohydrate metabolism (enolase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, phosphoglycerate kinase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and cytoskeleton/cellular motility (actin, paramyosin and innexin nuc-9). Those proteins had direct (physical) and/or indirect (functional) relationships along with their biochemical properties and biological roles. Conclusion: Protein repertoires strongly suggest that TsMFas and CC may symbiotically mediate protein-protein interactions during biological processes to maintain efficacious homeostatic functions and ensure the prolonged survival of TsM in the host. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Calcareous corpuscle; Carbohydrate metabolizing enzyme; Extracellular matrix; Fasciclin; Neurocysticercosis; Protein-protein interactions; Taenia solium metacestode,"actin; enolase; fasciclin I; fasciclin II; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; paramyosin; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; phosphoglycerate kinase; recombinant protein; helminth protein; nerve cell adhesion molecule; protein binding; amino acid sequence; Article; calcareous corpuscle; cell adhesion; cell motility; complex formation; controlled study; cytoskeleton; exon; fetus; human; human cell; in vitro study; intron; lung fibroblast; nonhuman; paralogy; parasite phenomena and functions; protein domain; protein localization; protein protein interaction; proteomics; scolex; Taenia solium; animal; classification; female; genetics; isolation and purification; male; metabolism; neurocysticercosis; parasitology; phylogeny; pig; swine disease; Taenia solium; veterinary; Animals; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Female; Helminth Proteins; Humans; Male; Neurocysticercosis; Phylogeny; Protein Binding; Swine; Swine Diseases; Taenia solium",2-s2.0-85029688945

The aim of this study was to assess the relation between SS and plaque characteristics and poststent vascular response using optical coherence tomography in coronary artery tree and left anterior descending artery (LAD) in patients with stable angina. A total of 179 lesions among 165 patients, including 100 lesions in LAD, were analyzed. Patients were stratified into tertiles. In pre–percutaneous coronary intervention analysis of whole coronary tree and LAD, lesions of the third tertile had the highest prevalence of lipid-rich plaque. Compared with the first tertile, the third tertile had greater lipid index, thinner fibrous cap, and higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma. In poststent optical coherence tomography, the incidence of stent edge dissection and irregular protrusion was higher in the third tertile compared with the first tertile in coronary tree analysis. In LAD analysis, the prevalence of irregular protrusion was the highest in the third tertile. In conclusion, high SS may reflect higher plaque vulnerability. Stent edge dissection and irregular protrusion were more frequent in patients with higher SS, indicating poor vascular response to stenting. Our results may explain higher cardiac event rate and target lesion revascularization in patients with higher SS. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"calcium; lipid; adult; Article; atheroma; blood vessel reactivity; cardiovascular parameters; clinical assessment; comparative study; controlled study; coronary artery; coronary artery calcification; coronary stent; coronary stenting; female; fibrous cap thickness; human; image analysis; incidence; left anterior descending coronary artery; major clinical study; male; optical coherence tomography; percutaneous coronary intervention; postoperative care; preoperative care; prevalence; priority journal; stable angina pectoris; stent edge dissection; SYNTAX score; target lesion revascularization; thin cap fibroatheroma; Angina, Stable; clinical trial; coronary angiography; coronary blood vessel; global health; Graft Occlusion, Vascular; middle aged; multicenter study; optical coherence tomography; pathology; percutaneous coronary intervention; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; procedures; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; risk factor; stent; treatment outcome; Angina, Stable; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Vessels; Female; Global Health; Graft Occlusion, Vascular; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stents; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85025456692

This information is fed back to subjects allowing them to gain a voluntary control over their own region-specific brain activity. Forty-one healthy participants were randomized into an experimental (NFB) group, who received a feedback directly proportional to their brain activity from the primary motor cortex (M1), and a control (CTRL) group who received a sham feedback. The M1 ROI was functionally localized during motor execution and imagery tasks. A resting-state functional run was performed before and after the neurofeedback training to investigate the default mode network (DMN) modulation after training. The NFB group revealed increased DMN functional connectivity after training to the cortical and subcortical sensory/motor areas (M1/S1 and caudate nucleus, respectively), which may be associated with sensorimotor processing of learning in the resting state. These results show that motor imagery training through rtfMRI-NFB could modulate the DMN functional connectivity to motor-related areas, suggesting that this modulation potentially subserved the establishment of motor learning in the NFB group. ? 2017 IEEE.",,brain mapping; controlled study; guided imagery; human; motor cortex; neurofeedback; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; randomized controlled trial; Brain Mapping; Humans; Imagery (Psychotherapy); Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Motor Cortex; Neurofeedback,2-s2.0-85032194350

As a primary method, an isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) has been used to obtain the accurate quantity of UA in blood or serum and also develop the certificated reference material (CRM) so as to provide a SI-traceability to clinical laboratories. Due to the low solubility of UA in water, an ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) has been considered as a promising solvent to increase the solubility of UA that enables the preparation of both UA and its isotope standard solution for next IDMS-based absolute quantification. But, because of using this NH4OH solvent, it gives rise to the unwanted degradation of UA. In this study, we sought to optimize condition for the stability of UA in NH4OH solution by varying the mole ratios of UA to NH4OH, followed by ID-LC-MRM analysis. In addition, we also inspected minutely the effect of the storage temperatures. Additionally, we also performed the quantitative analysis of UA in the KRISS serum certificated reference material (CRM, 111-01-02A) with diverse mixing ratios of UA to NH4OH and then compared those values to its certification value. Based on our experiments, adjusting the mole ratio of 1/2 (UA/NH4OH) with the storage temperature of -20°C is an effective way to secure both the solubility and stability of UA in NH4OH solution for next IDMS-based quantification of UA in serum. ?

Methods This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, blind genotype trial. First time non-cardiogenic ischemic stroke patients were enrolled and screened within 30 days. Participants were randomized to receive either triflusal or clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention. The primary outcome was the time from randomization to first recurrent ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. Results The required sample size was 1,080 but only 784 (73%) participants were recruited. In patients with a poor CYP2C19 genotype for clopidogrel metabolism (n=484), the risk of recurrent stroke among those who received triflusal treatment was 2.9% per year, which was not significantly different from those who received clopidogrel treatment (2.2% per year; hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60–2.53). In the clopidogrel treatment group (n=393), 38% had good genotypes and 62% poor genotypes for clopidogrel metabolism.

The primary compounds of Alisma Rhizome are protostane type triterpenes, such as Alisols A, B or C. We previously demonstrated that Alisol derivatives (Alisols A, B, and C) have inhibitory effects on 5-hydroxytryptamine 3A (5-HT3A) currents1. In this study, we tested the effects of a new triterpene, Alisol-F, on human 5-HT3A and α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor channel currents by using Xenopus oocytes expressing these channels. Co-application of Alisol-F inhibited 5-HT3A and α3β4 nACh receptor-mediated inward peak currents. The inhibitory effect of Alisol-F on 5-HT and ACh-induced inward peak currents occurred in a reversible and concentration- dependent manner.

This study aimed to compare the anti-proteinuric effect of different CCBs in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: A multicentre, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study was performed in seven centres in Korea. A total of 74 patients with T2D and microalbuminuria treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers were randomized to a cilnidipine 10?mg treatment (n=38) or amlodipine 5?mg treatment (n=36). Results: Urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) reduction was similar between the two groups at 12?weeks (?53.0±123.2?mg/g in cilnidipine group and ?35.7±83.6?mg/g in amlodipine group, P=.29) or 24?weeks (?57.3±106.9?mg/g in cilnidipine group and ?20.0±110.4?mg/g in amlodipine group, P=.24). In a subgroup analysis, cilnidipine treatment showed a larger ACR reduction than amlodipine treatment at 12?weeks (?84.7±106.8?mg/g in cilnidipine group and ?9.5±79.2?mg/g in amlodipine group, P=.01) and 24?weeks (?84.0±111.7?mg/g in cilnidipine group and 14.6±119.4?mg/g in amlodipine group, P=.008), particularly in patients with a longer duration of diabetes more than 10?years. Conclusions: Cilnidipine did not show any additional anti-albuminuric effect compared with amlodipine in patients with T2D and microalbuminuria treated with an RAS blocker. However, the anti-albuminuric effect of cilnidipine might differ according to the duration of diabetes. ? 2017 The Authors.

Decision making regarding the appropriate fusion levels, proper surgical treatment, and reduction amount of kyphoscoliosis is very important but difficult in the treatment of congenital scoliosis, especially in young children. Patient concerns: We report an 11-year follow-up of revision surgery for fractional curve progression after combined anterior and posterior fusion without hemivertebra resection using pedicle screw fixation (PSF) in congenital kyphoscoliosis at age 4 years (a total 18-year follow-up). A T12 hemivertebra was documented in a 4-year-old girl and was treated by combined anterior and posterior fusion in two stages with PSF. The fusion mass was maintained but the distal compensatory curve progressed during the follow-up period. The patient underwent a posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) with extended posterior fusion at the age of 11, 7 years after initial surgery. Outcomes: Eleven years after the revision surgery with PVCR, the patient showed satisfactory results and her spine was well balanced. Lessons: The cause of revision surgery for the curve progression may include inappropriate fusion level, incomplete hemivertebra resection, or failure of anterior and posterior fusion. Especially, inappropriate fusion level may result in deterioration of the compensatory curve even without progression of the fusion mass. Conclusion: Appropriate selection of fusion levels, complete resection of hemivertebra, and satisfactory reduction of scoliosis and kyphosis are important factors for deformity correction and prevention of progression of both main and compensatory curves (adding-on of structural curve or progression of compensatory curve) as well as reducing the influence of adjacent vertebral growth using as short a fusion as possible. ? 2017 Author(s).",congenital scoliosis; curve progression; fusion level; hemivertebra; posterior vertebral column resection,anterior spine fusion; Article; case report; child; clinical article; congenital heart malformation; craniofacial malformation; female; follow up; fractional curve progression; human; kyphoscoliosis; musculoskeletal system parameters; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient referral; patient satisfaction; pedicle screw fixation device; physician; posterior spine fusion; preschool child; priority journal; reoperation; spine radiography; thoracolumbar spine; urogenital tract malformation; vaginal delivery; adolescent; disease course; kyphosis; lumbar vertebra; pedicle screw; procedures; scoliosis; spine fusion; thoracic vertebra; Adolescent; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Kyphosis; Lumbar Vertebrae; Pedicle Screws; Reoperation; Scoliosis; Spinal Fusion; Thoracic Vertebrae,2-s2.0-85028977345

This study sought to compare diagnostic colonoscopic findings in symptomatic young patients from South Korea and the United States. Results from the first diagnostic colonoscopies in symptomatic 18-to 49-year-old patients were compared between the United States and Korean cohorts. The US cohort data were collected at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, Washington between January 2007 and January 2010, and the Korean cohort data were collected at 14 university hospitals in Korea between June 2006 and June 2015. The prevalence of advanced neoplasias was similar in both cohorts for bleeding and nonbleeding symptoms (P = .966 and P = .076, respectively). In a subgroup analysis for 40-to 49-year-old patients, the prevalence of advanced neoplasias was similar for bleeding symptoms; however, nonbleeding symptoms were significantly higher in the Korean cohort than in the US cohort (6.2% vs 2.6%, P < .001). In an age subgroup analysis for 18-to 39-year-old patients, the prevalence of advanced neoplasias was similar for bleeding and nonbleeding symptoms in both cohorts. Multivariate analysis showed that lower gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with the risk of any type of advanced neoplasia in young Korean patients. Ethnic disparities in the prevalence of advanced neoplasia on diagnostic colonoscopy were not noticeable between Korean and US young patients. However, 40-to 49-year-old patients with nonbleeding symptoms require more attention to detect advanced neoplasia in Korea than similarly aged patients in the United States. ? 2017 the Author(s).

The correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between the QSM value and the body weight and the fasting blood glucose value of the rats. QSM values in the OLETF group were significantly increased in hippocampi and thalami, as compared with those of the LETO group. The QSM values of the OLETF rats were negatively correlated with the body weight in putamen and were significantly correlated with the fasting blood glucose level in the left amygdala and right thalamus. With higher QSM values in diabetic rats than in control rats, QSM values in the diabetic group were significantly correlated with the body weight and the fasting blood glucose level, indicating that the QSM technique should be helpful to noninvasively investigate iron overload in the diabetic brain. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",brain; diabetes rat; iron accumulation; quantitative susceptibility mapping,Anthropometry; Blood; Brain; Glucose; Iron; Mapping; Rats; Blood glucose; Blood glucose level; Correlation analysis; Diabetes mellitus; Gradient echo sequences; Iron accumulation; Iron overloads; Susceptibility mapping; Brain mapping,2-s2.0-85027585511

This study explores whether the dosimetric difference is correlated with any radiobiological difference between delivered and planned dose. Methods: VMAT or IMRT plans optimized for 14 cancer patients were calculated and delivered to a QA device. Measured dose was compared against planned dose using 2-D gamma analysis. Dose volume histograms (for various patient structures) obtained by interpolating measured data were compared against the planned ones using a 3-D gamma analysis. Dose volume histograms were used in the Poisson model to calculate tumor control probability for the treatment targets and in the Sigmoid dose-response model to calculate normal tissue complication probability for the organs at risk. Results: Differences in measured and planned dosimetric data for the patient plans passing at ?94.9% rate at 3%/3 mm criteria are not statistically significant. Average ± standard deviation tumor control probabilities based on measured and planned data are 65.8±4.0% and 67.8±4.1% for head and neck, and 71.9±2.7% and 73.3±3.1% for lung plans, respectively. The differences in tumor control probabilities obtained from measured and planned dose are statistically insignificant. However, the differences in normal tissue complication probabilities for larynx, lungs-GTV, heart, and cord are statistically significant for the patient plans meeting ?94.9% passing criterion at 3%/3 mm. Conclusion: A ?90% gamma passing criterion at 3%/3 mm cannot assure the radiobiological equivalence between planned and delivered dose. These results agree with the published literature demonstrating the inadequacy of the criterion for dosimetric QA and suggest for a tighter tolerance. ? 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",3DVH; ArcCheck; Dosimetric quality assurance; NTCP; Radiobiological QA; TCP,"comparative study; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; Poisson distribution; procedures; radiobiology; radiometry; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; standards; Humans; Poisson Distribution; Radiobiology; Radiometry; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated",2-s2.0-85026754710

This condition can be improved within 6 months with conservative treatments such as stretching, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), extracorporeal shockwave therapy, and corticosteroid injection. However, soldiers need a faster and safer therapy for symptomatic relief to meet the requirements of their occupation. In this report, we reveal that Jakyak-Gamcho-Tang (JGT), an herbal complex, had a positive effect in a case series of 10 military patients with plantar fasciitis. We treated 10 patients with chronic and acute plantar fasciitis with the JGT herbal complex for 21.00 ± 5.72 days. During JGT administration, the patients continued to perform calf-strengthening exercises. After JGT administration, the average foot function index (FFI) score was reduced from 41.11 ± 7.86 to 1.65 ± 3.60 and the average facial rating scale (FRS) was reduced from 5.65 ± 0.88 to 0.40 ± 0.70. A statistically significant difference was observed between the average FFI and FRS measured before and after treatment (paired t test, P <.001). At the conclusion of JGT treatment, all 10 patients (100%) had reduced symptoms of plantar fasciitis. In 7 out of the 10 patients (70%), no pain was experienced after the treatment. In this case series, we show the clinical effects of JGT on pain control in patients with plantar fasciitis.

Following noise insult, intense metabolic activity occurs, resulting in a cochlear free radical imbalance. Oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme alterations, including lipoxygenase upregulation, have been linked to chronic inflammation, which contributes to hearing impairment. We previously proposed Scutellaria baicalensis (SB) extract as an alternative therapeutic for preventing NIHL and attributed its pharmacological effects to baicalein. Although baicalein was most effective, its concentration in SB extract is much lower compared to baicalin. In this study, we performed enzymatic bioconversion using an Sumizyme (SM) enzyme to increase baicalein concentration in SB extract and consequently improve its therapeutic efficacy. HPLC analysis revealed that baicalein concentration in SB extract after bioconversion (BSB) was significantly increased. Moreover, BSB-treated mice exhibited significantly improved auditory function compared with control mice and tended to have improved auditory function compared with SB-treated mice. We also demonstrated that BSB effectively stimulates hair cell regeneration compared to SB that did not achieve the same effect in a zebrafish model. Finally, when compared the abilities of SB and BSB to inhibit lipoxygenase (LOX), BSB showed a greater efficacy. Cumulatively, our data suggest that BSB exhibits improved pharmacological properties for treating NIHL compared with SB. ? 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",Baicalein; Bioconverted extract; Mouse model; Noise-induced hearing loss; Scutellaria baicalensis; Zebrafish model,"baicalein; baicalin; lipoxygenase; antioxidant; baicalein; baicalin; flavanone derivative; flavonoid; plant extract; Scutellaria baicalensis extract; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biotransformation; cell regeneration; concentration (parameters); controlled study; convalescence; drug efficacy; embryo; enzyme inhibition; hair cell; hearing; hearing impairment; high performance liquid chromatography; IC50; male; mouse; nonhuman; ototoxicity; priority journal; zebra fish; animal; cochlear hair cell; disease model; drug effects; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; noise injury; oxidative stress; Animals; Antioxidants; Disease Models, Animal; Flavanones; Flavonoids; Hair Cells, Auditory; Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts",2-s2.0-85025174024

Methods: We evaluated high-risk PCa patients (PSA >20?ng/ml, ?cT3a, or Gleason score 8–10) who underwent RP between 2007 and 2013 at our institute. We classified patients into three groups according to their pathologic outcomes: favorable (pT2, Gleason score ?7, and node negative), intermediate (specimen-confined disease (pT2-3a, node negative PCa with negative surgical margins) but not in the favorable group), and unfavorable (the remaining patients). We developed a risk stratification scoring system to predict prognostic outcomes after RP and validated our scoring system to estimate its predictive accuracy. Results: Among a total of 356 patients, 95 (26.7%), 115 (32.3%), and 146 (41%) were in the favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable prognostic groups, respectively. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates of the patients in each group were 87.8, 64.6, and 41.4%, respectively. We developed a scoring system based on preoperative PSA, clinical stage, percentage of tumor positive core, and percentage of cores with a Gleason score 8–10. This demonstrated internally and externally validated concordance indices of 0.733 and 0.772, respectively. Conclusions: Using our scoring system, we can predict which patients with high-risk PCa would benefit more from RP. Thus, this system can be used in patient counseling to determine an optimal treatment strategy for high-risk PCa. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Models; Prognosis; Prostatectomy; Prostatic neoplasms; Risk; Risk assessment; Statistical,"aged; Article; biochemical recurrence free survival; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer surgery; cancer survival; clinical outcome; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; Gleason score; high risk patient; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; prediction; preoperative care; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; scoring system; surgical margin; survival rate; survival time; tumor biopsy; adult; classification; disease free survival; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; pathology; procedures; prostate tumor; prostatectomy; risk factor; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Disease-Free Survival; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Pathology, Surgical; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85019766460

Training groups performed 8?weeks' aerobic training on a treadmill (3?times/week), but all subjects continued to smoke cigarettes as usual. Heart rate variability was monitored to evaluate the effect of aerobic training on autonomic regulation. Results: Aerobic training improved autonomic balance despite the continued smoking. In the time domain, rMSSD and pNN50 were significantly increased in HAT than in CG. On spectral analysis, the absolute and normalized units of high frequency (HF) were significantly increased in HAT, whereas the LF/HF ratio and the normalized unit of LF were significantly decreased compared to that in CG. SD1 and the SD1/SD2 ratio of the Poincar? plot analysis were significantly increased compared to CG. Although MAT showed a similar tendency to HAT in nonlinear indexes, there were no significant differences compared to CG. Conclusion: Aerobic training, particularly high-intensity training, increases the parasympathetic contribution to the sympathovagal system, leading to an improvement in autonomic balance despite continued cigarette smoking. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",aerobic training; autonomic imbalance; cigarette smoking; heart rate variability,adult; aerobic exercise; Article; cardiac autonomic regulation; cardiorespiratory fitness; controlled study; exercise intensity; heart rate; heart rate reserve; heart rate variability; human; male; neuromodulation; outcome assessment; parasympathetic tone; priority journal; smoking; smoking cessation; smoking habit; sympathetic tone; treadmill exercise; electrocardiography; exercise; exercise test; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; randomized controlled trial; smoking; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Electrocardiography; Exercise Test; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Physical Exertion; Smoking; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85014000666

We previously reported that a 70% ethanol extract of Elaeocarpus sylvestris leaves (ESE) inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication in vitro. In the present study, we determined the solvent fraction of ESE that inhibits HCMV replication using activity-guided fractionation. Methods: Activity-guided fractionation of ESE was performed to determine the solvent fraction that inhibits HCMV replication. Effects of solvent fractions on HCMV lytic gene expression and major immediate-early (MIE) enhancer/promoter activity were further investigated. Results: Among the solvent fractions tested, the EtOAc fraction of ESE markedly reduced HCMV lytic gene expression and viral replication in vitro without exerting significant cytotoxic effects against human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF). Furthermore, the EtOAc fraction negatively affected HCMV MIE enhancer/promoter activity. Conclusion: Our data collectively indicate that the EtOAc fraction of ESE contains active constituents that inhibit HCMV MIE enhancer/promoter activity and viral replication. The EtOAc fraction of ESE is a good source of novel drug candidates for treatment of HCMV-associated diseases. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Antiviral; Elaeocarpus sylvestris; Human cytomegalovirus,"acetic acid ethyl ester; Elaeocarpus sylvestris extract; plant extract; solvent; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; plant extract; viral protein; Article; drug cytotoxicity; drug determination; Elaeocarpus sylvestris; enhancer region; gene expression; human; human cell; Human cytomegalovirus; immediate early gene; in vitro study; medicinal plant; nonhuman; promoter region; skin fibroblast; virus inhibition; virus replication; chemistry; Cytomegalovirus; cytomegalovirus infection; drug effects; Elaeocarpaceae; genetics; immediate early gene; isolation and purification; metabolism; physiology; virology; virus replication; Antiviral Agents; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Elaeocarpaceae; Genes, Immediate-Early; Humans; Plant Extracts; Viral Proteins; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-85028448645

We aimed to determine the clinical relevance of a newly developed equation to estimate serum apoB levels based on total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in patients with high cardiovascular risk. Methods: The occurrence of a major cardiovascular event (MCVE) was assessed using the data from the Treating to New Targets (TNT) and Incremental Decrease in End points through Aggressive Lipid lowering (IDEAL) trials. Results: Pooled analysis of these two data sets showed that both directly-measured apoB (HR per 1-SD (95% CI): 1.16 (1.11-1.21), P < 0.001) and apoB estimated from the eq.

Varieties of technologies for detecting DNA methylation have been developed, but they are not sufficiently sensitive for use in diagnostic devices. The aim of this study was to determine the suitability of Raman spectroscopy for label?free detection of methylated DNA. Methods: The methylated promoter regions of cancer?related genes cadherin 1 (CDH1) and retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB) served as target DNA sequences. Based on bisulfite conversion, oligonucleotides of methylated or nonmethylated probes and targets were synthesized for the DNA methylation assay. Principal component analysis with linear discriminant analysis (PCA?DA) was used to discriminate the hybridization between probes and targets (methylated probe and methylated target or nonmethylated probe and nonmethylated target) of CDH1 and RARB from nonhybridization between the probe and targets (methylated probe and nonmethylated target or nonmethylated probe and methylated target). Results: This study revealed that the CDH1 and RARB oligo sets and their hybridization data could be classified using PCA?DA. The classification results for CDH1 methylated probe + CDH1 methylated target versus CDH1 methylated probe + CDH1 unmethylated target showed sensitivity, specificity, and error rates of 92%, 100%, and 8%, respectively. The classification results for the RARB methylated probe + RARB methylated target versus RARB methylated probe + RARB unmethylated target showed sensitivity, specificity, and error rates of 92%, 93%, and 11%, respectively.

Hypothesis Although KA was reported to suppress inflammation by activating Nrf2, the anti-inflammatory function of KA is less characterized. Given the complex nature of the inflammatory response and the critical role of TGF-β in resolving inflammation, we hypothesized that KA suppresses inflammatory response by activating TGF-β signaling. Methods Murine macrophage RAW 264.7, human lung epithelial cell MRC-5, and a TGFβRII defective cell HCT116 were treated with various amounts of KA. KA was also administered to mouse lung via intratracheal (i.t.) route. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 were analyzed by western blot. TGFβ-dependent gene expression was determined by immunoblotting of α-SMA and luciferase assay. Results KA induced the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, key activator molecules in TGF-β signaling. EW7197, an inhibitor for activin receptor-like kinase 5/TGF-β receptor I (TGFβR1) suppressed KA-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2. Similarly, KA failed to phosphorylate Smad2 in HCT116, suggesting that KA acts through the prototypic TGFβR. KA treatment increased the transcriptional activity driven by a Smad-binding element in a luciferase reporter assay and induced the α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Similarly, i.t. KA induced the phosphorylation of Smad2 and increased the expression of?α-SMA in mouse lungs.

We were to investigate associations of interarm systolic blood pressure (SBP) difference with heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise, an index of autonomic function, and carotid atherosclerotic markers, and to evaluate the association of interarm SBP difference with concurrent coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods A total of 995 consecutive patients who underwent treadmill stress echocardiography with chest pain but no history of CAD were enrolled. Interarm SBP difference, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque were measured before exercise, and HRR 2?min following exercise was assessed. Suspected CAD was defined as newly developed wall motion abnormalities after treadmill exercise. Results Patients with an interarm SBP difference???10?mm?Hg had higher prevalence of hypertension, increased right and left SBP, right diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, body mass index and carotid IMT, existent carotid plaque, lower metabolic equivalents and slower HRR. Interarm SBP difference???10?mm?Hg was independently associated with slower HRR and existent carotid plaque. Suspected CAD was associated with existent carotid plaque or slower HRR, but not with an interarm SBP difference???10?mm?Hg. Conclusions Increased interarm SBP difference was associated with lower autonomic modulation and carotid atherosclerosis in patients with chest pain and no history of CAD, but not with suspected CAD. Observed adverse prognosis in patients with increased interarm BP difference might result from long-term persistent autonomic dysfunction and atherosclerosis. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Carotid intima-media thickness; Carotid plaque; Heart rate recovery; Interarm blood pressure difference,"adult; arterial wall thickness; Article; autonomic dysfunction; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure variability; body mass; carotid atherosclerosis; comorbidity; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; exercise; female; heart rate; heart rate recovery; heart ventricle wall motion; human; hypertension; interarm blood pressure difference; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; medical history; metabolic equivalent; neuromodulation; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; stress echocardiography; systolic blood pressure; thorax pain; treadmill exercise; aged; arm; autonomic nervous system; blood pressure; carotid artery disease; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; thorax pain; vascularization; Aged; Arm; Autonomic Nervous System; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Carotid Artery Diseases; Chest Pain; Coronary Artery Disease; Echocardiography, Stress; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged",2-s2.0-85016396304

However, some studies show that this benefit is uncertain in patients with renal dysfunction, and the role of statins is based on the severity of renal dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the impact of statin therapy on major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and all-cause mortality in patients with advanced renal dysfunction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after AMI. Methods: This study was based on the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry database. We included 861 patients with advanced renal dysfunction from among 33,205 patients who underwent PCI after AMI between November 2005 and July 2012. Patients were divided into two groups: a statin group (n = 537) and a no-statin group (n = 324). We investigated the 12-month MACEs (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, repeated PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting) and all-cause mortality of each group. Subsequently, a propensity score-matched analysis was performed. Results: In the total population studied, no significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the rate of recurrent MI, repeated PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or all-cause mortality. However, the cardiac death rate was significantly lower in the statin group (p = 0.009). Propensity score-matched analysis yielded 274 pairs demonstrating, results similar to those obtained from the total population. However, there was no significant difference in the cardiac death rate in the propensity score-matched population (p = 0.103). Cox-regression analysis revealed only left ventricular ejection fraction to be an independent predictor of 12-month MACEs (Hazard ratio [HR] of 0.979, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0962–0.996, p = 0.018). Conclusions: Statin therapy was not significantly associated with a reduction in the 12-month MACEs or all-cause mortality in patients with advanced renal dysfunction undergoing PCI after AMI. ? 2017 Kim et al.

A number of external stimuli promote migration of MSCs into peripheral blood and support their participation in wound healing. In an attempt to harness the potential beneficial effects of such external stimuli, we exposed human MSCs (hMSCs) to one such stimulus—low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR)—and examined their biological properties. To this end, we evaluated differences in proliferation, cell cycle, DNA damage, expression of surface markers (CD29, CD34, CD90, and CD105), and differentiation potential of hMSCs before and after irradiation with γ-rays generated using a 137CS irradiator. At doses less than 50?mGy, LDIR had no significant effect on the viability or apoptosis of hMSCs. Interestingly, 10?mGy of LDIR increased hMSC viability by 8% (p?&lt;?0.001) compared with non-irradiated hMSCs. At doses less than 50?mGy, LDIR did not induce DNA damage, including DNA strand breaks, or cause cellular senescence or cell-cycle arrest. Surface marker expression and in vitro differentiation potential of hMSCs were maintained after two exposures to LDIR at 10?mGy per dose. In conclusion, a two-dose exposure to LDIR at 10?mGy per dose not only facilitates proliferation of hMSCs, it also maintains the stem cell characteristics of hMSCs without affecting their viability. These results provide evidence for the potential of LDIR as an external stimulus for in vitro expansion of hMSCs and application in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. ? 2017, The Korean Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Differentiation; DNA damages; Human mesenchymal stem cells; Low dose ionizing radiation; Proliferation,Cell death; Cells; Cytology; Differentiation (calculus); DNA; Flowcharting; Gamma rays; Ionizing radiation; Radiation effects; Radiation shielding; Stem cells; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Tissue regeneration; Biological properties; Cellular senescence; DNA damages; Human mesenchymal stem cells; Low dose; Mesenchymal stem cell; Proliferation; Regenerative medicine; Cell culture; beta1 integrin; CD34 antigen; cesium 137; DNA; endoglin; gamma histone H2AX; histone H2AX; Thy 1 antigen; unclassified drug; apoptosis; Article; cell aging; cell cycle arrest; cell proliferation; cell stimulation; cell structure; cell viability; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA damage response; DNA strand breakage; flow cytometry; gamma irradiation; human; human cell; immunofluorescence test; in vitro study; ionizing radiation; mesenchymal stem cell; nuclear size; priority journal; protein expression; radiation dose; radiation exposure; regenerative medicine; tissue engineering,2-s2.0-85026749247

In traditional East-Asian medicine, moxibustion is often used as a non-drug treatment for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion therapy to treat IPD. Methods The following electronic databases were searched for studies published in or before December 2016: Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, OASIS (Korean database), and CNKI (Chinese database). Two researchers conducted the data extraction and risk of bias assessments. Results From the results, a total of 10 studies (644 IPD patients) were included in this review. Overall methodological quality was not high and all studies included small numbers of participants which could not ensure the rigor of the synthesized evidence. There was a considerable clinical heterogeneity in terms of patient's population, moxibustion types and control group interventions. Compared with control group, moxibustion did not show significant difference in the overall effectiveness ratio (RR 1.20, 95% CI [1.00, 1.44]). About the total unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) score, however, there was significant difference between moxibustion and control interventions (MD ?8.75, 95% CI [?12.54, ?4.95]). Adverse events related to moxibustion treatment were not reported in most of the studies. Conclusions Evidence on the benefit and harm of moxibustion therapy for IPD was not conclusive due to methodological problems and small sample sizes among the included studies.

In 2015, with multiple socio-economic and medical support initiatives for MCF being available, we analyzed the statistics for several factors related to birth, to determine whether there are significant adverse birth outcomes in MCF. We analyzed the birth data of MCFs in 2015, from Statistics Korea. This study compared the birth data of MCF and Korean families (KF) by geography, neonatal birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA), birth order of the neonates, place of delivery, cohabitation period of parents before the first child, and parental education level. The distribution of BW and the prevalence of low BW (< 2,500 g) or very low BW (< 1,500 g) were similar between both groups. The incidence of preterm birth was lower in the MCF group (6.5% vs. 7.0%, P = 0.015) than in the KF group. In the MCF group, parental education level was lower, and incidence of out-ofhospital births was higher than that of the KF group. Adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm birth and low BW in MCF are similar or better than KF.

In Korea, there is a strong interest in the standardization of Traditional Medicine (TM). In order to standardize TM treatment, standardization of SD should be given priority. The aim of this study was to explore the SD, or symptom clusters, of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) using non-negative factorization methods and k-means clustering analysis. We screened 80 patients and enrolled 73 eligible patients. One TM dermatologist evaluated the symptoms/signs using an existing clinical dataset from patients with AD. This dataset was designed to collect 15 dermatologic and 18 systemic symptoms/signs associated with AD. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to decompose the original data into a matrix with three features and a weight matrix. The point of intersection of the three coordinates from each patient was placed in three-dimensional space. With five clusters, the silhouette score reached 0.484, and this was the best silhouette score obtained from two to nine clusters. Patients were clustered according to the varying severity of concurrent symptoms/signs. Through the distribution of the null hypothesis generated by 10,000 permutation tests, we found significant cluster-specific symptoms/signs from the confidence intervals in the upper and lower 2.5% of the distribution. Patients in each cluster showed differences in symptoms/signs and severity. In a clinical situation, SD and treatment are based on the practitioners' observations and clinical experience. SD, identified through informatics, can contribute to development of standardized, objective, and consistent SD for each disease. ? 2017",atopic; Cluster analysis; Dermatitis; k-means cluster analysis; non-negative matrix factorization; Syndrome differentiation,"Cluster analysis; Dermatitis; Diagnosis; Matrix algebra; Standardization; atopic; K-means cluster analysis; K-means clustering analysis; Non-negative factorization; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Point of intersections; Syndrome differentiations; Three dimensional space; Factorization; adolescent; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; chill; clinical feature; cluster analysis; cold; dermatologist; disease severity; erythema; exudate; female; fever; human; hyperhidrosis; insomnia; major clinical study; male; priority journal; pruritus; sleep disorder; standardization; symptomatology; syndrome differentiation; traditional medicine; algorithm; atopic dermatitis; pathophysiology; preschool child; South Korea; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Republic of Korea; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85019590963

The survey was carried out in five countries (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico and Brazil) between November and December 2015 using a standard market research methodology. Questionnaires were completed by patients with male AGA or hair loss/thinning and practicing physicians who were responsible for prescribing AGA treatment. In total, 835 patients and 338 physicians completed the questionnaire. Overall, 37.6% of patients reported satisfaction with the treatments they had used. The highest patient satisfaction was reported for 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (53.9% of patients satisfied). In all countries, physicians were more likely than patients to think that male AGA has a major impact on patient confidence (89.3% vs 70.4%, respectively). There was agreement by physicians and patients that male AGA patients who are involved in their treatment decisions have better outcomes. Patients who were satisfied with AGA treatments were more likely to have the level of involvement they desired in treatment decisions (69.1% of satisfied patients) than dissatisfied patients (56.4% of dissatisfied patients). This survey provides valuable insights into the attitudes of patients and physicians in Asia and Latin America about male AGA and its treatments. The survey identified areas of disconnect between physicians and patients regarding the impact of male AGA, treatment consultations and the importance of treatment attributes. It also highlights the need for physicians to spend sufficient time with patients discussing AGA treatment approaches. ? 2017 GlaxoSmithKline.

Cell viability and the levels of c-fos and c-Jun were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Western blot analysis, respectively, to further confirm the anti-cancer effect of SC extract. Results: SC extract increased the expressions of ER-α and -β (P<0.001), whereas cell viability and the expressions of growth factors (c-fos and c-Jun) were inhibited (P< and <0.001, respectively) following treatment. Conclusions: SC extract has phytoestrogenic effects, and its biological action includes ER binding ability with low cancer risk.

The expression of the mature rhBMP-4 was significantly enhanced by recombinant furin expression. The combination of a chemically defined medium and a nutrient supplement solution for high expression of rhBMP-4 was selected and used for bioreactor cultures. The 11-day fed-batch cultures of the established rhBMP-4-expressing rCHO cells in the 7.5-L bioreactor produced approximately 32 mg/l of rhBMP-4.

However, the benefit of statin therapy in patients with baseline LDL-C levels ? 50 mg/dl is less clear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who have baseline LDL-C levels ? 50 mg/dl would benefit from statin therapy in real-world clinical practice. We analyzed the clinical data of 1,048 patients (67.3 ± 12.6 years, 69.6% men) with AMI, who had baseline LDL-C levels ? 50 mg/dl from the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry data between November 2005 and May 2014. They were divided into 2 groups based on whether they were prescribed statins or not at discharge (statin and nonstatin group, n = 738 and 310, respectively). The primary end point was the major adverse cardiac event (MACE), defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, and repeated percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. MACE occurred in 9.2% of the statin group versus 19.6% in the nonstatin group during the 12-month follow-up. Statin therapy significantly reduced the risk of MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94, p = 0.025) and coronary artery bypass grafting (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.96, p = 0.043). There was a trend of reduced cardiac death in the statin group compared with the nonstatin group (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.02, p = 0.059). Statin therapy for patients with AMI with LDL-C levels ? 50 mg/dl was associated with improved outcomes.

On the day of discharge, follow-up heart rate variability, routine blood tests, cardiac biomarkers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level, and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) level will be assessed. Four weeks after discharge, hs-CRP, NT-pro BNP, heart failure symptoms, quality of life, and a pattern identification questionnaire will be used for follow-up analysis. Six months after discharge, major cardiac adverse events and cardiac function measured by echocardiography will be assessed. Adverse events will be recorded during every visit. Discussion: The result of this clinical trial will offer evidence of the effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture for acute decompensated heart failure.

The skin-fat-muscle structure in the human abdomen resembles that of the Salisbury screen, which consists of a resistive sheet, a dielectric slab, and a conducting plane. Using this similarity, the authors can estimate the degree of obesity based on the reflectivity of electromagnetic waves. The Salisbury screen acts as a wave absorber when the thickness of the dielectric matches the quarter wavelength. This characteristic is similar to the human abdominal structure. Fat, which has much lower conductivity than skin or muscle, plays the role of the dielectric in the Salisbury screen. Therefore, by measuring the frequency where reflection is minimised, fat thickness can be estimated. ?

PDGFRs are cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors, and are involved in several aspects of tooth development. The purpose of this study was to identify causative genes of familial supernumerary teeth and the molecular pathogenesis of tooth number abnormalities through genetic analysis of a family that showed supernumerary premolars in two successive generations. Material and methods: We recruited a Korean family with supernumerary premolars and performed mutational analyses to identify the underlying molecular genetic aetiology. Results: Targeted exome sequencing identified a missense mutation in PDGFRB (c.C2053T, p.R685C). Sanger sequencing confirmed that three affected individuals in the patient’s family were heterozygous for the mutation. Conclusions: This is the first report of a Korean family that carries a PDGFRB mutation potentially responsible for supernumerary premolars.

Methods: Seventy-two eyes with anterior corneal astigmatism less than 2.50 diopters (D) were evaluated. The distance between the incision wound and the corneal apex was measured using the Pentacam (Oculus Optikger?te, Wetzlar, Germany) Scheimpflug image and the Image J program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Patients were subgrouped into the inner incision distance close (less than 4,816.44 μm) and far (4,816.44 μm or greater) groups based on the median value of inner incision distance and the outer incision distance close (less than 6,131.77 μm) and far (6,131.77 μm or greater) groups based on the median value of outer incision distance. Results: In the inner incision distance group, the mean change in anterior, posterior, and total corneal astigmatism at 1 week and anterior astigmatism at 1 month were statistically significantly greater in the inner incision close group than in the inner incision far group. In the outer incision distance group, the mean change in anterior corneal astigmatism at 1 week was statistically significantly greater in the close group than in the far group. Surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) of the posterior cornea showed a statistically significant increase in the inner incision close group compared to the inner incision far group 1 month postoperatively, whereas there were no significant differences in the outer incision distance groups. Inner incision distance significantly correlated with the mean change in anterior and posterior corneal astigmatism and posterior SIA at 1 week postoperatively. Conclusions: Corneal astigmatism was affected more by inner incision distance than outer incision distance, and a larger change in the posterior SIA was noted with decreasing inner incision distance. During cataract surgery, the position of the inner corneal incision should be considered rather than the outer incision.

In the present study, we examined the protective effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SM) on oral mucositis induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in human pharyngeal cells and golden Syrian hamsters. We investigated the proliferation and antioxidant abilities of SM using MTT, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays in vitro. Additionally, TUNEL assay was performed, and the expression levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), caspase-3 and proinflammatory cytokines were assessed by immunoblotting. The results showed that SM increased the cell proliferation rate in human pharyngeal cells up to 128.97±9.7% compared with this rate in the untreated cells and exerted protective effects on mucosal injury caused by 5-FU treatment. In addition, all concentrations of SM increased DPPH scavenging ability and blocked ROS generation in the treated cells. Taken together, following SM treatment, expression of NF-κB and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly decreased followed by inhibition of cell death.

In this context, we have evaluated the cumulative risk of high-risk adenoma (HRA) or colorectal cancer (CRC) according to surveillance interval time after polypectomy. In addition, we assessed risk factors for late surveillance to determine whether late surveillance can impact the risk of subsequent advanced colorectal neoplasm. Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study involving 3562 subjects who had undergone removal of at least one adenoma at the index colonoscopy and who subsequently underwent a surveillance colonoscopy. The subjects were classified into an early, appropriate or late group depending on the timing of the surveillance colonoscopy, performed using modified U.S. guidelines. Results: With 3% of the study population with LRA and HRA at the index colonoscopy going on to develop HRA or CRC, the estimated surveillance intervals calculated would be 6.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.42–7.10] years and 3.1 (95% CI 2.61–4.45) years, respectively. The predictors of late surveillance were female gender [odd ratio (OR)?1.21; 95% CI 1.04–1.40], having undergone the procedure in small-to-medium-sized cities (OR?1.92; 95% CI 1.36–2.72) and HRA at index colonoscopy (OR?1.37; 95% CI 1.19–1.59). The risk factors for subsequent HRA or CRC were late surveillance (OR?1.34; 95% CI 1.03–1.74), male gender (OR?2.13; 95% CI 1.54–2.95), having undergone the procedure in small-to-medium-sized cities (OR?1.63; 95% CI 1.11–2.40) and HRA at index colonoscopy (OR?2.60; 95% CI 2.04–3.33). Conclusions: Women, having undergone the procedure in small-to-medium-sized cities and the presence of an HRA at the index colonoscopy were found to be independent risk factors for late surveillance colonoscopy.

Protocol 1 was a crossover study to investigate the effect of EA on IR-induced endothelial dysfunction. Twenty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to EA or sham EA (sham). Flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery (BA), nitroglycerin-mediated endothelial independent dilation, blood pressure before and after IR were measured. In protocol 2, seven volunteers were administered COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg orally twice daily) for five days. After consumption, volunteers underwent FMD before and after IR identical to protocol 1. Results: In protocol 1, baseline BA diameter, Pre-IR BA diameter and FMD were similar between the two groups (p = NS). After IR, sham group showed significantly blunted FMD (Pre-IR: 11.41 ± 3.10%, Post-IR: 4.49 ± 2.04%, p < 0.001). However, EA protected this blunted FMD (Pre-IR: 10.96 ± 5.30%, Post-IR: 9.47 ± 5.23%, p = NS, p < 0.05 compared with sham EA after IR). In protocol 2, this protective effect was completely abolished by pre-treatment with celecoxib (Pre-IR: 11.05 ± 3.27%; Post-IR: 4.20 ± 1.68%, p = 0.001). Conclusion: EA may prevent IR-induced endothelial dysfunction via a COX-2 dependent mechanism. ? 2017 Lee et al.

Methods Eight databases were searched up to January 2017 for randomised controlled trials of herbal medicine as an adjunct to conventional medication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Data were extracted to obtain risk ratio (RR) of failure of inducing or maintaining remission, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane criteria. Results Twenty-nine RCTs (24 UC, 5 CD) were included. In UC, herbal medicine was superior to placebo for clinical remission (RR of remission failure?=?0.74, 95% CI: 0.59–0.93; I2?=?62%) and maintaining remission (RR of failure to maintain remission?=?0.34, 95% CI: 0.17–0.67; I2?=?0%). Traditional Chinese patent medicine with standard therapy reduced the risk of no comprehensive remission by 19% compared to standard therapy alone (RR of no remission?=?0.81, 95% CI: 0.70–0.95; I2?=?0%). In CD, however, the effect of herbal medicine was significant neither for inducing nor maintaining remission (RR of remission failure?=?0.57, 95% CI: 0.24–1.33; I2?=?87%; RR of failure to maintain remission?=?0.95, 95% CI: 0.60–1.52). Few serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions An adjunctive herbal medicine compared to standard therapy appears effective with few adverse events in achieving and maintaining remission in UC, while there is a lack of supporting evidence for CD. Future high quality trials are warranted. ? 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Crohn's disease; Herbal medicine; Inflammatory bowel disease; Systematic review; Ulcerative colitis,Chinese drug; herbaceous agent; abdominal pain; Chinese medicine; constipation; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; gastrointestinal symptom; herbal medicine; human; inflammatory bowel disease; meta analysis; nausea; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); remission; Review; systematic review; treatment failure; treatment outcome; vomiting,2-s2.0-85019924141

Patients had received continuous maximal androgen blockade (MAB) or monotherapy [luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or orchiectomy] following the reaching of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir. The medical records of 293 patients who received MAB following a diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Following attainment of the PSA nadir and treatment with MAB, patients were maintained on continuous MAB (group CMAB) or converted to monotherapy (group MONO). Disease progression, defined as progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer, was evaluated and compared between the treatment modalities. PFS was compared between patients who received CMAB vs. MONO using 2:1 (102:53) propensity score matching; the basic clinicopathological characteristics (age, Gleason score, PSA and extent of bone metastasis) were similar between the groups. Disease progression was observed in 70.9% of all patients, with a median treatment period of 22.7 months. The median PFS time was 19.5 months in the CMAB group and 28.8 months in the MONO group (P=0.008). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that PFS was significantly associated with the type of maintenance androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; log rank <0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that the type of maintenance ADT and the pretreatment extent of bone metastasis were independent predictors of prolonged PFS. In this propensity score matched-analysis, conversion to monotherapy with a LHRH agonist or orchiectomy following attainment of the PSA nadir with initial MAB, prolonged the PFS, suggesting that monotherapy maintenance following initial MAB may benefit patients by reducing side effects without decreasing treatment efficacy. ? 2017, Spandidos Publications.

Since studies have validated an increased level of CXCL12 and its receptor in patients with colorectal cancers, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis has been considered as a valuable marker of cancer metastasis. Therefore, identification of CXCR4 inhibitors has great potential to abrogate tumor metastasis. Onbaekwon (OBW) is a complex herbal formula that is derived from the literature of traditional Korean medicine Dongeuibogam. In this study, we demonstrated that OBW suppressed CXCR4 expression in various cancer cell types in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Both proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors had no effect to prevent the OBW-induced suppression of CXCR4, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of OBW was not due to proteolytic degradation but occurred at the transcriptional level. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay further confirmed that OBW could block endogenous activation of nuclear factor kappa B, a key transcription factor that regulates the expression of CXCR4 in colon cancer cells. Consistent with the aforementioned molecular basis, OBW abolished cell invasion induced by CXCL12 in colon cancer cells. Together, our results suggest that OBW, as a novel inhibitor of CXCR4, could be a promising therapeutic agent contributing to cancer treatment. ?

Materials and methods Between February 2013 and September 2015, data were gathered prospectively from 180 consecutive patients who underwent partial nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy at 3 institutions, and 161 were enrolled. Evaluated factors included age and sex; histologic factors such as tumor diameter, stage, tumor subtype, necrosis, and Fuhrman grade; and clinical factors such as RENAL score; and completeness of PC. Results Only 94 tumors (58.4%) were surrounded by a continuous PC completely, 62 (38.5%) were partially surrounded, and 5 (3.1%) had no PC. Overall, 56 PCs (34.8%) were free from invasion, 58 PCs (36.0%) had partial invasion of PC without parenchymal invasion, and 47 PCs (29.2%) had parenchymal invasion. Defining parenchymal invasion as true pseudocapsular invasion, histologic diameter, RCC subtype, and completeness of PC were significant predictors for parenchymal invasion on multivariate analysis (P = 0.006, 0.046, and 0.002, respectively). Conclusions Rate of complete PC in RCC is relatively low in this study. The risk factors for pseudocapsular invasion were a histologic diameter greater than 4?cm, non–clear cell histology, and an incomplete PC. Surgeons must prepare for the possibility of a positive surgical margin if a tumor has at least one of these risk factors. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Kidney neoplasms; Partial nephrectomy; Pseudocapsule,"adult; Article; cancer size; cancer staging; cancer surgery; female; human; kidney carcinoma; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; partial nephrectomy; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; prospective study; pseudocapsule; radical nephrectomy; risk factor; tumor invasion; tumor necrosis; x-ray computed tomography; aged; clinical trial; kidney tumor; middle aged; nephrectomy; pathology; procedures; renal cell carcinoma; Aged; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Female; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Nephrectomy; Prospective Studies",2-s2.0-85011928368

The traditional concept of ""In-Sul"" (benevolent art) and the modern history of South Korea have led to cultural differences between South Korea and other countries in conceptualizing medical professionalism; thus, we studied medical students' perceptions of professionalism as described in essays written on this topic. Methods: In 2014, we asked 109 first-year medical students who were enrolled in a compulsory ethics course to anonymously write a description of an instance of medical professionalism that they had witnessed, as well as reflecting on their own professional context. We then processed 105 valid essays using thematic content analysis with computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. Results: Thematic analysis of the students' essays revealed two core aspects of professionalism in South Korea, one focused on respect for patients and the other on physicians' accountability. The most common theme regarding physician-patient relationships was trust. By contrast, distributive justice was thought to be a non-essential aspect of professionalism. Conclusions: In Western countries, physicians tend to promote justice in the health care system, including fair distribution of medical resources; however, we found that medical students in South Korea were more inclined to emphasize doctors' relationships with patients. Medical educators should develop curricular interventions regarding medical professionalism to meet the legitimate needs of patients in their own culture. Because professionalism is a dynamic construct of culture, medical educators should reaffirm cultural context-specific definitions of professionalism for development of associated curricula. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Cultural differences; Curriculum development; Korea; Medical education; Medical students; Professionalism,"content analysis; curriculum development; data analysis software; doctor patient relation; ethics; health care system; human; human experiment; justice; medical education; medical student; perception; professionalism; South Korea; thematic analysis; thinking; trust; adult; cultural anthropology; female; male; medical education; qualitative research; social justice; South Korea; writing; young adult; Adult; Culture; Education, Medical; Female; Humans; Male; Professionalism; Qualitative Research; Republic of Korea; Social Justice; Students, Medical; Writing; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85018992498

Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients who received intravenous rtPA administration. SBPs at the time of rtPA bolus and thereafter every hour were collected. The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation values of SBP during the periods of 0-2 h, 2-6 h, and 6-12 h were calculated. The primary outcome was major neurologic improvement (MNI) at 24 hours after thrombolysis. Results: Serial measures of SBPs revealed different 12-hour courses between the patients with and without MNI. The difference of SBP tendency was statistically significant (p=0.013). In univariate analysis, patients with MNI showed lower levels of mean SBPs during the periods of 2-6 h and 6-12 h (p=0.030 and p=0.005, respectively), and higher frequency of very early neurologic improvement (VENI) at the end of rtPA infusion (p<0.001).

Recently, a novel species of Weissella, W. jogaejeotgali FOL01T (= KCCM 43128 = JCM 30580), was isolated from Korean fermentedT clams. To determine the genomic features of this new species, its genome was completely sequenced and analyzed. The genome consists of a circular chromosome of 2,114,163 bp of DNA with a G+C content of 38.8%, and the plasmid pFOL01 consists of 35,382 bp of DNA with a G+C content of 39.1%. The genome analysis showed its potential for use in food fermentation and osmotic stress resistance abilities for processing in food industries. In addition, this strain was predicted to have acid tolerance and adhesion to the mucosal layer for survival and colonization in the gut. Subsequent experiments substantiated these abilities, suggesting that W. jogaejeotgali may have probiotic potential and a high survival rate during food fermentation. Therefore, it may be suitable as a novel probiotic strain for various applications in food industries. ? 2017 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.",High-salt fermented food; Lactic acid bacteria; Probiotics; Weissella jogaejeotgali,"bacterial DNA; bacterial DNA; bacterial RNA; mucin; probiotic agent; acid tolerance; Article; bacterial chromosome; bacterial colonization; bacterial genome; bacterial survival; bacterium adherence; controlled study; DNA content; fermentation; food industry; gene sequence; genome analysis; nonhuman; osmotic stress; plasmid; Weissella; Weissella jogaejeotgali; analysis; bacterium identification; DNA base composition; DNA sequence; food control; food industry; genetics; human; nucleotide sequence; osmotic pressure; pH; physiological stress; physiology; South Korea; Weissella; Bacterial Adhesion; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Base Composition; Base Sequence; DNA, Bacterial; Fermentation; Food Industry; Food Microbiology; Genome, Bacterial; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mucins; Osmotic Pressure; Plasmids; Probiotics; Republic of Korea; RNA, Bacterial; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Stress, Physiological; Weissella",2-s2.0-85019737556

In the central nervous system, polarized oligodendrocytes form myelin by wrapping processes in a spiral pattern around neuronal axons through myelin-related gene regulation. Since these events occur at a distance from the cell body, post-transcriptional control of gene expression has strategic advantage to fine-tune the overall regulation of protein contents in situ. Therefore, many research interests have been focused to identify RNA binding proteins and their regulatory mechanism in myelinating compartments. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is one such RNA binding protein, regulating its target expression by translational control. Although the majority of works on FMRP have been performed in neurons, it is also found in the developing or mature glial cells including oligodendrocytes, where its function is not well understood. Here, we will review evidences suggesting abnormal translational regulation of myelin proteins with accompanying white matter problem and neurological deficits in fragile X syndrome, which can have wider mechanistic and pathological implication in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders. ? 2017 The Korean Society of Applied Pharmacology.",Fragile X mental retardation protein; Myelin; Oligodendrocyte; Translational control,fragile X mental retardation protein; messenger RNA; myelin; myelin protein; RNA binding protein; transcription factor; cell polarity; fragile X syndrome; gene control; gene expression regulation; gene targeting; glia cell; human; mental disease; molecular pathology; myelination; nerve cell differentiation; neurologic disease; nonhuman; oligodendroglia; perikaryon; protein content; protein function; protein protein interaction; Review; translation regulation,2-s2.0-85019044774

Identification of the factors contributing to changes in willingness to quit smoking may aid the development of strategies that encourage smoking cessation. Pooled cross-sectional data from 11,924 smokers from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II-V were analyzed. The stages of change in smoking cessation were categorized as pre-contemplation, contemplation, and preparation. Baseline characteristics, socioeconomic factors, quality of life, psychological status, and smoking-related factors were compared between groups. The smokers were grouped as follows: 32.4% pre-contemplation, 54.4% contemplation, and 13.1% preparation. The proportion of smokers in the pre-contemplation group decreased (from 37.4% to 28.4%) from 2001 to 2012, while the proportion in the preparation group increased (from 6.4% to 18.1%). Compared with the preparation group, after adjusting for confounding factors, the pre-contemplation group was older [>65 years-old; odds ratio (OR) = 1.40], more often single (OR = 1.38), less educated (elementary school or lower; OR = 1.93), less physically active in terms of walking (OR = 1.38) or performing strengthening exercises (OR = 1.61), smoked more heavily (>20 cigarettes per day; OR = 4.75), and had a lower prevalence of chronic disease (OR = 0.76). Moreover, smokers who had never received education on smoking cessation were less willing to quit than those who had (OR = 0.44). In Korean smokers, the stages of change for smoking cessation were associated with age, education, marital status, chronic diseases, physical activity, and participation in smoking cessation programs. ? 2017 Leem et al.

However, its cost-effectiveness remains unclear. Understanding the relationship between risk factors and AAA is important to maximize the benefit of AAA screening. However, risk factors for AAA have not been reported in Korea. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for, AAA among the Korean population. Methods The study population consisted of patients >50?years of age who consented for AAA screening. Screening was performed as follows for all participants: collection of demographic information, including risk factors, physical examination, and ultrasound screening. We measured the maximal diameter of the aorta from the outer to outer layer at 5 levels: suprarenal, renal, and infrarenal aorta, and bilateral common iliac arteries. AAA was defined as maximal aortic diameter >3?cm. The risk factors and risk ratio for AAA were determined. Chi-square test and a logistic regression model were used for statistical analysis. All P-values <0.05 were considered significant. Results A total of 2,035 participants were enrolled. Among them, 908 (44.6%) were men and 1,127 (55.4%) were women. Mean age was 66.9?±?10.3 years (range 23–95). AAA was detected in 18 of 908 (2.0%) men and 4 of 1,127 (0.4%) women. The presence of an AAA was significantly correlated with male sex (P?<?0.001), advanced age (P?=?0.01), smoking (P?<?0.001), alcohol consumption (P?<?0.01), and the presence of pulmonary disease (P?=?0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that smoking was the only significant risk factor for AAA. Conclusions The prevalence of AAA was 2.0% in men and 0.4% in women. Male sex, old age, smoking, alcohol use, and pulmonary disease are possible risk factors for AAA in the general Korean population. Smoking is the strongest risk factor for the development of AAA. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"antihypertensive agent; abdominal aorta aneurysm; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; antihypertensive therapy; aorta; Article; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; coronary artery disease; demography; diabetes mellitus; end stage renal disease; female; groups by age; hemodialysis; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; iliac artery; ischemic heart disease; kidney artery; Korean (people); lung disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; physical examination; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; sex difference; smoking; transient ischemic attack; ultrasound; very elderly; abdominal aorta; abdominal aortic aneurysm; age; chi square distribution; comorbidity; diagnostic imaging; drinking behavior; echography; lesions and defects; lung disease; mass screening; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; predictive value; procedures; South Korea; statistical model; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcohol Drinking; Aorta, Abdominal; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal; Chi-Square Distribution; Comorbidity; Dilatation, Pathologic; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Lung Diseases; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Smoking; Ultrasonography; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85015745103

During adipogenesis interactions with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma are mainly responsible for the development of obesity with regulation of the various transcription factors. It causes the increase of lipid accumulation, triglyceride content as well as reactive oxygen species production in adipocyte differentiation. Current drugs used as anti-obesity associated with several side effects. The present study was therefore conducted, to evaluate the protective and inhibitory effect of ginsenoside F1 from Panax ginseng on lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen species production by an in silico and in vitro study using 3T3-L1 cells. The structures of F1 compound has been obtained from own in-house Panax ginseng saponin data base. In silico molecular docking and drug likeness properties including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, and toxicity and prediction of biological activity were performed in order to assess and investigate the antiobesity activity of F1. Molecular docking study showed that F1 exhibited strong hydrogen binding affinity with Janus activated protein kinase-2 greater than ?9.2 Kcal/mol compared to co-crystalized ligand 3kc and nicotinamide (control drug) ?8.2 kcal/mol and ?4.6 Kcal/mol respectively. In addition, our in vitro results indicated that F1 also showed significant inhibitory effect on the triglyceride content and reactive oxygen species production in adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, F1 significantly reduced the mRNA expression of adipogenesis markers such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, and Janus activated prot, which are responsible for lipid accumulation. Our findings demonstrated that ginsenoside F1 inhibits lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen species generation by downregulating the expression adipocyte differentiation markers in mature 3T3-L1 cells. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",3T3-L1 cells; Adipogenesis; Docking; Ginsenosides; Obesity; PPAR-γ,antioxidant; fatty acid binding protein 4; ginseng saponin; ginsenoside; ginsenoside f1; Janus kinase 2; nicotinamide; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; reactive oxygen metabolite; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; animal cell; antioxidant activity; Article; blood brain barrier; cell differentiation; cell viability; computer model; controlled study; drug absorption; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug metabolism; drug screening; drug structure; embryo; gene expression; ginseng; hinge region; hydrogen bond; in vitro study; lipid storage; liver toxicity; molecular docking; molecular interaction; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; plasma protein binding; prediction; proadipocyte; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction,2-s2.0-85014082802

However, estimating the intrinsic and extrinsic aging of skin remains a challenge. Our objective was to study intrinsic skin aging with respect to patient age and extrinsic photo-aging of human dorsal (photo-exposed) and volar (photo-protected) forearm in vivo through skin auto-fluorescence (AF). We also examined the correlations between serum antioxidant enzyme, malondialdehyde(MDA), and skin AF. Methods: 37 healthy volunteers were enrolled. We measured skin AF and its heterogeneity on the dorsal and volar forearms. We also examined serum concentration of catalase, superoxide dismutase, vitamin E, and MDA levels in every participant. Results: In photo-protected areas, skin AF intensity in the 40 years or older group was significantly higher compared to the group less than 40 years-old. On the other hand, heterogeneity value was significantly higher in the less than 40 years-old group in photo-protected area. With respect to serum antioxidant enzyme and MDA level, only MDA level showed a negative correlation with skin AF intensity in photo-exposed area. Conclusion: We determined that skin AF intensity of the photo-protected area reflects intrinsic skin aging. In addition, degree of photo-aging could be indirectly inferred by skin AF of photo-exposed area and serum MDA level. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

It can manifest with many different clinical phenotypes; however, in its chronic stage, hyperpigmentation, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness are the main symptoms. Jaungo comprises two herbs, Lithospermi radix and Angelica gigantis radix, and three carrier oils, and is an approved herbal ointment for xerosis cutis in Korea. In past studies, we demonstrated that Jaungo had anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activity in in vitro and in vivo AD models; however, there are few relevant randomized controlled clinical trials on Jaungo in AD. Methods/design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, phase IIa clinical trial was designed to investigate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and dose response of Jaungo in AD.

The study aims to enroll 34 AD patients to be randomly distributed among three parallel groups: treatment 1, treatment 2, and the placebo group. Treatment group 1 applies Jaungo twice a day, while treatment group 2 applies Jaungo and the placebo ointment once a day, separately, and the placebo group applies the placebo ointment twice a day, for a total of 3 weeks each. Participants will be evaluated for eczema before and after the application of the ointments based on several parameters including the Eczema Area and Severity Index, the SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis Index, the Dermatology Life Quality Index, transepidermal water loss, total IgE level, eosinophil count, and IL-17, IL-22, and IFN-γ levels. Discussion: The trial is currently ongoing and the enrollment of subjects has been initiated. There is an urgent need to develop a drug for the treatment of dry, hyperpigmented, scaly, and thickened skin in chronic-stage AD. This study will determine the efficacy and safety of Jaungo in AD, providing evidence for specific AD symptoms treated by Jaungo. Trial registration: Clinical Trials.gov, identifier: NCT02900131.

There is accumulating evidence on the existence of genetic alteration and amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) in various cancers. Also the aberrated FGFR/FGF signaling has been implicated in cancer development and tumor microenvironment. However, the antitumor activity of BGJ398, a selective inhibitor of FGFR 1/2/3 against ovarian cancer still remains unknown. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the antitumoral activity of BGJ398 on ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3ip1 using 3-dimensional (3D) sphere culture system which has been accepted as a better mimic in vivo microenvironment than conventional 2-dimensional (2D) monolayer culture system. We examined the differential expression features of key signaling molecules which have a role in cell survival and proliferation between sphere-cultured SKOV3ip1 cells and monolayer-cultured SKOV3ip1 cells. The phosphorylation of AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) known as survival signaling molecules were upregulated in spherecultured SKOV3ip1 cells compared to in monolayer-cultured SKOV3ip1 cells. Next, we evaluated the antitumor activity of BGJ398 in monolayer-cultured SKOV3ip1 cells or spherecultured SKOV3ip1 cells. Treatment of BGJ398 did not affect the SKOV3ip1 cell viability in monolayer culture system, but, the cell viability of sphere-cultured SKOV3ip1 cells was markedly reduced by BGJ398. The phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 was downregulated by BGJ398 in sphere-cultured SKOV3ip1 cells, but not in monolayer cultured-SKOV3ip1 cells. Moreover, combination treatment with BGJ398 and paclitaxel in sphere-cultured SKOV3ip1 showed synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability.

Methods: Adult asthmatics who were diagnosed by primary care physicians and followed for at least 1 year were educated via smart devices and pamphlets. The education sessions were carried out three times at 2-week intervals. Each education period lasted at most 5 minutes. The effectiveness was then evaluated using questionnaires and an asthma control test (ACT). Results: The study enrolled 144 patients (mean age, 56.7±16.7 years). Half of the patients had not been taught how to use their inhalers. After participating in the education program, the participants' understanding of asthma improved significantly across all six items of a questionnaire assessing their general knowledge of asthma. The proportion of patients who made errors while manipulating their inhalers was reduced to less than 10%. The ACT score increased from 16.6±4.6 to 20.0±3.9 (p<0.001). The number of asthmatics whose ACT score was at least 20 increased from 45 (33.3%) to 93 (65.3%) (p<0.001). The magnitude of improvement in the ACT score did not differ between patients who received an education session at least three times within 1 year and those who had not. The majority of patients agreed to the need for an education program (95.8%) and showed a willingness to pay an additional cost for the education (81.9%).

Numerous animal and clinical studies on obesity previously demonstrated a reduction in leptin levels using acupuncture. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on serum leptin levels in obese patients. Methods We searched 10 data bases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, KoreaMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), Wanfang, Allied and complementary medicine database (AMED), Cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature (CINAHL), and Japan medical abstracts society (JAMAS)). Our study included randomized controlled trials(RCTs) that measured serum leptin level to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in obese patients. Risk of bias in each article was assessed according to Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs. A meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager software (RevMan v5.3). Results Eight RCTs (n?=?468) were finally included in this meta-analysis, and most showed low or unclear risk of bias. Compared to the control arm receiving no treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) [7.79, 12.31]; P?<?0.00001), oral anorexiant (95% CI [3.49, 9.11]; P?<?0.0001), diet therapy or exercise (95% CI [0.17, 6.88]; P?=?0.04), acupuncture significantly reduced serum leptin levels. However, compared to sham acupuncture, acupuncture showed no significant reduction of serum leptin levels (95% CI [-2.41, 8.76]; P?=?0.26). Conclusions Our review suggests that acupuncture for obesity has beneficial effect on serum leptin levels compared to no treatment or oral anorexiant. Additional acupuncture treatment on diet therapy or exercise demonstrated greater reduction in serum leptin levels, whereas no significant difference was shown between the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups. Although the results are of limited value due to the moderate quality and clinical heterogeneity, acupuncture can be used as an effective and safe treatment in obese patients. ? 2017",Acupuncture; Leptin; Meta-analysis; Obesity; Systematic review,leptin; acupuncture; alternative medicine; Cinahl; CNKI database; Embase; human; medical society; Medline; meta analysis; obesity; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; software; systematic review,2-s2.0-85016636144

Thus, we aimed to investigate the risk of developing CRN in patients with >10 adenomas and to compare their risk with that of patients with 3–10 adenomas. Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study that included 214 patients with >10 adenomas on index colonoscopy performed between January 2009 and December 2011, and underwent follow-up colonoscopy until December 2015 was conducted. The risk of developing advanced CRN (cancer or advanced adenoma with a diameter of ?10?mm or with a villous component, or high-grade dysplasia) was investigated and compared with that in patients with 3–10 adenomas (n?=?975). Results: Among the 214 patients with >10 adenomas, the mean age was 62.9?years and the mean number of adenomas on index colonoscopy was 14.2. Overall, 57 patients (26.6%) developed an advanced CRN after a mean of 4.3?years from baseline colonoscopy. The respective 3- and 5-year cumulative risks of advanced CRN were 6.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9–10.7) and 28.7% (95% CI 20.8–36.5), higher than those in the group with 3–10 adenomas (n?=?975, P?=?0.001). Having >10 adenomas on index colonoscopy was an independent risk factor for developing advanced CRN (odds ratio 2.25, 95% CI 1.49–3.38). Conclusions: The risk of developing advanced CRN in patients with >10 adenomas was high and statistically higher than that in patients with 3–10 adenomas.

We employ both continuous and categorical measures of age to test for a potential moderating effect. Overall findings based on linear regression analyses reveal that the mental distress resulting from the perception of physically deteriorating neighborhood declines with age.

Study design A cohort study was conducted with 13,707 non-obese Korean men. They were categorized into 4 groups according to the quartile of fasting insulin level, and followed up from 2005 to 2010. Incidence rates of obesity were compared among the 4 groups during follow-up, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for abdominal obesity according to fasting insulin level. Results The overall incidence rate of obesity was 16.2%, but the rate increased in proportion to the fasting insulin level (quartiles 1–4: 9.8%, 12.4%, 16.9%, 25.5%, P < 0.001). When HR of the 1st quartile was regarded as the reference, HRs for abdominal obesity increased proportionally to baseline fasting insulin level in an unadjusted model. However, after adjustment for covariates, including baseline waist circumference (WC), only in the quartile 4 group was the statistical significance of the association maintained [quartile 2–4; abdominal obesity: 0.89 (0.76–1.02), 1.00 (0.86–1.14) and 1.24 (1.08–1.43), P for trend <0.001]. Conclusion Although the risk of incident abdominal obesity was highest in the group with the highest fasting insulin levels, an overall proportional relationship between fasting insulin level and incident abdominal obesity was not found.

To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of P. supina, we examined the inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in RAW 264.7 cells. Our results indicated that ethyl acetate fraction significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO, iNOS and PGE2 production in RAW 264.7 cells. This result showed that ethyl acetate fraction of P. supina is expected to be a good candidate for development into a source of anti-inflammatory agents. ? 2017 The Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology.",Anti-inflammatory effect; Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); Nitric oxide (NO); Potentilla supina; Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2); RAW 264.7 cells,,2-s2.0-85019047355

In such networks, devices usually have limited resources. Therefore, energy efficiency is among the most crucial design issues. Efficient energy management strategies must be devised at device and network levels to prolong the network lifetime as much as possible. In a typical network, devices employ schedules to wakeup for communication. In this work, we present design and analysis of a protocol to reduce the energy consumption and delay. The proposed scheme manages the network by taking into account the device buffer capacity, packet drop probability and retry limits. It is observed that the proposed scheme is able to improve the performance in terms energy consumption and delay.

This marker is located in an intron of the gene, and its genomic role has been unknown. In this study, we examined rs3278 and three adjacent SNPs prevalent in alcoholics for their effects on an alternative promoter that would lead to the production of the NH2-terminally truncated protein NBCn1?N450, missing the first 450 amino acids. Analysis of the transcription start site database and a promoter prediction algorithm identified a cluster of three promoters in intron 7 and two short CpG-rich sites in intron 6. The promoter closest to rs3278 showed strong transcription activity in luciferase reporter gene assays. Major-to-minor allele substitution at rs3278 resulted in increased transcription activity. Equivalent substitutions at adjacent rs3772723 (intron 7) and 13077400 (exon 8) had negligible effect; however, the substitution at nonsynonymous rs3755652 (exon 8) increased the activity by more than twofold. The concomitant substitution at rs3278/rs3755652 produced an additive effect. The rs3755652 had more profound effects on the promoter than the upstream regulatory CpG sites. The amino acid change E326K caused by rs3755652 had negligible effect on transporter function. In HEK 293 cells, NBCn1?N450 was expressed in plasma membranes, but at significantly lower levels than the nontruncated NBCn1-E. The pH change mediated by NBCn1?N450 was also low. We conclude that rs3278 and rs3755652 stimulate an alternative transcription of the SLC4A7 gene, increasing the production of a defective transporter. ? 2017 the American Physiological Society.",Bicarbonate transporter; NBCn1; Rs3278; SLC4A7,"amino acid; protein; protein NBCn1; unclassified drug; bicarbonate sodium cotransporter; mutant protein; SLC4A7 protein, human; alcoholism; algorithm; allele; amino acid substitution; amino terminal sequence; Article; cell membrane; controlled study; CpG island; exon; gene; genetic transcription; genome; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; intron; luciferase assay; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; reporter gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLC4A7 gene; transcription initiation site; animal; genetics; metabolism; pH; single nucleotide polymorphism; Xenopus; Alleles; Amino Acid Substitution; Animals; CpG Islands; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Introns; Mutant Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Sodium-Bicarbonate Symporters; Transcription Initiation Site; Transcription, Genetic; Xenopus",2-s2.0-85015974514

Methods: For this study, we analyzed secondary survey data collected to enhance the understanding of drinking behavior among Korean college students. The study sample consisted of 447 college students who had consumed alcohol at least one time during the month prior to the survey. To examine the mediating effects of PBS, structural equation modeling analysis was performed; as part of this effort, (a) model fit was examined, (b) the model was modified to improve fit statistics, and (c) standardized indirect, direct, and total effects of depression on problem drinking were estimated. Results: PBS was a significant mediator explaining the association between depression and problem drinking. We found that college students with greater depression were less likely to use PBS, which resulted in increased risk of problem drinking. Conclusions: Given the significant mediating effect of PBS on the association between depression and problem drinking, it would be advantageous to implement interventions that motivate depressed college students to use PBS when drinking alcohol in order to prevent or reduce the risk of problem drinking. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Alcohol use; college students; depression; problem drinking; protective behavioral strategies,adult; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; Article; college student; depression; female; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; South Korea; structural equation modeling,2-s2.0-84976336426

DI-CMTC is linked to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS)-associated neuropathies, which are caused by E196K and G41R missense mutations and a single de novo deletion (153-156delVKQV). It is well-established that these YARS mutations induce neuronal dysfunction, morphological symptoms involving axonal degeneration, and impaired motor performance. The present study is the first to describe a novel mouse model of YARS-mutation-induced neuropathy involving a neuron- specific promoter with a deleted mitochondrial targeting sequence that inhibits the expression of YARS protein in the mitochondria. An adenovirus vector system and in vivo techniques were utilized to express YARS fusion proteins with a Flag-tag in the spinal cord, peripheral axons, and dorsal root ganglia. Following transfection of YARS-expressing viruses, the distributions of wild-type (WT) YARS and E196K mutant proteins were compared in all expressed regions; G41R was not expressed. The proportion of Flag/green fluorescent protein (GFP) double-positive signaling in the E196K mutant-type mice did not significantly differ from that of WT mice in dorsal root ganglion neurons. All adenovirus genes, and even the empty vector without the YARS gene, exhibited GFP-positive signaling in the ventral horn of the spinal cord because GFP in an adenovirus vector is driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. The present study demonstrated that anatomical differences in tissue can lead to dissimilar expressions of YARS genes. Thus, use of this novel animal model will provide data regarding distributional defects between mutant and WT genes in neurons, the DICMTC phenotype, and potential treatment approaches for this disease. ? 2017, Medknow Publications.

Additionally, we analyzed the reasons for failing to receive follow-up screening in order to develop better strategies for improving follow-up screening rates. Methods We contacted MCI patients who had not visited the Dongdaemun-gu Center for Dementia for annual screening during the year following their registration. We compared the CCR from MCI to dementia in the following two groups: subjects registered as having MCI in the Dongdaemun-gu Center for Dementia database and subjects who failed to revisit the center, but who participated in a screening test for dementia after being contacted. The latter participants completed a questionnaire asking reasons for not previously visiting for follow-up screening. Results The final diagnoses of the 188 subjects who revisited the center only after contact were 19.1% normal, 64.9% MCI and 16.0% dementia. The final diagnoses of the 449 subjects in the Dongdaemun-gu Center for Dementia database were 25.6% normal, 46.1% MCI and 28.3% dementia. The CCR of the revisit-after-contact group was much lower than anticipated. The leading cause for noncompliance was “no need for tests” at 28.2%, followed by “other reasons” at 23.9%, and “I forgot the appointment date” at 19.7%. Conclusion Considering the low dementia detection rate of the group who revisited only after contact and the reasons they gave for noncompliance, there appears to be a need for ongoing outreach and education regarding the course and prognosis of MCI. ? 2017 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.",Cumulative conversion rates; Mild cognitive impairment; Noncompliance; Screening tests,aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; assessment of humans; community; controlled study; cumulative conversion rate; dementia; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; pathogenesis; patient compliance; questionnaire; register; screening test,2-s2.0-85015198164

However, studies have reported that the significant outbreaks caused by non-O157:H7 E. coli strains, also known as “Big-Six” serogroup strains, are increasing. There is no systematic study describing differential secreted proteins from these non-O157:H7 E. coli strains. In this study, we carried out MS-based differential secretome analysis using tandem mass tags labeling strategy of non-O157:H7 E. coli strains, O103, O111, O121, O145, O26, and O45. We identified 1241 proteins, of which 565 proteins were predicted to be secreted. We also found that 68 proteins were enriched in type III secretion system and several of them were differentially expressed across the strains. Additionally, we identified several strain-specific secreted proteins that could be used for developing potential markers for the identification and strain-level differentiation. To our knowledge, this study is the first comparative proteomic study on secretome of E. coli Big-Six serogroup and the several of these strain-specific secreted proteins can be further studied to develop potential markers for identification and strain-level differentiation. Moreover, the results of this study can be utilized in several applications, including food safety, diagnostics of E. coli outbreaks, and detection and identification of bio threats in biodefense. ? 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Improvement of outcomes can be hampered in this situation. This study was to describe the clinical outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients with comorbid disability in other extremities. Methods: In two tertiary institutions, 16 patients with comorbid disability (9 men and 7 women; mean age of 57.1 years [range, 45 to 71 years]; 14 dominant arms; mean follow-up of 18 months [range, 12 to 38 months]) underwent rotator cuff repair. There were 5 massive tears, 1 large tear, 9 medium tears, and 1 small tear. Open repair was performed in 3 patients and arthroscopic repair in 13. The most common comorbid condition was paralysis (n = 7). Eight patients walked with crutches preoperatively. Anatomical outcome was investigated in 12 patients using either magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography at least 6 months postoperatively. Results: Range of motion, visual analogue scale for pain and satisfaction, and all functional scores improved significantly. Healing failure occurred in 4 patients (2 large-to-massive and 2 medium size tears), but none required revision surgery. All 4 retears involved the dominant side, and 3 patients were crutch users. Conclusions: The current data suggested favorable outcome of rotator cuff repair in patients with comorbid disability.

The right shoulder showed anomalous accessory articulation between the distal third of the clavicle and the acromion along with normal articulation of the shoulder on CT. At the left shoulder, bony fusions were present between the distal portion of the clavicle, the acromion, and the coracoid process, and between the coracoid process, upper portion of the glenoid, and upper body of the scapula, which formed a bony canal and was responsible for hypoplasia of the supraspinatus muscle on CT and MRI. To our knowledge, this is the first description of such congenital shoulder anomalies with extreme bony fusion and is an illustrative example of how imaging may be used to differentiate fusion from other congenital abnormalities of the shoulder to aid diagnosis. ? 2016, ISS.",Clavicle; Congenital anomaly; CT; MRI; Scapula; Shoulder; Supraspinatus muscle,"acromion; adult; Article; case report; chronic pain; clavicle; computer assisted tomography; congenital malformation; congenital shoulder fusion anomaly; coracoid process; deltoid muscle; human; hypoplasia; image reconstruction; joint mobility; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; range of motion; shoulder disease; shoulder pain; supraspinatus muscle; three dimensional imaging; abnormalities; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; shoulder; shoulder pain; skeletal muscle; x-ray computed tomography; Acromion; Adult; Clavicle; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Shoulder Joint; Shoulder Pain; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85004001442

Materials and methods: Six different acrylic tubes were exposed to a 6-MeV electron beam; they had tips with three angles (0°, 15° and 30°) and two diameters (2·5 and 3·0 cm). Gafchromic EBT2 film was horizontally and vertically inserted in a solid water phantom to measure the dose profiles and percentage depth doses (PDDs). The measured data from radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeters placed on the neck and both eyes were used to estimate the lifetime attributable risk of secondary cancer resulting from intraoral radiotherapy for tongue cancer. Results: A total of 12 dose profiles were obtained from six different acrylic applicators at 0·5 and 1·28 cm depths. Circular shapes were obtained from 0° applicators, and oval shapes were obtained from 15° and 30° applicators. Absorbed doses at a 0·5 cm depth were higher than those at a 1·28 cm depth. PDD shapes for the six acrylic applicators were similar to those of a normal 6 MeV electron beam. Larger-diameter applicators showed higher PDD than smaller-diameter applicators with the same tip angle. According to our secondary cancer risk estimation, if 100,000 patients received intraoral radiotherapy at 30 years and lived until 80 years, 122 female and 22 male patients would develop secondary thyroid cancer, while 13 female and 18 male patients would develop secondary ocular melanoma or retinoblastoma. Conclusions: Dosimetric characteristics for linear accelerator-based intraoperative radiotherapy treatment beam were confirmed. In addition, we found that 0·1% of tongue cancer patients would get secondary malignancies for both eyes and thyroid from this treatment. ? 2016 Cambridge University Press.",dose; electron radiotherapy; intraoral cone radiotherapy; radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeter; secondary cancer risk,Article; cancer risk; dosimeter; dosimetry; electron beam; electron therapy; eye melanoma; human; linear accelerator; metastasis; radiation absorption; radiation applicator; radiation depth dose; retinoblastoma; risk assessment; thyroid cancer; tongue cancer,2-s2.0-84997335664

In the present study, the effects of chlorogenic acid on diabetic auditory pathway impairment were evaluated by neuro-electrical physiological measurements and morphological investigations. We have shown that CA efficiently prevents the progression of auditory pathway dysfunction caused by DM using auditory brainstem responses and auditory middle latency responses in mice. Additionally, using transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions measurement and scanning electron microscope observation of hair cells in DM mice, we found that CA may aid in the recovery from outer hair cell and otic hair cell damage.

Although many studies have been conducted to measure quantitatively the effects of acupuncture, thus far, models that describe these effects have not been established. The purpose of this study was to derive a transfer function model of acupuncture stimulation within the electrocardiograms based on the periods before, during, and after acupuncture. Methods: Fourteen healthy subjects were included in this clinical trial. Five-minute electrocardiograms were captured before, during, and after acupuncture at HT7. For each period, signal-averaged electrocardiograms were created from all of the subjects' 5-min electrocardiograms for that period. Individual transfer functions, which has the highest average goodness of fit, were derived for each period pair. By averaging individual transfer functions, generalized transfer functions were derived. Results: The transfer function with the highest average goodness of fit was a fraction with 4th order numerator and 5th order denominator. Fourteen individual transfer functions were derived separately for each pair of periods: before and during acupuncture, during and after acupuncture, and before and after acupuncture. Three generalized transfer functions were derived by averaging individual transfer functions for each period pair. Conclusion: The three generalized transfer functions that were derived may reflect the electrocardiogram changes caused by acupuncture. However, this clinical trial included only 14 subjects. Further studies with control groups and more subjects are needed. This clinical trial has been registered on the Clinical Research Information Service, Republic of Korea (No. KCT0001944).

This study involved two focus group discussions and three in-depth individual interviews. All interviews were recorded and transcribed as they were spoken, and data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: General medical-surgical nurses experienced difficulties in 3 categories, 9 subcategories, 27 codes. The three categories were ‘nurse’ related factors, ‘patient’ related factors, ‘resource’ related factors. The nine categories were ‘unpreparedness’, ‘nursing barriers due to stigma’, ‘undervaluing and avoidance of psychiatric nursing’, ‘eroding into the trap of a vicious cycle’, ‘facing unapproachable patients’, ‘dealing with unhelpful family members’, ‘burdening already overburdened staff’, ‘obstructive environment’, and ‘isolation of staff with heavy responsibilities’. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate the need to develop psychiatric mental health education programs for non-psychiatric nurses.

Efforts to find effective anti-bacterial strategies against H. pylori for the non-antibiotic control of H. pylori infection are urgently required. In this study, we used whey to prepare glycomacropeptide (GMP), from which sialic acid (G-SA) was enzymatically isolated. We investigated the anti-bacterial effects of G-SA against H. pylori in vitro and in an H. pylori-infected murine model. Materials/Methods: The anti-bacterial activity of G-SA was measured in vitro using the macrodilution method, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production was measured in H. pylori and AGS cell co-cultures by ELISA. For in vivo study, G-SA 5 g/kg body weight (bw)/day and H. pylori were administered to mice three times over one week. After one week, G-SA 5 g/kg bw/day alone was administered every day for one week. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were measured by ELISA to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of G-SA. In addition, real-time PCR was performed to measure the genetic expression of cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA). Results: G-SA inhibited the growth of H. pylori and suppressed IL-8 production in H. pylori and in AGS cell co-cultures in vitro. In the in vivo assay, administration of G-SA reduced levels of IL-1β and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines whereas IL-10 level increased. Also, G-SA suppressed the expression of cagA in the stomach of H. pylori-infected mice. Conclusion: G-SA possesses anti-H. pylori activity as well as an anti-H. pylori-induced gastric inflammatory effect in an experimental H. pylori-infected murine model. G-SA has potential as an alternative to antibiotics for the prevention of H. pylori infection and H. pylori-induced gastric disease prevention. ? 2017 The Korean Nutrition Society and the Korean Society of Community Nutrition.",Cytotoxin-associated gene A; Helicobacter pylori; Sialic acids,,2-s2.0-85012916387

Four different plans were devised and compared for 15 breast cancer patients, all of whom had early stage disease and had undergone breast conserving surgery. A total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions was prescribed as the planning target volume in all treatment plans. The doses to the ipsilateral lung, heart, and opposite breast were compared using a dose-volume histogram. The conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), and coverage index (CoVI) were evaluated and compared among the four treatment techniques. The lifetime attributable risk (LAR) associated with each of the four techniques from age at exposure of 30 to 100 years was measured for the organs at risk. We found that MIRT had a better CoVI (1.02 ± 0.13 and 1.01 ± 0.04, respectively) and IMRT had a better CI (0.88 ± 0.04, and 0.87 ± 0.02, respectively) compared to the other three modalities. All four techniques had similar HIs. Moreover, we found that IMRT and MIRT were less likely to cause radiation induced-pneumonitis, 3D-CRT had the lowest LAR, IMRT and MIRT had similar LARs and VMAT had the highest LAR. In study we found that compared to the VMAT, MIRT and IMRT provided adequate the planning target volume (PTV) coverage and reduced the risk of secondary cancers in most of the organs at risk (OARs), while 3D-CRT had the lowest secondary-cancer risks. Therefore, 3D-CRT is still a reasonable choice for whole breast RT except for patients with complex PTV shapes, in which cases IMRT and MIRT may provide better target coverage. ? 2017, The Korean Physical Society.",Breast; Dosimetry; Radiation therapy,,2-s2.0-85012009158

Design: A nested qualitative study within an ongoing randomised controlled trial to explore acupuncture's antiarrhythmic effects on drug refractory acupuncture in persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) (ACU-AF trial). Participants: Participants were recruited using purposeful sampling and a maximum variation strategy with regard to treatment allocation (treatment or control) and protocol completion (completion or non-completion). Setting: This was a single-centre in-depth interview qualitative study conducted at a tertiary-level university hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Results: Data saturation was reached after 8 participants. Thematic analysis identified that most patients were not aware of their condition until medical check-up; physician referral was the main reason for trial participation, and patients had high expectations regardless of previous acupuncture experiences. Patients tended to depend on their physicians' opinions because they felt helpless of their condition. No one questioned their assigned treatment groups and generally believed acupuncture treatment was different for cardiovascular diseases. A few patients expressed disappointment in the strict and rigid protocols, in which most practitioners refrained from explaining their acupuncture procedures. Conclusions: For cardiovascular patients their physician's advice was one of the biggest reasons for enrolling in the acupuncture trial therefore relying on standard recruitment methods may not be effective. Fortunately both real and sham acupuncture groups in our sample were receiving treatment as intended, but in the future, designing a more pragmatic trial (better reflecting clinical settings, expanding the inclusion criteria and using more treatment points) will allow researchers to better explore the comprehensive effects of acupuncture. The findings of this study will allow researchers to improve the currently ongoing ACU-AF trial and to further help interpretation of main trial outcomes once the trial is completed.",,acupuncture; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; clinical article; clinical protocol; controlled study; expectation; fear; human; Korea; personal experience; physician; qualitative research; randomized controlled trial; therapy effect; atrial fibrillation; directive counseling; double blind procedure; interview; middle aged; motivation; patient attitude; patient compliance; patient referral; prospective study; psychology; South Korea; Acupuncture Therapy; Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Directive Counseling; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Middle Aged; Motivation; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Compliance; Prospective Studies; Qualitative Research; Referral and Consultation; Republic of Korea,2-s2.0-85011564504

A TIPS revision can be performed using basic or advanced techniques to treat stenosis or occlusion. In patients with an initial poor clinical response, a TIPS venogram with pressure measurements should be performed to assess shunt patency. The creation of a parallel TIPS may also be required if the patient is symptomatic and the portal pressure remains high after TIPS revision. Additional procedures may also be necessary, such as peritoneovenous shunt (Denver shunt) placement for refractory ascites, tunneled pleural catheter for hepatic hydrothorax, and balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration procedure for gastric variceal bleeding.

If the 40-m sprint time exceeded 110% of the fastest baseline 40-m sprint time, the run was repeated. Repeated-sprint cycling test (every 3 weeks), quadriceps moment (every 2 weeks), and abdominal and thigh subcutaneous tissue thickness (every 2 weeks) were measured. Compared to baseline, mean power output improved at week 3 (16.27 vs. 17.73 Watt/kg, p=0.004). Regardless of side, quadriceps moment began to increase at week 4 (2.88 vs. 3.15 N·m/kg, p=0.03). Subcutaneous tissue thickness was reduced at week 2 (abdominal: 11.19 vs. 9.65 mm, p=0.01; thigh: 9.17 vs. 8.12 mm, p=0.009). Our results suggest that (1) sprint training with an intensity of 110% of the fastest baseline 40-m sprint time with the addition of one sprint per week produces similar effects to other training programs, and (2) untrained individuals need 4 weeks of training for strength development in the quadriceps and 2 weeks for reduction in fat tissue thickness. ?

Although these conditions are considered important, few studies have investigated them in detail. Therefore, we investigated the epidemiology of diabetic foot complications (DFC) with respect to the effects on the public healthcare system. Methods We evaluated the incidence, clinical characteristics, health service utilization frequency and medical expenses of DFC in type 2 DM patients in the Korea National Diabetes Program (KNDP), the largest multi-center, prospective cohort in Korea (n?=?4405). To determine precise outcomes, we used national representative databases, including claims data from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service of Korea. Results During a median follow-up period of 3.30?years, 528 patients (12.0%) were newly diagnosed with DFC at an incidence rate of 43.02 cases per 1000 person-years. The patients with DFC were significantly older than patients without DFC, but other clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. The patients with DFC had more hospital visits (p?<?0.001), longer duration of hospitalization (p?<?0.001), and increased expenses (p?<?0.001) compared to patients without DFC. After multiple adjustments, the differences in number of hospital visits and medical expenses were consistent. In a before and after comparison within the DFC group, all three variables increased significantly after the onset of DFC (p?<?0.001). Conclusions DFC were significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes and caused a substantial burden to the national healthcare system in Korea. Therefore, intervention to prevent DFC is important. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Diabetes complications; Diabetes mellitus, type 2; Epidemiology; Korea; Peripheral vascular diseases; Risk factors","antidiabetic agent; antithrombocytic agent; hemoglobin A1c; metformin; urea; adult; age; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetic foot; female; follow up; gender; health care cost; health care utilization; human; incidence; large scale production; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; South Korea; urea nitrogen blood level; clinical trial; complication; cost; cost of illness; diabetic foot; economics; foot injury; hospital cost; multicenter study; national health service; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; public hospital; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Cost of Illness; Costs and Cost Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Foot; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Foot Injuries; Hospital Costs; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Incidence; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; State Medicine",2-s2.0-84997079019

Design A retrospective cohort study. Setting Single-institutional, university hospital. Participants All patients admitted to the ICU after CABG between January 2009 and December 2012. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Based on PaCO2 status during the first 24 hours after CABG, 1,011 patients were classified into 4 groups: normocapnia, hypocapnia, hypercapnia, and dual hyper/hypocapnia. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.7% (n = 4) for normocapnia, 1.5% (n = 4) for hypocapnia, 2.2% (n = 3) for hypercapnia, and 7.5% (n = 4) for the dual-exposure group. The extubation times were 13.3±21.7 hours, 15.8±21.37 hours, 21.79±39.70 hours, and 42.29±75.35 hours, respectively. After adjusting for confounding variables, the dual hypocapnia and hypercapnia exposure group was associated with increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 8.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-35.86; p = 0.006) and delayed extubation (OR = 2.40; 95% CI, 1.24-4.64; p = 0.010). Conclusions Exposure to both hypocapnia and hypercapnia within 24 hours after CABG was associated independently with increased risk of 30-day mortality and delayed extubation.

Reperfusion through early intervention can increase limb salvage and decrease mortality. There was no common agreement when is the best to start thrombolysis in treating acute arterial occlusion. This study was designed to study the efficacy of an early thrombolysis compared with a late thrombolysis. Method We identified all patients discharged from the Gwangju Veterans hospital with a diagnosis of acute arterial occlusion between 2006 and 2014. 72 patients were eligible, and every patient had treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis on the day or 1 day after admission. Among them, 42 patients had undergone an early thrombolysis (less than 7 days after the onset of symptoms) and the other 30 patients had undergone a late thrombolysis (more than 7 days after the onset of symptoms). The primary outcome was amputation rate at 6 months. The secondary outcomes were all cause mortality at 6 months and increase of ankle brachial index (ABI). Results Amputation rate at 180 days in the early thrombolysis group was 7.1% as compared with 30% in the late thrombolysis group. All cause mortality at 6 months and increase of ABI were not different between two groups. In multivariable Cox-regression analysis, late thrombolysis was independent predictor of amputation at 6 months.

Objectives: Several previous studies have reported cases of Bell’s palsy with vestibular function disorder. The basic hypothesis behind this effect lies in the close proximity of the vestibular and facial nerves in the internal auditory canal (IAC). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between Bell’s palsy prognosis and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMPs). Methods: Total 104 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with Bell?s palsy from January 2012 to December 2014 were enrolled. Patients were divided into complete recovery group and incomplete recovery group. All of patients underwent oVEMP recordings within 1 week after disease onset. For the evaluation of correlation between H–B grades, ENoG, oVEMP and Recovery of Bell?s palsy, logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The mean value of ocular vemp asymmetry was significantly higher in the incomplete recovery group than the complete recovery group (p < 0.05). No association was found between the ipsilesional PTA threshold, caloric test, and rate of abnormal EMG and recovery state. However, the initial state of ENoG, initial H–B grade, and oVEMP abnormal findings (Latency & Amplitude symmetry ratio) were significantly correlated with the rate of recovery (p = 0.025, p = 0.013, and p < 0.005, respectively). ? 2016 Acta Oto-Laryngologica AB (Ltd).",Bell’s palsy; ocular vestibular myogenic potential; prognosis; VEMP,antivirus agent; famcyclovir; methylprednisolone; unclassified drug; adult; antiviral therapy; Article; Bell palsy; caloric vestibular test; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drug megadose; electromyography; female; human; hypertension; latent period; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; prognosis; pure tone audiometry; steroid therapy; vestibular evoked myogenic potential; vestibular nerve; visual evoked potential; Bell palsy; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; prognosis; Adult; Bell Palsy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials,2-s2.0-84986206642

For the optimal anterior segmental retraction, an ankylosed posterior tooth needed surgical inclination reposition. During anterior segmental osteotomy surgery under local anesthesia, additional single tooth osteotomy was performed without challenge. Methods: For anterior segment retraction, osteotomy cuts were made by the surgeon to define a block of bone embedding 6 mandibular anterior teeth. First premolars were extracted during initial orthodontic treatment period. But the ankylosed lower left lateral incisor and lower right second premolar root which remains mesially with uprighted crown hindered further anterior segment retraction. The authors removed cortical bone around second premolar root and repositioned to be upright. Anterior segment was retracted to proper position utilizing the space gained. Result: Thin alveolar mandibular anterior segment retraction and the second premolar uprighting were managed effectively with additional single tooth segmental osteotomy during anterior segmental osteotomy. Conclusion: Double anterior segmental osteotomy can be an effective alternative to conventional orthognathic surgery in selected adult patients. Copyright ? 2017 Mutaz B.

In some patients, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis causes adverse effects such as itching, rash, or digestive conditions. Certain patients still develop infections severe enough to require a repeat operation despite antibiotic prophylaxis. Acupuncture has been used to treat inflammatory conditions, and many basic and clinical studies have provided evidence of its anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory effects. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of acupuncture on inflammation and immune function after craniotomy. Methods: This trial will be a single-center, parallel-group clinical trial. Forty patients who underwent craniotomy for an unruptured aneurysm, facial spasm, or a brain tumor will be allocated to either the study or the control group. The study group will receive conventional management as well as acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and intradermal acupuncture, which will start within 48 h of the craniotomy. The patients will receive a total of six sessions within 8 days. The control group will only receive conventional management. The primary outcome measure will be the C-reactive protein levels, while the secondary outcomes will be the serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 levels measured at four different time points: within 48 h prior to the craniotomy and on days 2, 4, and 7 after surgery. The presence of fever and infection, the use of additional antibiotics, the presence of infection, including pneumonia or urinary tract infection, and safety will also be investigated. Discussion: In this trial, we will observe whether acupuncture has anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory effects after a craniotomy. If our study yields positive results and a placebo-controlled study also finds favorable results following our study, acupuncture could be recommended as an adjunctive therapy after a craniotomy.

To review the literature and systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Chuna (or Tuina) manual therapy (C[T]MT) on pain and function for musculoskeletal disorders. Methods. We searched 15 English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean databases using relevant keywords. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of C(T)MT for musculoskeletal disorders were considered, and we limited analyses to studies with a low-risk bias for randomization and/or allocation concealment. Results. Sixty-six RCTs with 6,170 participants were included. One sham-controlled RCT showed that C(T)MT relieved pain more effectively than a sham control (SMD-3.09 [-3.59,-2.59]). For active-controlled RCTs, pooled meta-analysis showed that C(T)MT had statistically significant effects on pain reduction, especially compared to traction (P<0.00001), drugs (P=0.04), and physical therapies (P<0.0001). For functional improvement, combined effects of C(T)MT with drugs (P=0.04) and traction (P=0.05) also showed similar positive effects. Conclusions. This systematic review suggests that C(T)MT is safe and effective for pain reduction and functional improvement for musculoskeletal diseases; however, the evidence for functional improvement was not as strong as for pain reduction. For future studies, high-quality RCTs such as sham-controlled studies with standardized interventions are needed to provide sufficient evidence on the effects of C(T)MT for musculoskeletal diseases.

There are plenty of studies investigating the history of diagnostic criteria of neurasthenia, which is influenced by diverse cultural(or social) environment. The obejective of this study is to provide review of the previous studys on the changes of neurasthenia diagnoses in the context of local area to find meanings of these transition and improve health care for psychiatric patient. Methods: Literature review was conducted on studies demonstrating diagnostic criteria of neurasthenia with cultural(or social) environment. We investigated the literature reviews or observative studies which described alteration of diagnostic criteria of neurasthenia and assessed its significance. After selecting eligible studies, the authors read the articles and summarized the meaningful contents those were significant in clinical practice. Results: Transformation of Chinese Classification of Mental Disorder(CCMD) integrated with internationally utilized DSM-IV or ICD-10 is controversial about its significance in that it had limited effect on public health care due to the variables of sociocultural context, but primarily differentiated neurasthenia from other disorders. The latter one can be the directing point of the diagnostic criteria of other culture-bound diseases, which is the traits of not outstanding mood(or affect) than other neurotic disorders. Conclusion: As diagnostic criteria of neurasthenia varies, the significance of this variation is controversial, but could be the paragon of other culture-bound diseases. ? 2017 Korean Pharmacopuncture Institute.",Culture-bound disease; Diagnostic criteria; Literature study; Neurasthenia,,2-s2.0-85041217890

Therefore, rehabilitation methods to reduce aspiration in patients with dysphagia are important. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Shaker exercise on aspiration and oral diet level in stroke survivors with dysphagia. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=16) or a control group (n=16). Participants in the experimental group performed Shaker exercise and conventional dysphagia therapy, whereas those in the control group performed only conventional dysphagia therapy. All participants performed training 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Degree of aspiration was assessed using the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) based on videofluoroscopic swallowing study, while oral diet level was assessed using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). RESULTS: The experimental group showed greater improvement on both the PAS (p<0.05) and FOIS (p<0.05) compared with the control group.

This study evaluated the role of preoperative assessment based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological analysis in identifying a group having a low risk of lymph node metastasis. Data of 529 patients with endometrial cancer were obtained from a prospective multicenter database, between January 2012 and December 2014. Clinical staging, based on MRI and histological analysis, was compared with final pathology results after the surgical staging procedure. The preoperative low-risk criteria, based on current guidelines from Korea, France, and Canada, and criteria used for fertilitysparing therapies, were applied to our multicenter cohort and the accuracy of each set of criteria for identifying group at low risk of lymph node metastasis was evaluated. When considering grades or MR stages separately, the overall agreement between preoperative and postoperative findings was poor (Kappa 0.45 for grades; 0.41 for stages). However, when combining these two parameters, the low-risk group, as defined by any of the guidelines, had an acceptable rate of lymph node metastasis (below 3%). The French guidelines identified 249 patients (47.1%) as being in the low-risk group. Criteria used to define fertility-sparing therapy candidates identified 48 patients (9.1%) among the study population, only one of whom had extra-uterine disease. This study shows that the current guidelines, using preoperative assessment based on MRI and histological analysis, can identify low-risk patients, who may be candidates for omitting lymphadenectomy. ?

Still, it causes additional suffering for the suicide survivors, and they may end up in another high-risk group. The word suicide is a combination of sui (oneself) and caedo (to kill), refering to an intentional act of hurting oneself (WHO, 2014). That is, suicide is neither a disorder nor a disease but an act. Previously, suicide was treated following a disease model, and causes and preventitive measures were discussed. However, as studies on suicide have become diversified, it is today understood that suicide is a result of social and personal factors along with disease factors interacting with each other (Kouichi Yoshimasu, 2008). The importance of depression in the issue of suicide is still highlighted. Depression is the psychiatric diagnosis most commonly associated with suicide.

This study was conducted to investigate the association between serum CRP and colorectal adenoma risk. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on first-time screening colonoscopies in asymptomatic subjects who also had their serum CRP level measured during a routine health check-up between September 2006 and September 2009 in Korea. Serum CRP level was compared between high-risk and low-risk adenoma groups and independent predictors of high-risk adenoma were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. Results: Among the 3,309 eligible patients, the high-risk adenoma group had higher serum CRP levels than the low-risk adenoma group (P=0.000). In addition, patients with a high-risk adenoma were more frequently included in the high CRP group than in the low CRP group (8.6% vs. 4.0%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of high-risk adenoma was 3.5 times higher in the highest quartile of CRP level (P=0.000) compared with that in the lowest quartile. In logistic regression analysis, a higher quartile CRP level was found to be an independent risk factor for high-risk adenoma (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.5; P=0.000). Conclusions: High CRP level is associated with high-risk adenoma in both men and women. Our data may support the association between chronic inflammation and colorectal neoplasia, which warrants further investigation. ? 2017.

Methods: Patients (n = 157) were prospectively enrolled and allocated to Group 1 (no local anaesthetic), Group 2 (local anaesthesia to subcutaneous fat level; lidocaine 1-2 ml), Group 3 (to deltoid muscle level; 3-5 ml), or Group 4 (to subscapularis muscle level; 6-8 ml). We evaluated the frequency of contrast leakage, periprocedural/postprocedural pain, contrast-To-noise ratio of the intra-Articular signal, and subjective image noise/image sharpness. Radiological diagnoses of superior anterior-To-posterior (SLAP) and Bankart lesions were assessed. All data were analysed by one-way analysis of variance/Kruskal-Wall, Χ2/Fisher's exact and DeLong's tests. Results: The frequency of contrast leakage from the injection path and subjective image noise were significantly lower in Groups 1 and 2 than in Groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.001- 0.04). Periprocedural/postprocedural pain scores among Groups 2-4 were similar and lower than those of Group 1. The contrast-To-noise ratio (p = 0.11-0.97) and image sharpness (p = 0.12-0.43) were similar among Groups 2-4 and significantly lower than those of Group 1 (p = 0.001- 0.02). The diagnostic performance for the assessment of superior anterior-To-posterior and Bankart lesions was better in Groups 2-4 than in Group 1, although there were no significant differences (p = 0.23-0.99). Conclusion: Local anaesthesia with 1-2 ml lidocaine at subcutaneous fat level reduced pain and provided optimal image quality in direct shoulder magnetic resonance arthrography.

Methods: Korean men (n=1,050) who were screened for lung cancer using LDCT imaging at a health promotion center in Seoul, Korea between January 1 and December 31were recruited for the study. AAD is the longest length of ascending aorta measured from approximately 15 mm above left main coronary ostium to the mid-slice level of the right pulmonary artery. Results: AAD were divided into quartiles, and the degree of hypertension was determined based on the quartiles of the AAD using logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) for the proportion of hypertension in Q2 (1.70, 95% CI: 1.11-2.59), Q3 (2.72, 95% CI: 1.81-4.09) and Q4 (3.94, 95% CI: 2.63-5.89) were significantly greater than that of Q1 (P for trend < 0.001). Even after controlling for confounding covariates of age, BMI, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose, GGT, ALT, eGFR, smoking status and alcohol intake, there was significant correlation.

To know the inhibitory effects of taurine-ribose (Tau-Ribose) on differentiation process and adipokine expression, preadipocytes were incubated with Tau-Ribose in differentiation medium for 14 days. Differentiated adipocytes were also stimulated at the concentration of IL-1β 1 ng/ml with addition of Tau-Ribose. After 7 days of incubation, the levels of adiponectin, leptin, IL-6, and IL-8 were measured from the culture supernatants. At concentrations of 10–40 mM, Tau-Ribose dose-dependently inhibited the process of adipogenesis. The treatment of Tau-Ribose decreased the expression of transcription factors, which are necessary for adipogenesis and are known as adipocyte marker. Treatment with Tau-Ribose significantly modulated the production of IL-8 and IL-6. However, it did not modulate the production of adiponectin and leptin in IL-1β-activated adipocytes. As with taurine chloramine, Tau-Ribose also inhibited STAT-3 signaling, independent of MAPK signaling. In conclusion, Tau-Ribose inhibits the signaling pathway of STAT-3 and can change adipokines production; thus, it may have a potential as an agent for treating obesity-related diseases. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Adipogenesis; Adipokines; STAT-3 signalling; Taurine derivatives,"adipocytokine; adiponectin; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; leptin; mitogen activated protein kinase; ribose; sodium; STAT3 protein; taurine; tosylchloramide sodium; transcription factor; adiponectin; ADIPOQ protein, human; N-(D-ribopyranosyl)taurine; ribose; STAT3 protein; STAT3 protein, human; taurine; adipogenesis; Article; cell differentiation; controlled study; dose response; enzyme activation; enzyme synthesis; human; human cell; in vitro study; incubation time; priority journal; proadipocyte; protein expression; signal transduction; supernatant; adipocyte; analogs and derivatives; biosynthesis; cell culture; cell differentiation; drug effect; metabolism; stem cell; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Adiponectin; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Humans; Ribose; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Stem Cells; Taurine",2-s2.0-85029305412

Attempts to understand the emotion have evolved from the perspective of an independent cognitive system of the mind to that of an interactive response involving the body. This study aimed to quantify and visualize relationships between different emotions and bodily organ systems from the perspective of East Asian medicine. Methods. Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) method was used to quantify the significance of Five Viscera and the gallbladder relative to seven different emotions through the classical medical text of DongUiBoGam. Bodily organs that corresponded to different emotions were visualized using a body template. Results. The emotions had superior tf-idf values with the following bodily organs: anger with the liver, happiness with the heart, thoughtfulness with the heart and spleen, sadness with the heart and lungs, fear with the kidneys and the heart, surprise with the heart and the gallbladder, and anxiety with the heart and the lungs. Specific patterns between the emotions and corresponding bodily organ systems were identified. Conclusion.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease, but only few studies involved samples of children and adolescents that are representative of the entire Korean population. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of AD among children and adolescents in Korea by using nationally representative data. Methods. We used data from the fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2010 and retrospectively evaluated 2,116 children and adolescents. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between AD and other variables, including IgE levels. Results. The prevalence rate of AD in children and adolescents was 15.0%. In the multivariate analysis of ages from 1 to 18 years, age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.96; p<0.01) was related to AD. From age of 12 to 18 years, smoking (aOR, 8.99; p<0.01) and elevated total IgE serum level (aOR, 5.31; p<0.01) were related to AD. Conclusion. Age, smoking, and elevated total IgE level were related to AD in the children and adolescents. Thus, an antismoking policy and public education are necessary for reducing the prevalence of allergic diseases. In addition, measurement of total IgE level and age may be helpful in the diagnosis of AD. ? 2017 Kyung Suk Lee et al.",,"immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E; adolescent; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; epidemiological data; female; groups by age; health survey; human; immunoglobulin blood level; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; prevalence; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking; age; atopic dermatitis; blood; infant; nutrition; pathophysiology; preschool child; risk factor; South Korea; Adolescent; Age Factors; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Male; Nutrition Surveys; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85029184408

A total of 27 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included and received definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patterns of primary tumor regression and development of locoregional recurrences were evaluated by imaging studies every 1 to 2 months. Primary tumors gradually regressed over the period of follow-up. The median time to full regression was 4.9 months (range, 1.5-19.4). In 61.5% of patients, the primary tumor continued to regress for >4 months after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Six patients experienced locoregional recurrence during follow-up, all of which occurred after full regression of the primary tumor. A patient group with delayed regression did not have poorer prognosis than a patient group with early regression. Older age, non-current-smoker status, advanced T stage, and higher daily radiation dose were significantly associated with delayed primary tumor regression. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma continued to regress for >4 months after chemoradiotherapy in a considerable number of patients.

We examined the effects of Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with thiolated beta cyclodextrin (AuNP-S--CD) as a delivery vehicle in this study. The inhibitory effect of BC on the growth of HeLa cells was measured using a cell counting kit (CCK-8) and LIVE/DEAD cell assay; Hoechst 33342 staining and electrophoresis were used to explore the mechanism underlying cell inhibition. The formation of AuNPs and AuNP-S--CD-BC was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. The ability of AuNP-S--CD-BC to induce apoptosis of HeLa cells was examined by CCK-8 assay and western blot. BC was shown to significantly inhibit the proliferation of HeLa cells via induction of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Similar effects were seen following treatment with AuNP-S--CD, including a significant decrease in the proliferation of HeLa cells compared with controls (P < 0001). According to western blot analysis, there was increased expression of Apaf-1 and cleavage of caspase-3 in response to AuNP-SH--CD-BC relative to controls. Taken together, these findings indicate that AuNP-S--CD-BC inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells by inducing apoptosis, making AuNP-S--CD-BC could be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cervical cancer.

Recently, we developed a new equation to estimate serum apoB (apoBE). We validated the clinical relevance of apoBE and compared the performance of the equation with conventional lipid measurements and direct measurement of apoB. Materials and Methods: Study subjects were recruited from patients who visited the Health Screening Center at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital between January and December 2009 for routine medical examinations (n=78125). For analysis of coronary calcium score, we recruited study subjects from the same institution between January 2007 and December 2010 (n=16493). Results: apoBE was significantly correlated with serum high-sensitivity C-reactive level {r=0.18 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.18–0.19]} in partial correlation analysis adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index. apoBE was associated with a Framingham risk score indicating more than moderate risk (10-year risk ?10%), the presence of microalbuminuria, and the presence of coronary artery calcium in multivariate logistic regression analysis. These associations were comparable to those of directly-measured serum apoB [odds ratio per 1 SD 3.02 (2.75–3.27) vs. 2.70 (2.42–3.02) for a Framingham risk score indicating more than moderate risk, 1.31 (1.21–1.41) vs. 1.35 (1.25–1.45) for the presence of microalbuminuria, and 1.33 (1.26–1.41) vs. 1.31 (1.23–1.38) for the presence of coronary calcium score respectively]. These findings were also consistently observed in subgroup analysis for subjects with type 2 diabetes.

There is a negative relationship between sleep deprivation and health. However, no study has investigated the effect of sleep deprivation on individuals with different body composition. The aim of this study was to determine the differential effect of sleep deprivation in individuals with different body compositions (fluid) according to Soyang type (SY) and Taeeum type (TE). Methods. Sixty-Two cognitively normal, middle-Aged people with normal sleep patterns were recruited from the local population.The duration of participants' sleep was restricted to 4 h/day during the intervention phase. To examine the physiological changes brought on by sleep deprivation and recovery, 10ml of venous blood was obtained. Results. Total BodyWater (TBW) and Extracellular Water (ECW) were significantly different between the groups in the intervention phase. Physiological parameters also varied from the beginning of the resting phase to the end of the experiment. Potassium levels changed more in SY than TE individuals. Conclusion. Participants responded differently to the same amount of sleep deprivation depending on their Sasang constitution types. This study indicated that SY individuals were more sensitive to sleep deprivation and were slower to recover from the effects of sleep deprivation than TE individuals. ? 2017 Seung Min Hong et al.",,alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; calcium; creatinine; potassium; sodium; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body fluid; body height; body weight; calcium blood level; creatinine blood level; extracellular fluid; female; follow up; human; human experiment; intervention study; kidney function; Korean medicine; liver function; male; normal human; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; potassium blood level; prospective study; sleep deprivation; sleep pattern; sleep time; sodium blood level; total body water; urea nitrogen blood level; venous blood,2-s2.0-85021625354

In particular, we estimate the degree of variance in college graduates' employment that can be attributed to college-level factors using multi-level data provided by EduData Service System (EDSS) in Korea. Findings indicate that male students majoring in the areas of medicine or engineering and who obtain state-authorized certificates and have study-abroad experiences have a higher probability of being employed. The estimation of intra-class correlation coefficient also indicates that 23.3 percent of the probability of college graduates' employment can be attributed to college factors. When unobserved college factors alone, such as colleges' efforts to support their students' employment, are taken into account, 14.8 percent of employment is still attributable to college-level factors. These findings have clear implications for the role of colleges in improving their graduates' job market performance. ?

A quasiexperimental pretest/posttest control group design was employed. Samples were total 70 patients (aroma gargling: 24 samples, cold gargling: 24 samples, and wet gauze: 22 samples) after spine surgery in K Hospital in Seoul, Korea. The aroma gargle solution as an experimental intervention was prepared by blending peppermint, tea tree, and lemon oils at a ratio of 1:2:2. A 60 cc of aroma gargle solution was used 3 times for 15 to 20 seconds. The visual analog scale was used to measure the degrees of thirst and sore throat, and a portable device was used to examine the degree of halitosis. There were significant differences in the degrees of thirst, halitosis, and sore throat according to interaction between group and duration. In the comparison among 3 groups, aroma gargling provided better oral health by decreasing thirst, halitosis, and sore throat for patients with spine surgery.

Materials and Methods: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was designed to include patients treated with dental implants from 2003 to 2014. The variables included age, sex, systemic disease, bone graft, implant placement date, position of dental implant, length of dental implant, diameter of dental implant, loading time, type of prosthesis, type of opposing occlusion, latest check date, and survival or loss of the dental implant. The demographic and clinical variables' influence on the survival of dental implants was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The position and diameter were adjusted for the accurate estimation of the relationship between the prosthesis type and survival of the dental implant with the Cox proportional hazard method. Results: A total of 1,151 dental implants from 403 patients were ascertained. After adjusting for the confounding effect of position and diameter, single-crown prostheses were 38.1 (95% CI: 15.1-118) times more likely to be lost than the connected-type prostheses. For single-crown implants, the waiting time for osseointegration before loading was the highest for the maxillary molar position and the lowest for the mandibular molar position (P <.0001), while the most frequent implant loss occurred in the maxillary anterior area, and the second frequent area was the maxillary molar position; the lowest occurrence of implant loss was for the mandibular molar position. This disparity was statistically significant (P =.0271). Conclusion: Despite the high survival rates of endosseous implants as a whole, since the variation of implant loss was observed among the different anatomical positions for single-crown implants, special attention has to be given to the maxillary anterior and maxillary molar positions. A longer healing time assuming compensation for disadvantageous bone quality was not directly effective in increasing implant longevity in the vulnerable positions. ? 2017 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.",Bone quality; Implant position; Loading time; Mortality gap; Osseointegration; Single-crown implant,"adult; aged; alveolar bone loss; clinical trial; dental restoration; female; human; implant-supported denture; male; middle aged; multicenter study; osseointegration; procedures; proportional hazards model; prosthesis design; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; tooth implant; tooth implantation; Adult; Aged; Alveolar Bone Loss; Dental Implantation, Endosseous; Dental Implants; Dental Prosthesis Design; Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported; Dental Restoration Failure; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Osseointegration; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85019836573

VCD directly targets the preantral follicles. Mice were injected with VCD (160 mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 15 days and then with SF dosage 3 times/week for six weeks. To evaluate the effects of SF, body weight, tail skin temperature, uterine weight, lipid profile, and osteocalcin levels were measured. A decrease in body weight and tail skin temperature and an increase in uterine weight were observed upon SF treatment. Moreover, SF treatment significantly decreased total cholesterol, triglyceride, osteocalcin, and low-density lipoprotein levels and low-density/high-density lipoprotein ratio.

Current microscopic imaging methods often lack the ability to accurately determine the extent of malignancy over a large area, due to their limited field of view. In this research we focus on the development of simple mesoscopic (i.e. between microscopic and macroscopic) biomedical imaging device for non-invasive assessment of ECM alterations over a large, heterogeneous area. In our technology development, a telecentric lens, commonly used in machine vision systems but rarely used in biomedical imaging, serves as a key platform to visualize alterations in tissue microenvironments in a label-free manner over a clinically relevant area. In general, telecentric imaging represents a simple, alternative method for reducing unwanted scattering or diffuse light caused by the highly anisotropic scattering properties of biological tissue. In particular, under telecentric imaging the light intensity backscattered from biological tissue is mainly sensitive to the scattering anisotropy factor, possibly associated with the ECM. We demonstrate the inherent advantages of combining telecentric lens systems with hyperspectral imaging for providing optical information of tissue scattering in biological tissue of murine models, as well as light absorption of hemoglobin in blood vessel tissue phantoms. Thus, we envision that telecentric imaging could potentially serve for simple site-specific, tissue-based assessment of stromal alterations over a clinically relevant field of view in a label-free manner, for studying diseases associated with disruption of homeostasis in ECM. ? 2017 SPIE.",Diffuse light suppression; Hyperspectral; Label-free; Large area imaging; Light propagation in tissues; Telecentricity; Tissue anisotropy; Tissue optical properties,Anisotropy; Biopsy; Blood vessels; Diagnosis; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Hyperspectral imaging; Lenses; Light absorption; Light propagation; Medical imaging; Noninvasive medical procedures; Optical properties; Spectroscopy; Tissue engineering; Tissue homeostasis; Diffuse light; HyperSpectral; Label free; Light propagation in tissue; Telecentricity; Tissue optical properties; Tissue,2-s2.0-85019188908

Although the etiology has not been fully elucidated, both environmental and genetic causes are known to be involved. In chronic inflammatory conditions such as IBD, B lymphocytes are chronically stimulated, and they induce monoclonal expansion of plasma cells, sometimes resulting in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Immunomodulators that are commonly used to control inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) blockers could increase the possibility of hematologic malignancy. The pathogenesis of multiple myeloma in association with TNF-a inhibitor therapy is attributed to decreased apoptosis of plasma cell populations.

Raman spectroscopy has demonstrated the possibility of using as diagnostic method for the early detection of precancerous and cancerous lesions in vivo. It also can be used in identifying markers associated with malignant change. However, Raman spectroscopy lacks sufficient sensitivity due to very weak Raman scattering signal or less distinctive spectral pattern. A dual modal approach could be one of the solutions to solve this issue. The level of extracellular pH in cancer tissue is lower than that in normal tissue due to increased lactic acid production, decreased interstitial fluid buffering and decreased perfusion. High sensitivity and specificity required for accurate cancer diagnosis could be achieved by combining the chemical information from Raman spectrum with metabolic information from pH level. Raman spectra were acquired by using a fiber optic Raman probe, a cooled CCD camera connected to a spectrograph and 785 nm laser source. Different transmission spectra depending on tissue pH were measured by a lossy-mode resonance sensor based on fiber optic. The discriminative capability of pH-Raman dual modal method was evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA). The obtained results showed that the pH-Raman dual modal approach can improve discriminative capability between normal and cancerous tissue, which can lead to very high sensitivity and specificity. The proposed method for cancer detection is expected to be used in endoscopic diagnosis later. ? 2017 SPIE.",Cancer detection; Diagnosis; Dual modal; Endoscope; PCA; PH; Raman,CCD cameras; Diagnosis; Diseases; Endoscopy; Fiber optics; Fibers; Lactic acid; Optical fibers; pH; pH sensors; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Tissue; Cancer detection; Dual modal; Fiber optic Raman probe; Lactic acid production; Lossy mode resonances; Metabolic information; Raman; Transmission spectrums; Principal component analysis,2-s2.0-85018892846

Cold treatment induced the activation of RhoA in pericytes and vascular endothelial cells, however this was reduced by treatment with AG. Furthermore, AG treatment reduced the endothelin-1 (ET-1)-mediated RhoA activation in pericytes; however, cold-induced ET-1 production by vascular endothelial cells was not affected by treatment with AG. In addition, AG treatment suppressed the formation of stress fbers and focal adhesion complexes, and the cold-induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src and extracellular signal-related kinase. Therefore, AG treatment demonstrated an ability to reduce cold-induced RhoA activation in pericytes and vascular endothelial cells, and attenuated ET-1-mediated RhoA activation in pericytes.

OBJECTIVE: To examine if a bilateral 20-min lower-extremity joint cooling alters maximal vertical jump heights over time. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy male basketball and volleyball players participated in this cross over study. One of three conditions was assigned for each session (ankle or knee joint cooling, or control). Subjects performed three maximal vertical jumps with (countermovement jump: CMJ) and without (squat jump: SJ) using muscle pre-stretching and arm swinging at baseline and after condition (0-, 10-, 20-, and 30-min post). To test joint cooling effects over time, we performed 3 × 5 mixed model ANOVAs and Tukey-Kramer tests. RESULTS: Both joint cooling altered CMJ heights (F8,280 = 2.29; p = 0.02). Compared to the baseline measurements, subjects jumped lower after condition (ankle: 4.3 cm; knee: 3.5 cm, p &lt; 0.0001) but their jump heights returned to the baseline levels after 10-min post-joint cooling (p &gt; 0.16). SJ heights did not change at any time interval (F8,280 = 1.67; p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral joint cooling does not produce a facilitatory effect during a high-intensity dynamic movement. Cryotherapy at the lower extremity joints should be done ten minutes before games or practices to avoid a performance deficit in vertical jump heights. ? 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

BRGP suppressed the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 from HMC-1 stimulated with PMA and A23187. Furthermore, the oral administration of BRGP markedly significantly reduced apparent severity of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions, ear swelling, lymph node weight gains and serum IgE levels induced by TMA in mice. BRGP treatment also ameliorated epidermal hyperplasia and infiltration of inflammatory cells including mast cells.

The head and neck portion of the rando phantom was subjected to a CT scan. The tomotherapy plan was designed to ensure delivery of the prescribed total 70 Gy day 2.2 Gy. With the lens portion of the glass dosimeter, a 5mm bolus was subjected to the scattered radiation treatment, and the dose was measured in each of the three megavoltage CT (MVCT) modes. The result is multiplied by 30 times and was determined once as the mean value. The measurement at the MVCT Coarse mode is RT mode 10.797 mGy, that for the Normal mode is 13.360 mGy, for the Fine mode is a maximum of 22.872 mGy, and for the treatment mode is 895.830 mGy. A small amount of scattered radiation in the MVCT is measured in the lens scattered radiation, but scattered radiation during treatment was measured to be near 1 Gy on the lens. Compared to a one-time radiation treatment of 2.2 Gy, the survey showed something unexpected in that it was half the value of that research to the patient. Therefore, will be aware of how much of an influence there will be on sensitive organs, such as the lens by scattered radiation generated during intensity modulated radiation therapy. ?The Korean Magnetics Society.

Cases due to monoclonal gammopathy occurring in plasma cell disorder have been infrequently reported. Here we report a case of PRCA associated plasma cell disorder, especially monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Methods: A 55-year-old male visited the ER due to general weakness. At his initial visit he exhibited severe anemia. Mild intravascular hemolysis was suspected. For anemia evaluation, BM examination was performed. In BM aspi-ration, almost no erythroid precursor cells were observed. Also, plasma cells were relatively elevated, at 7.2%. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation revealed paraproteinemia of 5.1 g/L (IgG and lambda). No hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency or lytic bone lesions were found. This unusual case showed MGUS accompanied by PCRA. We were also able to assume the erythroid cell-specific restriction due to paraprotein, because we ruled out possible causes of PRCA. Results: We discovered several reported cases associated with plasma cell dyscrasia. However, most of these cases involved plasma cell myeloma, characterized by high immunoglobulin burden. Our case demonstrates that PRCA is also observed in cases with MGUS, where immunoglobulin burden is low. Conclusions: It is not yet accurately known, what parts of erythroid precursors are targeted by M-protein nor what the mechanism is.

Therefore, this study was performed to develop and validate a self-assessment score for MetS risk in non-obese Korean adults. Methods and Study Design: Data from the fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES IV), 2007-2009 were used to develop a MetS risk score. We included a total of 5,508 non-obese participants aged 19-64 years who were free of a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, stroke, angina, or cancer. Multivariable logistic regression model coefficients were used to assign each variable category a score. The validity of the score was assessed in an independent population survey performed in 2010 and 2011, KNHANES V (n=3,892). Results: Age, BMI, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, dairy consumption, dietary habit of eating less salty and food insecurity were selected as categorical variables. The MetS risk score value varied from 0 to 13, and a cut-point MetS risk score of ?7 was selected based on the highest Youden index. The cut-point provided a sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 61%, positive predictive value of 14%, and negative predictive value of 98%, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78. Consistent results were obtained in the validation data sets.

Nevertheless, MI in terms of facial movement has not been studied extensively; thus, in the present study, we investigated shared neural networks between facial motor imagery (FMI) and facial motor execution (FME). In addition, FMI somatotopy within-face was investigated between the forehead and the mouth. Functional MRI was used to examine 34 healthy individuals with ME and MI paradigms for the forehead and the mouth. The general linear model and a paired t-test were performed to define the facial area in the primary motor cortex (M1) and this area has been used to investigate somatotopy between the forehead and mouth FMI. FMI recruited similar brain motor areas as FME, but showed less neural activity in all activated regions. The facial areas in M1 were distinguishable from other body movements such as finger movement. Further investigation of this area showed that forehead and mouth imagery tended to lack a somatotopic representation for position on M1, and yet had distinct characteristics in terms of neural activity level. FMI showed different characteristics from general MI as the former exclusively activated facial processing areas. In addition, FME and FMI showed different characteristics in terms of BOLD signal level, while sharing the same neural areas. The results imply a potential usefulness of MI training for rehabilitation of facial motor disease considering that forehead and mouth somatotopy showed no clear position difference, and yet showed a significant BOLD signal intensity variation. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In this study, we explored the cytoprotective effect of DNAJB6(S) against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion- (MPP+-) induced apoptosis and the underlying molecular mechanisms in cultured LN18 cells from astrocytic tumors. We observed that MPP+ significantly reduced the cell viability and induced apoptosis in LN18 glioblastoma cells. DNAJB6(S) protected LN18 cells against MPP+-induced apoptosis not only by suppressing Bax cleavage but also by inhibiting a series of apoptotic events including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species, and activation of caspase-9.

ST-VABis less invasiveandis associated with less scar formation than surgical excision. Also ST-VABcan avoid unnecessary additional surgery. But ST-VAB has possibility of histologic underestimation of high-risk lesions such as atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia. Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of ST-VAB and mammography-guided localization and excisional biopsy (MGL-EB) for microcalcifications. Patients and Methods: Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent breast biopsy for microcalcification from January 2011 to March 2013. They underwent ST-VAB (n = 22) and MGL-EB (n = 34). The clinicoradiological factors of two groups were evaluated, respectively. The malignancy rate and imaging histologic discordant rate in the two groups were assessed. We evaluated follow-up studies of all patients for newly developed or missed breast cancer. Results: The malignancy rates were 13.6% (3/22) for ST-VAB and 17.6% (6/34) for MGL-EB, respectively. Subsequent surgery was performed in five patients (n = 3, ST-VAB; n = 2, MGL-EB) and they were all confirmed as ductal carcinoma in situ. The discordant rates were 22.7% (5/22) for ST-VAB and 14.7% (5/34) for MGL-EB after imaging-histologic correlation. There was no malignancy detected on follow up studies. Conclusion: ST-VAB and MGL-EB are reliable biopsy methods for microcalcifications. In proper indications, breast microcalcifications could be obtained by each method without missing diagnosis of breast cancer. ? 2016, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iranian Society of Radiology.",Biopsy; Breast diseases; Breast neoplasms; Image-guided biopsy; Mammography,adult; aged; Article; biopsy device; biopsy needle; breast biopsy; breast calcification; breast carcinoma; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic error; female; histopathology; human; image guided biopsy; intraductal carcinoma; mammography; mammography guided localization and excisional biopsy; mammography system; medical record review; middle aged; partial mastectomy; retrospective study; stereotactic biopsy; stereotactic vacuum assisted biopsy,2-s2.0-85013456006

We aimed to do this in our present study. Methods: After a literature review of existing generic HRQoL instruments, a focus group discussion, in-depth interviews, and expert consultations, we selected 30 tentative items for a new HRQoL measure. These items were evaluated by assessing their ceiling effects, difficulty, and redundancy in the first survey. To validate the HRQoL instrument that was developed, known-groups validity and convergent/discriminant validity were evaluated and its test-retest reliability was examined in the second survey. Results: Of the 30 items originally assessed for the HRQoL instrument, four were excluded due to high ceiling effects and six were removed due to redundancy. We ultimately developed a HRQoL instrument with a reduced number of 20 items, known as the Health-related Quality of Life Instrument with 20 items (HINT-20), incorporating physical, mental, social, and positive health dimensions. The results of the HINT-20 for known-groups validity were poorer in women, the elderly, and those with a low income. For convergent/discriminant validity, the correlation coefficients of items (except vitality) in the physical health dimension with the physical component summary of the Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2) were generally higher than the correlations of those items with the mental component summary of the SF-36v2, and vice versa. Regarding test-retest reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient of the total HINT-20 score was 0.813 (p<0.001). Conclusions: A novel generic HRQoL instrument, the HINT-20, was developed for the Korean general population and showed acceptable validity and reliability. ?

It depresses the transmission of monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflex by stimulating GABAβ (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic characteristics of two 10-mg baclofen formulations and to assess bioequivalence. Methods: A randomized, single-dose, two-period, twosequence crossover study was conducted in healthy male subjects. Each subject received the test or reference formulations. After washout period, all subjects received the alternative formulation. Blood samples were collected for up to 24 hours after the dose in each period. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including tmax, Cmax, and AUClast were calculated by noncompartmental methods. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the test to the reference formulation and its 90% confidence interval (CI) for Cmax and AUClast were calculated for assessment of bioequivalence. Results: A total of 22 subjects completed the study. The median tmax of the test and the reference formulation were 1.50 and 1.25 hours, respectively. The mean (± SD) Cmax of the test and the reference formulation were 141.401 ± 29.447 ng/ mL and 138.837 ± 31.392 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (± SD) AUClast of the two formulations were 702.404 ± 82.149 ng×h/mL and 726.803 ± 90.638 ng×h/mL, respectively. The GMR (90% CI) of the test to the reference formulation for the Cmax and AUClast were 1.0306 (0.9564 - 1.1106) and 0.9674 (0.9437 - 0.9916), respectively. Conclusions: The two different baclofen 10-mg formulations had similar PK profiles and were bioequivalent based on Cmax and AUClast. ? 2017 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

Materials and Methods Patients who underwent ASCT in the upfront or salvage setting between January 2000 and December 2013 were analyzed. Patients were dichotomized according to the TBI group (n=38) and non-TBI group (n=60) based on the type of conditioning regimen for ASCT. Results Patients with responsive disease underwent upfront ASCT (TBI, n=16; non-TBI, n=29) whereas patients with refractory disease (TBI, n=9; non-TBI, n=12) or relapsed disease (TBI, n=13; non-TBI, n=19) underwent ASCT after salvage treatment. Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were manageable, and the median cumulative toxicity score according to Seattle criteria was estimated as 2 (range 0 to 7) in both groups. No significant difference in 100-day mortality was observed between the TBI (13% 5/38) and non-TBI (12% 12/60) groups, and most deaths were related to disease progression. There was no difference in overall and progression-free survival; however, the TBI group showed a trend of better survival in upfront and salvage ASCT than the non-TBI group. However, patients with refractory disease showed the worst outcome regardless of the use of TBI. Patients who showed complete response before ASCT showed better progression-free survival than those who showed partial response. Conclusion TBI could be used as an effective part of conditioning for ASCT in patients with mature T- and NK-cell lymphomas. ? 2017 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Lymphoma; Nutural killer cells; Stem cell transplantation; T-lymphocytes; Whole-body irradiation,"asparaginase; busulfan; carmustine; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; dexamethasone; doxorubicin; etoposide; ifosfamide; melphalan; mesna; methotrexate; prednisone; steroid; thiotepa; vincristine; antineoplastic agent; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; blood toxicity; cancer growth; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; comparative effectiveness; female; human; major clinical study; male; multiple cycle treatment; NK T cell lymphoma; progression free survival; retrospective study; T cell lymphoma; treatment outcome; treatment response; whole body radiation; autotransplantation; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; middle aged; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; NK T cell lymphoma; nonhodgkin lymphoma; procedures; salvage therapy; survival analysis; transplantation conditioning; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Salvage Therapy; Survival Analysis; Transplantation Conditioning; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Whole-Body Irradiation; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85010377734

Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and to evaluate the bioequivalence of two formulations of talniflumate 370 mg tablets (test formulation: Flumagen? 370 mg tablet; reference formulation: Somalgen? 370 mg tablet). Methods: A randomized, open-label, single dose, two-sequence, two-period crossover clinical study was conducted. After oral administration of the study drug in each period, blood samples were collected up to 15 hours post-dose. The plasma concentration of niflumic acid, a metabolite of talniflumate, was determined using HPLC-MS/MS. The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by non-compartmental method. Results: The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from zero to the time point with the last measurable concentration (AUClast) for the test formulation were 290.7 ± 199 μg/L and 1,154 ± 643 μg×h/L, respectively, and the corresponding values for the reference formulation were 286.8 ± 193 μg/L and 1,151 ± 577 μg×h/L, respectively. The geometric mean ratio and 90% confidence intervals (CI) of the test formulation to the reference formulation for the Cmax and AUClast were 0.983 (0.829 - 1.166) and 0.979 (0.856 - 1.121), respectively. Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic profiles of the test and reference formulations were found not to be significantly different, meeting the Korean regulatory criteria for bioequivalence. ? 2017 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

A 50-year-old man who underwent simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation 14 months previously was admitted with large pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and ascites. Laboratory findings and cultures for possible infectious causes were all negative. Pericardial window surgery with drainage of the pericardial fluid was performed on day 3. Pleural and pericardial biopsy revealed non-specific inflammation without evidence of malignant cells. Everolimus was discontinued and replaced by mycophenolate mofetil on day 4.

Objective: This study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and assess the bioequivalence of two different formulations of morniflumate 350-mg tablets in healthy Korean male subjects. Methods: A randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence crossover study was conducted with 38 subjects. Subjects received a single dose of two tablets of either a test or a reference formulation and the alternated formulation in the next period. Serial blood samples for the PK analysis were collected over 12 hours. PK parameters were determined by a noncompartment analysis. PK parameters, including the maximum concentration (Cmax) and the area un-der-the-concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) were compared in bio-equivalence tests. Results: The Cmax of the test and reference formulations were 985.72 ± 6.80 mg/L and 947.09 ± 6.73 mg/L, respectively, while the AUClast values were 2675.92 ± 7.84 mg×h/L and 2653.06 ± 7.78 mg×h/L, respectively. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of the test formulation to the reference formulation for Cmax and AUClast were 1.0715 (0.9469 - 1.2124) and 1.0592 (0.9592 - 1.1695), respectively. Conclusions: The new formulation of morniflumate 350-mg tablet showed a PK profile similar to that of the marketed formulation, and the results of this study fell within in the conventional criteria of bioequivalence. ? 2017 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

In this study, we sought to compare the response of lipid-rich plaque to statin therapy in elderly versus younger patients using optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound. Patients and methods Sixty-nine patients who underwent serial optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound at the time point of baseline, 6, and 12 months were divided into two groups according to median age: group A (age<57 years, n=35) and group B (age?57 years, n=34). Patients were treated with intensive (atorvastatin 60 mg/day) or moderate (atorvastatin 20 mg/day or rosuvastatin 10 mg/day) statin therapy. Results A continuous increase in fibrous-cap thickness (FCT) from baseline to 12 months was observed in both groups (P<0.001, <0.001, respectively). Intensive statin induced greater percent change in FCT at 12 months than moderate statin in group B (P=0.020), but not in group A (P=0.251). Mean lipid arc decreased significantly at 12 months in two groups (P<0.001, <0.001, respectively), and this response was delayed for 6 months (P=0.403) and began to decrease during the second 6 months (P<0.001) in group B. Normalized total atheroma volume decreased significantly in group A (P<0.001), but not in group B (P=0.349). Conclusion Statin therapy could stabilize lipid-rich plaque irrespective of age, and intensive statin therapy was more effective than a moderate dose of statin in increasing FCT, particularly in older patients. A delayed response of lipid content and unfavorable change in normalized total atheroma volume to statin were observed in elderly patients. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Whether Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) negatively affects the natural course of SCH was investigated in pediatric patients without concomitant diseases. Predictors for levothyroxine medication were also evaluated. Medical records of 109 children with SCH (91 girls, 5-18 years) diagnosed between 2005 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified into HT (n=37) and isolated non-autoimmune hyperthyrotropinemia (iso-NAHT, n=72). During median 2 years of follow-up, only 10.1% of SCH patients eventually initiated levothyroxine, and HT patients showed a higher probability of requiring levothyroxine medication than iso-NAHT patients (21.6% vs. 4.2%). Underlying HT independently predicted deterioration of thyroid function, leading to levothyroxine medication (hazard ratios [HRs], 4.6 vs. iso-NAHT, P=0.025). High titers of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAbs) predicted later medication in the HT group (HRs, 28.2 vs. normal TGAbs, P=0.013). Most pediatric SCH showed benign and self-remitting courses.

Patient preference is integral to the selection of anti-TNFs and their routes of administration, however, previous studies on the patient preference to anti-TNFs are inconsistent and limited. We evaluated the predictive factors for preferences to anti-TNF administrations in IBD patients between March and August in 2015. Consecutive adult IBD patients who received care at one of four university hospitals in Korea were invited to participate in this study. Patients were administered questionnaires about their preferences regarding anti-TNF therapy and QOL. During the study period, 322 IBD patients completed the questionnaires. IBD patients preferred intravenous anti-TNFs to subcutaneous anti-TNFs (2.4:1), and 58.4% of patients preferred shared decision-making. When comparing subcutaneous anti-TNF therapy with intravenous anti-TNF therapy, patients with higher income levels, patients who experienced adverse events with prior medication and patients with a longer disease duration preferred subcutaneous anti-TNF therapy over intravenous anti-TNF therapy (P=0.043, P=0.000, and P=0.029, respectively). In a logistic regression analysis, high income level (odds ratio [OR] 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.5; P=0.026) and an adverse event with prior medication (OR 4.0; 95% CI 2.2-7.2; P=0.000) and were found to be independent predictors for preference to subcutaneous anti-TNF therapy.

Another patient with ITP had sustained remission after steroid therapy in childhood, but extensive uterine bleeding and thrombocytopenia recurred when she was 16 years old. She was managed with steroids again for 2 years, but severe side effects occurred, and eventually she ceased taking steroids. She refused a splenectomy, and was then treated with a herbal medicine for 7 months, ultimately leading to sustained remission again.

The objective of this study is to determine whether the fasting serum insulin concentration influences future incidence of MetS. Methods A total of 14,621 Korean men without MetS participating in a medical health check-up program were followed up from 2005 until 2010. They were divided into 4 groups according to baseline fasting insulin concentrations. The incidence of MetS was compared among the groups, and Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine if MetS was associated with higher fasting insulin concentration. Results The incidence of MetS increased according to the baseline fasting insulin concentration (first quartile: 8.4%, second quartile: 12.3%, third quartile: 16.3%, fourth quartile: 26.5%, P?<?0.001). Even after adjusting for multiple covariates, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for MetS was higher for the second (1.13 (0.93–1.37)), third (1.29 (1.06–1.56)) and fourth quartile group (1.70 (1.36–2.13)), compared to the first quartile group (P for trend <?0.001). Conclusion The incidence of MetS increased proportionally to fasting insulin concentration. Additionally, increased fasting insulin concentration was an independent risk factor for the future development of MetS. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Hyperinsulinemia; Insulin; Metabolic syndrome,insulin; insulin; adult; Article; controlled study; fatty liver; follow up; hazard ratio; human; hyperinsulinemia; incidence; insulin blood level; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; priority journal; risk assessment; South Korean; blood; diet restriction; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; risk; South Korea; Adult; Fasting; Humans; Insulin; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Risk,2-s2.0-84995968222

Background: The optimal interval for FIT in CRC screening is unclear, especially in Asian populations. Study: Between January 2009 and December 2015, 13,480 individuals aged 50 years or older with an initial negative FIT result underwent 2 rounds of FIT screening at intervals of 1 (annual group, 5333), 2 (biennial group, 7363), or 3 years (triennial group, 784). Positive rates of FIT, colonoscopy acceptance, colonoscopy findings, and detection rates for CRC and advanced neoplasia were compared according to FIT intervals. Results: The overall positivity rate of FIT in the second screening round was significantly higher in men and in older subjects than in the entire sample. Younger subjects were less likely to undergo annual FIT (36.0% vs. 46.4%, P<0.001). The colonoscopy acceptance rate was decreased in the biennial and triennial groups compared with an annual group among younger subjects (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.95 for the biennial group vs. odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-1.37 for the triennial group). Detection rates for CRC and advanced neoplasia in the second round were significantly higher and accompanied by increased FIT screening intervals in older, but not younger subjects.

Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study. From May 2003 to March 2015, 53 image-guided placements of uncovered stents (44 initial placements, 9 secondary placements) were attempted in 44?patients (male:female?=?23:21; mean age, 71.8?years). The technical and clinical success, complication rates, and patency rates of the stents were also evaluated. Technical success was defined as the successful deployment of the stent under fluoroscopic guidance alone and clinical success was defined as the relief of obstructive symptoms or signs within 48?h of stent deployment. Results: In total, 12 (27.3?%) patients underwent preoperative decompression, while 32 (72.7?%) underwent decompression with palliative intent. The technical success rate was 93.2?% (41/44) for initial placement and 88.9?% (8/9) for secondary placement. Secondary stent placement in the palliative group was required in nine patients after successful initial stent placement due to stent obstruction from tumor ingrowth (n?=?7) and stent migration (n?=?2). The symptoms of obstruction were relieved in all successful cases (100?%). In the palliative group, the patency rates were 94.4?% at 1?month, 84.0?% at 3?months, 64.8?% at 6?months, and 48.6?% at 12?months. Conclusions: The radiologic placement of uncovered stents for the treatment of malignant obstruction proximal to the descending colon is feasible and safe, and provides acceptable clinical results. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",Colon cancer; Interventional; Obstruction; Proximal colon; Radiology; Self-expanding metallic stents,"adult; aged; angiographic catheter; Article; clinical article; clinical outcome; colon obstruction; colon radiography; colon stent; descending colon; feasibility study; female; fluoroscopy system; human; in-stent restenosis; male; medical record review; patient safety; priority journal; retrospective study; self expanding nitinol stent; stent migration; vascular guide wire; Colorectal Neoplasms; complication; descending colon; Intestinal Obstruction; middle aged; stent; treatment outcome; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colon, Descending; Colorectal Neoplasms; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Stents; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84991373097

Methods: The C-tube components are titanium anchor plates and monocortical screws that are basically similar to any other miniplate systems, but it has the unique characteristic of the tube head to be malleable. The manipulation of the head part is easy due to the composition of pure titanium. The I-shaped C-tube with 3 holes and T-shaped C-tube miniplates were placed above the apices of maxillary molars as an absolute anchorage system to intrude the posterior maxilla. The bending of the tube heads assisted in reduction of severe open bite patient with maxillary sinus pneumatization. Results: Sinus perforation during placement of skeletal anchorage system weakens stability of the anchorage and further cause complications. Placement of titanium C-tube miniplates allowed reliable skeletal anchorage and avoided maxillary sinus perforation in patients with extreme pneumatizations. Simple bending of C-tube miniplates ensured increased orthodontic intrusion force without having to replace them, and eliminated consequences such as perforation of maxillary sinus, sinusitis, soft tissue irritation, or infection. Conclusions: Anatomic difficulties in the placement of temporary anchorage device can be easily managed by using the bendable Ctube miniplate. It can serve as a great alternative over miniscrews or regular miniplates with reduced risk of sinus perforation and ability to bend the head portion to control orthodontic vectors and forces. ? 2016 by Mutaz B.

Chronic hepatitis B causes various complications including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and approximately 0.5~4.2 million deaths occur annually due to HBV infection. Current therapies such as antivirals and vaccine are often hampered by drug intolerance, side effects, and long-time medication, therefore, the development of powerful anti-HBV drugs is demanded. Recently, sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) receptor was revealed to play a pivotal role in HBV entry into hepatocytes. Cell lines transfected with NTCP receptor enables to analyze HBV life cycle by inducing HBV infection stably, but in vivo models still have some limitations such as high costs, restrictive differentiation, and unveiled cofactors related to human NTCP. Therefore, it requires well-established in vivo models to develop and evaluate novel therapeutic agents targeting NTCP receptor, and viral entry inhibitors that inhibit the early step of viral infection are potent sufficient to substitute for existing antivirals. ? 2016, Chonnam National University Medical School.

The recent stroke prevention strategies have targeted risk factors for preventing ischemic stroke. Community-based data that quantify the prevalence of these risk factors are needed to develop effective stroke prevention strategies. This study was performed aiming to establish customized prevention strategies by investigating vascular risk factors of ischemic stroke among the healthy adults in an urban population in Korea. Methods: The Prevention of Stroke and Dementia (PRESENT) survey collected data associated with stroke risk factors between 2007 and 2009 in Ansan city, Korea. Of 46,537 people, 2,843 were selected by random sampling, and final population included 358 men and 422 women over 50 years old. We checked modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and physical inactivity. Results: The mean age of study subjects was 60.1±8.2 years; 55.5% had hypertension, 18.6% had diabetes mellitus, 17.7% were current smoker, 44.9% had hyperlipidemia, 1.7% had atrial fibrillation, and 4.5% had cardiovascular disease. Men had more risk factors for stroke, and higher rates of diabetes mellitus and current smoking. However, women had higher cholesterol and obesity rates and lower physical activity. The proportion of individuals with >1 risk factor for stroke increased with age. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases also increased with age, but low-density lipoprotein levels and current smoking decreased. Conclusions: This study provides valuable information to develop customized strategic policies for primary and secondary stroke prevention. ? 2016, ASEAN Neurological Association.

Male C57BL/6J mice were treated with HFD, HFD+catechin, and HFD+PC [two different doses, 20 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) and 100 mg/kg b.w.] in each AIN93G supplement for 8 weeks. Treatment of HFD mice with both low and high doses of PC significantly reduced body weight gain compared to HFD mice. Liver weight of mice was reduced in both the low and high dose PC-supplemented groups (24.19% and 19.83%, respectively). Total adipose tissue weight of mice was reduced in both the low and high dose PC-supplemented groups (45.54% and 62.66%, respectively). Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol were reduced in the low and high dose PC-supplemented groups, and ratios of HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol increased by 94.55% in the high dose PC-supplemented group. Serum leptin was significantly reduced in the low and high dose PC-supplemented groups (28.14% and 62.72%, respectively). These results were supported by genetic expression of protein and enzymes related to lipid metabolism assessed by real-time PCR. There was significant reduction of lipid regulatory transcription factors such as PPAR-γ, C/EBP, and SREBP and lipid enzymes such as fatty acid synthesis and lipoprotein lipase in the low and high dose PC-supplemented groups. However, there was no statistical difference between low and high dose PC treatments. These results suggest that pine cone supercritical extract supplementation is able to regulate serum lipid profiles by reducing total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol levels, followed by regulation of expression of lipid metabolic factors, resulting in reduction of weight gain in HFD-induced obese mice. ? 2016, Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.

MS is a disease of malfunctioned immune system where infiltrating immune cells are stimulated by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation and cause blood–brain barrier disruption followed by the destruction of myelin sheath by concurrent activation of cytokines. hCG is responsible for the expression and activation of MMPs and regulation of cytokines in different cells. Mice were implanted with the osmotic pump containing hCG and luteinizing hormone (LH) which maintain their release for 4?weeks with constant velocity. The activities of MMP-9 and NADPH oxidase and the levels of cytokines were measured in the plasma and the CNS tissues. The hCG treated EAE mice showed a decrease in body weights, increased mortality, accelerated onset stage and amplified EAE severity. MMP-9 activity was increased significantly in the EAE+hCG group compared to EAE group in both CNS and plasma. We also found increased activity of NADPH oxidase in plasma at onset stage and in brain tissues at day 38. IL-6 and IL-4 levels in brain tissue were found significantly higher in EAE+hCG group than in EAE group. EAE+LH group mice showed early onset patterns like EAE+hCG group and MMP-9 and NADPH oxidase levels were higher than EAE group, but cytokines levels were not significantly different from EAE group. We suggest that hCG treatment should be considered carefully as multiple or constant hCG treatment could exacerbate aggravation of MS induction and clinical symptoms. ? 2016, The Korean Society of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology.",Cytokine; Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; Human chorionic gonadotropin; Luteinizing hormone; Matrix metalloproteinase-9; Multiple sclerosis,chorionic gonadotropin; gamma interferon; gelatinase B; interleukin 17; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; luteinizing hormone; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; allergic encephalomyelitis; animal model; Article; biochemical analysis; CD3+ T lymphocyte; CD4 lymphocyte count; controlled study; enzyme activity; male; mortality; mouse; multiple sclerosis; nonhuman; osmotic pump; priority journal; weight reduction,2-s2.0-85007605347

Among them three studies of 139 patients reported a significant improvement in STAXI-E-in and BDI than control group in the treatment group while no significant improvement in STAXI-S, STAXI-T, STAXI-E-con and STAXI-E-out. The four studies of 189 patients reported a significant improvement in STAI in the treatment group. The results of the included studies suggest that Korean medicine is efficacious for Hwa-byung patients in some specific scale. More research and well-designed, rigorous, and large clinical trials are necessary to address these issues. ? 2016, Institute of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Concise report; Hwa-byung; Korean medicine; Meta-analysis; Randomized controlled trials; Systemic review,herbaceous agent; placebo; acupuncture; anger syndrome; Beck Depression Inventory; behavior disorder; drug efficacy; herbal medicine; human; Korean medicine; Likert scale; meta analysis; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory; systematic review; therapy effect; watchful waiting,2-s2.0-85007163166

The purpose of the study was to determine the feasibility of using the video in a web-based suicide awareness programme for Asian American and non-Hispanic white college students. Methods A cross-sectional, comparative, web-based study was conducted with 227 Asian Americans and 204 non-Hispanic whites at a university in the Midwest region of the USA. Study participants completed a questionnaire measuring their cultural orientation and attitudes towards suicide, watched the 27 min video, completed a debriefing session and evaluated the video's overall suitability. Results Asian Americans rated the suicide awareness video significantly lower for cultural relevance than did non-Hispanic whites (F=5.479, p=0.02). Collectivist cultural orientation was a significant predictor for cultural relevance, credibility and appeal; however, evaluation of the video's cultural relevance was negatively affected by Asian ethnicity.

The study aimed to introduce how traditional Korean medicine (TKM) applied to smoking cessation programmes in Korea and to show the detail information of each programme for designing other smoke cessation programmes. Methods: Reports of the smoke cessation programmes in Korea were searched on March 10th, 2016, from the webpages of the related agencies and the databases: the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Korea Health Foundation, the Association of Korean Medicine, PubMed, Google scholar, the RISS, the KISS, the NDSL, and the OASIS. Smoking cessation programmes, projects, or services using traditional Korean medicine (TKM) were included with no language, implementation site, and year restrictions. Results: The three smoking cessation programmes using TKM in South Korea were the public health centre smoking cessation programme (PHC-SCP), the Ministry of Gender Equality & Family smoking cessation programme (MOGEF-SCP), and the National Health Insurance Service smoking cessation treatment project (NHIS-SCP). All programmes included ear acupuncture and counselling. Manual acupuncture was only used in the NHIS-SCP. The MOGEF-SCP and the NHIS-SCP used herbal medicines selectively. The PHC-SCP and MOGEF-SCP provided education programme and other tools such as non-smoking doll, self-writing handbook. They were run at no cost for participants. Treatment period were different for each programmes, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 to 12 weeks, respectively. Treatment frequency was twice a week for PHC-SCP and MOGEF-SCP, and dependent on each clinic for NHIS-SCP. Conclusions: This study showed the summaries of the smoking cessation programme that used TKM. The three programmes and the detail information will be a reference for other countries that are going to apply T&CM to their smoking cessation programme. Though TKM integrated smoking cessation programmes had been contributed to stop smoking, persistent efforts are needed to develop more effective and various treatments. In addition, this study suggests that consistent support and systematic reporting system are needed to be successful in non-smoking strategy. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Ear acupuncture; Smoking cessation; Tobacco control; Traditional Korean medicine,"acupuncture; alternative medicine; Article; controlled study; health education; health insurance; herbal medicine; human; Korea; patient counseling; private health insurance; public health; smoking cessation; traditional medicine; adolescent; adult; Korean medicine; procedures; smoking cessation; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Medicine, Korean Traditional; Smoking Cessation; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85000789255

Methods: This study was a retrospective chart review. A total of 138 patients with abnormal liver transaminase levels at the time of admission were included in this study. We evaluated the influence of combined therapy of conventional and herbal medicines on liver transaminase levels over a period of at least 2 weeks at Kyung Hee University Korean Medical Hospital. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 for Windows. Paired T-tests were used to examine the significance of differences in AST, ALT, and GGT levels at the time of admission and discharge. Results: We found that combined therapy reduced levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) to a statistically significant level. Specifically, there were 48, 66, 104 subjects who exhibited abnormal AST, ALT and GGT levels at admission, which was reduced to 13, 37, and 64 subjects after combined therapy, respectively. Some subjects exhibited worsening levels of liver transaminases after combined therapy, so we used the χ2 test to analyze the influence of combined therapy with conventional and herbal medicines on liver function according to initial liver transaminase levels. According to this analysis, ALT and GGT levels may be more important than AST levels in estimating the influence of combined therapy on patients with abnormal liver transaminase levels. Conclusions: Based on this retrospective chart review, combined therapy of conventional and herbal medicines would be considered relatively safe. Thus, if patients have abnormal ALT or GGT levels, caution should be taken when suggesting combined therapy with conventional and herbal medicines. ? 2016 The Author(s).",ALT; AST; Combined therapy of conventional and herbal medicines; GGT; Liver function; Liver transaminases,alanine aminotransferase; anticoagulant agent; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antithrombocytic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; digestive tract agent; gamma glutamyltransferase; muscle relaxant agent; tranquilizer; aminotransferase; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; combination chemotherapy; controlled study; drug safety; female; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; herbal medicine; human; hypertransaminasemia; liver function; major clinical study; male; prevalence; retrospective study; drug effects; enzymology; liver; liver function test; metabolism; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Liver; Liver Function Tests; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Transaminases,2-s2.0-85000774386

This longitudinal study examined the robustness of iris parameters, temperament characteristics (TC), and their relationship over a 1?year period. Methods A total of 70 healthy subjects who participated in the 2013 study were interviewed 1?year later. They were asked to complete the Korean version of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and 6 iris parameters (iris density, pigment, nerve ring, toxic radii, pupil area ratio [PAR], and autonomic nerve wreath area ratio [ANWAR]) were calculated. Subsequently, intra- and inter-rater reliabilities and robustness of the iris parameters were examined using an intra-class coefficient (ICC), and the relationships between the iris parameters and TC scores in 2014 were compared with those recorded in 2013. Finally, decision tree modeling was conducted to examine which iris parameters were related to TC. Results The 6 iris parameters possessed excellent levels of reliability and robustness, ranging from 0.797 to 1.000 of ICCs. Among the 5 significant relationships between iris parameters wereTC scores, iris density and harm avoidance, pigment and reward dependence, ANWAR and persistence had the same significant relationships to those in 2013. Decision tree modeling showed that PAR, iris density, ANWAR, and toxic radii were related to individual TCs (classification accuracy: 77.5–88.9%). Conclusions Iris parameters and the relationships between iris parameters and TC are robust. Iris parameters may serve as a contributing factor to one's TC. ? 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Intra-class coefficient; Iridology; Iris parameters; Longitudinal study; Temperament and Character Inventory,adult; Article; autonomic nerve wreath area ratio; avoidance behavior; comparative study; decision tree; female; follow up; human; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; iris; iris density; iris nerve ring; iris pigment epithelium; iris toxic radii; longitudinal study; male; normal human; personality assessment; priority journal; pupil area ratio; reward; temperament; Temperament and Character Inventory Korean version; visual system parameters,2-s2.0-84992323851

Methods: The medical records of BRONJ patients from 2007 to 2014 were reviewed. The data from only the male patients was extracted, and demographic data was collected and biochemical markers were measured. Results: 11 Patients out of 210 (5?%) being males. Among the 11 patients, the indication of bisphosphonate (BP) was osteoporosis in 9 patients, and cancer in two. In one of the osteoporosis patients, osteoporosis was thought to be secondary to hypogonadism after testicular tumor resection. Serum c-terminal telopetide crosslink of type I collagen (s-CTX) values ranged from 60 to 165?pg/mL (mean: 84.6?±?36.8, median: 70). Serum osteocalcin (s-OC) ranged from 0 to 5.06?ng/mL (mean: 1.83?±?1.66, median: 1.5) and vitamin D ranged from 0 to 11.9 (mean: 5.02?±?4.92, median: 3.5). Conclusion: BRONJ can be overlooked in male patients with osteoporosis. Although the incidence of BRONJ in males may be low, dentists should also check if their male patients are on osteoporosis treatment since osteoporosis in males can be manifested as a secondary disease to hypogonadism. ? 2016, The Author(s).",Bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis; BRONJ; ONJ,,2-s2.0-84984918402

Methods: In this prospective, observational, multicenter study, 797 participants with type 2 diabetes were assessed using CUS, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Risk Engine (UKPDSRE) calculator, and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) algorithm. Health-related behaviors and physician treatments were compared at baseline and at 6 months after assessment. Results: According to CUS, 43.5 % of the participants were at high risk (compared to 10.6 % and 4.3 % using the UKPDSRE and FRS approaches, respectively). Interestingly, 31.5 % of the patients with low risk scores according to the UKPDSRE calculator and 35.8 % of the patients with low risk scores according to the FRS algorithm were found to be at high risk according to CUS. The proportion of patients who achieved target LDL-C levels significantly increased after CUS. Moreover, increased awareness of atherosclerosis through CUS findings significantly altered physician treatment patterns and patient health-related behaviors. Conclusions: Carotid atherosclerosis was detected in more than 30 % of all participants with low or intermediate risk stratification scores. Improved awareness of atherosclerosis through CUS findings had a positive impact on both patient and physician behavior, resulting in improved CV risk management. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Behavior; Cardiovascular disease; Carotid atherosclerosis; Diabetes mellitus; Type 2,"low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; arterial wall thickness; Article; cardiovascular disease assessment; carotid atherosclerosis; carotid ultrasound; echography; female; Framingham risk score; health behavior; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; smoking cessation; sodium restriction; United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Risk Engine calculator; atherosclerosis; behavior; carotid artery; Carotid Artery Diseases; clinical trial; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; diagnostic imaging; follow up; middle aged; multicenter study; pathophysiology; patient; physician; procedures; psychology; risk assessment; risk factor; time factor; United Kingdom; Adult; Atherosclerosis; Behavior; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Artery Diseases; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patients; Physicians; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-84995790795

The pathogenetic mechanism of the tumor-related heterotopic bone formation remains as yet unconfirmed. Here, we describe a rare case of LAMN with ossification in a 72-year-old woman, and concentrate on the etiology of heterotopic ossification by the immunohistochemical evaluation of the novel markers such as BMP9, osteocalcin, and osteopontin. BMP9 is one of the most effective osteogenetic proteins. However, no researches associated with BMP9 in the heterotopic ossification occurring to LAMN have been performed. Consequently, we suggest the trustworthy hypothesis of tumor-associated heterotopic bone formation through this case. When osteoblastic markers such as BMP9, osteocalcin, and osteopontin are overexpressed in tumor cells, osteoblast-like transformation of such tumor cells occurs. In turn, these tumor cells increase secretion of interactive osteogenetic factors, such as BMP9, osteocalcin, and osteopontin, thus contributing to heterotopic bone formation through a microenvironmental change to mesenchymal stromal cells (osteoblastic differentiation). This phenomenon is considered a type of EMT. Patients should be followed closely because EMT-like transformed tumors have shown a tendency toward local recurrence. Our findings provide insight into the pathogenetic etiology of the heterotopic ossification in LAMN (pseudomyxoma peritonei). ? 2016 Elsevier GmbH",BMP9; Heterotopic ossification; Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm; Osteocalcin; Osteopontin; Pseudomyxoma peritonei,"bone morphogenetic protein 9; osteocalcin; osteopontin; tumor marker; tumor marker; aged; appendix tumor; Article; case report; cell transformation; disease association; disease marker; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene overexpression; heterotopic ossification; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm; mesenchymal stroma cell; osteoblast; peritoneum pseudomyxoma; protein secretion; tumor cell; tumor microenvironment; appendix tumor; colloid carcinoma; pathology; peritoneum pseudomyxoma; peritoneum tumor; Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous; Aged; Appendiceal Neoplasms; Biomarkers, Tumor; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Pseudomyxoma Peritonei",2-s2.0-85000763565

However, complications such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and stent migration can occur after the endoscopic insertion of CMSs. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a double-layered CMS (DCMS) for the management of malignant bile duct obstruction. Methods: DCMSs were endoscopically introduced into 59 patients with unresectable malignant extrahepatic biliary obstruction at four tertiary referral centers, and the patient medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Both the technical and functional success rates were 100%. Procedure-related complications including pancreatitis, cholangitis, stent migration, and liver abscess occurred in five patients (8.5%). The median follow-up period was 265 days (range, 31 to 752 days). Cumulative stent patency rates were 68.2% and 40.8% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. At the final follow-up, the rate of stent occlusion was 33.9% (20/59), and the median stent patency period was 276 days (range, 2 to 706 days).

Although a previous in vitro study from our laboratory revealed that DSGOST prevents cold (25-C)-induced RhoA activation and endothelin-1 (ET-1) production in endothelial cells (ECs), the mechanisms by which DSGOST is able to alleviate the symptoms of RP have yet to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to demonstrate that DSGOST regulates RhoA-mediated pathways in cold-exposed pericytes. In pericytes, DSGOST amplified cold-induced RhoA activation, while markedly reducing ET-1-induced RhoA activation. Additionally, DSGOST-mediated regulation of RhoA was closely associated with Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1)/testis-specific kinase 1 (TESK1)/PDXP, but not with LIM domain kinase 1/2 (LIMK1/2), cofilin and myosin light chain (MLC). Thus, DSGOST activation of RhoA/ROCK1/TESK1/PDXP in cold-exposed pericytes appeared to be crucial for treating vessel contraction. In addition, the DSGOST effect on the RhoA-mediated pathway in cold-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells or human dermal microvascular endothelial cells was similar to that in ET-1-treated pericytes, but not in cold-induced pericytes. The results of the present study further confirmed that DSGOST inhibits cold-induced contraction of the mouse tail vein in vivo. Furthermore, DSGOST treatment reduced cold-induced expression of the -2c-adrenergic receptor in mouse tail vessels. Therefore, the data in the present study suggest that DSGOST may be useful for the treatment of RP-like disease.",Actin reorganization; Cold-induced vasospasm; Danggui-Sayuk-Ga-Osuyu-Senggang-Tang; Pericytes -2c adrenergic receptor; Raynaud's phenomenon,"alpha 2C adrenergic receptor; cofilin; coiled coil containing protein kinase 1; Danggui Sayuk Ga Osuyu Senggang Tang; drinking water; endothelin 1; herbaceous agent; LIM kinase 1; LIM kinase 2; myosin light chain; protein; protein PDXP; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; testis specific kinase 1; unclassified drug; alpha 2 adrenergic receptor; endothelin 1; herbaceous agent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; Chinese medicine; cold; controlled study; dermal microvascular endothelial cell; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; endothelium cell; enzyme activation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; pericyte; protein expression; Raynaud phenomenon; tail vein; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vasoconstriction; animal; drug effects; metabolism; signal transduction; vasoconstriction; Animals; Cold Temperature; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Endothelin-1; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Mice; Pericytes; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2; Signal Transduction; Vasoconstriction",2-s2.0-84992365662

BACKGROUND: Despite numerous strategies developed to reduce caregiver injuries, nurses are still experiencing work-related musculoskeletal injuries. A comprehensive SPHM program has been found to be effective in reducing patient handling injuries among nurses. METHODS: By using data from 143 480 RNs working in 321 acute care hospitals in 44 US states, RNs' perceptions on 6 key aspects of SPHM programs were compared between states with and without SPHM legislation and among 11 unit types. RESULTS: Registered nurses in states with SPHM legislation are more likely to report the implementation of SPHM programs in contrast with those in comparison states. This finding was found for each of the 11 unit types. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence to support the positive effect of state-based efforts for legislative actions on the development and implementation of SPHM programs.

Although various cytokines are involved in immunologic responses in patients with OME, no study to date has assessed the involvement of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22. This study analyzed the levels of expression of IL-17 and IL-22 in the middle ear effusion of patients with OME. Methods Patients aged <11 years who were diagnosed with chronic OME and underwent ventilation tube insertion from May 2013 to August 2015 were enrolled. Effusion fluid samples were obtained during surgery and levels of IL-17 and IL-22 mRNAs assessed by real-time PCR. IL-17 and IL-22 mRNA levels were compared in patients with effusion fluid positive and negative for bacteria; in patients with and without accompanying diseases, recurrent disease, and re-operation; and relative to fluid characteristics. Results The study cohort included 70 pediatric patients, 46 boys and 24 girls, of mean age 4.31?±?2.11 years. The levels of IL-17 and IL-22 mRNA were higher in patients with than without sinusitis, but only IL-22 mRNA levels differed significantly (p?<?0.05). The level of IL-17 mRNA was significantly higher in patients who did than did not undergo T&A (p?<?0.05). The level of IL-22 expression was significantly higher in mucoid and purulent middle ear fluid samples than in serous fluid samples (p?<?0.05).

The association between CAC scores and cortical thickness was significantly stronger in participants with moderate or severe WMH compared to those with none or mild WMH, even though CAC scores were not associated with WMH.

This association was evident after adjusting for multiple coronary artery disease risk factors and for WMH, suggesting that CAC may be more closely related to Alzheimer's Disease-type disease rather than to cerebral small vessel disease. ?

This review aimed to explore the impact and role of doctors practising TKM on the Korean public healthcare system. Methods A search was conducted of official government agency websites, doctors’ associations and 3 Korean databases using the key words: ‘public doctor’, ‘public TKM doctor’ and ‘public health system’. The search was conducted on September 15, 2015. Neither the publication language nor the publication date were restricted. Results The TKM public health system commenced in 1998 and after a two-year pilot project was expanded nationwide in 2002. In 2001, there were only 38 public health TKM doctors, this had increased to 1026 by 2015. Most of these practitioners work in public health centres (23.38%) and branch offices of community health centres (68.12%). Conclusions This review has considered the public health doctor system with a focus on TKM doctors including assignment status of public health TKM doctors, the development of the TKM public health doctor system. Roles of public health TKM doctors. Although the public health doctor system has contributed to the improvement of Korean public health for 30 years, continuous development is required to improve the working conditions, provide reasonable regulation for the medical system, and strengthen the medical information and management. ? 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Integrated health system; Public health; Review; Traditional Korean medicine,dentist; health care policy; human; Korean medicine; patient satisfaction; physician; priority journal; public health; public health service; Review,2-s2.0-84992643488

Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted. One hundred participants were recruited: 40 outpatients with schizophrenia, 40 with depression, and 20 healthy controls. All completed a depression inventory, and the positive and negative symptoms of the patients with schizophrenia were evaluated by their psychiatrists. All participants were asked to complete a sleep log for two weeks. For the psychiatric patients, a randomized design with experimental (three months of acupuncture treatment) and control (waitlist) conditions was used, after which all measurements were conducted once more. Results Before treatment, patients with depression were awake longer during the night, needed more time to fall asleep, evaluated their sleep as less relaxed, felt more exhausted, and reported a lower average performance level compared with healthy controls. Moreover, patients with depression slept less and felt more exhausted than patients with schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia reported a lower average performance level compared to healthy controls. Acupuncture slightly improved sleep and depressive symptoms in patients with depression, but did not affect sleep nor influence positive and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Conclusion These preliminary data suggest that acupuncture can be used in order to reduce symptoms and improve sleep to some extent in patients with depression, but due to the lack of comparative data, it is impossible to reliably say anything about its effects for patients with schizophrenia. ? 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Acupuncture; Depression; Randomised controlled trial; Schizophrenia; Sleep disorders; Sleep log,acupuncture; acupuncture needle; adult; Article; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; depression; depression inventory; exhaustion; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental patient; middle aged; negative syndrome; night; outcome assessment; outpatient care; physical performance; positive syndrome; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; schizophrenia; sleep disorder; sleep pattern; sleep time; symptomatology; treatment duration,2-s2.0-84992641035

The interest in herbal medicine as an option for fertility care extends to many countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of Korean herbal medicine treatment for women with infertility aged ?35 years by calculating the clinical pregnancy and live birth rate through a retrospective analysis. Methods A retrospective analysis was carried out using computerized charts for 270 infertile women, over the age of 35 years receiving Korean herbal treatment from the Happysaem Korean Medicine Clinic, between 2011 and 2012. The main outcome measures were clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Secondary outcome measures included the predictors of pregnancy success and treatment period/cost until pregnancy was achieved. Results Our results revealed that clinical pregnancy and live birth rates after Korean herbal treatment were 44.4% and 26.3%, respectively, in totality, 49.0% and 30.0%, respectively, in the 35–39 years group, and 31.4% and 15.7%, respectively, in the 40–46 years group. The clinical pregnancy rates were 44.0% in the Korean herbal treatment group and 43.4% in the Korean herbal treatment?+?western treatment group. The live birth rates were 23.5% in the Korean herbal treatment group and 31.3% in the Korean herbal treatment?+?western treatment group. The mean treatment duration was 11.26?±?5.02 weeks and average cost for Korean herbal treatment was $1320?±?600. Conclusions Our retrospective study suggests that management of infertile women ?35 years with Korean herbal treatment can be effective and economical. ? 2016 The Authors",Advanced maternal age; Adverse events; Cost analysis; Female infertility; Korean herbal medicine; Pregnancy outcome,chokyungonshin tang; chokyungsoyosan; clomifene citrate; fertility promoting agent; guichulleekyung tang; herbaceous agent; unclassified drug; abdominal distension; abdominal pain; acupuncture; adult; Article; diarrhea; dyspepsia; female; female infertility; health care cost; heartburn; human; in vitro fertilization; infertility therapy; intrauterine insemination; Korean medicine; live birth; major clinical study; middle aged; moxibustion; nausea; ovulation induction; pregnancy outcome; pregnancy rate; priority journal; retrospective study; treatment duration; treatment outcome; western medicine,2-s2.0-84992549280

Principal component analysis was applied to differentiate the two groups. The upregulated and downregulated phospholipid species in the mitophagic cells were also represented in a heatmap. In the volcano plot (fold change > 1.3 and p value < 0.01), individual species of seven PCs, two SMs, and three PIs were selected as differentially regulated phospholipids. In particular, almost all the molecular species of PC, SM, and PI were downregulated in the mitophagic cells. Quantification of these lipids indicated that mitophagy induces altered metabolism of phospholipids. Therefore, phospholipid alterations during the mitophagic process of lung cancer cells were well characterized by MALDI-TOF/MS. ? 2016 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.",MALDI; Mass spectrometry; Mitophagy; Phospholipids,"phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylinositol; phospholipid; sphingomyelin; phospholipid; Article; cancer cell; controlled study; down regulation; human; human cell; lipid analysis; lipid metabolism; lung cancer; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; mitophagy; phospholipid synthesis; protein expression; quantitative analysis; upregulation; chemistry; cluster analysis; lung tumor; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; metabolism; mitophagy; physiology; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cluster Analysis; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mitochondrial Degradation; Phospholipids; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",2-s2.0-84992458956

Although the symptoms are usually not prominent, it is fatal once it bursts. If AAA is diagnosed early and treated, the majority of deaths from ruptured AAA can be prevented. It is screened for with ultrasonography, which is a fast, cheap and safe diagnosis tool. Most patients can also tolerate the screening well. Several countries are operating national AAA screening programs in efforts to reduce AAA-related deaths. For instance, the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently program in the United States and the National Health Service Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme in the United Kingdom are some of the prominent programs currently available. If Korea conducts AAA screening programs for a target population similar to these cases, the cost is estimated to be 25.7 billion Korean won (23.4 million US dollars [USD]). If the target population is extended to males 65 years of age and above with experience smoking more than 5 pack-years of cigarettes, the cost is estimated to be 36.4 billion Korean won (33.1 million US dollars [USD]). However, considering the actual screening rate of the current national cancer screening program, the realistic costs are estimated to be 10.6 billion Korean won (9.7 million US dollars [USD]) and 15.0 billion Korean won (13.7 million US dollars [USD]), respectively. Given the success of AAA screening programs in other countries, it is necessary to introduce a national AAA screening program in Korea. ???

The aim of the study was to identify KM utilization patterns using a national representative sample data. Methods: KM users aged 0-80 years and older from the nationally representative sample in the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort of 778,506 KM users between 2002 and 2013 (were analyzed. Annual changes in utilization patterns were analyzed by sex, nine age groups, five income levels, and numbers of visits and hospitalizations. Utilization patterns by the type of healthcare institution and the top 10 major diseases were studied. Results: Frequencies of KM use differed according to analyses of patients and claims. Women used KM 1.5 times more than did men. Patients in their 40s and 50s made up one third of KM users. In contrast to other studies, high-income groups used KM more than did low-income groups. More than 96% of ambulatory patients used mostly KM clinics, and more than 76% of inpatients used KM hospitals. Musculoskeletal disorders were the main disease treated, which conformed to the results of previous studies. Conclusion: The results suggest that women, people in their 40s and 50s, and people with a relatively high income use KM more often than other patients. Further comparison studies of both Western medicine in Korea and other countries should be conducted. ?

A total of 228 patients were prospectively enrolled at seven academic centers in South Korea between April 2011 and September 2012. Of these, 122 patients underwent SPLS and 106 patients underwent MPLS. The serum levels of C-reactive protein, creatine phosphokinase, lactic dehydrogenase and cancer antigen 125 were measured preoperatively and on postoperative day 4 by immunonephelometry. Cosmetic satisfaction and postoperative pain scores (visual analogue scale) were analyzed. Postoperative changes in the levels of the serum markers were found to be similar between the SPLS and MPLS groups. However, the postoperative pain scores at 48 h were significantly lower in the SPLS group when compared with those in the MPLS (P=0.001). In addition, patient-controlled analgesia was used more frequently by patients in the MPLS group (P=0.003). The present study is the first prospective investigation of tissue injury resulting from SPLS and MPLS in gynecology. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that serum marker levels during SPLS were similar to those during MPLS in the treatment of benign gynecologic diseases. However, SPLS is a reasonable alternative to MPLS and is associated with comparable tissue injury, improved cosmesis and reduced postoperative pain. ? 2016, Spandidos Publications.

However, the additional effects of physical treatment with chemical agents on skin barrier function have not been adequately studied. This study measured the degree of acute skin damage and the time required for skin barrier repair using non-invasive bioengineering methods in vivo with human skin to investigate the additional effect of a 4% AHA chemical jet accelerated at supersonic velocities. Methods: Thirteen female subjects (average age: 29.54 ± 4.86 years) participated in this study. The faces of the subjects were divided into half according to the block randomization design and were then assigned to receive AHA peeling alone or AHA peeling combined with pneumatic pressure on each side of the face. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin colour and skin blood flow were evaluated at baseline and at 30 min, 2, 5 and 7 days after treatment. Results: The TEWL and skin blood flow were significantly increased after 30 min in chemodermabrasion compared with chemical peeling alone (P < 0.05). The TEWL and skin blood flow recovered to baseline after 2 days, and TEWL was significantly decreased at 7 days compared with chemical peeling alone (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Chemodermabrasion can temporarily impair skin barriers, but it is estimated that it can enhance the skin barrier function after 7 days compared to the use of a chemical agent alone. In addition, chemodermabrasion has a more effective impact in the dermis and relatively preserves the skin barrier. ? 2016 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Soci?t?

We found that 3-formylchromone (3FC) inhibited both constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Besides the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, 3FC also abrogated constitutive activity and nuclear translocation of STAT3. This suppression was mediated through the inhibition of phosphorylation of Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 1/2 and Src. Furthermore, 3FC induced the expression of the protein inhibitors of activated STAT3 (PIAS3), and gene silencing of the PIAS3 by small interfering RNA abolished the ability of 3FC to inhibit STAT3 activation, suggesting a critical role for PIAS3 in the action of 3FC. 3FC also downregulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Mcl-1, Survivin, inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (IAP-1), Cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) in MM cells. This correlated with induction of substantial apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the sub-G1 cell population and caspase-3 induced poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Overall, these results suggest that 3FC is a novel blocker of STAT3 activation pathway thus may have a potential in therapy of MM and other cancers. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",3-Formylchromone; apoptosis; multiple myeloma; PIAS3; STAT3,"3 formylchromone; antineoplastic agent; caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; cyclin D1; cyclooxygenase 2; gelatinase B; inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1; Janus kinase 1; Janus kinase 2; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein bcl 2; protein bcl xl; protein inhibitor of activated STAT; protein inhibitor of activated stat3; protein mcl 1; small interfering RNA; STAT3 protein; survivin; unclassified drug; chaperone; chromone derivative; PIAS3 protein, human; protein inhibitor of activated STAT; STAT3 protein; STAT3 protein, human; tumor protein; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; down regulation; gene silencing; human; human cell; multiple myeloma cell line; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; apoptosis; cell proliferation; drug effects; immunology; multiple myeloma; pathology; tumor cell line; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Chromones; Humans; Molecular Chaperones; Multiple Myeloma; Neoplasm Proteins; Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor",2-s2.0-84978971980

Previous studies reported that serum IgE levels are elevated in nephrotic syndrome and suggested IgE levels as a prognostic indicator in glomerular diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the association between serum IgE levels and renal outcome in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). Methods We included 117 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN. Renal progression was defined if a patient meets one of these criteria: (1) a negative value of delta estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/1.73 m2/mo) or (2) a rise in serum creatinine to an absolute level of ? 1.3 mg/dL (male) or 1.2 mg/dL (female). We defined delta changes in serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria as a difference of values during the follow-up period. Results A total of 117 patients with IgAN were included. The serum IgE level was significantly high in the renal progressive group compared with the nonprogressive group. Sex and history of gross hematuria were significantly different between the high-IgE group and the low-IgE group. Regression analysis showed that a male sex, initial proteinuria, and change of proteinuria were significantly associated with serum IgE levels. Conclusion The serum IgE level is potentially associated with disease progression and pathogenesis of IgAN. ? 2016",Glomerulonephritis; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin E,creatinine; immunoglobulin E; adult; Article; controlled study; creatinine blood level; disease association; disease marker; female; follow up; gender; glomerulus filtration rate; hematuria; human; human tissue; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; immunoglobulin blood level; kidney biopsy; major clinical study; male; pathogenesis; priority journal; prognosis; proteinuria,2-s2.0-84990213181

Methods: 11 unilateral cementless primary THA were performed to arthritic hips in patients with residual poliomyelitis. 7 were in paralytic and 4 were in nonparalytic limbs. The mean follow-up duration was 79.9 months. Retrospective clinical evaluations with various scores and radiological evaluations were made. Results: Harris Hip Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Short-form (SF)-36 physical scales were significantly improved after the surgery. However, UCLA activity score and SF-36 mental scale were not. Because of remaining leg length discrepancies, all but 1 noted a residual limp. In nonparalytic hip, functional acetabular cup inclination during weight bearing significantly increased from installed inclination. Other than 1 case of posterior dislocation, no complications were observed. Conclusions: Although the overall result itself is excellent, THA for these patients cannot improve limp, physical activity and mental status.

Our study aimed to determine whether the presence of PAD in stroke patients affected the progression of disability or death one year after discharge. Methods: From April 2012 to March 2013, consecutive first stroke patients above 50 years of age without known PAD were enrolled. PAD was defined as a low ankle-brachial index (less than 0.9) measured by an automatic device. Clinical data associated with the stroke were collected from medical records. Disability in stroke patients was evaluated with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) on discharge day and one year after the index stroke. Progression of disability was defined as an increase in mRS more than one level at one year. Results: Among the 526 patients, 238 had ischemic strokes and underwent ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement. Of them, 192 patients were included. In univariate analysis, age, dyslipidemia, discharge mRS, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, D-dimer, homocysteine, internal carotid artery stenosis, posterior cerebral artery stenosis, and PAD were factors associated with worsening mRS. After adjustment for these factors in the logistic regression analysis, PAD was an independent factor associated with worsening mRS. In the analysis of one-year mortality, patients with PAD had a higher death rate, but PAD was not an independent factor after adjusting for other variables. Conclusions: The presence of PAD in stroke patients suggests a chance of disability progression, but may not be a predictor of death after one year. ? 2016, ASEAN Neurological Association.

Subjects and Methods Ninety-nine patients who underwent knee MRI and arthroscopy were included. All MRIs were retrospectively and independently assessed by 2 radiologists. Medial synovial folds of the PCL on MRI were categorized into 3 types. Type A showed no medial synovial fold. Type B showed a small synovial protrusion that did not extend beyond an imaginary line drawn from the medial tibial spine to the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle. Type C had a long enough fold to extend beyond the imaginary line. The presence of a tear in the anterior cruciate ligament, PCL, or menisci and impingement of the PCL were obtained from arthroscopic records. Results Intraobserver agreement in the classification of medial synovial folds was nearly perfect (κ = 0.850). Interobserver agreement was substantial (κ = 0.759). Of 99 cases, 34 were type A, 41 were type B, and 24 were type C folds on MRI. Thirty-nine impingements of the PCL (39.4%) were identified on arthroscopy. Multivariable analysis revealed that type C folds were 40.60 times more likely to have impingement than type A folds (odds ratio, 40.60; 95% confidence interval, 8.73-188.93; P < 0.001). Conclusions Of the 3 types of medial synovial folds, type C was significantly associated with impingement of the PCL on arthroscopy. Therefore, type C folds may be a cause of internal derangement of the knee. Copyright ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We compared chondrogenesis efficiency between different chondrogenic-induction methods such as micromass culture, pellet culture, and 3D-cell sheet culture. Among them, the 3D-cell sheet culture resulted in the best chondrogenesis with the disc-type bio-cartilage (>12 mm diameter in size) in vitro, but sometimes spontaneous curling and contraction of 3D-cell sheet culture resulted in the formation of bead-type cartilage, which was prevented by type I collagen coating or by culturing on amniotic membrane. Previously, it was reported that tissue-engineered cartilage reconstructed in vitro does not maintain its cartilage phenotype after transplantation but tends to transform to other tissue type such as bone or connective tissue. However, the disc-type bio-cartilage of 3D-cell sheet culture maintained its hyaline cartilage phenotype even after exposure to the osteogenic-induction condition in vitro for 3 weeks or after the transplantation for 4 weeks in mouse subcutaneous. Collectively, the disc-type bio-cartilage with 12 mm diameter can be reproducibly reconstructed by the 3D-cell sheet culture, whose hyaline cartilage phenotype and shape can be maintained under the osteogenic-induction condition as well as after the transplantation. This disc-type bio-cartilage can be proposed for the application to reconstructive surgery and repair of disc-type cartilage such as mandibular cartilage and digits. ? 2016, The Korean Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Bone marrow stromal cell; Cartilage; Chondrogenesis; Costal chondrocyte,Body fluids; Bone; Cells; Collagen; Cytology; Musculoskeletal system; Surgery; Tissue; Amniotic membranes; Bone marrow stromal cells; Chondrocytes; Chondrogenesis; Connective tissues; Human bone marrow stromal cells; Reconstructive surgery; Tissue engineered cartilage; Cartilage; collagen type 1; adult; aged; amnion; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bone marrow stroma cell; cartilage cell; cartilage transplantation; cell culture; cell shape; chondrogenesis; controlled study; costal chondrocyte; female; human; human cell; human tissue; hyaline cartilage; in vitro study; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; rib cartilage; three dimensional cell sheet culture,2-s2.0-84982811810

We report our experience of a case of pseudoaneurysm that developed on the PICA after blunt trauma to the head. Case Description A 55-year-old woman was transferred to our emergency department presenting with a semicomatose mental status after falling to the floor from a standing position. Computed tomography showed a small intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage in the cerebellum. Cerebral angiography revealed no causative lesion. After 3 days, the woman was nearly mentally alert. One month later, follow-up angiography showed a small, newly developed saccular aneurysm at the distal PICA. The patient underwent surgical treatment via a midline suboccipital approach. The aneurysm was surrounded by a subacute-stage subdural hematoma and protruded into the cortex. The aneurysm was coagulated and resected. On pathologic examination, pseudoaneurysm was diagnosed without infectious inflammation. No surgery-related morbidity occurred. Conclusions Given that development of traumatic pseudoaneurysm usually is delayed, follow-up radiologic examination is required, especially for patients with severe blunt trauma. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Blunt trauma; Brain; Posterior inferior cerebellar artery; Pseudoaneurysm; Surgery,"abducens nerve paralysis; adult; Article; blunt trauma; brain angiography; brain artery aneurysm; brain hemorrhage; cerebellum; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; craniotomy; digital subtraction angiography; emergency ward; false aneurysm; female; follow up; Glasgow coma scale; head injury; human; male; mental health; middle aged; posterior inferior cerebellar artery; saccular aneurysm; subarachnoid hemorrhage; subdural hematoma; Aneurysm, False; case report; complication; computed tomography scanner; diagnostic imaging; head injury; neurosurgery; pathology; posterior cerebral artery; procedures; Aneurysm, False; Angiography, Digital Subtraction; Craniotomy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Head Injuries, Closed; Humans; Middle Aged; Neurosurgical Procedures; Posterior Cerebral Artery; Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84979641443

A large volume of declarative knowledge is hidden in multiple knowledge resources such as clinical notes, standard guidelines etc. that can play an important role in decision support systems as well as in health and wellness applications after structured transformation. In this paper, an Unstructured Declarative Knowledge Acquisition Methodology, called UDeKAM, is proposed that acquires and constructs the declarative structured knowledge from unstructured knowledge resources using Documents Clustering, Topic Modeling, and Controlled Natural Language processing techniques. The proposed methodology is designed for different domains to serve a variety of applications.

Methods Clinical charts and radiographs of all patients treated surgically from February 2004 to July 2012 for cervical myeloradiculopathy due to DISH with OPLL or OPLL alone were reviewed retrospectively. All patients were observed for a minimum of 1 year. Pre-and postoperative Nurick grades were assessed for all patients. Results Forty-nine patients underwent surgical treatment for cervical myeloradiculopathy due to OPLL, and 8 also had DISH (average 58.9 years, range 37 to 70). The DISH with OPLL group had a significantly higher proportion of subjects with diabetes mellitus (50 versus 9.8% in the OPLL-only group). Everyone in the DISH with OPLL group had continuous or mixed-Type OPLL, whereas 78% of patients in the OPLL-only group had primarily segmental type. Operative treatments for patients in the DISH with OPLL group included laminoplasty, anterior decompression and fusion, and posterior laminectomy with fusion. By Nurick grade, 5 patients improved and 3 showed no change. Conclusion Patients with both DISH and OPLL had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and either continuous or mixed-Type OPLL classifications.

Thus, a careful endoscopic examination is required during follow-up in ANPT-positive patients with CRS. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and prognosis after surgical treatment in patients with CRS and aspirin hypersensitivity. Methods: In a prospective study, 100 patients were analyzed with CRS who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery at the hospital from October 2012 to March 2013. This study measured changes in nasal volume and symptoms before and after the ANPT and examined patients asthma history, allergy, Lund-Mackay score (LMS), total immunoglobulin E, percentage of peripheral eosinophils, and objectively measured relapse at 6 months. Results: Patients wwith CRS and nasal polyps (CRSwNP) were more likely to have a positive ANPT test result compared to those without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) (21.4% vs 5.5%). The ANPT-positive group had a higher LMS and required more revision endoscopic sinus surgery than those in the ANPT-negative group. The results were that similar results were observed in CRSwNP and CRSsNP. ? 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Aspirin nasal provocation test; chronic rhinosinusitis,"adult; aged; Asthma, Aspirin-Induced; chronic disease; complication; female; human; male; middle aged; Nose Diseases; nose provocation test; prospective study; young adult; Adult; Aged; Asthma, Aspirin-Induced; Chronic Disease; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nasal Provocation Tests; Nose Diseases; Prospective Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84964603342

Methods: Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey V were used. A total of 19,083 participants were included. The chi-square test, the Mantel-Haenszel extension, logistic regression analysis, and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 2.0% of the participants had nitrituria. The incidence of nitrituria significantly increased with age (P trend<0.001). In addition, nitrituria in women began to significantly increase in the fifth decade, more than in men, and this difference was maintained in the 60s, 70s, and greater than 70s age groups (P<0.001). After adjusting for confounders, the odds ratio (OR) for nitrituria in the MetS group was significantly increased, as compared to the OR for nitrituria in the group without MetS (MetS: OR, 1.577; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.134-2.192; P=0.007). The glycosylated hemoglobin of the nitrite positive group was significantly higher than the negative group (adjusted mean±standard error: 6.108±0.081 vs. 5.883±0.065, P< 0.001). Conclusions: An effective health policy for urinary tract infection (UTI) is needed for older age groups and women.

Here a 70% ethanol extract of Makgeolli suldeot (70EMS) was tested for its inhibitory activities against cancer metastasis. This extract interrupted the formation of the neovasculature and reduced the migratory and invasive activity of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, it dose-dependently suppressed the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and Akt. Moreover, 70EMS strongly inhibited the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) into the nucleus and expression of activator protein-1 (AP-1).

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 77 patients with primary ES were obtained in South Korea, Argentina and Brazil, and were studied via methylation chip assay and direct sequencing of the GNAS gene and immunohistochemical analysis of Gsα. The mutation and methylation statuses of the GNAS gene were examined. Immunohistochemical results were measured with respect to proportion and staining intensity. The results revealed that GNAS genes in ES tumor samples were less methylated compared with normal controls. No mutations were detected at exons 8 or 9 of the GNAS locus complex on chromosome 20q13.3, indicating that the pathogenesis of ES was not associated with GNAS mutation. Gsαexpression correlated well with the methylation status of the GNAS gene. Notably, high Gsαexpression was detected more frequently in samples from living patients than from decedents, although this was not statistically significant (P=0.055). In conclusion, GNAS mutation is not associated with the pathogenesis of ES tumors. This finding may be used to differentiate ES tumors from metastatic bone lesions with morphological similarity to ES tumors. Analysis of the methylation status of the GNAS gene and immunohistochemical Gsαexpression suggests that hypermethylated GNAS (low Gsαexpression) in ES may be associated with unfavorable progression with a non-significant trend. ? 2016, Spandidos Publications.

Because these patients generally participate in social life, risk factors associated with lifestyle may have a great impact and need to be identified. Methods The SKY (Stroke in Korean Young Adults) study is a multicenter case-control study and a prospective cohort study in 8 tertiary medical centers in the Republic of Korea. The case subjects are patients aged 18-44 years with first-ever ischemic stroke occurring within 1 month of stroke onset, and the control subjects are age- and gender-matched community controls. Our aim is to include 470 cases and 470 controls. The main objective of our study is to determine the risk factors and the causes of ischemic stroke in Korean young adults. Both well-documented risk factors and little-known lifestyle-related risk factors such as lifestyle habits and psychological distress including job strain will be evaluated by comparing cases and controls using a structured questionnaire. Secondary objectives are to determine the risks of mortality, recurrent vascular events, and poststroke epilepsy in these patients. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Conclusions The SKY study is designed to obtain more insights into relatively little-known risk factors in young Korean adults with ischemic stroke.

Aims: We compared the rate of recurrent bleeding in antiplatelet users and non-users. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed prospectively collected data from PUB patients treated by endoscopic modalities between August 2007 and December 2014. We evaluated and compared the rate of recurrent bleeding within 30?days in antiplatelet users and non-users; we also categorized antiplatelet users into continuation (?3?days) and withdrawal (>3?days) groups. Results: A total of 490 patients were enrolled in the study, 302 (61.6?%) and 188 (38.4?%) in the non-user and antiplatelet user groups, respectively. The recurrent bleeding rate among antiplatelet users (10.1?%) was significantly higher than that among non-users (5.0?%; p?=?0.029). Among 188 antiplatelet users, 51 (27.1?%) and 137 (72.9?%) were assigned to the continuation and withdrawal groups, respectively. The rate of recurrent bleeding did not differ significantly between groups (11.7 vs. 5.9?%, p?=?0.241). Multivariate analysis revealed chronic kidney disease as a risk factor [odds ratio (OR) 2.890, 95?% confidence interval (CI) 1.079-7.742, p?=?0.035].

As qualitative studies documenting the quality of life (QoL) of lung cancer patients using CAM is limited, this study focused on exploring perceived changes in QoL of lung cancer patients following their experiences of CAM treatment. Methods In 2013, in-depth semi-structured tape recorded interviews were conducted with 15 Korean lung cancer patients who had reported a CAM treatment experiences in a Korean medical hospital specializing in cancer. The transcriptions were analyzed using NVivo10, and patients’ experience of cancer was investigated using van Manen's four fundamental existential categories which relate to lifeworld experiences. Results Patients exhibited the greatest change in two of the categories; ‘lived body’ and ‘lived relations’. Three final themes were identified, ‘loss of self’, ‘being the same as before’, and ‘revitalization’. Cancer diagnosis accelerated the loss of ‘self’ but also gave patients a chance to concentrate on and regain ‘self’. Participants demonstrated that ‘being the same as before’ was the most important factor for quality of life and also for treatment decisions. CAM treatment was deemed acceptable when the patients felt revitalized and they were able to live as before and when they were respected. Conclusion As CAM gave a chance for patients to concentrate on ‘self’ and regain the will to continue with treatment, CAM potentially improves lung cancer patients’ QoL. Effective application of CAM during cancer treatment should be investigated. ? 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Complementary and alternative medicine; Lifeworld experience; Lung cancer; Qualitative study; Quality of life,antineoplastic agent; herbaceous agent; acupuncture; adult; alternative medicine; aromatherapy; Article; breathing exercise; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; cupping; drug therapy; female; herbal medicine; human; Korean medicine; lung cancer; male; meditation; middle aged; moxibustion; patient decision making; personal experience; pharmacopuncture; priority journal; qualitative research; quality of life; self concept; semi structured interview; South Korea; South Korean; thematic analysis; unspecified side effect; western medicine; yoga,2-s2.0-84955578478

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in patients with ADHD. Methods The study was randomized, waitlist-controlled, and unblinded. A total of 93 participants with ADHD were enrolled. The acupuncture group received acupuncture treatment twice per week for 6 weeks. The waitlist group did not receive acupuncture during the first six weeks, and then underwent acupuncture treatment during the next six weeks. The primary outcome measure was the ADHD-rating scale. The computerized neurocognitive function tests (CNTs) was conducted as an objective measurement. Results The results of the primary analyses were equivocal. Additional analyses were conducted after data were stratified according to ADHD medication. The acupuncture group not taking ADHD medications demonstrated significantly better performance in the CNTs compared to the waitlist group: the backward digit span test (p?=?0.026), backward visual span test (p?=?0.044), correct hit/omission error of auditory continuous performance test (CPT) (p?=?0.021), standard deviation of response time of visual CPT (p?=?0.048). The clinical global impression-severity score decreased significantly in the acupuncture group after treatment compared to that in the waitlist group (p?=?0.000). There was no statistically significant difference between both groups taking ADHD medications, except for verbal learning test in which waitlist group experienced a higher increase than acupuncture group. No adverse effect was reported. Conclusions Acupuncture positively influences cognitive function in patients who are not on ADHD medication. ? 2016",Acupuncture; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Complementary and alternative medicine; Computerized neurocognitive function test,acupuncture; Article; attention deficit disorder; backward digit span test; backward visual span test; child; Clinical Global Impression scale; cognitive function test; continuous performance test; controlled study; female; headache; human; learning and memory test; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; patient safety; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; response time; school child,2-s2.0-84949477970

The aim of this study was to identify awareness and behavioral patterns concerning acne and acne scar of people having acne and differences between those with and without acne scars. Methods: The survey was performed via smartphone application for 900 participants in their second to fourth decade having current or previous acne lesions. They were further categorized into two groups based on the presence of acne scar (scar and scarless groups) with no statistical difference in demographic composition. Results: The mean age of all participants was 24.6 ± 5.3. The scar group had a longer disease duration (4.9 years) than those of the scarless group (2.2 years). Participants in the scar group thought that acne scarring affected psychosocial aspects more negatively compared with those in the scarless group. Participants in the scarless group visited dermatology clinics earlier than those in the scar group. In the scar group, 62.1% of participants have never had their acne scars treated medically. Most (88.6%) participants from both groups believed that non-dermatologic treatment caused side effects or aggravated their acne. Conclusions: Participants with acne scars tended to treat their acne and acne scars improperly, which could negatively affect their daily lives. Acne scars are sequelae of acne and should be regarded as a distinct disease entity, requiring a patient's early visit to dermatologic clinics. ? 2016 International Society of Dermatology.",,"acne; adult; Article; attitude to health; awareness; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; disease duration; emotionality; female; health care cost; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; mobile application; patient satisfaction; perception; scar; self care; skin surgery; smartphone; social behavior; social life; social psychology; suicidal ideation; young adult; acne vulgaris; adolescent; adverse effects; ambulatory care; attitude to health; child; Cicatrix; complication; dermatology; disease course; economics; emotion; mobile application; onset age; psychology; questionnaire; smartphone; social participation; time factor; time to treatment; dermatological agent; Acne Vulgaris; Adolescent; Adult; Age of Onset; Child; Cicatrix; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatologic Agents; Dermatology; Disease Progression; Emotions; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Mobile Applications; Office Visits; Patient Satisfaction; Self Care; Smartphone; Social Participation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Time-to-Treatment; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84949457362

However, the two branches frequently conflict with one another, particularly with regard to mental disorders. This study was designed to compare the utilization of WM and TKM, focusing on child/ adolescent patients with mental disorders. We analyzed F-code (Mental and behavioral disorders) claims from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, including data from 0-18-year-old patients from 2010 to 2012. Slightly more men than women utilized WM, while TKM use was almost evenly balanced. WM claims increased with advancing age, whereas utilization of TKM was common for the 0-6 age group. In WM and TKM, the total number of claims relying on the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) was 331,154 (92.78%) and 73,282 (97.85%), respectively, and the number of claims relying on medical aid was 25,753 (7.22%) and 1,610 (2.15%), respectively. The most frequent F-coded claim in WM was F90 (Hyperkinetic disorders), with 64,088 claims (17.96%), and that in TKM was F45 (Somatoform disorders), with 28,852 claims (38.52%). The prevalence of a single disorder without comorbidities was 168,764 (47.29%) in WM and 52,615 (70.25%) in TKM. From these data, we conclude that WM takes prevalence over TKM in cases of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as in psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. On the other hand, patients utilizing TKM more commonly present with physical health problems including somatoform problems, sleep, and eating disorders. ? 2016 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Child and adolescent psychiatry; Traditional korean medicine; Western medicine,"adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; child; cognitive therapy; demography; factual database; female; human; incidence; infant; insurance; Korean medicine; male; Mental Disorders; newborn; preschool child; social class; South Korea; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Child, Preschool; Cognitive Therapy; Databases, Factual; Demography; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Insurance Claim Reporting; Male; Medicine, Korean Traditional; Mental Disorders; Republic of Korea; Social Class",2-s2.0-84964707312

The study also aimed to use these SNPs to develop prediction models for individual training responses. Methods: 79 Healthy volunteers participated in the HIT program. A genome-wide association study, based on 2,391,739 SNPs, was performed to identify SNPs that were significantly associated with gains in V?O2max and knee peak torque, following 9?weeks of the HIT program. To predict two training responses, two independent SNPs sets were determined using linear regression and iterative binary logistic regression analysis. False discovery rate analysis and permutation tests were performed to avoid false-positive findings. Results: To predict gains in V?O2max, 7 SNPs were identified. These SNPs accounted for 26.0?% of the variance in the increment of V?O2max, and discriminated the subjects into three subgroups, non-responders, medium responders, and high responders, with prediction accuracy of 86.1?%. For the knee peak torque, 6 SNPs were identified, and accounted for 27.5?% of the variance in the increment of knee peak torque. The prediction accuracy discriminating the subjects into the three subgroups was estimated as 77.2?%. Conclusions: Novel SNPs found in this study could explain, and predict inter-individual variability in gains of V?O2max, and knee peak torque. Furthermore, with these genetic markers, a methodology suggested in this study provides a sound approach for the personalized training program. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Genetic marker; HIT; Knee peak torque; Prediction model; SNP; Training response; V?O2max,"adult; education; exercise; female; genetics; genome-wide association study; human; knee; male; muscle strength; oxygen consumption; physiology; procedures; resistance training; single nucleotide polymorphism; torque; Adult; Education; Exercise; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Knee; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Strength; Oxygen Consumption; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Resistance Training; Torque",2-s2.0-84961821086

The present study aims to investigate SBS in partial epilepsy with regard to surgical outcomes and intracranial EEG findings. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who underwent epilepsy surgery following extraoperative intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) study from 2008 to 2012. The presence of SBS was determined based upon the results of scalp EEG monitoring performed for presurgical evaluations. We reviewed scalp EEG, neuroimaging, intracranial EEG findings, and surgical outcomes in patients with SBS. Results: We found 12 patients with SBS who were surgically treated for intractable partial epilepsy. Nine (75%) patients had lateralized ictal semiology and only two (16.6%) patients showed localized ictal onset in scalp EEG. Brain MRI showed epileptogenic lesion in three (25%) patients. Intracranial EEG demonstrated that ictal onset zone was widespread or non-localized in six (50%) patients. Low-voltage fast activity was the most common ictal onset EEG pattern. Rapid propagation of ictal onset was noted in 10 (83.3%) patients. Eleven patients underwent resective epilepsy surgery and only two patients (18.2%) achieved seizure-freedom (median follow-up 56 months). MRI-visible brain lesions were associated with favorable outcomes (p = 0.024). Patients with SBS, compared to frontal lobe epilepsy without SBS, showed lesser localization in ictal onset EEG (p = 0.029) and more rapid propagation during evolution of ictal rhythm (p = 0.015). Conclusions: The present results suggested that resective surgery for partial epilepsy with SBS should be decided carefully, especially in case of nonlesional epilepsy. Poor localization and rapid spread of ictal onset were prominent in intracranial EEG, which might contribute to incomplete resection of the epileptogenic zone and poor surgical outcomes. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Epilepsy surgery; Intracranial electroencephalography; Secondary bilateral synchrony; Surgical outcome,"fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adolescent; adult; anterior corpus callosotomy; Article; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; disease duration; electroencephalography; epileptic discharge; epileptic focus; epileptogenesis; female; focal epilepsy; human; male; neurosurgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; peroperative care; postoperative period; priority journal; retrospective study; secondary bilateral synchrony; single photon emission computer tomography; treatment outcome; treatment response; comparative study; cortical synchronization; drug resistant epilepsy; electrocorticography; Epilepsies, Partial; Epilepsy, Frontal Lobe; follow up; pathophysiology; prognosis; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cortical Synchronization; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; Electrocorticography; Epilepsies, Partial; Epilepsy, Frontal Lobe; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84961183787

However, serious complications can occur after GKRS, including hydrocephalus. The pathophysiology and risk factors of this disorder are not yet fully understood. The objective of the study was to assess potential risk factors for hydrocephalus after GKRS. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical radiosurgical records of 244 patients who underwent GKRS to treat intracranial schwannoma. The following parameters were analyzed as potential risk factors for hydrocephalus after GKRS: age, sex, target volume, irradiation dose, prior tumor resection, treatment technique, and tumor enhancement pattern. The tumor enhancement pattern was divided into 2 groups: group A (homogeneous enhancement) and group B (heterogeneous or rim enhancement). Results Of the 244 patients, 14 of them (5.7%) developed communicating hydrocephalus. Communicating hydrocephalus occurred within 2 years after GKRS in most patients (92.8%). No significant association was observed between any of the parameters investigated and the development of hydrocephalus, with the exception of tumor enhancement pattern. Group B exhibited a statistically significant difference by univariate analysis (P?= 0.002); this difference was also significant by multivariate analysis (P?= 0.006). Conclusion Because hydrocephalus is curable, patients should be closely monitored for the development of this disorder after GKRS. In particular, patients with intracranial schwannomas with irregular enhancement patterns or cysts should be meticulously observed. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Complication; Gamma knife radiosurgery; Hydrocephalus; Schwannoma,"adolescent; adult; aged; Article; communicating hydrocephalus; disease association; female; gamma knife; gamma knife radiosurgery; human; image enhancement; major clinical study; male; neurilemoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient monitoring; retrospective study; risk factor; Brain Neoplasms; complication; diagnostic imaging; hydrocephalus; middle aged; Neurilemmoma; procedures; radiosurgery; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Hydrocephalus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neurilemmoma; Radiosurgery; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84953410462

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to report a case of the occurrence of common iliac vessel displacement into the intervertebral disc space following one of the spinal compensatory mechanisms. Material and methods: The authors demonstrated this case by showing the patient history, physical examination, imaging studies, and treatment strategy as well as by reviewing some related literature. Results: An 81-year-old woman presented with a long history of low back pain with claudication. An upright plain radiograph and flexion–extension study demonstrated a progressive local thoracolumbar kyphosis and losing of lumbar lordosis with significant widening of the intervertebral disc space of L4–L5. An MRI scan and 3D volume rendering spiral computed tomography (3D-CT) revealed an abnormal content which was depicted as common iliac vessels inside the disc space of L4–L5. Consequently, a rare case of the occurrence of common iliac vessel displacement into the intervertebral disc space following one of the spinal compensatory mechanisms was reported. Conclusion: The occurrence of vascular displacement into the intervertebral disc space related to lumbar hyperextension, as a compensating mechanism, is a rare incident but can occur. Consequently, when this mechanism presents with abnormal widening of the intervertebral disc space, especially at the low lumbar level, it should raise surgeon’s concern about the probability of vascular injury when performing a disc procedure. Thorough investigation with imaging studies and selecting the optimum surgical treatment are warranted. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Compensatory mechanism; Intervertebral disc space; Sagittal imbalance; Spine; Vascular displacement,"aged; Article; body posture; bone matrix; case report; claudication; conservative treatment; female; follow up; human; intervertebral disc space; intervertebral disk; knee function; kyphosis; lordosis; low back pain; medical history; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical examination; priority journal; spine disease; spine radiography; spiral computer assisted tomography; very elderly; complication; iliac vein; injuries; intervertebral disk; intervertebral disk hernia; lumbar vertebra; pathology; thoracic vertebra; vascularization; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Iliac Vein; Intervertebral Disc; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Kyphosis; Lumbar Vertebrae; Thoracic Vertebrae",2-s2.0-84939420071

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and other clinical characteristics of SGD in elderly Korean individuals. Methods: A total of 280 subjects aged >60 years identified through the outpatient department at our hospital were included in this study. Basic clinical information was collected, and the subjects were evaluated clinically for gluteal lesions. Skin biopsies were performed in eight of the patients diagnosed with SGD. Results: Among a total of 280 subjects, 37 were diagnosed with SGD. Their mean age was 70.4 years. The prevalence of SGD was found to increase with age. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between SGD and lower lean body mass, longer period of a sedentary lifestyle, use of a Korean-style mattress, and diabetes mellitus. Most patients had either mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. Skin biopsies showed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, follicular plugging, and meandering superficial vessel proliferation with mild lymphohistiocytic infiltration. None of the biopsy specimens exhibited amyloid deposition. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that SGD is a common disorder in elderly Korean individuals and is associated with prolonged periods of rest such as those occurring in a highly sedentary lifestyle and with sleeping on a Korean-style mattress. ? 2015 The International Society of Dermatology.",,"acanthosis; adult; aged; Article; bed; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; histiocytosis; human; human cell; human tissue; hyperkeratosis; Korean (people); lean body weight; lymphocytic infiltration; major clinical study; male; outpatient department; prevalence; sedentary lifestyle; senile gluteal dermatosis; skin biopsy; skin disease; age; body mass; buttock; diabetes mellitus; Lichenoid Eruptions; middle aged; pathology; risk factor; sedentary lifestyle; South Korea; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bedding and Linens; Body Mass Index; Buttocks; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Lichenoid Eruptions; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Sedentary Lifestyle",2-s2.0-84938267641

Acupuncture has been studied with regard to the rising need for treating FD, but the mechanism verifying its efficacy has not yet been fully revealed. The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and mechanism of acupuncture for FD compared with a sham group. Methods/design: We describe a proposal for a randomized, assessor-blind, sham-controlled trial with 70 eligible participants who will be randomly allocated either into an acupuncture or a sham group. Participants in the acupuncture group will receive 10 sessions of real acupuncture treatment and those in the sham group will be treated with identical sessions using a Streitberger needle. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and metabolomics studies will be implemented before and after 4 weeks of treatment to investigate the mechanism of acupuncture. The primary outcome is a proportion of responders with adequate symptom relief and the secondary outcomes include the Nepean Dyspepsia Index - Korean version, Functional Dyspepsia-Related Quality of Life questionnaire, Ways of Coping Questionnaire, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, perception of bodily sensation questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale. The outcomes will be evaluated before and after the treatment. Discussion: This is the first large-scale trial evaluating the efficacy and mechanism of acupuncture with fMRI and metabolomic methods. We will compare real acupuncture with the Streitberger sham needle to verify the specific effect of acupuncture.

Leptin-deficient obese mice were treated with two different doses, 100 mg/kg body weight (BW) and 300 mg/kg BW of each AIN93G supplement, for 7 weeks. Treatment of obese mice with both low and high doses of Sinetrol-XPur significantly reduced body weight gain compared to control obese mice. White adipose tissue weight of mice was reduced by 30.96% in high dose-supplemented groups. Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride were reduced by a high dose of Sinetrol-XPur by 20.02% and 30.96%, respectively. Serum level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) was significantly increased by treatment with both doses, as the ratio of HDL to low density lipoprotein increased by 138.78% and 171.49%, respectively. Regarding expression of biochemical factors related to lipid metabolism, fatty acid synthase significantly decreased and UCP-2 increased upon treatment with a high dose of Sinetrol-XPur, but there was no significant difference in lipoprotein lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. To define cellular mechanism, intracellular cAMP levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner over the range of 50?250 μg/mL. The phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine clearly blocked cAMP, suggesting that Sinetrol-XPur promotes lipolysis of adipocytes through inhibition of cAMP-dependent PDE, resulting in induction of cAMP response element binding protein and UCP-2. These results suggest that Sinetrol-XPur supplementation is a viable option for reducing body weight and fat by improving serum lipid profiles and genetic expression of lipid metabolic factors, especially activation of cAMP-dependent UCP-2. ? 2016, Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.

To measure the point-absorbed dose and the 2D dose distribution for the patient’s therapy plan, we fabricated a solid phantom that allowed for the insertion of an applicator for patient-specific QA and used an ion chamber and a film as measuring devices. The patient treatment plan was exported to the QA dose-calculation software, which calculated the time weight of dwell position stored in the plan DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) file to obtain an overall beam quality correction factor, and that correction was applied to the dose calculations. Experiments were conducted after importing the patient’s treatment planning source data for the fabricated phantom and inserting the applicator, ion chamber, and film into the phantom. On completion of dose delivery, the doses to the ion chamber and film were checked against the corresponding treatment plan to evaluate the dosimetric accuracy. For experimental purposes, five treatment plans were randomly selected. The beam quality correction factors for ovoid and tandem brachytherapy applicators were found to be 1.15 and 1.10 ? 1.12, respectively. The beam quality correction factor in tandem fluctuated by approximately 2%, depending on the changes in the dwell position. The doses measured by using the ion chamber showed differences ranging from ?2.4% to 0.6%, compared to the planned doses. As for the film, the passing rate was 90% or higher when assessed using a gamma value of the local dose difference of 3% and a distance to agreement of 3 mm. The results show that the self-fabricated phantom was suitable for QA in clinical settings. The proposed patient-specific QA for the treatment planning is expected to contribute to reduce dosimetric errors in brachytherapy and, thus, to enhancing treatment accuracy. ? 2016, The Korean Physical Society.",Applicator; Brachytherapy; Patient-specific QA; Phantom,,2-s2.0-84964311344

In this study, we explored seasonal hormone profiles in two brood parasitic Cuculus species breeding in the Republic of Korea. As brood parasites have relatively simple breeding stages without incubation and provisioning, we predicted that during the breeding season individuals would exhibit similar levels of testosterone (T) and stress-induced corticosterone (CORT), hormones that are known to be closely related to the transition of breeding stages. We also assessed how these hormone profiles were associated with traits such as body size and sex. Overall, male cuckoos showed similarly high T levels throughout the breeding season, as predicted, but individual variation became greater as the season progressed. Individual CORT levels tended to decrease as the season progressed, although the decrease was significant only in Common Cuckoos Cuculus canorus. We also found that male Lesser Cuckoos Cuculus poliocephalus showed a much higher level of T than females, as expected, but this sexual difference was not observed in Common Cuckoos. Our results suggest that the seasonal hormone profiles of avian brood parasites are likely to be similar to typical hormone profiles expected for non-brood parasites during the breeding season. This may suggest that not only the breeding cycle but also other factors such as social interaction may be affected by hormonal changes. Further studies are needed to fully understand the proximate mechanism of avian brood parasitism. ? 2016 British Ornithologists' Union.",Brood parasites; Common Cuckoo; Corticosterone; Hormone; Lesser Cuckoo; Testosterone,Aves; Cuculidae; Cuculus; Cuculus canorus; Cuculus poliocephalus,2-s2.0-84961966628

There are increasing numbers of published studies based on endoscopic databases such as the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative. However, no study has yet validated such data. We compared colonoscopic findings reported by an endoscopic documentation software (Provation) against manually collected medical records data from two similar patient cohorts in the same endoscopy unit. Methods: In November 2011, our unit switched from dictation-based text documentation to the Provation system. As a quality control initiative, we collected data on 9614 patients who had undergone colonoscopies from January 2010 to November 2011, using manual electronic chart review. We compared these data against those generated by Provation on 7091 similar patients who underwent colonoscopy from November 2011 to March 2013. Results: Age, sex and procedural indication distribution were similar between the Manual and Provation cohorts, as were the large (?1?cm) polyp (7.6 vs. 8.1?%; p?=?0.25) and advanced neoplasia (8.3 vs. 8.2?%; p?=?0.80) prevalences. However, there were significant differences in the polyp (46.9 vs. 49.8?%) and adenoma prevalences (31.3 vs. 26.8?%; p?<?0.001). Furthermore, the Manual cohort had a higher prevalence of diverticulosis and hemorrhoids, and a lower colonoscopy completion rate. Stratification by indication resulted in additional discrepancies between the two cohorts for screening and surveillance patients. There were also differences in the anatomic (right vs. left colon) distribution of large polyps. Conclusions: There were significant discrepancies between data from Provation and manually collected medical records data. Although the two cohorts were enrolled during slightly different time periods, they came from the same endoscopy unit, had the same endoscopists and indications, and demonstrated similar demographics, making it unlikely for there to be true differences between the cohorts independent of documentation method. Thus, caution is advised when using endoscopic data for research. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Adenoma; Colonoscopy; Colorectal cancer; Endoscopic database; Polyp,"adult; Article; cohort analysis; colonoscopy; colorectal adenoma; colorectal tumor; computer program; data base; diverticulosis; female; gastrointestinal endoscopy; hemorrhoid; human; incidence; intestine preparation; major clinical study; male; medical documentation; medical record review; pathological anatomy; polyp; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; validation process; Colonic Diseases; comparative study; factual database; medical record; middle aged; quality control; software; validation study; Colonic Diseases; Colonoscopy; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Records; Middle Aged; Quality Control; Software",2-s2.0-84961830055

Methods: Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey V were used. A stratified, three-stage, clustered probability design was used to collect representative data on the Korean population. Ultimately, 18,587 participants were included. The incidence of isolated dipstick hematuria and its relationship with the GFR (estimated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation) were evaluated. Results: The analysis showed that 31.8?% of the population had isolated hematuria, the incidence of which significantly increased with age (Ptrend?&lt;?0.001).

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of GMHGYGT on ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization/challenge-induced AR in BALB/C mice, through examination of allergic inflammatory response regulation, as well as examination of human mast cells (HMC-1). Methods: Nasal symptoms were evaluated in the OVA-induced allergic rhinitis mouse model, and total immunoglobulin (Ig)E and OVA-specific IgE levels in serum were investigated. Eosinophil infiltration and thickness of the nasal mucosa, and levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and caspase-1 were also measured by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the effect of GMHGYGT on the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, C-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 in HMC-1 cells was investigated. Results: GMHGYGT was demonstrated to have antiallergic effects on the nasal symptoms of the OVA-induced mouse model, decreasing serum levels of OVA-specific IgE and levels of the cytokines IL-5, IL-6, IL-1β, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2. GMHGYGT reduced the number of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa and thickness of the nasal septum, and inhibited the expression of IL-1β and caspase-1. Moreover, it inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and C-Jun N-terminal kinase, as well as the activation of nuclear factor-κB on protein level in HMC-1 cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that GMHGYGT has therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. ? 2015.",Allergic rhinitis; Cytokines; Gami-hyunggyeyeongyotang; Immunoglobulin E; Nasal symptom; Nuclear factor κB,"antiallergic agent; calcimycin; cetirizine; gami hyunggyeyeongyotang; herbaceous agent; I kappa B alpha; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; macrophage inflammatory protein 2; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; ovalbumin; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; antiallergic agent; cytokine; herbaceous agent; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; ovalbumin; allergic rhinitis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell infiltration; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; dose response; drug dose comparison; enzyme activation; eosinophil count; female; human; human cell; immunoglobulin blood level; immunoglobulin production; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; mast cell; mouse; nonhuman; nose mucosa; protein degradation; protein phosphorylation; sensitization; sneezing; Western blotting; animal; Bagg albino mouse; blood; cell culture; drug effects; immunology; mast cell; metabolism; pathology; Rhinitis, Allergic; Animals; Anti-Allergic Agents; Cells, Cultured; Cytokines; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Mast Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Nasal Mucosa; NF-kappa B; Ovalbumin; Rhinitis, Allergic",2-s2.0-84956611743

The traditional ways of searching information from the online resources has been evolved and the tendency is geared more towards getting quality contents. In healthcare domain, the clinical researchers and physicians are even more interested to find quality information to use as a clinical evidence in decision making. An increasing number of potential articles in the form of MEDLINE articles are readily available to be retrieved, helps in evidence-based clinical decisions, however, the retrieval methods pose several challenges to clinicians. The first challenge is to automatically reformulate the user query into a knowledge-intensive query in order to acquire articles that are relevant to user needs. The second challenge is to re-evaluate the retrieved articles in order to get quality studies and filter-out all the low quality articles. In this paper, we approach to solve these challenges by proposing two methods to construct knowledge-intensive query for relevant evidence acquisition and statistical model for quality evidence appraisal. The construction of knowledge-intensive query is based on the term expansion using domain model, name variants, and terminological variants. The statistical model is learnt on a corpus prepared through automatic construction of feature vectors from data and metadata features. We evaluate the results at two levels; 1) pre-appraisal stage, 2) post-appraisal stage. We compared the results based on the retrieved result sets with knowledge-intensive query approach and simple query approach. The proposed knowledge-intensive query approach successfully retrieves the potential evidences with average 12.33% improved accuracy in contrast to simple query approach. Furthermore, we performed human evaluation to identify the overall satisfaction of the proposed approach. From the user input, we learned that the proposed approach contributes to maximizing the clinical throughput of clinicians by minimizing the unnecessary intermediary manual steps in evidence retrieval and the appraisal process. ? 2016 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI).",Content-based retrieval; Evidence Appraisal; Information filtering; Keyword search; Machine learning,Artificial intelligence; Content based retrieval; Decision making; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Quality control; Query processing; Search engines; Automatic construction; Clinical researchers; Evidence acquisition; Evidence Appraisal; Information and Communication Technologies; Keyword search; Quality information; Statistical modeling; Information filtering,2-s2.0-84962833984

This adverse effect potentially leads to various lesions such as erythema, ulcerations, pain, opportunistic infections, and weight loss. Although there are many experimental studies and clinical trials related to novel therapies for radiation-induced oral mucositis, we here evaluate the protective effect of orally administrated Yeoldahanso-tang (YDHS) on radiation-induced oral mucosal damage in a mouse model. YDHS is a traditional Korean herbal formula, containing 7 herbs: Pueraria thunbergiana Benth., Angelica tenuissima Nakai, Platycodon grandiflorum (Jacq.) A. DC., Raphanus sativus var., Angelica dahurica Benth. et Hooker f., Cimicifuga heracleifolia Kom., and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. Oral mucosal damage was induced by irradiation (17?Gy) throughout the head and neck area in male BALB/c mice. YDHS (400 or 800?mg/kg/day for consecutive 12?days) was administered orally, and the protective effect was determined by histological evaluation of the oral mucosa. We found that irradiation highly increased COX-2 expression in salivary glands and its expression was suppressed by YDHS. Histologically, the irradiated mice exhibited the epithelial thickness from the basement membrane to the stratum granulosum significantly decreased as compared to the vehicle group. YDHS-treated mice showed significantly recovered epithelial cell layer thickness compared to irradiated group. Similarly, YDHS-treated group also showed the expression of Ki-67, cell proliferation maker, in the basal layer compared to the irradiated group in both dorsal and ventral surface. From these results, we suggest that YDHS is a promising candidate for preventing or treating radiation-induced oral mucositis during radiation therapy. ? 2015, Institute of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Ki-67; Oral mucositis; Radiation therapy; Traditional Korean medicine; Yeoldahanso-tang,cyclooxygenase 2; herbaceous agent; Ki 67 antigen; radioprotective agent; unclassified drug; yeoldahanso tang; Angelica dahurica; Angelica tenuissima; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; basement membrane; Cimicifuga heracleifolia; controlled study; herb; male; mouse; mouth mucosa; nonhuman; oral mucositis; Platycodon; priority journal; Pueraria thunbergiana; radiation injury; radish; salivary gland; Scutellaria baicalensis,2-s2.0-84962490811

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 317 consecutive patients referred for knee MRI at our institution between October 2009 and December 2009. Interposition of the PCL into the medial compartment of the knee joint on proton coronal MRI was evaluated dichotomously (i.e., present or absent). We analyzed the interposition according to its prevalence as well as its relationship with right-left sidedness, gender, age, and disease categories (osteoarthritis, anterior cruciate ligament tear, and medial meniscus tear). Results: Prevalence of interposition of PCL into the medial compartment of the knee joint was 47.0% (149/317). There was no right (50.0%, 83/166) to left (43.7%, 66/151) or male (50.3%, 87/173) to female (43.1%, 62/144) differences in the prevalence. There was no significant association between the prevalence and age, or the disease categories. Conclusion: Interposition of the PCL into the medial compartment of the knee joint is observed in almost half of patients on proton coronal MRI of the knee. Its presence is not associated with any particular factors including knee pathology and may be regarded as a normal MR finding. ? 2016 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Anatomic variation; Knee; Magnetic resonance imaging; Posterior cruciate ligament,"adolescent; adult; aged; arthroscopic surgery; Article; avulsion fracture; child; clinical feature; female; human; image analysis; knee ligament injury; major clinical study; male; medial meniscus tear; medical record; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; osteoarthritis; posterior cruciate ligament interposition; prevalence; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; retrospective study; right left sidedness; diagnostic imaging; image processing; knee; knee meniscus; middle aged; osteoarthritis; posterior cruciate ligament; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84960099246

Methods: 16 consecutive patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with single-stage posterior subtotal corpectomy and circumferential reconstruction. The mean patient age was 54.8 years. The mean follower up period was 25 months. Five patients suffered from T12 fractures, 10 from L1, 1 from L2. The segmental kyphosis, neurologic status, visual analogue scale for back pain was evaluated before surgery and at follow up. Results: The segmental kyphotic angle improved from 18.5 degrees before surgery to -9.2 degrees at the last follow up. The mean correction angle was 28.9 degrees. The mean surgical time was 255 minutes, and a mean intraoperative blood loss was 1073 mL. Intraoperative complications included two dural tears, and a superficial wound infection. There were no other severe complications. The mean visual analog scale of back pain decreased from a mean value of 6.6 to 2 at the last follow up. Conclusion: The single-stage posterior subtotal corpectomy and circumferential reconstruction achieved satisfactory kyphosis correction with direct visualization of the circumferentially decompressed spinal cord, as well as good fusion with less blood loss and complications.

Inflammatory reactions have an important function in the pathophysiology of depression. Ikwitang (IW) has been used to treat fever and inflammatory diseases, however, its effect on depression has not been previously investigated. Therefore, the present study evaluated the possible antidepressant-like effect of IW using a forced swimming test (FST) in mice. IW was orally administered for 14 days. On the 14 day, IW was administered 1 h prior to the FST. The immobility durations of the IW groups (0.01, 0.1 and 1 g/kg) were significantly decreased, compared with those of the distilled water (D.W.) groups. The reduction of immobility duration by IW was associated with significant increases in the levels of serotonin, noradrenaline and estrogen receptor-β in the brain. IW significantly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases, compared with the D.W. groups. In addition, the levels of inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced following IW administration in the hippocampus and serum.

We tested the hypothesis that histamine would attenuate blood pressure (BP), cardiac output (CO), and vascular resistance responses to short-term, submaximal dynamic exercise during H2 receptor blockade. Fourteen healthy men (20-29 years of age) were studied. Systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean arterial (MAP) BP and heart rate (HR) were assessed at rest and during the last minute of 10 min of submaximal cycling exercise (60% of peak oxygen consumption) in the absence and presence of histamine H2 receptor blockade (ranitidine, 300 mg). Stroke volume (SV) (impedance cardiography) and plasma norepinephrine (NE) were measured, and CO, rate × pressure product (RPP), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were calculated. Plasma levels of histamine were also measured. H2 blockade had no effects on any variables at rest. During exercise, SBP (184±3mmHg vs. 166±2mmHg), MAP (121 ± 2mmHg vs. 112±5mmHg), and RPP (25.9 ± 0.8 × 103mmHg beats/min vs. 23.5 ± 0.8 × 103mmHg/beats min) were greater during blocked conditions (P &lt; 0.05), and an interaction was observed for TPR. SV, DBP, HR, and NE levels were unaffected by blockade. Plasma histamine increased from 1.83 ± 0.14 ng/mL at rest to 2.33 ± 0.23 ng/mL during exercise (P &lt; 0.05) and was not affected by H2 blockade (1.56 ± 0.23 ng/mL vs. 1.70 ± 0.24 ng/mL). These findings suggest that, during submaximal exercise, histamine attenuates BP, vascular resistance, and the work of the heart via activation of H2 receptors and that these effects occurred primarily in the vasculature and not in the myocardium. ? 2016, National Research Council of Canada.

We characterize key health test readings and basic demographic information from 10,816 South Koreans, obtained from two Ubiquitous Healthcare (U-Healthcare) centers that have distinct surrounding neighborhood characteristics. One is located in a rural area in Busan, the other is located in an urban area in Daegu surrounded by a highly crowded residential and commercial business area. We analyze comprehensive health data sets, including blood pressure, body mass index, pulse rate, and body fat percentage from December 2013 to December 2014 to study differences in overall health test measurements between users of rural and urban U-Healthcare centers. We conduct multiple regression analyses to evaluate differences in general health status between the two centers, adjusting for confounding factors. We report statistical evidence of differences in blood pressure at the two locations. As local residents are major users, the result indicates that the environmental surroundings of the centers can influence the demographics of the users, the type of health tests in demand, and the users' health status. We further envision that U-Healthcare centers will provide public users with an opportunity for enhancing their current health, which could potentially be used to prevent them from developing chronic diseases, while providing surveillance healthcare data. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Environment; Health promotion; Neighborhood and health; Physical activity; Self-healthcare; U-healthcare,"demography; health care; health status; multiple regression; neighborhood; physical activity; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; blood pressure; body fat distribution; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; environmental factor; female; geographic distribution; health center; health promotion; health service; health status; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neighborhood; obesity; physical activity; prevalence; pulse rate; rural health care; seasonal variation; sex difference; South Korea; urban area; urban rural difference; wellbeing; environment; health disparity; regression analysis; rural health; statistics and numerical data; urban health; very elderly; Pusan [South Korea]; South Korea; Taegu [South Korea]; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environment; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Regression Analysis; Republic of Korea; Residence Characteristics; Rural Health; Urban Health",2-s2.0-84957605274

The symptom is common, but highly troublesome, and it reduces quality of life. Despite much effort to develop a protocol for diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, it remains problematic to determine its cause. As a result, treatment is often unsuccessful. Thus, there is much interest regarding the use of symptomatic drugs to control chronic cough. Maekmoondong-tang is widely used in East Asian countries to treat chronic dry cough. Several experimental studies have reported that the herbal medicine has immunomodulatory and antitussive effects. Clinical studies involving Maekmoondong-tang have also been carried out; however, these studies have involved treating various diseases as a whole rather than chronic cough itself. Thus, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Maekmoondong-tang in chronic dry cough patients with a randomized controlled trial. Methods/Design: This study is designed as an exploratory, single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel group clinical trial. Patients with dry cough that has lasted more than 8 weeks will be recruited, after a 1-week run-in period, and randomly allocated to either the Maekmoondong-tang treatment group or the placebo group. The patients will receive Maekmoondong-tang or placebo granules 3 times daily for 4 weeks, with a 2-week follow-up. The primary outcome is a 10-point cough diary that will be recorded on a daily basis. The secondary outcomes comprise a cough visual analog scale, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (Korean version), the Pattern Identification for Chronic Cough Questionnaire, biomarkers, safety testing, etc. Adverse events will also be reported. Discussion: This trial will assess the efficacy and safety of Maekmoondong-tang in chronic dry cough.

We examined data concerning the acceptable duration between occupational exposure and administration of a hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) injection in an occupational clinical setting. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted with data from 143 cases of HCWs exposed to HBV in 15 secondary and tertiary teaching hospitals between January 2005 and June 2013. Data were taken from the infection control records of each hospital. Results Active vaccination after HBV exposure was started in 119 cases (83.2%) and postvaccination testing for hepatitis B antibody showed positive seroconversion in 93% of cases. In 98 cases (68.5%), HBIG was administered within 24 hours after HBV exposure; however, 45 HCWs (31.5%) received an HBIG injection more than 24 hours postexposure and 2 among the 45 received an injection after 7 days. Although 31.5% received an HBIG injection more than 24 hours postexposure, no cases of seroconversion to hepatitis b antibody positivity occurred. Conclusions For susceptible HCWs, HBIG administered between 24 hours and 7 days postexposure may be as effective as administration within 24 hours in preventing occupational HBV infection. ? 2016 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.",Health care workers; Hepatitis B virus; Occupational exposure; Postexposure prophylaxis; Treatment outcomes,hepatitis B antibody; hepatitis B antibody; hepatitis B hyperimmune globulin; immunoglobulin; Article; clinical effectiveness; female; follow up; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; injection; major clinical study; male; multicenter study (topic); occupational exposure; occupational health service; retrospective study; seroconversion; teaching hospital; tertiary care center; vaccination; adult; blood; clinical trial; health care personnel; hepatitis B; immunology; middle aged; multicenter study; post exposure prophylaxis; South Korea; time factor; Adult; Female; Health Personnel; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Antibodies; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Post-Exposure Prophylaxis; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors,2-s2.0-84958846607

The aims of this study were to evaluate GLTSCR2 expression in RCC tissue and to determine pathological significance of GLTSCR2 in terms of tumor grade. RCC and adjacent normal tissue from 84 different patients was retrieved from nephrectomy specimens. The expression level of GLTSCR2 in RCC tissues was determined via immunohistochemical staining and invasion was determined using transwell chambers with Matrigel-coated membranes. The expression of GLTSCR2 was suppressed in about 80% of the carcinoma specimens compared to noncancerous renal tissue and inversely correlated with Fuhrman nuclear grade (r = -0.40, p < 0.05). Knockdown of GLTSCR2 expression increased the invasiveness of SNU267 RCC cells. The expression of GLTSCR2 was suppressed in RCCs and its downregulation accentuated the malignant phenotype. ? 2015 Elsevier GmbH.",Glioblastoma tumor suppressive candidate region gene 2; Immunohistochemistry; Invasion; Renal cell carcinoma,"GLTSCR2 protein; nuclear protein; unclassified drug; GLTSCR2 protein, human; tumor marker; tumor suppressor protein; adult; Article; cancer grading; cancer staging; carcinogenesis; controlled study; disease association; down regulation; female; human; human tissue; immunoreactivity; kidney carcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; protein depletion; protein expression; protein function; tumor volume; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; cell motion; genetic transfection; genetics; immunohistochemistry; Kidney Neoplasms; metabolism; pathology; phenotype; RNA interference; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Down-Regulation; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Phenotype; RNA Interference; Transfection; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",2-s2.0-84957666674

To review the outcome of Z-plasty of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon at the tarsal tunnel for checkrein deformity in 8 patients. Methods. Records of 6 males and 2 females aged 14 to 67 (mean, 39.5) years who underwent Z-plasty (lengthening) of the FHL tendon at the tarsal tunnel for checkrein deformity in the first and second toes by a single surgeon were reviewed. All patients had undergone 3 months of conservative treatment. The mean time from injury to surgical treatment was 8.4 (range, 5–12) months. All patients had associated injuries including distal tibiofibular fracture (n=6), distal fibular fracture (n=1), and crush injury around the ankle (n=1); they were treated with intramedullary nailing (n=6), long leg splinting (n=1), and short leg splinting (n=1). Results. After a mean follow-up of 3.4 (range, 1–7) years, the FHL tendon was lengthened by a mean of 1.7 (range, 1.6–1.8) cm, and the mean American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society hallux score increased from 59 (range, 52–67) to 89 (range, 80–90).

Objective: The aim of this study was to provide methods for predicting ideal trajectory and position of C1 lateral mass screw (C1LMS) from plain radiographs. Summary of Background Data: There has been no study on prediction of C1LMS position using plain radiographs. Methods: A total of 40 consecutive subjects (with 79 screws) who had undergone C1LMS placement were enrolled. To evaluate the C1LMS position, the positions of screw head and tips on anteroposterior radiographs, screw length, and height on lateral radiograph were graded as 0, I, and II, respectively. On the postoperative computed tomography images, we analyzed lateral mass (LM) perforation, screw-thread engagement percent (%), bicortical fixation, extruded screw length, and violation of adjacent joints. Results: Screws with tip located medial to LM(tip 0) showed LM perforation in all cases. Polyaxial head located within the LM (head 0) or crossing the lateral margin of the LM (head I) showed no LM perforation. Screw-thread engagement percent was the highest with head I-tip I (medial half of LM) position (97.6%), followed by head 0-tip I (90.5%) and head I-tip II (lateral half of LM) (86.4%). Screws longer than the posterior half of C1 anterior arch (AA) showed bicortical fixation in all cases with mean extruded screw length of 1.9mm. Adjacent joint was not violated in 98%, with the screw height below half of C1AA. Conclusions: On an anteroposterior radiograph, a C1LMS with the screw head located on the lateral margin of the LM and with the screw tip in the medial half of the LM resulted in the safest and longest trajectory. On lateral radiograph, a screw tip that is placed within the anterior-inferior quadrant of the C1AA results in safe bicortical fixation without injury to the adjacent structures. These plain radiographic findings may be helpful both postoperatively and intraoperatively for assessing the trajectory and length of the screw. Copyright ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

To evaluate the dose distribution and coverage of axilla using only tangential field for whole breast radiotherapy (RT) at three institutions in Korea. Methods. We used computed tomography (CT) images of nine consecutive 1-2 sentinel lymph node-positive patients who underwent breast conserving surgery and whole breast RT without axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection for clinical T1-2N0 breast cancer. The CT data were transferred to three radiation oncologists in 3 institutions and each radiation oncologist created treatment plans for all nine patients; a total of 27 treatment plans were analyzed. Results. The mean doses delivered to levels I and II were 31.9 Gy (9.9-47.9 Gy) and 22.3 Gy (3.4-47.7 Gy). Ninety-five percent of levels I and II received a mean dose of 11.8 Gy (0.4-43.0 Gy) and 3.0 Gy (0.3-40.0 Gy).

This study compared the pharmacokinetics (PK) and evaluated the bioequivalence of two levofloxacin 100-mg tablet formulations. An open, randomized, two-way crossover study was conducted in 28 healthy volunteers. The reference (Cravit Tab 100-mg, Jeil) or test (Levobacter Tab, Seoul) formulation was administered and serial blood samples were collected over 24 h for PK analysis. Levofloxacin plasma concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The correlation of levofloxacin concentration at various time points with the area under the concentration time-curve over the time interval from 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) was estimated to determine the best reflected time point. The average half-life, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and AUClast were comparable. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratio (GMR test/reference) of AUClast and Cmax were 0.8200-1.0633 and 0.9474-1.0643 respectively. Both formulations were tolerated with no clinically relevant safety issues. Plasma levofloxacin concentrations at various time points correlated well with the AUCinf, and showed high correlation coefficients (r &gt; 0.7, P &lt; 0.001) for both drugs 8 and 12 h after administration. Both formulations showed similar PK profiles while levofloxacin plasma levels after administration indicated their bioequivalence. The Cmax and AUClast GMR 90% CIs were 0.80-1.25. Moreover, 12 h was the best time point to predict the AUCinf and therefore suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring. ? 2016 Translational and Clinical Pharmacology.",Bioequivalence; Comparative PK; Levofloxacin; Pharmacokinetics,levofloxacin; adult; Article; bioequivalence; blood pressure measurement; blood sampling; body temperature; comparative study; controlled study; correlation coefficient; crossover procedure; drug blood level; drug clearance; drug dosage form comparison; drug half life; elimination rate constant; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human experiment; male; maximum plasma concentration; normal human; patient compliance; physical examination; plasma concentration-time curve; pulse rate; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; tablet formulation; tandem mass spectrometry; time to maximum plasma concentration; unspecified side effect,2-s2.0-85003454620

We reviewed the medical records of 307 patients who were diagnosed with ABP between January 2006 and December 2015. The etiologic pathogens and risk factors for ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and ESBL-producing microbes, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, and the incidence of ESBL in patients with ABP were described. History of prior urologic manipulation was an independent risk factor for ciprofloxacin-resistant (P = 0.005) and ESBL-producing microbes (P = 0.005). Advanced age (over 60 years) was an independent risk factor for ciprofloxacin-resistant microbes (P = 0.022). The ciprofloxacin susceptibility for Escherichia coli in groups without prior manipulation was documented 85.7%. For groups with prior manipulation, the susceptibility was 10.0%. Incidence of ESBL-producing microbes by pathogen was 3.8% for E. coli and 1.0% for Klebsiella pneumonia in the absence of manipulation group, and 20% and 33.3% in the presence of manipulation group, respectively. Initial treatment of ABP must consider patient's age and the possibility of prior manipulation to optimize patient treatment. With the high rate of resistance to fluoroquinolone, cephalosporins with amikacin, or carbapenems, or extended-spectrum penicillin with beta lactamase inhibitor should be considered as the preferred empirical ABP treatment in the patients with history of prior urologic manipulation. ? 2016 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Acute bacterial prostatitis; Ciprofloxacin; Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; Risk factors,"amikacin; antiinfective agent; beta lactamase; cephalosporin derivative; ciprofloxacin; imipenem; acute disease; adult; age; aged; antibiotic resistance; Bacterial Infections; drug effects; enzymology; Escherichia coli; human; isolation and purification; Klebsiella pneumoniae; male; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; middle aged; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; prostatitis; retrospective study; risk factor; South Korea; Acute Disease; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Amikacin; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Infections; beta-Lactamases; Cephalosporins; Ciprofloxacin; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia coli; Humans; Imipenem; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Prostatitis; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-84995483140

However, chronic communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis persist worldwide. Furthermore, emerging new infections such as H1N1 influenza pose a new threat to public health. However, most studies have focused on noncommunicable diseases because of their increasing incidence, with fewer studies investigating communicable diseases. Therefore, we estimated the burden of communicable diseases in Korea using national representative 2012 data. To estimate the disability-adjusted life years (DALY), we used cause of death data from the Statistics Korea to estimate the years of life lost (YLL), applied the Korean garbage code algorithm, and used national claims data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) to estimate years lived with disability (YLD). In 2012, the total DALYs of communicable disease were 445 per 100,000, with 129 YLLs per 100,000 and 316 YLDs per 100,000. The total DALYs in men were 468 per 100,000, greater than the 422 per 100,000 DALYs seen in women. The DALYs of lower respiratory infections were the highest value among communicable diseases at 143/100,000 DALYs followed by tuberculosis and upper respiratory infections. The 40- 49 years old age group had the largest number of total DALYs. In contrast, the over 80 years old age group had the largest number of total DALYs per 100,000 followed by the 70-79 and 0-9 years old age groups. These results enable the prioritization of interventions related to communicable diseases and can be used for evidence-based public health policies. ? 2016 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Chronic communicable disease; Communicable disease; Disability-adjusted life years; Emerging infection,"adolescent; adult; aged; child; Communicable Diseases; economics; female; global disease burden; human; infant; male; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; quality adjusted life year; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Communicable Diseases; Female; Global Burden of Disease; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Republic of Korea; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84995469372

The burden of disease has emerged as an important approach to the assessment of health needs for political decision-making. However, the disability adjusted life years approach hides conceptual and methodological issues regarding the claims and value of disabled people. In this article, we discuss ethical issues that are raised as a consequence of the introduction of evidencebased health policy, such as economic evidence, in establishing resource allocation priorities. In terms of ethical values in health priority setting in Korea, there is no reliable rationale for the judgment used in decision-making as well as for setting separate and distinct priorities for different government bodies. An important question, therefore, is which ethical values guiding the practice of decision-making should be reconciled with the economic evidence found in Korean healthcare. The health technology assessment core model from the European network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) project is a good example of incorporating ethical values into decision-making. We suggest that a fair distribution of scarce healthcare resources in South Korea can be achieved by considering the ethical aspects of healthcare. ? 2016 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Burden of Disease; Cost of Illness; Ethical Analysis; Health Policy; Korea,"cost benefit analysis; cost of illness; decision making; economics; global disease burden; health care delivery; health care policy; human; medical ethics; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; Cost of Illness; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Ethics, Medical; Global Burden of Disease; Health Policy; Humans; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Republic of Korea",2-s2.0-84995380073

Methods: Twenty-eight patients underwent osteotomies. Radiological outcomes by sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and pelvic tilt (PT), T1 pelvic angle (T1PA), and pelvic incidence (PI)-lumbar lordosis (LL) at preoperative, postoperative 1 month, and final were evaluated.

Patients were divided into 2 groups (SVA ?5 cm: normal, SVA >5 cm: positive) at final and compared outcomes. Results: Nineteen patients (68%) had PSO and the other 9 patients had SPOs with anterior lumbar interbody fusions (ALIFs) (Mean age: 65 years, follow-up: 31 months). The PT, PI-LL, SVA, T1PA were significantly improved at 1 month and at final (p<0.01).

Owing to increasing rates of cesarean section, the incidence of morbidly adherent placenta has increased. Abnormally adherent placenta is classified according to its degree of invasion of the myometrium. When the placenta penetrates completely through the myometrium, it may result in placenta percreta, possibly involving adjacent structures or organs such as the urinary bladder or rectum. The urinary bladder is the most commonly affected pelvic structure, whereas the involvement of other abdominal organs by placenta percreta is an extremely rare condition. We describe a rare case of placenta percreta invading the terminal ileum and mesentery. A 40-year-old woman presented at 28 weeks of gestation with irregular uterine contraction and vaginal bleeding. She underwent a repeat cesarean section and explorative laparotomy. Segmental resection of the perforated terminal ileum was performed. Histopathological examination revealed an adherent placenta with invasion of the chorionic villi into the ileal subserosa and mesentery. The trophoblastic origin was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Placenta percreta is associated with high maternal mortality and morbidity rates, mostly secondary to intraoperative bleeding and its consequences. A high index of suspicion for placenta percreta is required when evaluating pregnant women with a prior history of cesarean section.

However, ECG findings in NSTEMI vary, and there is a need to define the clinical characteristics and outcomes according to ECG. We analyzed the admission ECGs of 345 NSTEMI patients who underwent coronary angiography from 2006 to 2013. Demographics, procedural characteristics, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. The ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, and no ECG change groups included 114, 90, and 141 patients, respectively. The ST-segment depression group trended toward older, nonsmoking, and female, with a lower body mass index (BMI) and a higher incidence of comorbidities, than the no ECG change group. The ST-segment depression group also had a higher Killip class, a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, a higher regional wall motion score index (RWMSI), and 3-vessel coronary artery disease angiographically, than the no ECG change group. Patients with T-wave inversion trended toward older, female, lower BMI, less smoking, lower creatine kinase MB, and more left anterior descending (LAD) artery involvement, than the no ECG change group. In clinical outcomes, the ST-segment depression group had a higher mortality rate at 30 days and 12 months after the index procedure than the no ECG change group, whereas the T-wave inversion group showed similar clinical outcomes. Patients with ST-segment depression have a greater burden of comorbidities with risk factors and worse clinical outcomes, whereas patients with T-wave inversion have an intermediate number of risk factors but similar outcomes, compared with the no ECG change group.

Concordantly, when combined with FGS, CDDP significantly reduced the volume and weight of tumors derived from LLC subcutaneously injected into C57BL/6 mice, with concomitant increases of phosphor-p53 and p21 in tumor tissue. Together, these results show that FGS could enhance the antitumor activity of CDDP, suggesting that FGS can be used as a complementary measure to enhance the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic agent such as CDDP. ? 2016 Kyun Ha Kim et al.",,antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase 4; fruit hull of Gleditsia sinensis extract; plant extract; protein p21; protein p53; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer tissue; cell cycle arrest; cell viability; controlled study; drug dose comparison; drug megadose; fruit; Gleditsia; Gleditsia sinensis; in vitro study; in vivo study; Lewis carcinoma; Lewis lung carcinoma cell; low drug dose; male; medicinal plant; mouse; nonhuman; protein phosphorylation; tumor volume; tumor xenograft,2-s2.0-84990859107

It is unknown that the severity of the clinical signs is associated with the risk of coronary artery lesions (CALs). We wanted to evaluate clinical characteristics and the risk of CALs in the patient groups who had severe skin lesions or those with arthritis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 220 KD patients who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). We compared clinical and laboratory data between the group with severe skin lesions (n=52) and those with mild or no skin lesions (n=168), and between the group with arthritis (n=6) and those without arthritis (n=214). Results: The mean age of total patients was 2.23±1.87 years of age, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1 (138/82). Among 220 patients, 52 patients had CALs (23.6%), and 29 patients (13.2%) showed incomplete KD. The patients with CALs had a higher mean age, longer total fever duration, and higher rate of IVIG non-responsiveness. The patient group with severe skin lesions showed a higher mean age (P<0.001), more prolonged fever duration (P=0.041), higher frequency of CALs (P=0.033), higher WBC, neutrophil, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio levels, compared to the patient group without severe skin lesions. The patients with arthritis had a tendency of further treatment with methylprednisolone or infliximab. Conclusions: The frequency of CALs was higher in patient group with severe skin lesions. Our results suggest that the intensity of clinical signs of KD such as skin rash, cervical lymphadenopathy and possibly arthritis may be associated the risk of CALs. ? 2016, Korean Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases.

Dyslipidemia has been well-known as a common metabolic disorder contributing to cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the Pinus koraiensis needle extracts (PKE) on the blood cholesterol and oxidative stress. Method. We conducted a 12-week randomized, double-blinded controlled trial to examine the effect of PKE on blood lipid profiles in adults with borderline dyslipidemia. Thirty-three eligible persons were recruited and randomly assigned into PKE (n = 20) and placebo groups (n = 13). Serum lipids including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein- (LDL-) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein- (HDL-) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein- (VLDL-) cholesterol, and triglyceride were measured before and after trial. Serum insulin, glucose, and antioxidant indicators were also analyzed before and after trial and anthropometry and blood pressure were measured every 4 weeks. Results. After 12 weeks, PKE statically significant decreases in systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) and waist circumference (p < 0.05) were observed. Also, VLDL-cholesterol significantly decreased (from 24.4 ± 10.0 mg/dL at baseline to 18.4 ± 4.1 mg/dL after 12 weeks) (p < 0.05) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased (6.12 ± 0.41 U/mL to 9.06 ± 0.62 U/mL) (p < 0.01) in PKE group. However, after adjustment with WC, VLDL-cholesterol was not significant between groups (p = 0.095) and while SOD remained significant between groups (p = 0.013). Conclusion. The results show that PKE was effective in improving the superoxide dismutase in the individuals with borderline dyslipidemia. ? 2016 Hansongyi Lee et al.",,catalase; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; malonaldehyde; Pinus koraiensis needle extract; placebo; plant extract; superoxide dismutase; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Article; blood pressure measurement; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug isolation; drug screening; dyslipidemia; evening dosage; female; glucose blood level; human; insulin blood level; lipid blood level; male; middle aged; morning dosage; oxidative stress; pine; randomized controlled trial; systolic blood pressure; triacylglycerol blood level; waist circumference,2-s2.0-84984816428

The aim of this study was to assess the utility of an en-face projection processing for optical coherence tomography (OCT) images for SB evaluation. Methods Measurements of the SB orifice obtained using en-face OCT images were validated using a phantom model. Linear regression modeling was applied to estimated area measurements made on the en-face images. The SB orifice was then analyzed in 88 patients with bifurcation lesions treated with either Xience V (everolimus-eluting stent) or Resolute Integrity [zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES)]. The SB orifice area (A) and the area obstructed by struts (B) were calculated, and the %open area was evaluated as (A-B)/A?100. Results Linear regression modeling demonstrated that the observed departures of the intercept and slope were not significantly different from 0 (-0.12± 0.22, P=0.59) and 1 (1.01± 0.06, R2=0.88, P=0.87), respectively. In cases without SB dilatation, the %open area was significantly larger in the everolimus-eluting stent group (n=25) than in the ZES group [n=32; 89.2% (83.7-91.3) vs. 84.3% (78.9-87.8), P=0.04]. A significant difference in %open area between cases with and those without SB dilatation was demonstrated in the ZES group [91.4% (86.1-94.0) vs. 84.3% (78.9-87.8), P=0.04]. Conclusion The accuracy of SB orifice measurement on an en-face OCT image was validated using a phantom model. This novel approach enables quantitative evaluation of the differences in SB orifice area free from struts among different stent types and different treatment strategies in vivo.

The records describing the detailed process of compiling the Annals indicate that silk bags packed with the powders of ‘Cheongung’ and ‘Changpo’, which have been used as traditional herbal medicines in the northeast Asian countries such as China and Japan as well as Korea, were put in the wooden storage boxes together with the volumes of the Annals. However, there is no record that parts of plants were used in the process of compiling the Annals. The botanical origin of leaf fragments was identified as Ligusticum sinense ‘Chuanxiong’ by the analysis of trnK of chloroplast DNA as well as the examination of leaf surface with SEM. The comparative analysis of trnK sequences showed that the chloroplast DNA haplotype of ‘Tocheongung’, a triploid species cultivated in Korea, was identical with Cnidium officinale, but different from L. sinense ‘Chuanxiong’.

Methods: From July 2011 to May 2014, 103 invasive breast cancer patients who underwent preoperative MR-CAE were included. False MR-CAE results in ALN staging were compared in terms of clinicopathologic features, baseline mammography, and breast ultrasonography. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate independent factors related to false results. Results: For MR-CAE, the false-negative and false-positive results of ALN metastasis were 6.8% and 33.3%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, spiculated tumor margin (P = 0.016) and positive lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.020) were associated with false-negative results, and circumscribed tumor margin (P = 0.017) and negative lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.036) were associated with false-positive results for ALN metastasis.

Several studies conducted in Western countries have shown that obese or overweight patients with fibromyalgia (FM) exhibit more severe symptoms than patients of normal weight. However, there has been no study on the relationship between obesity and FM symptom severity in Asian patients. In this study, we evaluated the association between obesity, and other related factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), and FM symptom severity in Korean patients. Methods. A total of 343 participants were enrolled in this prospective cohort study, which used a nationwide survey of FM patients who were followed on an annual basis. We investigated health-related quality of life (QoL) and associated factors, such as demographic characteristics, SES, and physical and psychological function. The FM patients were assessed using the following self-reported questionnaires: the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Social Support Scale. Results. Of the 343 patients, 76 (22.1%) were obese; these patients did not differ from the non-obese patients in terms of tender points or self-reported questionnaire scores. FM patients with lower SES-as indexed by unemployment, lower income, and education levels-had more severe symptoms, and poorer QoL and function compared to those with higher SES. Conclusion. In contrast to Western patients, symptom severity in Korean FM patients is associated with SES, but not with obesity. ?

We have published several experimental and clinical research articles on CHD. It has shown antilipidemic, antihypertensive, antiatherosclerotic, and inhibitory effects on ischemic stroke recurrence with clinical safety in the previous studies. The antilipidemic effect of CHD results from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and pancreatic lipase-inhibitory activity. The antihypertensive effect likely results from the inhibitory effect on endogenous catecholamine(s) release and harmonization of all components showing the antihypertensive effects. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on endothelial cells are implicated to dictate the antiatherosclerotic effects of CHD. It also showed neuroprotective effects on cerebrovascular and parkinsonian models. These effects of CHD could be helpful for the prevention of the recurrence of ischemic stroke. Therefore, we suggest that CHD could be a promising medication for treating and preventing cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. However, to validate and better understand these findings, well-designed clinical studies are required. ? 2016 Woo-Sang Jung et al.",,antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; atorvastatin; chunghyul dan; herbaceous agent; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; neuroprotective agent; unclassified drug; antihypertensive activity; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; atherosclerosis; brain ischemia; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; cholesterol blood level; Coptis; degenerative disease; dyslipidemia; endothelial dysfunction; fatigue; Gardenia jasminoides; headache; human; hypertension; indigestion; insomnia; Korean medicine; neuroprotection; Review; rhubarb; Scutellaria baicalensis,2-s2.0-84975291096

The aim of this study is to systematically review trial-based economic evaluations of manual therapy relative to other interventions used for the management of musculoskeletal diseases. Methods and analysis: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on the economic evaluation of manual therapy for musculoskeletal diseases will be included in the review. The following databases will be searched from their inception: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Econlit, Mantis, Index to Chiropractic Literature, Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), National Health Service Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (NHS DARE), National Health Service Health Technology Assessment Database (NHS HTA), National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), CENTRAL, five Korean medical databases (Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS), Research Information Service System (RISS), DBPIA, Korean Traditional Knowledge Portal (KTKP) and KoreaMed) and three Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP and Wanfang). The evidence for the cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit of manual therapy for musculoskeletal diseases will be assessed as the primary outcome. Health-related quality of life and adverse effects will be assessed as secondary outcomes. We will critically appraise the included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Drummond checklist. Results will be summarised using Slavin's qualitative best-evidence synthesis approach.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the correlation between trunk muscles cross sectional area (MCSA) and fusion rate after posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using stand-alone cages. Methods: A total of 89 adult patients with degenerative lumbar disease who were performed PLIF using stand-alone cages at L4–5 were included in this study. The cross-sectional area of the psoas major (PS), erector spinae (ES), and multifidus (MF) muscles were quantitatively evaluated by preoperative lumbar magnetic resonance imaging at the L3–4, L4–5, and L5–S1 segments, and bone union was evaluated by dynamic lumbar X-rays. Results: Of the 89 patients, 68 had bone union and 21 did not. The MCSAs at all segments in both groups were significantly different (p<0.05) for the PS muscle, those at L3–4 and L4–5 segments between groups were significantly different (p=0.048, 0.021) for the ES and MF muscles. In the multivariate analysis, differences in the PS MCSA at the L4–5 and L5–S1 segments remained significant (p=0.048, 0.043 and odds ratio=1.098, 1.169). In comparison analysis between male and female patients, most MCSAs of male patients were larger than female’s. Fusion rates of male patients (80.7%) were higher than female’s (68.8%), too. Conclusion: For PLIF surgery, PS muscle function appears to be an important factor for bone union and preventing back muscle injury is essential for better fusion rate. ? 2016 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",Cross-sectional area; Fusion rates; Posterior lumbar interbody fusion; Trunk muscle,adult; aged; Article; degenerative disease; degenerative lumbar disease; female; human; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; skeletal muscle; spine fusion,2-s2.0-84969528937

We performed SPOP mutation analysis and investigated its protein expression of PCa in Korean population. We selected 108 cases of prostatectomy specimen for PCa at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea from 1995 to 2006. All cases were sequenced by Sanger sequencing to analyze SPOP somatic mutations in paraffin-embedded tissue. In addition, we also applied SPOP immunohistochemistry (IHC) on the tissue microarray blocks for 108 cases. All cases were successfully sequenced. Three missense mutations, p.Phe102Cys in one case and double mutation with p.Phe125Val and p.Glu145 Lys in another case, were identified (1.85%). p.Phe102Cys and p.Phe125Val have been previously reported in the literature; however, p.Glu145 Lys was newly discovered in this study. All but one case were successfully stained with IHC. Thirty two (32.7%) out of 107 cases showed SPOP expression loss and loss of SPOP expression was not correlated with mutation status. In conclusion, we identified three missense mutations including double mutation in 108 PCa in Korean population.

However, whether subtypes of DCIS-IDC have prognostic significance remains unknown. We assessed the prognostic value of immunohistochemical subtypes in DCIS-IDC compared with DCIS or IDC without predominant intraductal component. Methods: We retrospectively studied 37,049 early breast cancer patients enrolled in the Korean Breast Cancer Registry between January 1993 and February 2011. We categorized DCIS, DCIS-IDC and IDC by estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressions, such as luminal A, B, HER2 and Triple negative breast cancer(TNBC). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to estimate associations between subtypes and survival. Results: In total, 8346 patients (26.3%) had DCIS, 20,427 (64.4%) had IDC and 2938 (9.3%) had DCIS-IDC. Luminal A type was the most predominant type in all three groups (DCIS=66.5%, IDC=64.7%, DCIS-IDC=46.9%). HER2 subtype was more frequent in DCIS-IDC (27.0%) than in IDC (8.3%) and DCIS (13.3%) (p<0.001). TNBC subtype was more frequent in IDC (18.0%) than in DCIS (8.5%) and DCIS-IDC (12.7%) (p<0.001). Breast cancer subtypes showed significant differences in breast cancer specific survival in IDC. HER2/neu typed DCIS showed a poor prognostic effect in overall survival, but no differences were observed in DCIS-IDC before or after adjusted by adjuvant treatments. Conclusions: Different distribution of subtypes and indistinct prognostic effects in DCIS-IDC indicates that DCIS-IDC is a distinct clinical and biological entity from pure IDC or pure DCIS. MicroAbstract: Through a large-sized, registery-based study, we reported differences of IHC-breast cancer subtypes or outcomes in pure IDC, pure DCIS and mixed DCIS-IDC cases with a predominant DCIS component (more than 80% of tumor was DCIS). IHC-breast cancer subtypes of invasive ductal carcinoma with predominant intraductal component were not significant prognostic factor unlike either pure IDC or DCIS. Clinical Practice points: We subdivide breast cancer into pure IDC (64%), pure DCIS (26%) and mixed DCIS-IDC cases (9%) with a predominant DCIS component (more than 80% of tumor was DCIS). Within IDC, they observed differences in outcome that correlated with phenotype, among approximately 37,000 cases entered into the Korean cancer registry. They did not observe statistical differences in outcome with phenotypes for the DCIS-IDC group. This study supports that there is a biologic difference between DCIS-IDC cases compared to pure DCIS or pure IDC. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Breast neoplasm; Ductal carcinoma in situ; Molecular subtypes; Prognosis,epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; Article; body mass; breast carcinoma; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; clinical feature; disease classification; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; interview; invasive ductal carcinoma with predominant intraductal component; Korea; luminal A breast cancer; luminal B breast cancer; major clinical study; mastectomy; partial mastectomy; priority journal; protein expression; retrospective study; scoring system; triple negative breast cancer,2-s2.0-84962850017

The objective of this study, therefore, was to assess the ability of proton MRS to identify the apparent heterogeneous characteristics of metabolic spectra in the joint fluid regions in human knees using a high-field MRI system. Eighty-four patients with effusion lesions who were referred for routine knee MR imaging underwent proton MRS with point-resolved, single-voxel MR spectroscopy using a clinical 3.0 Tesla MRI system. Thirty-eight patients were confirmed to have the following: degenerative osteoarthritis, 21 patients (Group 1); traumatic diseases, 12 patients (Group 2); infectious diseases, 4 patients and an inflammatory disease, 1 patient (Group 3). Spectroscopy data were analyzed using the public jMRUI freeware software to obtain lipid metabolites. Nonparametric statistical comparisons were performed to investigate any differences in metabolites among the three disease groups. The major metabolites were vinylic CH=CH lipids around 5.1-5.5 ppm, CH2 lipids around 1.1-1.5 ppm, and CH3 lipids around 0.7-1.0 ppm. Each patient had either a CH=CH lipid peak, CH2 and CH3 lipid peaks, or all three peaks. There were no significant differences among the three groups for the CH3 (p = 0.9019), CH2 (p= 0.6406), and CH=CH lipids (p = 0.5467) and water (p = 0.2853); none of the metabolites could differentiate between any of the three types of diseases. The CH2 lipids in the 38 patients who had confirmed fluid characteristics were significantly correlated with CH3 lipids (rho = 0.835, p &lt; 0.0001). The ratio of CH3 to CH2 was highest in the degenerative disease. In both the degenerative and traumatic diseases, metabolite peaks of the vinylic CH=CH lipids around 5.1-5.5 ppm and of the sum of the CH2 and CH3 lipids around 0.7-1.5 ppm were observed, but in the infectious disease, only a metabolite peak of the sum of the CH2 and CH3 lipids was detected. Although none of the metabolites could statistically significantly differentiate between the three types of diseases, the different lipid metabolite peaks and their ratios in the three disease groups may give us a hint at the different mechanisms of joint fluids in the infectious, degenerative, and traumatic diseases. ?

Many client proteins of HSP90 are involved in cell growth, survival, and migration; processes that are generally accepted as participants in tumorigenesis. HSP90 is also up-regulated in certain tumors. Indeed, the inhibition of HSP90 is known to be effective in cancer treatment. Recently, studies showed that HSP90 regulates transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-induced transcription by increasing the stability of the TGF-β receptor. TGF-β signaling also has been implicated in cancer, suggesting the possibility that TGF-β1 and HSP90 function cooperatively during the cancer cell progression. Here in this paper, we investigated the role of HSP90 in TGF-β1-stimulated Mv1Lu cells. Treatment of Mv1Lu cells with the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17AAG), or transfection with truncated HSP90 (ΔHSP90) significantly reduced TGF-β1-induced cell migration. Pretreatment with 17AAG or transfection with ΔHSP90 also reduced the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. In addition, the HSP90 inhibition interfered the nuclear localization of Smads induced by constitutively active Smad2 (S2EE) or Smad3 (S3EE). We also found that the HSP90 inhibition decreased the protein level of importin-β1 which is known to regulate R-Smad nuclear translocation. These data clearly demonstrate a novel function of HSP90; HSP90 modulates TGF-β signaling by regulating Smads localization. Overall, our data could provide a detailed mechanism linking HSP90 and TGF-β signaling. The extension of our understanding of HSP90 would offer a better strategy for treating cancer. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",17AAG (17-ALLYLAMINO-DEMETHOXY-GELDANAMYCIN); HSP90 (HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 90); SMADS; SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION; TGF-β1 (TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR β1),"4 [4 (1,3 benzodioxol 5 yl) 5 (2 pyridinyl) 1h imidazol 2 yl]benzamide; geldanamycin; heat shock protein 90; importin beta 1; karyopherin beta; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; benzoquinone derivative; heat shock protein 90; macrocyclic lactam; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; tanespimycin; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta receptor; amino terminal sequence; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; carcinoma cell line; cell migration; cell stimulation; cellular distribution; controlled study; cytosol; genetic transfection; human; human cell; lung carcinoma; nuclear localization signal; priority journal; protein degradation; protein domain; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; ubiquitination; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; drug effects; genetics; metabolism; phosphorylation; Animals; Benzoquinones; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Lactams, Macrocyclic; Phosphorylation; Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta; Signal Transduction; Smad2 Protein; Smad3 Protein; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transforming Growth Factor beta1",2-s2.0-84957309266

Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate radiation dose during minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MiTLIF) compared with open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (OTLIF) and evaluate the risk of radiation-related disease. Summary of Background Data: MiTLIF was introduced to reduce soft tissue injury and shows favorable perioperative outcomes. However, the disadvantage of MiTLIF is that, compared with OTLIF, it involves high radiation exposure because MiTLIF usually depends on a fluoroscopic guide. The additional cancer risk due to medical radiation exposure during the MiTLIF procedure has not yet been assessed. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in June 2014 for studies directly comparing MiTLIF and OTLIF. Patient demographics, fluoroscopy time, intraoperative bleeding, and hospitalization period were extracted. The effective dose was converted from fluoroscopy time using formulas from prior studies. Results: Eight cohort studies with a total of 619 patients were identified. Mean fluoroscopy time was 39.42 seconds [95% confidence interval (CI), 38.01-40.83] during OTLIF and 94.21 seconds (95% CI, 91.51-96.91) during MiTLIF according to the meta-analysis. The pooled data revealed that patients who underwent MiTLIF were exposed to 2.4-fold more radiation than those who underwent OTLIF. Patients who underwent OTLIF and MiTLIF were exposed to 0.66 mSv (95% CI, 0.64-0.69) and 1.58 mSv (95% CI, 1.54-1.63) during the surgery, respectively. The lifetime risk of cancer was theoretically increased by 36.4×10 -6 and 87.0×10 -6 after OTLIF and MiTLIF, respectively. The risk of detrimental hereditary disorders associated with OTLIF and MiTLIF is 1.32×10 -6 and 3.16×10 -6, respectively. Conclusions: Patients who underwent MiTLIF were exposed to 2.4-fold more radiation than those who underwent OTLIF. Although the theoretical cancer risk associated with radiation exposure may be tolerable, stochastic effects should not be disregarded. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",fusion; lumbar; meta-analysis; radiation; transforaminal,bleeding; cancer risk; comparative study; demography; dosimetry; fluoroscopy; genetic disorder; hospitalization; human; intraoperative bleeding; ionizing radiation; meta analysis; minimally invasive surgery; minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion; open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion; priority journal; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation hazard; radiation injury; Review; spine fusion,2-s2.0-84946866446

(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00869908) was a 24-week observational study evaluating certain insulin analogs and not insulin analogs in general in 66,726 people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in routine clinical care in 28 non-Western countries. This study demonstrated that insulin analogs improved self-management and metabolic control in patients with T2D. We investigated the effectiveness and clinical characteristics of patients with T2D showing better response to basal insulin (BI) (detemir), using data from the A1chieve study performed in Korea. Methods: Subjects were classified into two groups according to the achievement of target glycated hemoglobin (A1c) level of &lt;7.5%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the variables independently associated with the achievement of target A1c level. Results: Baseline A1c, postprandial glucose (PPG), difference between PPG and fasting plasma glucose, and duration of diabetes were independently associated with better response to BI after adjusting for other risk factors. Compared to patients with BI use at evening, those who took BI in the morning demonstrated a larger reduction in A1c level. Conclusion: Once-daily BI therapy appears to be effective in Korean subjects with type 2 diabetes who had a shorter duration of diabetes and a smaller postprandial glucose excursion.

Sedentary behavior is associated with the onset and exacerbation of hypertension and the deterioration of health in hypertensive patients. Purpose: The aims of this study were to examine the level of sedentary behavior and to identify the factors predicting sedentary behavior in elderly Koreans with hypertension. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive design was used. Three hundred six hypertensive elderly subjects who visited three public health centers in Korea for regular medical checkups completed self-report questionnaires on sedentary behavior, physical activity, empowerment, perceived health, depression, self-efficacy for physical activity, and social support for physical activity. Results: The participants spent an average of 8.59 hours a day in sedentary behavior. The stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that sedentary behavior was significantly predicted by empowerment level, perceived health, time since diagnosis of hypertension, vigorous-intensity physical activity, and depression. These variables explained 42.6% of the variance in sedentary behavior. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: To reduce sedentary behavior in this population, future interventions should improve empowerment and perceived health, increase the intensity of physical activity, and alleviate depression while considering the duration of disease.

There has also been a continuous effort to establish the evidence-base of Korean medicine in various fields. The attitudes and perceptions of neuropsychiatry (NP) residents regarding EBM were investigated to ensure their ability to keep abreast of the progress in the field of medicine. We distributed a questionnaire to all of the residents in all of the Korean medical hospitals in Korea (n?=?388). The questionnaire consists of both quantitative and qualitative questions. The overall response rate is 68.30?% (n?=?265), while the response rate of the NP residents is 84.84?% (n?=?28). The NP residents generally expressed unwelcoming attitudes toward EBM, perceiving it as less necessary compared with the residents of other specialties; the NP residents also had a poor understanding of the basic knowledge that is required to read papers. In a qualitative study, three categories and four themes were identified regarding the advantages of the application of EBM in Korean medicine, while two categories and six themes were identified regarding the barriers that hamper evidence-based practice in Korean medicine. In terms of the acceptance of new evidence, the NP residents lacked both skill and knowledge; the key underpinning factor here is a perceived uselessness. The factors that have formed this tendency should be considered during the formulation of a desirable model of NP practice. ? 2015, Institute of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Barrier; Complementary and alternative medicine; Evidence-based medicine; Neuropsychiatry; Perception; Qualitative study; Questionnaire,adult; Article; clinical practice; evidence based medicine; female; human; Korean medicine; male; neuropsychiatry; perception; physician attitude; priority journal; professional competence; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; residency education; resident; specialization,2-s2.0-84948981662

Korean traditional dance, in particular, values the spirit pursued on the inside rather than the mere beauty on the outside, so it values the power of life expressed through the dance. The principle of dance choreography emphasizes tension and relaxation, reflects the universal principles of Yin and Yang, including grudge and deities, excitement and beauty, and liberally controls movements and rhythms through breathing to harmonize the flow of energy.

This study focuses on the record of pregnancy and childbirth in the royal court of Joseon dynasty (a Korean kingdom that lasted for approximately five centuries, from July 1392 to October 1897) to analyze what medical treatment was used in the period. The pregnancy and childbirth related to the royal family was systematically managed by the state with a specific kind of treatment manual and protocol. Compound use of natural herbal medicine was common among diverse treatment methods. It seems that the oral medication of herbal medicines served to minimize miscarriages and post-natal aftereffects, and for this purpose Angelica Gigantis Radix and Cnidii Rhizoma were frequently used. ? 2015, Institute of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Angelica gigantis radix; Antepartum medicinal; Cnidii rhizoma; Joseon dynasty medicine; Korean medicine; Postpartum medicinal,Angelica; Article; childbirth; Citrus; Cnidium; Corydalis; Cyperus; female; fetus; follow up; ginger; ginseng; Glycyrrhiza; herbal medicine; historical period; human; Korean medicine; nonhuman; Poria; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prescription; priority journal; puerperium; Rehmannia; spontaneous abortion,2-s2.0-84948957363

It is based on re-distribution of a fluorescence reporter protein upon protease cleavage and the fact that HIV-infected cells undergo apoptosis. The in-cell assay utilizes fluorescent reporter proteins consisting of an intracellular translocation signal sequence, a caspase-3-specific cleavage sequence, and a fluorescent tagging protein. The reporter proteins are designed to change their intracellular localization upon cleavage, either from the cytosol to a subcellular organelle (type I) or from a subcellular organelle to the cytosol (type II). Inhibition of protease activity can be monitored at the single cell level. Interestingly, the expression of HIV-1 protease induced endogenous caspase-3 activation; thus, the fluorescence reporter protein containing the caspase-3 cleavage sequence translocalized upon cleavage. This is the first time that HIV-1 protease expression, not whole virus infection of the cell, was observed to trigger the apoptotic pathway, including caspse-3 activation. A validation of this assay was performed with a known HIV-1 protease inhibitor, Ac-Leu-Val-phenylalanine. The clear cellular change in fluorescence pattern makes this system an ideal tool for various types of life science and drug discovery research, including high throughput and high content screening applications. ? 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea.",Caspase-3; HIV-1 protease; In-cell assay; Trans-localization,"caspase 3; fluorescence reporter protein; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase inhibitor; peptides and proteins; signal peptide; unclassified drug; caspase 3; fluorescent dye; green fluorescent protein; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase; p16 protease, Human immunodeficiency virus 1; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; cell organelle; cellular distribution; controlled study; cytosol; drug screening; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; fluorescence; in cell assay; nonhuman; protein expression; protein localization; animal; apoptosis; biosynthesis; chemistry; CHO cell line; Cricetulus; cytoplasm; hamster; metabolism; physiology; Animals; Apoptosis; Caspase 3; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Cytoplasm; Fluorescent Dyes; Green Fluorescent Proteins; HIV Protease",2-s2.0-84948716831

However, little research has been done on quantifying experiences of stigma and their psychosocial impacts in the perspectives of those who suffer from mental illnesses. It is essential to develop an instrument that quantifies the extent and impact of stigma. Therefore, we conducted a study to conduct a field test on TheInventory ofStigmatizingExperiences and measure the difference in perceived stigma and its psychosocial impacts on Korean and Canadian patients with depression and bipolar disorders. Methods: A cross-sectional comparison study was conducted. Data collection took place at a tertiary care hospital located in Seoul, South Korea. Data for the Canadian patient group were retrieved from a previous study conducted by Lazowski etal. Results: In total, 214 Canadian and 51 Korean individuals with depression and bipolar disorder participated. Canadian participants reported significantly higher experience with stigma (P<0.05) and its impact (P<0.05) compared with Korean participants. Both subscales of the inventory (the Stigma Experiences Scale and the Stigma Impact Scale) were highly reliable, with reliability coefficients of 0.81 and 0.93, respectively. Discussion: In conclusion, there seems to be higher level of stigma and impact in the Canadian population compared with the Korean population. These differences in stigma experience and their impact in different populations suggest the need to develop more tailored antistigma programs.

Objectives: This study was designed to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) bioequivalence between a new generic (test) formulation of ALC hydrochloride 590 mg and a branded (reference) formulation of ALC hydrochloride 590 mg in healthy Korean male volunteers. Methods: This was a randomizedsequence, single-dose, two-way crossover study. All subjects randomly received one formulation of the test or reference tablet and the other formulation with a 7-day washout period. Blood samples (7 mL) were collected immediately before dosing, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose. The plasma concentrations of ALC were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study. Results: The PK profiles of both formulations showed similar trends. The mean (± SD) baseline (predose) concentration of ALC was 1.23 ± 0.31 μg/ mL and 1.09 ± 0.30 μg/mL for the test and the reference formulations, respectively. The mean Cmax for the test and reference formulations were 1.74 ± 0.43 μg/mL and 1.68 ± 0.48 μg/mL, respectively.

MPP+ accumulation leads to neuronal cell death. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) regulates the accumulation of monoamine neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles and is involved in neuroprotection against neurotoxin-induced cell death. Recently, zingerone has been reported to reduce oxidative stress and inhibit inflammation. Therefore, we examined the effect of zingerone on neuronal cell death in a PD model. In an MPP+ and MPTP-mediated PD model, neuronal cell survival was increased by zingerone without modifying neuroinflammation or reactive oxygen species generation. Zingerone also induced ERK activation and VMAT2 expression, leading to the attenuation of MPP+-induced neuronal cell death. Our current results suggest that zingerone has a neuroprotective effect in a PD model.

On immunohistochemistry study, kappa and lambda chain were present. In addition, kappa chain was significantly elevated in urine and serum on electrophoresis. Although the patient was finally diagnosed as having primary gastric amyloidosis with restrictive cardiomyopathy, her general condition rapidly deteriorated and died at 12th hospital day. When obscure gastric lesion is encountered, performing gastric biopsy is strongly recommended since it be primary gastric amyloidosis.

These aromatic amino acids-derived compounds play important roles as ingredients of diverse phenolics including pigments and cell walls, and hormones like auxin and salicylic acid in plants. Moreover, they also serve as the natural products of alkaloids and glucosinolates, which have a high potential to promote human health and nutrition. The biosynthetic pathways of aromatic amino acids share a chorismate, the common intermediate, which is originated from shikimate pathway. Then, tryptophan is synthesized via anthranilate and the other phenylalanine and tyrosine are synthesized via prephenate, as intermediates. This review reports recent studies about all the enzymatic steps involved in aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathways and their gene regulation on transcriptional/posttranscriptional levels. Furthermore, results of metabolic engineering are introduced as efforts to improve the production of the aromatic amino acids-derived secondary metabolites in plants. ?

MLL induced apoptosis in MCF-7-SC, as evidenced by increased apoptotic body formation, sub-G1 cell population, annexin V-positive cells, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, as well as proteolytic activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein. Concomitantly, MLL induced the formation of acidic vesicular organelles, increased LC3-II accumulation, and reduced the activation of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K, suggesting that MLL initiates an autophagic progression in MCF-7-SC via the Akt/mTOR pathway. Epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical step in the acquisition of the metastatic state, is an attractive target for therapeutic interventions directed against tumor metastasis. At low concentrations, MLL induced anti-metastatic effects on MCF-7-SC by inhibiting the EMT process. Exposure to MLL also led to an increase in the epithelial marker E-cadherin, but decreased protein levels of the mesenchymal markers Snail and Slug. Collectively, this study provides evidence that lemon leaves possess cytotoxicity and antimetastatic properties. Therefore, MLL may prove to be beneficial as a medicinal plant for alternative novel anticancer drugs and nutraceutical products. ?

Nevertheless, traditional evaluation procedures suffer from practical limitations, which can lead to potential misdiagnoses. This work presents mDurance, a novel mobile health system aimed at supporting specialists in the functional assessment of trunk endurance by using wearable and mobile devices. The system makes use of a wearable inertial sensor to track the patient trunk posture, while portable electromyography sensors are employed to seamlessly measure the electrical activity produced by the trunk muscles. The information registered by the sensors is processed and managed by a mobile application that facilitates the expert normal routine, while reducing the impact of human errors and expediting the analysis of the test results. The reliability and usability of mDurance is proved through a case study, thus demonstrating its potential interest for regular physical therapy routines. Copyright 2015 ?

Methods: Urinary adiponectin levels were examined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 229 participants. who used olmesartan as a hypertensive agent. Their albuminuria levels were measured for 16 weeks after randomization and initiation of conventional or intensive diet education. Linear or logistic regression models were applied, as appropriate, to explore the relationship with albuminuria itself or its response after the intervention. Results: Urinary adiponectin levels were positively related to baseline albuminuria level (r = 0.529). After adjusting for several covariates, the adiponectin level was associated with the albuminuria level (β = 0.446). Among the 159 subjects with baseline macroalbuminuria, the risk of consistent macroalbuminuria (> 300 mg/day) at 16 weeks was higher in the 3rd tertile of adiponectin than in the 1st tertile (odds ratio = 6.9), despite diet education. In contrast, among all subjects, the frequency of the normoalbuminuria achievement (< 30 mg/day) at 16 weeks was higher in the 1st tertile than in the 3rd tertile (odds ratio = 13.0). Conclusions: Urinary adiponectin may be a useful biomarker for albuminuria or its response after treatment in non-diabetic hypertensive patients. ? 2015 Han et al.",Adiponectin; Albuminuria; Biomarker; Kidney; Urine,"adiponectin; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; olmesartan; adiponectin; ADIPOQ protein, human; antihypertensive agent; creatinine; imidazole derivative; olmesartan; tetrazole derivative; adult; albuminuria; Article; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; hypertension; macroalbuminuria; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nutrition education; prospective study; protein urine level; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; sodium restriction; treatment response; albuminuria; diet therapy; hypertension; odds ratio; patient education; procedures; statistical model; urine; Adiponectin; Adult; Albuminuria; Antihypertensive Agents; Creatinine; Diet Therapy; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Imidazoles; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Patient Education as Topic; Tetrazoles",2-s2.0-84938565809

The present study was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of a Lao Juan Questionnaire (LJQ). Methods: A total of 151 outpatients and 73 normal subjects were asked to complete the LJQ. Seventy-three normal subjects were additionally asked to complete the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS). Twelve clinicians determined whether the 151 outpatients exhibited LJ or not. The internal consistency and construct validity for the LJQ were estimated using data from the outpatient subjects. The CFS data were used to examine the concurrent validity of the LJQ. Total LJQ scores and the clinicians?diagnoses of the outpatients were used to perform receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses and to define an optimum cut-off score for the LJQ. Results: The 19-item LJQ had satisfactory internal consistency (α=0.828) and concurrent validity, with significant correlations between the LJQ and the CFS subscales. In the test of construct validity using principal component analysis, a total of six factors were extracted, and the overall variance explained by all factors was 59.5%. In ROC curve analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were 76.0%, 59.2%, and 0.709, respectively. The optimum cut-off score was defined as six points.

Results: With the administration of UC, BOLD responses to the right hand motor task showed a decrease in both hemispheres including the right cerebellar culmen, right and left medial frontal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, right and left sublobar insula, right and left posterior cingulate, left precuneus, and right precentral gyrus. Decreased BOLD responses to the left hand motor task were shown in the right lingual gyrus, right cerebellar culmen, left superior temporal gyrus, right and left middle frontal gyrus, and right precentral gyrus after UC administration. Increased BOLD responses to the left hand motor task were shown in the left and right posterior cingulate, while there was no increased response to the right hand motor task after UC administration. Conclusions: UC administration significantly decreased fMRI BOLD signal responses to hand grasping in most of the brain areas including the primary motor cortex, but it is not clear whether these decreased responses were caused by a decrease in neuronal activities or by an increase in cerebral blood flow due to the cerebral vasodilatory effects of UC. Further studies using positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography are needed to fully elucidate these findings. ? 2015, Chinese Association of the Integration of Traditional and Western Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",cerebral blood flow; Niuhuang Qingxin Pill; pharmacological fMRI; Uhwang Chungsim Won,"Chinese drug; herbaceous agent; uhwang chungsim won; unclassified drug; herbaceous agent; niuhuang qingxin; oxygen; adult; Article; BOLD signal; chemical composition; drug activity; drug effect; functional magnetic resonance imaging; grip strength; human; human experiment; image analysis; lingual gyrus; male; middle frontal gyrus; motor performance; normal human; parahippocampal gyrus; positron emission tomography; posterior cingulate; precuneus; primary motor cortex; priority journal; right cerebellar culmen; single photon emission computer tomography; sublobar insula; task performance; blood; brain mapping; drug effects; hand; hand strength; motor activity; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; signal processing; task performance; Adult; Brain Mapping; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Hand; Hand Strength; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Motor Activity; Oxygen; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Task Performance and Analysis",2-s2.0-84937206604

Paecilomyces japonica (PJ) is a herbal medicine that is commonly used to treat opiate and other addictions in Eastern Asia. However, its influence on nicotine addiction has not been examined. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of PJ on repeated nicotine-induced behavioral sensitization of locomotor activity and c-Fos and TH expression in the rat brain using immunohistochemistry. Methods: Rats were pretreated with PJ (10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) 30 min before repeated injections of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, subcutaneously, twice daily for 7 days). Locomotor activity was measured in rats during 7-day nicotine treatments. On the seventh day, c-Fos and TH expression were assessed. Results: Pretreatment with PJ decreased the development of nicotine-induced sensitization, c-Fos expression in the nucleus accumbens and striatum, and TH expression in the ventral tegmental area. PJ decreased nicotine-induced locomotor activity by modulating brain dopaminergic systems. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that PJ may be a useful agent for preventing and treating nicotine addiction. ? 2015 Ye et al.",c-Fos; Development sensitization; Dopamine; Locomotor activity; Nicotine; Paecilomyces japonica (PJ); Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH),"drugs used in the treatment of addiction; nicotine; Paecilomyces japonica extract; plant extract; protein c fos; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; unclassified drug; biological product; nicotine; protein c fos; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; behavior; controlled study; corpus striatum; dopaminergic nerve cell; dopaminergic system; drug mechanism; locomotion; male; neuromodulation; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; Paecilomyces; Paecilomyces japonica; protein expression; rat; sensitization; tobacco dependence; ventral tegmentum; animal; animal behavior; chemistry; drug effects; metabolism; motor activity; tobacco dependence; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Biological Products; Motor Activity; Nicotine; Paecilomyces; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos; Rats; Tobacco Use Disorder; Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase",2-s2.0-84938907412

VLPs were purified from the culture medium of the TN-5B1-4/M1-M2-NA-HA cells by pelleting on a sucrose cushion, followed by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose density gradient. The four structural proteins were released together from the TN-5B1-4/M1-M2-NA-HA cells, and were co-purified from the same fractions of the sucrose density gradient, indicating that recombinant M1, M2, NA, and HA self-assembled into VLPs in the TN-5B1-4/M1-M2-NA-HA cells. Recombinant baculoviruses (rBac/NA and rBac/HA) expressing recombinant NA and HA were generated and used to co-infect stably transfected TN-5B1-4 (TN-5B1-4/M1-M2) cells expressing recombinant M1 and M2, resulting in the production of high-molecular-weight VLPs and the release of self-assembled VLPs with diameters of 80 ? 120 nm. The production of VLPs was greatly enhanced in the TN-5B1-4/M1-M2 cells co-infected with rBac/NA and rBac/HA, compared with the TN-5B1-4/M1-M2-NA-HA cells.

Two hundred forty-five non-diabetic hypertensive participants with established albuminuria and relatively preserved renal function were treated with an ARB (40 mg/day olmesartan) for eight weeks. Subsequent changes in various clinical parameters, including Hb, EPO, and albuminuria, were analyzed following treatment. After the 8-week treatment with an ARB, Hb and EPO levels significantly decreased. Patients with a greater decrease in Hb exhibited a greater reduction in 24-hour urinary albumin excretion compared with patients with less of a decrease or no decrease in Hb, whereas no associations with a decline in renal function and EPO levels were noted. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated a correlation between the reduction of urine albumin excretion and the decrease in Hb levels (after natural logarithm transformation, adjusted odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.21-2.56, P = 0.003). Linear regression analysis also supported this positive correlation (Pearson correlation analysis; R = 0.24, P < 0.001). Decreased Hb concentrations following ARB treatment were positively correlated with reduced albuminuria in non-diabetic hypertensive patients, regardless of decreased blood pressure and EPO levels or renal function decline.

Methods: One thousand six hundred three non-diabetic Korean men without microalbuminuria in 2005 had been followed up for the development of microalbuminuria until 2010. Microalbuminuria was evaluated by urine-albumin creatinine ration, and insulin resistance was evaluated by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk for microalbuminuria according to the tertile of HOMA-IR. Results: During 5465.8 person-y of average follow-up, microalbuminuria developed in 76 (4.7%) participants. Incidence of microalbuminuria increased in proportion to the level of HOMA-IR (tertile 1: 3.0%, tertile 2: 4.1%, tertile 3: 7.1%, P<. 0.001). When the 1st tertile of HOMA-IR was set as reference, hazard ratios and 95% confidence interval were 1.15 (0.56-2.35) and 2.07 (1.05-4.09) for those in the 2nd and 3rd tertiles of HOMA-IR, even after adjusting multiple covariates, respectively (.

Periodontitis is associated with high levels of various pro-inflammatory mediators, which result in extensive destruction of connective and bone tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate gene expression profiling related periodontitis in gingival tissues of the ligature induced periodontitis rat model. The periodontitis rat model was induced using ligation of the left and right maxillary second molars during 2 weeks. Micro-computed tomography (CT) was performed to identify bone loss of the teeth. To determine the gene expression profile related to periodontitis, up and down regulated gene expression was analyzed using a cDNA microarray (Affymetrix). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed that 40 genes were expressed differentially in gingival tissues of the ligature-induced periodontitis rat model compared to those of normal rats (25 up-regulated genes and 15 down-regulated genes). The DAVID system was carried out to identify functional category and signal pathway. It was found that the regulation of these genes be associated with progress of periodontitis in gingival tissues.

To provoke an epileptic seizure, an exercise method is performed in some cases during long-term video-EEG recording in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). The purpose of this study was two-fold: to assess the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with the use of an exercise bicycle and to find a way to safely use it in the EMU. Methods: A retrospective survey was performed on all epileptic seizure videos recorded in the EMU from January 2012 to December 2013. Three hundred and fifty patients were included in this study. Results: Eleven patients experienced an epileptic seizure while riding the exercise bicycle in the EMU. One patient's foot got stuck between the cycling pedal and its strap, and one patient fell off the exercise bicycle during the epileptic seizure. However, there were no serious adverse events over two years. Conclusion: Epileptic seizures were not frequent while riding the exercise bicycle, and serious injuries did not occur.

Each subject was asked to complete the phlegm pattern questionnaire (PPQ), yin deficiency questionnaire (YDQ) and cold-heat questionnaire (CHQ). For the acoustic analysis, each subject was asked to produce a sustained vowel sound (/a/) for 3 s to be used to calculate acoustic parameters. Then, habitual fundamental frequency (F<inf>0</inf>), jitter, shimmer, F<inf>0</inf>tremor, mean F<inf>0</inf>, standard deviation of F<inf>0</inf>, maximum F<inf>0</inf>, minimum F<inf>0</inf>, normalized noise energy, harmonic-to-noise ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, amplitude tremor, and power ratio were calculated using the Dr. Speech software. Finally, four hierarchical regression models with pattern questionnaire scores as dependent variables were formed to examine which factors among acoustic parameters, sex, and age were predictive of those pattern scores.Conclusion: Our study results suggest that vocal characteristics estimated by acoustic parameters are partially predictive of phlegm, yin deficiency, heat, and cold patterns. In terms of phlegm and yin deficiency patterns, there were direct or moderating effects of sex and age.Results: PPQ, YDQ, heat, and cold pattern scores all formed significant regression model equations and the adjusted R2 values were 0.281, 0.164, 0.156, and 0.170, respectively. There were aging effects in the PPQ and YDQ models (standardized β=0.199, 0.271, respectively). Vocal tremor-related F<inf>0</inf> tremor and vocal ringing-related power ratio parameters were associated with PPQ and YDQ scores. Gender was directly predictive of PPQ and indirectly moderated the relationship between power ratio and YDQ score. Vocal pitchrelated habitual F<inf>0</inf> and mean F<inf>0</inf> were associated with heat and cold scores. These results indicate that the vocal qualities of phlegm- and yin deficiency-susceptible subjects tend to be ringing and less tremorous, and those of heat- and cold-susceptible subjects tend to be high-pitched.Objective: To examine whether vocal characteristics estimated by acoustic parameters were associated with phlegm, yin deficiency, or cold-heat patterns. ? 2015, Chinese Association of the Integration of Traditional and Western Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",acoustic parameters; Chinese medicine syndrome; oriental medicine,acoustic analysis; acoustics; adult; amplitude tremor; Article; cold pattern questionnaire score; computer program; controlled study; energy; female; habitual fundamental frequency; harmonic to noise ratio; heat pattern questionnaire score; human; jitter; male; maximum fundamental frequency; mean fundamental frequency; minimum fundamental frequency; noise; normal human; normalized noise energy; phlegm pattern questionnaire score; power ratio; priority journal; questionnaire; shimmer; signal noise ratio; standard deviation of fundamental frequency; vocalization; yin deficiency pattern questionnaire score; young adult; age; regression analysis; voice; yin deficiency; Acoustics; Age Factors; Female; Humans; Male; Regression Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Voice Quality; Yin Deficiency; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84928792368

Introduction of immunosuppressive therapies, however, involves the risk of host susceptibility to opportunistic infections in this patient population. Therefore, adequate immunization for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases is currently recommended for all patients with IBD and is emerging as an important target for quality improvements in IBD care. However, ongoing issues regarding underuse of immunization, safety and efficacy of vaccines in patients with IBD remain. For quality improvements in IBD care, all physicians should follow the recent immunization guidelines proposed by professional IBD societies. Additionally, there are ongoing needs for intensive educational programs regarding a role of immunization in long-term care of IBD and up-to-date immunization guidelines. Immunization status should be checked at the time of diagnosis of IBD and timely vaccination before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies can be a practical solution for maximizing the efficacy of vaccination at this point. Inactivated vaccines can be used safely irrespective of immunization status of patients, while attenuated vaccines are contraindicated in patients on immunosuppressive therapies.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of melittin on the AKT/mTOR/S6K1/4E-BP1 activation, associated gene products, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis in several tumor cells. We found that melittin inhibited both constitutive phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR and exerted a significant time-dependent anti-proliferative effect on MM1.S cells as compared to other types of tumor cells. Indeed, melittin clearly suppressed the constitutive activation of AKT/mTOR/S6K1/4E-BP1 signaling cascades, which correlated with the induction of apoptosis. Melittin can cause broad-spectrum inhibition of AKT/mTOR/S6K1/4E-BP1 axes in multiple myeloma cells when compared with various pharmacological AKT/mTOR inhibitors. Aberrant AKT activation by pcDNA3-myr-HA-AKT1 plasmid could not prevent the observed suppressive effect of melittin on constitutive mTOR, S6K1, and 4E-BP1 activation and overexpression of Bcl-2 also attenuated melittin-mediated apoptosis in the cells. Our results clearly indicate that melittin can interfere with multiple signaling cascades involved in carcinogenesis and thereby used as a potential drug candidate for both the prevention and treatment of cancer. ? 2014, Institute of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",AKT/mTOR/S6K1/4E-BP1; Apoptosis; Melittin; MM1.S; Multiple myeloma,antineoplastic agent; apamin; bee venom; initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; mammalian target of rapamycin; melittin; protein bcl 2; protein kinase B; antineoplastic activity; Apis mellifera; apoptosis; Article; carcinogenesis; cell cycle G1 phase; cell invasion; cell proliferation; cell survival; cellular distribution; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; drug effect; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme repression; flow cytometry; gene product; genetic transfection; human; human cell; investigative procedures; mitochondrial membrane potential; multiple myeloma; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; signal transduction; Western blotting,2-s2.0-84925960283

Tomotherapy HDA provides a dynamic jaw (DJ) delivery mode that creates a sharper penumbra at the craniocaudal ends of a target in addition to a fixed jaw (FJ) delivery mode. The purpose of this study was to evaluate its dosimetric effect on the pediatric cancer cases. We included 6 pediatric cases in this study. The dose profiles and plan statistics-target dose conformity, uniformity, organ-at-risk (OAR) mean dose, beam-on time, and integral dose-were compared for each case. Consequently, the target dose coverage and uniformity were similar for different jaw settings. The OAR dose sparing depended on its relative location to the target and disease sites. For example, in the head and neck cancer cases, the brain stem dose using DJ 2.5 was reduced by more than two-fold (2.4. Gy vs. 6.3. Gy) than that obtained with FJ 2.5. The integral dose with DJ 2.5 decreased by more than 9% compared with that with FJ 2.5.

Laser is used to deposit optical energy (i.e., optical fluence) into a target. As a result, the target temperature changes and causes thermal expansion to the target that leads to generating a PA signal. One of the important parameters that control the PA is the elasticity of the target. In general, most the PA studies and image reconstruction algorithms for PAI assumes isotropic elasticity within the target. However, it is known that certain soft tissues, like muscles and glands, are anisotropic with respect to elastic deformation. Also, observations indicate that breast tumors tend to be anisotropic. This could affect the reconstruction of PA images. In this study, we have investigated the influence of the anisotropic elasticity on PA back-propagation imaging using finite element method. The Fluence distribution was estimated by solving light propagation within a tissue model using Monte Carlo method.

We reported a case of bilateral perirenal hemorrhage in the patients with PAN who have continued to take exogenous sex hormone. ? 2015 Hyung-Il Choi et al.",,C reactive protein; creatinine; drospirenone; dydrogesterone; estrogen; ethinylestradiol; hemoglobin; paracetamol; acute abdomen; adult; Article; bilateral spontaneous perirenal hemorrhage; case report; computer assisted tomography; conservative treatment; creatinine blood level; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; fertilization in vitro; flank pain; hemoglobin blood level; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; kidney angiography; kidney hemorrhage; leukocyte count; lower abdominal pain; myalgia; neutrophil count; oral contraception; ovary polycystic disease; physical examination; polyarteritis nodosa; priority journal; superior mesenteric artery; urinalysis,2-s2.0-85032640448

This study used data from the 2008 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging which included a total of 8157 adults. We divided body mass index into 2 groups: normal weight and overweight. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between social activities and overweight. For males, frequency of meetings with neighbors (1-3 times a week) was associated with being less overweight. Middle-aged adults who met with neighbors 1 to 3 times a week were less likely being overweight than those with once a year meeting frequency. On the contrary, social activity participation is related with high risk of overweight especially in the female and older adults. Our results suggest that social activity participation and social support needs to be taken into consideration when dealing with being overweight. ? 2015 Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health.",Korea; middle-aged and older adults; overweight; social activities; socioeconomic factor,aged; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; middle aged; Overweight; sex ratio; social participation; socioeconomics; South Korea; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Overweight; Republic of Korea; Sex Distribution; Social Participation; Socioeconomic Factors,2-s2.0-84962463304

CHS is classifi ed as primary or secondary if the tumor arises de novo or develops in a preexisting benign cartilage neoplasm (enchondroma or osteochondroma), respectively. By the same token, CHS is classifi ed according to its anatomic location within a bone as central when it is located in the medullary cavity of a long bone (80-85 % of cases) or peripheral (about 10-15 of cases) or juxtacortical or periosteal when the tumor is located on the surface of a bone (1 of cases). Microscopically, CHS is a group of different clinicopathological entities in which the common denominator is the presence of hyaline cartilage. The most common is the primary or conventional CHS that represents 85 % of all the CHSs and is a tumor composed predominantly of hyaline cartilage in various stages of differentiation. Its variants include a specifi c cell component such as a high-grade sarcoma component in dedifferentiated CHS, clear cells in clear-cell CHS, and a small-cell component in mesenchymal CHS. Each one of these subtypes has distinct clinical, radiological, histological, and genetic features. Secondary chondrosarcoma may arise in a sporadic osteochondroma, in a genetic syndrome characterized by multiple osteochondromas (hereditary multiple exostosis), or in skeletal enchondromatosis (Ollier or Maffucci diseases). The prognosis of CHS depends on the histological grade, stage, and location of the tumor. According to the National Cancer Data Base Report, the relative 5-year survival rate of CHS is approximately 75 %, and patients who survive the fi rst 10 years after diagnosis of conventional CHS will die of other causes rather than from CHS-related events. High-grade (grade 3) conventional CHS and dedifferentiated and mesenchymal CHSs account for those cases with less favorable prognosis. ? 2015 Springer-Verlag London.

As such, this study evaluates the feasibility of micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) in radiotherapy by investigating the effect of radiation on a miniature portable respiratory monitoring system based on the MEMS system, which is currently under development. Using a patient respiration simulation phantom, the time-acceleration graph measured by a normal sensor according to the phantom's respiratory movement before irradiation and the change in this graph with accumulated dose were compared using the baseline slope and the change in amplitude and period of the sine wave. The results showed that with a 400Gy accumulated dose in the sensor, a baseline shift occurred and both the amplitude and period changed. As a result, if the MEMS is applied in respiratory-gated radiotherapy, the sensor should be replaced after use with roughly 6-10 patients so as to ensure continued therapy accuracy, based on the characteristics of the sensor itself. In the future, a more diverse range of sensors should be similarly evaluated. ? 2015 SPIE.",Hardness; Micro-electro-mechanical system; Portable monitoring system; Radiation; Respiratory gated radiotherapy; Sensor,Hardness; Heat radiation; Mechanics; Medical nanotechnology; Monitoring; Patient monitoring; Patient treatment; Radiotherapy; Respirators; Respiratory mechanics; Sensors; Baseline shifts; Gated radiotherapy; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Micro electro mechanical system; Portable monitoring; Respiratory Monitoring; Respiratory movement; Respiratory pattern; MEMS,2-s2.0-84951862395

The expansion of morbidity perspective argues that elongated life expectancy would comprise of, in large part, disabled life expectancy. The compression of morbidity theory suggests that increases in active life expectancy correspond to increases in total life expectancy. The dynamic equilibrium theory posits that, though overall levels of morbidity would rise, the prevalence of severe disability would decrease. The study is based on mortality data from Life Tables for Korea and the morbidity data from five nationally representative cross-sectional surveys conducted in 1994, 1998, 2004, 2008, and 2011. Sullivan’s method is used to compute the active, mildly disabled, and severely disabled life expectancies. Results reveal that the total life expectancy of elderly Koreans has markedly increased, and this has been accompanied by an impressive extension of active life expectancy. In addition, results show negligible declines in the mildly disabled life expectancy but rapid drops in the severely disabled life expectancy. Collectively, these observations strongly support the compression hypothesis, and provide partial support for a dynamic equilibrium. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.",compression; dynamic equilibrium; elderly Koreans; expansion; morbidity and mortality,elderly population; historical perspective; life expectancy; life table; morbidity; mortality; South Korea,2-s2.0-84947910861

This study was conducted to verify the necessity of corresponding prescription to the diagnosed pattern in acute cerebral infarction patients. Methods. We studied cerebral infarction patients hospitalized within 30 days after the ictus. Forty-four clinical indicators, Motricity Index (MI) score, Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) score, and herbal prescriptions were checked twice, two weeks apart. The probability of each pattern was calculated based on the clinical indicators. Changes in MI score, SSS score, and the probability of fire-heat pattern were compared between the pattern-prescription correspondence group and the noncorrespondence group. Results. Increments of MI score and SSS score in the correspondence group were significantly greater than those of the noncorrespondence group (p=0.003, p=0.001) while the baseline score of the two groups showed no significant difference. Probability of fire-heat pattern decreased significantly in the correspondence group (p=0.013) while the noncorrespondence group showed no significant difference after the treatment. Conclusion. Acute cerebral infarction patients who are diagnosed as fire-heat pattern showed better improvement in dysfunctions caused by the disease when they took the pattern corresponding prescriptions.

The South Korean government has implemented policies to provide city services using information communication technologies, and ubiquitous healthcare (u-healthcare) wellness is one of these. This article presents the effects of using a u-healthcare center model that proves self-healthcare monitoring can work for the general population. Materials and Methods: The u-healthcare center has provided service to the public since April 2013. It is equipped with medical devices that evaluate physiological parameters such as weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR), and body fat (BF). This article focuses on the analysis of BMI, BP, PR, and BF parameters. Results: Health test results from 12,766 voluntary patients of the u-healthcare center were analyzed during a 1-year period. The four health parameters from each of the four seasons were analyzed and compared, showing statistically significant seasonal differences. A Duncan's post hoc analysis showed that BMI did not differ between spring and summer, whereas BP differed throughout all seasons. Participation of females was higher compared with males, and men's average BMI was statistically higher than that of the women. Some additional significant findings for all participants were as follows: 48.8% scored normal in BMI, 31.7% scored normal-controlled in BP, 90.7% scored normal in PR, and 24.8% scored normal in BF. A survey showed that 96.4% found the u-healthcare center to be generally helpful, and 95.7% responded that they would recommend it. Conclusions: Implementation of u-healthcare projects provides a new public service toward evaluating health parameters, providing historical health information access, promoting self-monitoring, and motivating users to be more aware of their own health status. ?

Accompanied by easy placement and removal, the spike screw provides good stability for the orthodontic anchorage. Materials and Methods: The spike screw consists of 6 spikes attached to a washer with laser welded stainless-steel hook that is placed by self-drilling fixation miniscrew. The spike screws were applied to correct malocclusions in patients as follows: Traction of impacted canines and protraction of posterior teeth as a direct anchorage and correction of midline discrepancy as an indirect anchorage. For orthodontic traction of impacted canines, spike screws were placed in the mandibular labial mucosal area to create extrusive forces. Afterward, it was utilized for the protraction of posterior teeth. In the second case of the indirect anchorage, spike screw was applied on the midpalatal area to correct midline discrepancy that occurred during orthodontic treatment. The extended hook of a washer was prebended along the curvature of the palate and then secured with a mini screw. The extended hook was bonded to maxillary left first molar. Results: In the first case, the spike screw provided adequate anchorage for the vertical traction of horizontally impacted canine. Since the spike screws were placed in the mandibular anterior lesion, the vertical traction force was applied simply with orthodontic elastics. Also, enough distance was achieved for up-down elastics to work by placing the spike screw in the opposite arch. The force of vertical traction was adjusted with selection of size and force of up-down elastics. Later, it was used to provide anchorage for protraction of mandibular molars without changing orientation of the spike screws. In the second case, the spike screw placed in the midpalatal area was attached to the left first molar and worked as an indirect anchorage. The midline discrepancy was resolved by consolidating the spaces to the left with securing the left first molar location. Conclusion: The novel design of the spike screw permits clinicians to have minimum invasive and easy placement and removal of the appliance while maintaining a good control over tooth movement with improved stability in various clinical cases.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the similarities and uniqueness associated with these two perspectives from both the US and Korean standpoints. Similar to the USA, UI in Korea has been constructed from a biological perspective. The cultural construction of UI in both the USA and Korea is grounded in sexism. Subtle differences exist in each country regarding ageism and shame. In this cultural construction of UI on sexism, ageism and shame, managing the signs and symptoms of UI necessitates an approach different from that used in countries such as the USA. Findings from this study will contribute to understanding the health in Korean immigrant women who have poor health care access and utilization owing to cultural constraints. Health policy for minorities and policy makers should consider the cultural variances and meaning of UI. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. and BAUN.",Culture; Elderly; Immigrants; Sexism; Shame; Urinary incontinence,,2-s2.0-84944510879

Cellular elasticity could potentially serve as a biomarker to quantitatively distinguish undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. The goal of this work is to characterize the retinoic acid (RA) induced alternations of elastic properties of SH-SY5Y cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The elasticity was measured at multiple points of a single cell. Results have shown that the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cell led to a larger elastic modulus, which is three times more than that of undifferentiated cells. A higher indentation rate applied during AFM measurements led to a larger elastic modulus of the cell. This work provides new insights into the differentiation process identified by the elasticity marker, which could be extended to investigate the function, health and ageing of cells. ? 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",differentiation; Elasticity; human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells; retinoic acid,Atomic force microscopy; Cell culture; Cells; Differentiation (calculus); Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Differentiation process; Elastic properties; Human neuroblastoma; Parkinson's disease; Retinoic acids; SH SY5Y Cells; Therapeutic strategy; Undifferentiated cells; Cytology,2-s2.0-84944112009

To date, there is no definite cure for ICF, and alternative therapies are being investigated. Oriental medicine music therapy (OMMT), a novel music therapy that occurs through an active behavioral process, has been applied to various chronic diseases, including ICF. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of OMMT on ICF. Design: Randomized controlled trial of OMMT compared with the waitlist control (6 sessions each) during a 2-week period. Participants: Thirty participants who had had ICF for at least 6 months before the experiments were recruited. Outcome measures: We evaluated fatigue severity scale (FSS), visual analog scale (VAS) for overall fatigue, revised Chalder fatigue scale (RCFS), World Health Organization quality of life scale abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF), Buzhongyiqi-Tang questionnaire (BZTQ), and salivary cortisol level at baseline (week 0) and at the end of the study (week 2) in the two groups. Results: FSS, VAS, and RCFS scores were significantly lower, and WHOQOL-BREF scores were significantly higher in the OMMT group than in the waitlist group (p=0.006, p=0.004, p=0.002, and p=0.002, respectively). In contrast, salivary cortisol level and BZTQ scores were not significantly different between the OMMT group and the waitlist group. Conclusions: The present study suggests that OMMT may be an alternative treatment for ICF. Based on this result, further studies including possible mechanisms are needed. ?

Methods: Seven patients with a mandibular horizontal ridge that was inadequate for proper implant placement were included in this study. Simultaneous implant placement and autogenous block bone grafting was planned; we designed the ""L-shaped notch"" preparation of the recipient site for the additional fixation with only 1 screw. This new technique also required minimal size of autogenous block bone. Results: In total, 11 implants and final restorations were delivered in 7 patients. The dehiscence defects were covered successfully (79.70 6 5.58%; 2.26 6 0.68 mm) at the uncover surgery. The marginal bone loss was 0.50 6 0.26 mm on the mesial side and 0.58 6 0.23 mm on the distal side. The outcomes were satisfactory clinically and radiographically during the 1-year follow-up. Conclusion: Although additional studies, with more than 7 patients, are needed to evaluate the L-shaped notch preparation, this was effective to accomplish horizontal ridge augmentation simultaneously with the placement of dental implants using the minimal size of autogenous block bone. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Food and water intake, fasting blood glucose concentrations, blood glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and plasma insulin levels were significantly lower in the db/db-AS200 group than in the vehicle-treated db/db group; whereas glucose tolerance was significantly improved in the db/db-AS200 group. Moreover, AS dose dependently increased both insulin receptor substrate 1 and glucose transporter type 4 expression in skeletal muscle, significantly increased glucokinase expression, and decreased glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expressions in the liver. The expressions of transcription factors, such as sterol-regulatory element-binding protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and adipocyte protein 2, were upregulated in adipose tissue. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis showed that AS upregulated insulin production by increasing pancreatic β-cell mass. In summary, AS extract normalized hyperglycemia by multiple mechanisms: inhibition of glyconeogenesis, acceleration of glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism, and increase of glucose uptake.

This study validates the Hwa-byung Scale (HBS) and examines the relationship of HB with cardiovascular autonomic function. Method: The electronic medical records of all 98 outpatients that visited the Hwa-Byung and Stress Clinic of the Kyung Hee University Oriental Medical Hospital at Gangdong were reviewed in this study. The outpatients completed the personality- and symptom-related subscales of the HBS (HBS-P, HBS-S) and to undergo heart rate variability (HRV) tests. Two neuropsychiatrists interviewed each outpatient and screened for HB. We conducted reliability and construct validity tests, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the HBS-P and HBS-S. We also examined whether HBS-P and HBS-S scores were partially related to cardiovascular autonomic function, as estimated by HRV. Results: The HBS-S had satisfactory reliability ( α= 0.922) and construct validity (% of total variance = 68.1%), and a suitable cut-off score (28 points). Multiple regression analysis indicated that toleration and victimization personality traits were predictive of HB ( β = 0.235-0.485). Further, toleration and victimization, heat-sensation- and fatigue-related items were negatively correlated with the standard deviation of R-R intervals, root of the mean squared differences of successive R-R intervals, total power, very low frequency, low frequency, and low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (-0.305 < r< -0.207). Conclusions: It appears that the HBS-S is a reliable and valid screening tool for HB, and that HB may be partially related to decreased cardiovascular autonomic function. ? 2015 Elsevier GmbH.",Fire disease; HRV; Hwa-byung; Hwa-Byung Diagnostic Interview Schedule; Questionnaire,aged; Article; autonomic nervous system function; cardiovascular function; construct validity; electronic medical record; fatigue; female; heart rate variability; heat sensation; human; Hwa Byung Scale; hwa byung syndrome; Korean medicine; major clinical study; male; outpatient; personality; priority journal; questionnaire; rating scale; receiver operating characteristic; reliability; syndrome; validation study,2-s2.0-84941260822

Recent technological advances in medical equipment and increased utilization of the imaging modality have resulted in a significant increase in the exposure to ionizing radiation. After the rapid adoption of multi-detector computed tomography, computed tomography (CT) is now the single largest source of diagnostic radiation exposure to patients. The risks and benefits from radiation must be carefully considered in all examinations using ionizing radiation, and the principles of justification and optimization should be considered in the proper use of CT examination. Justification means that the examination must be medically indicated and useful. Optimization means that the imaging should be performed using doses that are ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable), consistent with the diagnostic task. This includes understanding and changing CT protocols to perform the same diagnostic task with the minimal amount of radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Protocols and guidelines are important tools for radiation dose reduction. Understanding the parameters and dose information for CT examination is essential for optimization. If the exam is justified, then the parameters must be optimized to the imaging indication, scan area, body size, age, and weight of the patients. The physician should always assess the radiation risk-benefit ratio for each patient before ordering an examination that uses radiation. Continuing education is essential for the implementation of the principles of patient radiation dose reduction. Physicians and radiologists must be aware of the radiation risks associated with CT exams. ?

When a patient exhibits recurrent prostate cancer following definitive EBRT and presents with comorbidities meaning that they cannot receive a prostatectomy, it is difficult to treat due to the numerous limitations of current salvage therapies. In the present study, two cases of salvage reirradiation using helical tomotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer following definitive EBRT are presented. The two patients received EBRT without severe complications. Local recurrence was confirmed by serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, repeat prostate biopsy, prostate magnetic resonance imaging and a bone scan.

However, no study has yet identified the knee center of rotations during several daily activities before and after high tibial osteotomy surgery, which is one surgical option for treating knee osteoarthritis. In this study, an estimation method for determining the knee joint center of rotation was developed by applying the optimal common shape technique and symmetrical axis of rotation approach techniques to motion-capture data and validated for typical activities (walking, squatting, climbing up stairs, walking down stairs) of 10 normal subjects. The locations of knee joint center of rotations for injured and contralateral knees of eight subjects with osteoarthritis, both before and after high tibial osteotomy surgery, were then calculated during walking. It was shown that high tibial osteotomy surgery improved the knee joint center of rotation since the center of rotations for the injured knee after high tibial osteotomy surgery were significantly closer to those of the normal healthy population. The difference between the injured and contralateral knees was also generally reduced after surgery, demonstrating increased symmetry. These results indicate that symmetry in both knees can be recovered in many cases after high tibial osteotomy surgery. Moreover, the recovery of center of rotation in the injured knee was prior to that of symmetry. This study has the potential to provide fundamental information that can be applied to understand abnormal kinematics in patients, diagnose knee joint disease, and design a novel implants for knee joint surgeries. ? 2015 IMechE.",biomechanics; Center of rotation; high tibial osteotomy; kinematics; knee,"Biomechanics; Computerized tomography; Kinematics; Physiological models; Rotation; Stairs; Surgery; Transplantation (surgical); Accurate measurement; Center of rotation; Healthy population; High tibial osteotomies; knee; Knee osteoarthritis; Motion capture data; Musculoskeletal model; Joints (anatomy); adult; biomechanics; case control study; female; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; male; middle aged; osteotomy; physiology; procedures; surgery; tibia; walking; young adult; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Knee; Male; Middle Aged; Osteotomy; Range of Motion, Articular; Tibia; Walking; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84930463010

Methods: Adolescents who experienced casual sex and romantic sex were compared to adolescents who retained their virginity. Data was from samples drawn from the three waves (2010~2012) of the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey. Logistic models were used to adjust for a wide array of confounding variables. Results: Any type of sexual intercourse increases risk of all suicidal behaviors. Sexual intercourse in a romantic relationship exhibits enhanced risk of suicidal behaviors compared to casual sex. Adjusting for experience of sexual violence, however, decreases risk of romantic sex substantially, turning some estimates statistically insignificant. In addition, risks for suicide lethality are greater for girls than boys. Conclusion: Romantic sex put adolescents at higher risk for suicidal behaviors than casual sex owing to prevalent sexual violence in the relationships. Girls suffer more substantively adverse outcomes than boys. These results suggest that adolescents will benefit from comprehensive education on sexuality and sexual behaviors regarding how to form and maintain a romantic relationship that is characterized by personal integrity and mutual respect. It is also important to help victims of sexual violence recover from traumatic events by providing emotional support and effective counseling. ? 2015 Korean Society of Nursing Science.",Adolescence; Contexts of sexual intercourse; Sexual intercourse; Suicide,"adolescent; adolescent behavior; female; human; Internet; male; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; sex difference; sexual behavior; sexual crime; social class; South Korea; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Sex Offenses; Sexual Behavior; Social Class; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84928940323

However, no studies have investigated the clinicopathological risk factors associated with early carcinoma according to these criteria. Methodology: We compared the clinicopathological risk factors of early carcinoma with those of dysplasia, and used multivariate analysis to elucidate the independent risk factors associated with early carcinoma. Lesions with severe cytologic or architectural changes confined to the mucosa are classified as carcinoma in Japanese criteria and as high grade dysplasia (HGD] in Western criteria. Results: Pathologically, 625 total patients were diagnosed with low grade dysplasia (n=321), HGD (n=244), intramucosal carcinoma (n=35) or submucosal carcinoma (n=25). In multivariate analysis, age, large lesion size, and non-polypoid appearance were associated with carcinoma in Japanese criteria; however, only large lesion size was associated with carcinoma in Western criteria. The clinicopathological characteristics of intramucosal carcinoma were similar to those of submucosal carcinoma rather than HGD. Conclusions: The clinicopathological characteristics for early carcinoma were not identical between Japanese and Western criteria.

Microscopic examinations were used to identify malaria parasites. ELISA was used to quantitate anti-circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antibodies against P. vivax. A total of 1,774 blood samples were collected. The overall CSP-ELISA-positive rate was 7.7% (n=139). The annual parasite incidences (APIs) in these areas gradually decreased from 2004 to 2005 (1.09 and 0.80, respectively). The positive rate in Gimpo (10.4%, 44/425) was the highest identified by CSP-ELISA. The highest API was found in Yeoncheon, followed by Cheorwon, Paju, and Gimpo in both years. The positive rates of CSP-ELISA were closely related to the APIs in the study areas. These results suggest that seroepidemiological studies based on CSP may be helpful in estimating the malaria prevalence in certain areas. In addition, this assay can be used to establish and evaluate malaria control and eradication programs in affected areas. ? 2015, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine",Annual parasite incidence; Circumsporozoite protein; Plasmodium vivax; Seropositivity,"circumsporozoite protein antibody; parasite antibody; unclassified drug; protozoal protein; protozoon antibody; antibody detection; antibody titer; Article; blood sampling; disease association; disease surveillance; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemic; geographic distribution; human; major clinical study; malaria control; microorganism detection; morbidity; nonhuman; parasite incidence; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; prevalence; seroepidemiology; South Korea; trend study; adolescent; adult; blood; female; immunology; incidence; Malaria, Vivax; male; middle aged; parasitology; physiology; young adult; Apis; Plasmodium vivax; Adolescent; Adult; Antibodies, Protozoan; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Incidence; Malaria, Vivax; Male; Middle Aged; Plasmodium vivax; Prevalence; Protozoan Proteins; Republic of Korea; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84928405075

The severity of clinical symptoms and dopamine transporter (DAT) bindings were less correlated compared to other parkinsonisms, suggesting that presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction may not explain extrapyramidal manifestations in CBD. Therefore we wanted to reexamine asymmetry and severity between DAT imaging and clinical findings. We studied patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for CBD based on clinical features. We collected their clinical information and imaging retrospectively. Seven patients were enrolled and all had asymmetric rigidity, bradykinesia and unilateral limb dystonia. These symptoms did not improve with levodopa. All patients showed symptoms bilaterally in the last visit, but asymmetry of clinical symptoms was remarkable at the time of DAT imaging. The DAT bindings were decreased in six subjects. However, one patient showed normal DAT binding. Four patients had a more evident DAT reduction on the side contralateral to the more clinically affected side, however, two patients had a more prominent reduction on the ipsilateral side. The symptoms that we regard as parkinsonian features in CBD are not only explained by presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction.

In the present study, the GoldenGate high-throughput genotyping assay was adapted to determine the methylation state of 1,505 specific CpG sites in 807 cancer-related genes. The methylation results revealed that CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) was hypomethylated (mean β-value difference, -0.21) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) tissue. Tissue samples from 61 CCRCC cases were used for immunohistochemical staining, and patients with low CCR5 expression (n=44) were compared with those with high CCR5 expression (n=17). Tumor (T) stage was significantly lower in the low expression group compared with the high expression group (P=0.047). The Fuhrman grade of patients in the low expression group was significantly lower than that of patients in the high expression group (P=0.044). Whilst the node (N) and metastasis (M) stages of the CCR5 low expression group appeared to be lower compared with those of the CCR5 high expression group; this difference was not statistically significant (N stage, P=0.632; M stage, P=0.896). Additionally, patients in the low expression group had lower risks of postoperative tumor recurrence (P=0.110) and mortality from CCRCC (P=0.159) compared with those in the high expression group, however, this was also without statistical significance. The results indicate that CCR5 hypomethylation is associated with cancer tissue to a greater extent than normal tissue. Although the biological function of CCR5 in CCRCC remains to be established, low CCR5 expression is associated with low T stage and low Fuhrman grade in these patients. ? 2015, Spandidos Publications.

As endoscopic injection has a lower success rate than ureteral reimplantation, a postoperative voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is usually performed. The present study evaluated whether the presence of a nodule on noninvasive ultrasound could predict the resolution of VUR and replace invasive VCUG. Patients who received an injection of endoscopic bulking agent for VUR from January 2005 to December 2010 were evaluated retrospectively. It was evaluated whether a nodule, an echogenic mass lesion distinguished from the bladder at the ureteral orifice, was present on the ultrasound one month postoperatively. The success of the injection in the group with nodules was compared with that of the group without nodules by VCUG 3 months postoperatively. A total of 149 patients (220 ureters) met the inclusion criteria. The mean age at surgery was 3.5 years (range, 0.6?18 years). The overall success rate was 73.2%. A nodule was present in 152 cases (69.1%). The group with nodules had a higher success rate than the group without nodules (84.2%, 128/152 vs. 48.5%, 33/68, respectively; P<0.001). According to multivariate analysis, injection nodules were a predictive factor for the success of the endoscopic injection (odds ratio, 6.050; P<0.001). The failure rate increased with increasing injection volume. The sensitivity of sonographic injection nodules for predicting success was 79.5% and the specificity was 59.3%.

To overcome these limitations, a new piperazine dithioctate (PDT) tablet formulation was developed by a domestic pharmaceutical company in Korea. Objective: The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of PDT in healthy volunteers. Methods: This study consisted of two clinical trials. In the part 1 study, a randomized, single-dose, parallel study was performed with 24 healthy volunteers. All of the subjects were administered one of the three study formulations, Thioctacid? HR (High Release) as the reference, PDT-1 or PDT-2 (each containing thioctic acid 600 mg), respectively. To determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics, blood samples were serially collected at pre-dose and at pre-defined timepoints after dosing. In the part 2 study, a randomized, single-dose, two-way crossover study was conducted with 48 subjects. All of the subjects were administered both the reference and PDT-2 formulations, with a 7-day washout period between the two medications. Blood samples were collected at the same timepoints as in the part 1 study. Toler-ability was evaluated throughout the study. Results: 23 volunteers completed the part 1 study. The maximum plasma concentration (C<inf>max</inf>) of thioctic acid after administration of the reference tablet was 4.08 ± 2.35 μg/mL (means ± SD), and the C<inf>max</inf>of PDT-1 and PDT-2 was 3.53 ± 2.87 μg/mL and 4.15 ± 1.62 μg/mL, respectively.

The tumor size and extent of axillary lymph node involvement are important parameters to evaluate the breast cancer survival rate. Additionally, the anomaly characterization is required to distinguish a malignant tumor from a benign tumor. In order to overcome the limitation of breast cancer detection using impedance measurement probes, we developed the high density trans-admittance mammography (TAM) system with 60 x 60 electrode array and produced trans-admittance maps obtained at several frequency pairs. We applied the anomaly detection algorithm to the high density TAM system for estimating the volume and position of breast tumor. We tested four different sizes of anomaly with three different conductivity contrasts at four different depths. From multifrequency trans-admittance maps, we can readily observe the transversal position and estimate its volume and depth. Specially, the depth estimated values were obtained accurately, which were independent to the size and conductivity contrast when applying the new formula using Laplacian of trans-admittance map. The volume estimation was dependent on the conductivity contrast between anomaly and background in the breast phantom. We characterized two testing anomalies using frequency difference trans-admittance data to eliminate the dependency of anomaly position and size. We confirmed the anomaly detection and characterization algorithm with the high density TAM system on bovine breast tissue. Both results showed the feasibility of detecting the size and position of anomaly and tissue characterization for screening the breast cancer. ? 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",lesion estimation; mammography; tissue characterization; trans-admittance,"Anomaly detection; Electrode arrays; Tissue characterization; trans-admittance; Mammography; algorithm; animal; bovine; breast; Breast Neoplasms; congenital malformation; electrode; feasibility study; female; human; image quality; impedance; mammary gland; mammography; pathology; procedures; Algorithms; Animals; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Cattle; Electric Impedance; Electrodes; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Mammary Glands, Human; Mammography; Phantoms, Imaging",2-s2.0-84907210864

In the present study, we investigated the effects of ATM (1, 3 or 10. mg/kg) and MPD (5, 10 or 20. mg/kg) on pharmacological mouse models of sensorimotor gating measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) using the acoustic startle response test. MK-801, a non-competitive N-methyl. -d-aspartate receptor antagonist, or apomorphine, a non-competitive dopamine receptor agonist, was used to induce PPI deficits. ATM (3 or 10. mg/kg, s.c.) significantly attenuated the MK-801-, but not apomorphine-, induced PPI deficits. In contrast to ATM, MPD did not reverse the PPI deficits induced by either MK-801 or apomorphine. Immunostaining revealed that the number of c-Fos-immunopositive cells was increased in the nucleus accumbens following MK-801 treatment, and this was reversed by the administration of ATM (3. mg/kg), but not MPD (10. mg/kg). However, neither ATM nor MPD reversed the increased number of c-Fos-immunopositive cells in the nucleus accumbens following apomorphine treatment. These results suggest that the attenuating effect of ATM on the increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens induced by MK-801 may be attributed to the PPI deficit-ameliorating effects of ATM and that ATM would be useful to treat sensorimotor gating-related disorders by improving the patient's attention span or cognitive function. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Atomoxetine; Dopaminergic neurotransmitter system; Methylphenidate; Prepulse inhibition; Sensorimotor gating,"atomoxetine; methylphenidate; protein c fos; adrenergic receptor affecting agent; amino acid receptor blocking agent; apomorphine; atomoxetine; dizocilpine maleate; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; dopamine uptake inhibitor; methylphenidate; propylamine; protein c fos; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; auditory stimulation; cell count; cellular distribution; central nervous system; controlled study; dopaminergic system; drug effect; executive function; glutamatergic system; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; male; motor dysfunction; mouse; neurophysiology; nonhuman; prepulse inhibition; sensory gating; startle reflex; animal; auditory stimulation; dose response; drug effects; hearing; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; nucleus accumbens; pathophysiology; physiology; prepulse inhibition; startle reflex; Acoustic Stimulation; Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors; Animals; Apomorphine; Auditory Perception; Dizocilpine Maleate; Dopamine Agonists; Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; Male; Methylphenidate; Mice, Inbred ICR; Nucleus Accumbens; Prepulse Inhibition; Propylamines; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos; Reflex, Startle; Sensory Gating",2-s2.0-84903528353

This study aims to determine whether recurrence is a significant contributor of hospitalization cost in items for ischemic stroke patients. Methods: This study assessed acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to an academic medical center in 2003 through 2009. The t-test and Chi-square tests were used to compare first-ever and recurrent ischemic stroke groups in terms of total and categorized hospitalization cost, and multiple regression was performed to assess the influence of stroke recurrence. Results: Recurrent ischemic strokes were associated with higher total cost, but examination cost showed no difference between the two groups. The recurrent stroke group showed higher laboratory but lower imaging cost. Of imaging studies, there was no significant difference in computed tomography scan cost while the first-ever stroke group spent more on magnetic resonance imaging and sonography. Controlling for other influential factors, recurrence was discovered to be a significant factor in lowering examination cost. Conclusions: The findings of stroke recurrence in lowering examination cost could be explained from two perspectives, different clinical patterns of healthcare utilization and patients' economic status in recurrent stroke. ? 2014 Kwon et al.",,"adult; aged; article; brain ischemia; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; cost control; disease duration; echography; female; health care cost; health care utilization; hospitalization cost; human; imaging cost; laboratory cost; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; recurrent disease; stroke patient; acute disease; brain; brain ischemia; economics; hospitalization; pathology; recurrent disease; risk factor; Stroke; transient ischemic attack; Acute Disease; Aged; Brain; Brain Ischemia; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Stroke; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84904605888

Sixteen and 24 patients were diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion and branch retinal vein occlusion, respectively. Twenty-one patients (52.5%) recognized reduced visual acuity due to recurring macular edema. These patients were younger (59.2 ± 7.6 vs. 64.8 ± 9.4 years, p = 0.046), had better visual acuity before recurrence of macular edema (0.52 ± 0.48 vs. 1.02 ± 0.46, p = 0.002), and exhibited a greater reduction in visual acuity after recurrence of macular edema (0.34 ± 0.24 vs. 0.14 ± 0.13, p = 0.003). Only four patients visited the hospital before the scheduled follow-up date, and all of these patients lived relatively close to the hospital.CONCLUSIONS: For prompt treatment of recurring macular edema, more intensive education about the self-estimation of visual acuity is necessary, particularly for elderly patients who have relatively poor visual acuity. In addition, a simple and easy way to identify the recurrence of macular edema at the local clinic should be established for patients who live relatively far from the hospital.PURPOSE: To evaluate patients' self-recognition of reduced visual acuity due to recurring macular edema in retinal vein occlusion.METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of patients who were diagnosed with recurring macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion was performed. The proportion of patients who recognized reduced visual acuity due to the recurrence of macular edema and who visited the hospital before the scheduled follow-up date was determined.

Little is known about the effects of a low-salt diet (LSD) on net endogenous acid production (NEAP) levels in CKD patients using angiotensin receptor blockade. Methods: We enrolled a total of 202 nondiabetic CKD patients who underwent an 8-week treatment with olmesartan from the original trial [Effects of Low Sodium Intake on the Antiproteinuric Efficacy of Olmesartan in Hypertensive Patients with Albuminuria (ESPECIAL) trial: NCT01552954]. The patients were divided into good-And poor-LSD-compliance groups. Results: During the interventional 8 weeks, the NEAP in the good-compliance group increased compared to the control group (12.9 ± 32.0 vs.-2.0 ± 35.0 mmol/day, p = 0.002). NEAP was positively associated with the good-LSD-compliance group in the fully adjusted analyses (r = 0.135, p = 0.016). The additional reduction of 2.39 g/day of protein intake with a reduction of 1 g/day of salt intake did not increase the NEAP under angiotensin II receptor blockade (ARB) treatment with an LSD (r = 0.546, p < 0.001). Conclusion: We found that an LSD may increase the NEAP in nondiabetic CKD patients using ARB, which suggests that additional acid producing-protein restriction should be required to prevent the NEAP from rising. ? 2014 S.

Administration of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) with the CGJ extract resulted in hyper-production of KLH-specific IgA in the gut and KLH-specific IgG in the serum. Oral-administration of the CGJ extract resulted in promotion of both Th1 and Th2 immune responses, thus eliminating concerns over an imbalanced Th1 and Th2 immune bias that is often observed upon administration of other commonly used immunoadjuvants.

To date, more than 700 independent mutations have been identified in the NF1 gene, the majority of which are family specific. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenic mutations in NF1 gene in 15 Korean NF1 families. We performed genetic analysis on 37 patients from 15 unrelated families by using RT-PCR and mRNA sequencing with 12 primer set including whole coding region of the NF1 gene. Here, we identified the familial and sporadic mutations in 34 of 37 patients (91.9 %) and found the familial mutations in 11 of 15 families (73.3 %). We detected 29 mutations of NF1 gene, which may encode the truncated form of neurofibromin. Four mutations were found in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase recognition sites (G1610A, c.2179delCAG) and the GTPase activating protein related domain (c.3169insT, c.2863delC). In this series of familial studies, we report a wide spectrum of NF1 mutations in Korean patients. We conclude that most mutations caused abnormal transcripts and premature termination of the mutant alleles. Then we suggest that these may provide further insights into the pathogenesis of NF1. ? 2013 The Genetics Society of Korea.",Korea; Mutation; Neurofibromatosis type 1; Neurofibromin; Premature termination,,2-s2.0-84894050210

Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is a member of animal lectins that plays an essential role in various biological functions. The expression of Gal-9 is significantly enhanced in MS lesions; however, its role in autoimmune disease has not been fully elucidated. To identify the role of Gal-9 in EAE, we measured changes in mRNA and protein expression of Gal-9 as EAE progressed. Expression increased with disease progression, with a sharp rise occurring at its peak. Gal-9 immunoreactivity was mainly expressed in astrocytes and microglia of the central nervous system (CNS) and macrophages of spleen. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that Gal-9+CD11b+ cells were dramatically increased in the spleen at the peak of disease. Increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-R1 and p-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK) was observed in the CNS of EAE mice, suggesting that TNF-R1 and p-JNK might be key regulators contributing to the expression of Gal-9 during EAE. These results suggest that identification of the relationship between Gal-9 and EAE progression is critical for better understanding Gal-9 biology in autoimmune disease.",Central nervous system; Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; Galectin-9,Animalia; Mus,2-s2.0-84975801833

Rights to life and health are recognised by many international agreements as fundamental human rights. This article argues, from the perspective of the New Haven school of jurisprudence, that since the principle of human dignity as a legal source of fundamental human rights is a basic norm justifying all legal regulations and institutions, it must, in case of con""icts with provisions under the GATT/WTO Agreements, have priority over rules for free trade and investment liberalisation. In light of the rights to life and health being core human rights having the status of international custom or jus cogens, the author proposes several policy and legal requirements to ensure human dignity, as applied to regulations of international trade of GMO. ?

The connection between these two constitutive aspects - the informational and the phenomenal - is deep, but how are we to make sense of it? One influential approach maintains that sentience ultimately reduces to sapience, namely, that phenomenal consciousness is a function of representational relations between mental states which, barring these relations, would not, and could not, be conscious. In this paper I take issue with this line of thought, arguing that neither of these salient aspects of consciousness reduces to the other. Instead, I offer an explanatory framework which takes both sentience and sapience as ontological fundamentals and explore how they co-evolve. In particular, I argue that while epistemic access cannot generate experience from scratch it does play a crucial role in constituting an important form of higher-order experience, namely, the capacity to experience a sense of ownership over one's experiential domain. ? 2014 The Institute of Mind and Behavior, Inc.",Panpsychism; Sapience; Sentience,access to information; Article; awareness; cellular organism; cognition; conceptual framework; consciousness; consciousness level; epistemology; human; information processing; information science; knowledge base; mental health; molecular evolution; natural science; nervous system function; personal experience; phenomenal consciousness; phenomenology; self concept,2-s2.0-84943574175

Background: Choroidal metastasis is rare and ocular examination is not routinely recommended as part of staging work up in breast cancer management. Clinical picture: We present a case of choroidal metastasis in female breast cancer. Breast imaging and staging evaluation suggested multicentric breast cancer without lymph node metastasis or systemic metastasis. After total right mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, the final pathologic stage was pT2N0, ER (+), PR (+), c-erbB2 (2+), and FISH (-). On the third day following surgery, she complained of blurred vision in her left eye. Ophthalmologic evaluation showed choroidal metastasis from breast cancer. The visual acuity in her left eye was 20/50. Result: After concomitant delivery of chemoradiation therapy, the choroidal lesions improved dramatically and vision acuity in her left eye recovered to 20/20. Conclusion: Clinicians should consider the possibility of choroidal metastasis when breast cancer patients complain of ocular symptoms. ?

To do this, the existing 'Health Performance Indicator for the Public Housing' developed by a previous study in 2010 was utilized to compare and analyse the characteristic differences as evaluated by experts and the residents. The survey tool was developed to allow evaluation by the experts using pairwise comparison between components; while the residents were asked to evaluate the relative importance of the components in the survey tool. Furthermore, Analytic Hierarchy Process was applied to the evaluation given by experts and PASW statistical package was used to analyse the survey results given by the residents. The results showed that the residents do have a high awareness of the impacts of the various components in their apartments that could be seen visually, revealing a partial difference in their awareness in comparison to that given by the experts. It is therefore necessary to utilize this understanding of the experts and residents in order to meet the actual demands of the residents in accordance with their awareness. It is expected that the evaluation results of this study would be used in the construction plan of new apartments to promote healthy housing and to incorporate not just the experts' view but also the demand of the residents. ?

Methods: The records of 661 patients with apparently uterine-confined disease were reviewed. The performance in predicting overall survival and cause-specific survival was compared between a multivariate prognostic model with nodal status and a model without nodal status by calculating Harrell concordance index. Results: Among 661 patients with clinically early-stage endometrial cancer, the lymph node metastasis rate was 8.3% (55/661). Lymph node metastasis independently associated with cause-specific survival only when no stratification according to adjuvant treatment was applied (P = 0.035). After stratification according to adjuvant radiotherapy, lymph node status marginally associated with cause-specific survival (P = 0.073), whereas myometrial invasion retained its strong association with cause-specific survival (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the performance of the survival model using only uterine factors and the model using lymph node status and uterine factors (concordance index, 0.77 vs 0.77, respectively; P = 0.798). Conclusions: Knowledge of lymph node status did not significantly improve the performance of survival prediction in apparently uterine-confined endometrial cancer, although it was independently associated with survival. In the patients with clinically early-stage endometrial cancer, the accuracy of the prediction of survival was comparable between risk grouping without lymph node status and that including lymph node status.

Due to some privacy concerns, depth camera is a good candidate in such domains over RGB camera for facial expression recognition (FER). The accuracy of such FER systems are completely reliant on the extraction of the informative features. In this work, we have tested and validated the accuracy of a new feature extraction method based on symlet wavelet transform. In this method, the human face is divided into number of regions and in each region the movement of pixels have been traced in order to create the feature vectors. Each expression frame is decomposed up to 4 levels. In each decomposition level, the distance between the two corresponding pixels is found by using the distance formula in order to extract the most informative coefficients. After feature vector creation, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has been employed to reduce the dimensions of the feature space. Lastly, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been exploited for expression recognition. Most of the previous FER systems used existing available standard datasets and all the datasets were pose-based datasets. Therefore, we have collected our own depth data of 15 subjects by employing the dept camera. For the whole experiments, 10-fold cross validation scheme was utilized for the experiments. The proposed technique showed a significant improvement in accuracy against the existing works. ?

The HCV RC is known to be associated with an intracellular membrane structure, but the cellular components of the RC and their roles in the formation of the HCV RC have not been well characterized. In this study, we took a proteomic approach to identify stomatin, a member of the integral proteins of lipid rafts, as a cellular protein interacting with HCV NS5B. Coimmunoprecipitation and co-localization studies confirmed the interaction between stomatin and NS5B. We demonstrated that the subcellular fraction containing viral NS proteins and stomatin displays RdRp activity. Membrane flotation assays with the HCV genome replication-competent subcellular fraction revealed that the HCV RdRp and stomatin are associated with the lipid raft-like domain of membranous structures. Stomatin silencing by RNA interference led to the release of NS5B from the detergent-resistant membrane, thereby inhibiting HCV replication in both HCV subgenomic replicon-harboring cells and HCVinfected cells.

In the present study, the effects of DS in the growth and survival of AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells and the involvement of Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin (TRPM) 7 channels were investigated. The AGS cells were treated with varying concentrations of DS. Analyses of the sub Gl, caspase-3 and-9 activity and the mitochondrial depolarization were conducted to determine whether AGS cell death occured by apoptosis. Also, to identify the involvement of TRPM7 channels in AGS cell growth and survival, we used Human Embiyonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells overexpressed with TRPM7 channels. The sub Gl, caspase-3 and 9 activity and the mitochondrial depolarization was increased by DS and this apoptosis was inhibited by SB203580 (a p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) inhibitor) and by a c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) II inhibitor. Additionally, DS inhibited TRPM7 like currents in AGS cells and in TRPM7 overexpressed HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, tetracycline induced TRPM7 channel overexpressions in HEK 293 cells increased DS-induced cell death. These results suggested that DS inhibits the growth and survival of gastric cancer cells and TRPM7 channel activity and MAPK signaling is involved in the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. Therefore, DS may be have an anti-cancer effects and a potential drug for treatment of gastric cancer. Both TRPM7 channel and MAPK signaling may play an important role in proliferation of gastric cancer cells. ? 2014 Asaian network for Scientific information.",AGS cells; Apoptosis; Dangkwisoo-San; Mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor; Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 channel,4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 methylsulfinylphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl) imidazole; caspase 3; caspase 9; dangkwisoo San; herbaceous agent; mitogen activated protein kinase p38 inhibitor; stress activated protein kinase inhibitor; transient receptor potential channel M7; unclassified drug; apoptosis; Article; caspase assay; cell membrane depolarization; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; gastric cancer cell line; genetic transfection; human; human cell; human tissue; kidney cell; mitochondrion; MTT assay; patch clamp technique; signal transduction; stomach adenocarcinoma,2-s2.0-84908374471

Reduction of secondary doses from CBCT was measured using a radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeter (RPLGD) placed inside an anthropomorphic phantom. The entire body, except for the region scanned by using CBCT, was shielded by wrapping it with a 2-mm lead sheet. Changes in secondary cancer risk due to shielding were calculated using BEIR VII models. Doses to out-of-field organs for head-and-neck, chest, and pelvis scans were decreased 15 ~ 100%, 23 ~ 90%, and 23 ~ 98%, respectively, and the average reductions in lifetime secondary cancer risk due to the 2-mm lead shielding were 1.6, 11.5, and 12.7 persons per 100,000, respectively.

However, the regulation of CF in gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of CF on the pacemaker activity of the Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICCs) in murine small intestine and GI motility. Enzymatic digestion was used to dissociate ICCs from mouse small intestines. The whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record pacemaker potentials from cultured ICCs clusters. In vivo effects of CF on GI motility were investigated by measuring the Intestinal Transit Rate (ITR) of Evans blue in normal and abnormal mice models. The CF depolarized resting membrane potentials in a concentration dependent manner but this action was blocked by Y25130 (a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) and RS39604 (a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist). However, SB269970 (a 5-HT7 receptor antagonist) did not. Pretreatment with Ca2+ free solution or thapsigargin (Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor in endoplasmic reticulum) abolished the generation of pacemaker potentials and suppressed CF-induced activity. In vivo, CF (0.01-1 g kg-1, p.o.) not only significantly increased the ITR in normal mice but also ameliorated acetic acid-induced or STZ-induced diabetic GI motility retardation in a dose-dependent manner. So, CF regulates the pacemaker potentials in a dose dependent manner via external and internal Ca2+ regulations through 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptors. Also CF increases the ITRs in normal and acetic acid-induced or STZ-induced diabetic GI motility dysfunctions mice models. Therefore, CF might be a novel candidate for development as a prokinetic agent that may prevent or alleviate GI motility dysfunctions. ? 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Carthami flos; Gastrointestinal tract; GI motility; Interstitial cells of Cajal; Pacemaker activity,safflower extract; serotonin 3 antagonist; serotonin 3 receptor; serotonin 4 antagonist; serotonin 4 receptor; thapsigargin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell culture; cell membrane depolarization; cell membrane steady potential; controlled study; depolarization; endoplasmic reticulum; enzymatic degradation; gastrointestinal motility; interstitial cell of Cajal; male; mouse; nonhuman; peritoneal disease; small intestine; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; toxicity testing; whole cell patch clamp,2-s2.0-84907354704

In contrast to GE, capillary electrophoresis (CE) has some merits because it is automated, fast, and highly reproducible. However, CE results occasionally make the interpretation difficult and require additional confirmatory tests like GE. Methods: In order to assist a correct reporting of CE results and compatible interpretations between two different electrophoresis methods, we report here two unusual cases of monoclonal gammopathy by a pattern of polyclonal gammopathy upon CE interpretation in patients with end stage renal disease and multiple myeloma. Results: In these cases, serum CE showed the broad bumpy peak in the gamma region. This bumpy peak does not drop completely flat after the reaction with anti-FLC. Conclusions: Because the plasma cell is a B-cell lineage and plays an important role in adaptive immunity, MG accompanying with PG is not rarely found in plasma cell dyscrasia. If the broad bumpy peak is observed in CE, careful examinations must be done to rule out the hidden M-peak. In our cases, a parallel use of gel-based methods was very helpful as it revealed monoclonal bands.",Capillary electrophoresis; Monoclonal gammopathy; Polyclonal gammopathy,"Aged; Electrophoresis, Capillary; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Paraproteinemias",2-s2.0-84905017635

However, most of these trials have been limited to adult patients. In this study, we evaluated the paired serum and urinary free light chain levels of pediatric patients with various inflammatory conditions to investigate the clinical significance of free light chain measurement in pediatrics. Methods: The study included 227 paired serum and urine specimens from 134 pediatric patients at our hospital between January and February of 2012. Serum and urinary FLC levels were measured using a Freelight Kit (The Binding Site, Ltd., Birmingham, UK). Results: The serum lambda and urine kappa and lambda components were significantly increased only in the renal impairment group, not in the mild inflammatory group. FLC ratios were not significantly different among these groups. Conclusions: In serum, only the L components were significantly increased. This result may indicate the presence of a dimeric L structure, in contrast with monomeric K. FLC levels might also be influenced by renal conditions other than mild inflammation. Therefore, as shown in previous studies of adult patients, renal reference ranges might be needed to interpret FLC results, especially for dimeric L components.",Free light chain; Inflammation; Pediatrics; Renal,"Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin Light Chains; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Inflammation; Male",2-s2.0-84904999307

We retrospectively examined the medical records of patients treated with herbal complexes containing licorice from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010. We recorded the changes in the levels of potassium, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen and examined the differences between before and after herbal complexes intake using a paired t-test. In addition, we investigated the prevalence of hypokalemia among these patients and reviewed such patients. We identified 360 patients who did not show significant changes in the levels of potassium and creatinine (P = 0.815, 0.289). We observed hypokalemia in 6 patients. However, in 5 patients, the hypokalemia did not appear to be related to the licorice. Thus, we could suggest that herbal complexes containing licorice do not significantly influence the potassium levels in routine clinical herbal therapies. However, we propose that follow-up examination for potassium levels is required to prevent any unpredictable side effects of administration of licorice in routine herbal medicine care. ? 2014 WooSang Jung et al.",,acetylsalicylic acid; alfacalcidol; atenolol; Bojungikki tang; calcium carbonate; ceftriaxone; ciprofloxacin; clopidogrel; creatinine; donepezil; fluindostatin; gabapentin; Gamiondamg tang; Glycyrrhiza extract; Gwibi tang; herbaceous agent; hydrochlorothiazide; lercanidipine; losartan potassium; metformin; nifedipine; oxiracetam; paracetamol; potassium; pravastatin; quetiapine; teprenone; tramadol; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; urea; acupuncture; adult; aged; antibiotic therapy; article; brain damage; brain hemorrhage; brain infarction; brain tumor; cerebrovascular accident; colon cancer; complex regional pain syndrome; creatinine blood level; deep vein thrombosis; delirium; esophagus cancer; facial nerve paralysis; fatigue; female; follow up; gallbladder cancer; gastroesophageal reflux; hemiplegia; human; hypertension; hypokalemia; insomnia; intervertebral disk hernia; kidney cancer; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medical record review; moyamoya disease; myelitis; neuralgia; osteoarthritis; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; potassium blood level; retrospective study; shoulder pain; side effect; stomach cancer; tension headache; treatment duration; urea nitrogen blood level; urinary tract infection; vertebral canal stenosis,2-s2.0-84904129401

Methods: A total of 153 specimens were obtained from RA patients for diagnostic or monitoring purposes. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) were measured, and autoantibody testing using IIF and LIA was performed. Frequencies of IIF patterns and autoantibodies identified by LIA were analyzed and compared with each other and with serologic markers of RF, including anti-CCP, ESR, and CRP. Results: The overall positivity of IIF and LIA results was 49.7% and 34.0%, respectively. The most frequent IIF pattern in RA was homogenous (20.9%), followed by dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern (17%). Anti-SS-A and/or anti-Ro-52 were most frequently detected in RA irrespective of the observed IIF pattern. Positive rates and intensities of autoantibodies detected did not differ by therapeutic regimen or disease activity, as reflected by CRP levels or ESR. Only anti-CCP showed a tendency to increase depending on IIF intensity. Conclusions: RA patients did not display a specific or dominant IIF pattern or autoantibody presence, as identified by LIA.

It functions as a membrane-cytoskeletal linker in actin-rich cell surface structures and is thought to be essential for cortical cytoskeleton organization, cell motility, adhesion, and proliferation. An increase in phosphorylated ERM in fibroblast-like synoviocytes contributes to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial hyperplasia. We examined the genetic association between the RDX gene and RA in a Korean population. To identify the relationship between RDX gene polymorphisms and RA, we genotyped 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs11213326 and rs12575162) of RDX using a direct sequencing method in 296 RA patients and 493 control subjects. In this study, the 2 SNPs showed no association with RA disease susceptibility. However, further analysis based on clinical information of the RA patient group showed that the SNPs were associated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in RA patients. These data suggest an association between RDX polymorphisms and the clinical features of RA patients, particularly the ESR. ?

We hypothesized that parity may differentially be associated with the development of invasive breast cancer by each subtype. Methods: We reviewed the clinical, radiological, and pathological records of women diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast at Samsung Medical Center between 2005 and 2009. Clinicopathologic results were assessed by χ2 and Fisher's exact tests with a Bonferroni correction for categorical variables, and by the Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric continuous variables. A multinomial logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. Results: Among a total of 3,095 patients, 283 (9.14 %) patients were nulliparous. Older age, higher pN, and expression of HER2 were associated with parity. In the analysis between parity and molecular subtypes, parity also had a variable influence on breast cancer subtypes (p = 0.032). Intergroup analysis with multiple comparison showed that luminal B subtype was related to nulliparity compared with HER2-positive subtypes (p = 0.03). Conclusions: The effect of parity on the development of breast cancer differed by hormone receptor and HER2 expression. It seems that parity might have a protective effect against hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, especially cancers expressing HR+ and Ki-67. Further basic research to define and understand this result is ongoing. ? 2014 Soci?t?

Children sometimes develop metabolic syndrome, and it is strongly associated with the same syndrome in adulthood. Recently, there is evidence that obesity and metabolic syndrome originate from fetal life. Possible explanations of fetal and developmental origin of metabolic syndrome are the thrifty genotype and thrifty phenotype hypothesis, which together confer insulin resistance on developing fetus. Poor nutrition in utero as well as extrauterine growth restriction of preterm infants are important triggers of this hypothesis. Like metabolic syndrome in adulthood, the high levels of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines are certainly characteristic in pediatric patients. Increased fat mass was also observed in these patients, although their birth weight was lower than average. The mitochondrial genome is responsible for the inheritance of obesity from the maternal line. This can be a key as to why the phenotypes of obesity and metabolic syndrome start in fetal life with an association with poor maternal nutrition. In such circumstances, catch-up growth with an over-nutrition strategy can aggravate those features, suggesting that rapid catch-up growth in early infancy should not be encouraged. ?

A descriptive correlational design was used and data of 401 patients were retrospectively collected for analysis. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed for all patients, which included the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, the Barthel Index, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. The Tobit model was used to manage censoring data, and hierarchical logistic regressions were conducted to determine the relationships among nutrition status, functional status and comorbid conditions. A significant mediating effect of nutritional status on the relationship between multimorbidity and functional status was found. Although multimorbidity, nutritional status, and functional status are usually interlinked in geriatric care, results of this study showed that nutritional intervention may play a stronger role in improving functional status of older patients admitted for acute geriatric services.

This study sought to determine whether jaw-tapping could be a useful exercise to improve memory function by observing changes in brain activity. Methodology: Twelve subjects with subjective memory complaints (SMC group) and thirteen MCI patients (MCI group) participated in a prospective functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. All subjects performed jaw-tapping and n-back memory tasks during blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Measurements were made before and after home practice of the jaw-tapping exercise for 4 weeks. Pre- and post-test fMRI data were analyzed using statistical parametric maps of brain activation. Results: The SMC and the MCI groups showed improvement in the memory task after 4 weeks of jaw-tapping training. In the SMC group, more brain regions were activated overall, including the prefrontal, temporal, and precuneus regions related to memory function. Although fewer brain regions were activated in the MCI group compared to the SMC group, brain activity increased in the MCI group after 4 weeks of training. Conclusion: Jaw-tapping movement could be a useful exercise for improving memory and cognitive function in elderly people with memory disturbance by stimulating brain regions related to these functions. ? 2013 Elsevier GmbH.",FMRI; Jaw-tapping; MCI; Memory disorder; Mild cognitive impairment; Working memory,adult; aged; article; BOLD signal; brain depth stimulation; brain region; cerebellum; cingulate gyrus; clinical article; cognition; cuneus; electroencephalogram; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; fusiform gyrus; human; inferior parietal lobule; insula; jaw movement; jaw tapping; kinesiotherapy; memory; memory disorder; mental performance; mesencephalon; middle aged; middle frontal gyrus; middle temporal gyrus; mild cognitive impairment; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; pons; postcentral gyrus; precuneus; prefrontal cortex; primary motor cortex; priority journal; prospective study; superior frontal gyrus; superior parietal lobule; superior temporal gyrus; supramarginal gyrus; temporal cortex; temporal gyrus; treatment duration,2-s2.0-84895434078

Methods: To identify a possible association with PTC, 94 patients with PTC and 346 healthy controls were recruited. One promoter SNP (rs10898853,-16C/T) was analyzed by direct sequencing. Multiple logistic regression models (co-dominant, dominant, recessive, and log-additive models) were applied, and odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p values were calculated. Results: The genotype of the promoter SNP (rs10898853) of FADD was found to be significantly associated with PTC in the co-dominant model 2 (T/T vs. C/C; p = 0.002, OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.39-5.65), the recessive model (p = 0.003, OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.31-3.71), and the log-additive model (p = 0.002, OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.20-2.44). Allele frequency analysis showed that the C allele of rs10898853 was significantly associated with an increased risk of PTC (p = 0.002, OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.21-2.32). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the FADD promoter polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to PTC. ? 2014 S.

Materials and Methods Fifty-six patients with biopsy-proven breast cancers underwent preoperative breast MRI, including sagittal DIR and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WI). Twenty-four of the 56 patients additionally underwent sagittal T1WI and T2WI. The signal intensities of the lesion (L) and ipsilateral normal breast tissue (N) were measured. The lesion-to-normal ratio (LNR) was defined as LNR = 100(L-N)/N. We compared LNRs among the four sequences, and then assessed the differences of LNRs between CE-T1WI and DIR in each pathologic subgroup (IDC and non-IDC group). Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the normal tissue or lesion and LNRs. Results The mean LNR did not differ significantly between DIR (58.65 ± 71.55) and CE-T1WI (59.78 ±31.04), nor did the LNRs between DIR and CE-T1WI in the two subgroups. The LNRs of DIR did not differ significantly between the two subgroups (P = 0.247). The SNR of lesions in DIR was correlated with the intraductal component percentage (r2 = 0.485, P = 0.037). Conclusion DIR and CE-T1WI showed similar tumor detection efficacy, and DIR could complement dynamic MRI for detecting breast cancer without a contrast agent. J. Magn. Reson.
