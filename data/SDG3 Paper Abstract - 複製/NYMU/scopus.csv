"P3HT:Bebq2-based photovoltaic device enhances differentiation of hiPSC-derived retinal ganglion cells",2019,"Electric field stimulation is known to affect various cellular processes, including cell fate specification and differentiation, particularly towards neuronal lineages. This makes it a promising therapeutic strategy to stimulate regeneration of neuronal tissues. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a type of neural cells of the retina responsible for transduction of visual signals fromthe retina to the brain cortex, and is often degenerated in various blindness-causing retinal diseases. The organic photovoltaic materials such as poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) can generate electric current upon illumination with light of the visible spectrum, and possesses several advantageous properties, including light weight, flexibility and high biocompatibility, which makes them a highly promising tool for electric stimulation of cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we tested the ability to generate photocurrent by several formulations of blend (bulk heterojunction) of P3HT (which is electron donor material) with several electron acceptor materials, including Alq3 and bis(10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinolinato)beryllium (Bebq2). We found that the photovoltaic device based on bulk heterojunction of P3HT with Bebq2 could generate photocurrent when illuminated by both green laser and visible spectrum light. We tested the growth and differentiation capacity of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived RGCs when grown in interface with such photostimulated device, and found that they were significantly increased. The application of P3HT:Bebq2-formulation of photovoltaic device has a great potential for developments in retinal transplantation, nerve repair and tissue engineering approaches of treatment of retinal degeneration. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Post-acute care regains quality of life among middle-aged and older stroke patients in Taiwan",2019,"Objective: This study aims to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL)of middle-aged and older stroke patients receiving the stroke post care (PAC)program and to identify possible predictors. Design, setting and participants: This is a retrospective cohort study. Demographic characteristics and functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Concise Chinese Aphasia Test)were collected at enrollment. EQ-5D HRQoL questionnaires were administered at the beginning and the end of PAC, and health state utilities were compared. Results: The EQ-5D utilities of stroke patients aged 75–84 years and 85 years or above were estimated to be 0.091 and 0.159 lower than those aged less than 50 years. A decrease of the utility by 0.075 was observed among patients with the prior history of stroke. The EQ-5D utilities of patients having Barthel Index of 21–40, 41–60, and 61–100 were 0.1432, 0.1568, and 0.1387 higher than those having Barthel Index of 0–20, respectively. For patients reporting extreme problems in self-care or any dimension of EQ-5D questionnaires prior to PAC, increases in utilities by 0.0733 and 0.2875 were noted. The EQ-5D utility of PAC service duration rose by 0.0733 per one incremental day. Conclusions and implications: This study provides vital evidence regarding time-varying benefits of PAC services to HRQoL of stroke patients and to identify multiple predictors of HRQoL among stroke patients receiving PAC services. This study thus could serve as good reference to enhance quality of PAC services among stroke patients. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; age distribution; aged; Article; Barthel index; cerebrovascular accident; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; Concise Chinese Aphasia Test; demography; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; evidence based medicine; female; geriatric patient; health program; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; neurologic examination; patient care; priority journal; quality of life; Rankin scale; retrospective study; very elderly"
"Evaluation of a Simple and Safe Tumor Drilling Technique to Potentiate the Effect of Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Tubal, and Peritoneal Cancer: A Matched Retrospective Cohort Study",2019,"Frontline intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPCT) in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer has been well established. However, the role of second-line IPCT is yet to be confirmed. With a view to implementing IPCT to treat recurrent disease, a prerequisite is to perform a cytoreductive procedure to minimize residual tumor size. However, the role of cytoreductive procedure is still in debate due to a higher chance of complications. A matched retrospective cohort study was conducted. From 2008 to 2015, we adopted a relatively simple and safe tumor drilling technique to maximize tumor exposure to second-line IPCT. Patients who received tumor drilling followed by second-line IPCT constituted the cohort group. Concurrently, patients who received standard second-line systemic chemotherapy were selected as the comparison group. After propensity score matching, 85 patients in each group entered into the final analysis. The median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2-7.8) for the cohort group versus 4.1 months (95% CI, 4.0-4.3) for the comparison group (hazard ratio = 0.25 [95% CI, 0.17-0.36]; P <.001, by log-rank test). The median overall survival was 33.6 months (32.1-36.6) for the cohort group versus 25.9 months (20.5-26.9) for the comparison group (hazard ratio = 0.33 [95% CI, 0.23-0.48]; P <.001, by log-rank test). Toxicities in the cohort group were not different from those that were published in reports of IPCT for ovarian cancer. The most commonly observed toxicity was gastrointestinal origin (51.7%), and it may be attributed to the intraperitoneal pharmacokinetic clearance of cisplatin and taxol and we also discussed the mechanism of gastrointestinal toxicity. Tumor drilling followed by second-line IPCT may confer a survival advantage over standard second-line systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. ?

"Graft rejection prediction following kidney transplantation using machine learning techniques: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Kidney transplantation is recommended for patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). However, complications, such as graft rejection are hard to predict due to donor and recipient variability. This study discusses the role of machine learning (ML) in predicting graft rejection following kidney transplantation, by reviewing the available related literature. PubMed, DBLP, and Scopus databases were searched to identify studies that utilized ML methods, in predicting outcome following kidney transplants. Fourteen studies were included. This study reviewed the deployment of ML in 109,317 kidney transplant patients from 14 studies. We extracted five different ML algorithms from reviewed studies. Decision Tree (DT) algorithms revealed slightly higher performance with overall mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) for DT (79.5% + 0.06) was higher than Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (78.2% + 0.08). For predicting graft rejection, ANN and DT were at the top among ML models that had higher accuracy and AUC. ? 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.

"Dietary Patterns and Foods Associated With Cognitive Function in Taiwanese Older Adults: The Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Studies",2019,"Objectives: To find dietary patterns and foods associated with cognitive function. Design: A cross-sectional study of short-term effects and a prospective study for long-term effects. Setting: Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (NAHSIT) 2014-2016 and NAHSIT 1999-2000. Participants: A total of 1245 older patients enrolled in the NAHSIT 2014-2016 and 1436 in the NAHSIT 1999-2000. Measurements: Dietary intake was appraised with a food-frequency questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE). Results: Using reduced rank regression to data-mine NAHSIT 2014-2016 cross-sectional data, we found in both genders a dietary pattern associated with high MMSE score, which was characterized by higher intakes of fresh fruits, nuts and seeds, whole grains, breakfast cereals, coffee, dairy products, seafood products, and fish. Moreover, in women, the pattern included a few additional items: tea, eggs, soybean products, and vegetables. Presence of mild cognitive impairment was inversely associated with the dietary pattern score, with declined adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) from tertile 1 (as reference), tertile 2, to tertile 3 in both men [1 → 0.85(0.45-1.61) → 0.32 (0.14-0.78)] and women [1→0.44 (0.25-0.76) → 0.39 (0.20-0.75)]. Using the NAHSIT 1999-2000 as a baseline, along with 11 years of follow-up, we found with the Cox proportional hazards model that higher intake (?4 vs <1 time/wk) of either tea or fish, but not other foods, was associated with a lower risk of developing dementia. Higher intakes of both tea and fish were associated with an even lower risk. Conclusions/Implications: A dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of phytonutrient-rich plant foods (fruits, whole grains, nuts/seeds, and vegetables), tea and coffee, and protein-rich foods such as eggs, dairy products, and fish, was associated with the presence of better cognitive function in older adult. Higher intakes of fish and tea combined showed a long-term protective effect. Further research is warranted to understand the long- and short-term effects of diet. ? 2018 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","aged; Article; body mass; breakfast cereal; cerebrovascular accident; coffee; cognition; cross-sectional study; dairy product; dementia; diastolic blood pressure; dietary intake; dietary pattern; educational status; egg; female; fish; follow up; food frequency questionnaire; fruit; human; inflammation; longitudinal study; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; nut; physical activity; plant seed; prospective study; sea food; sex difference; Taiwanese; tea; vegetable; whole grain"
"Epigenetic silencing of the synthesis of immunosuppressive Siglec ligand glycans by NF-κB/EZH2/YY1 axis in early-stage colon cancers",2019,"Normal colonic epithelial cells express sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis x and disialyl Lewis a on their cell surface, which are ligands for the immunosuppressive molecule Siglec-7. Expression of these normal glycans is frequently lost upon malignant transformation by silencing DTDST and ST6GalNAc6 at the early stage of colorectal carcinogenesis, and leads to production of inflammatory mediators that facilitate carcinogenesis. Indeed, by querying The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets, we confirmed that the level of DTDST or ST6GalNAc6 mRNA is substantially decreased at the early stage of colorectal carcinogenesis. Cultured colon cancer cell lines were used in this study including DLD-1, HT-29, LS174T and SW620. Their promoter regions were strongly marked by repressive mark H3K27me3, catalyzed by EZH2 that was markedly upregulated in early stage of colorectal carcinogenesis. Suppression of EZH2 substantially downregulated H3K27me3 mark and upregulated DTDST and ST6GalNAc6 as well as expression of normal glycans and Siglec-binding activities. Transcription factor YY1 was vital for the recruitment of PRC2-containing EZH2 to both promoters. Inhibition of NF-κB substantially reduced EZH2 transcription and restored their mRNAs as well as the production of normal Siglec ligand glycans in the results obtained from in vitro studies on cultured colon cancer cell lines. These findings provide a putative mechanism for promotion of carcinogenesis by loss of immunosuppressive molecules by epigenetic silencing through NF-κB-mediated EZH2/YY1 axis. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; sialic acid binding immunoglobulin like lectin; transcription factor EZH2; transcription factor YY1; EZH2 protein, human; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; ligand; polysaccharide; sialic acid binding immunoglobulin like lectin; transcription factor EZH2; transcription factor YY1; YY1 protein, human; Article; binding affinity; chromatin immunoprecipitation; colon cancer; colon cancer cell line; colon carcinogenesis; DLD-1 cell line; DNA probe; epigenetics; first cervical vertebra; gene expression; gene silencing; genetic transfection; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vitro study; intestine epithelium cell; LS174T cell line; malignant transformation; priority journal; promoter region; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; SW620 cell line; biosynthesis; carcinogenesis; colon tumor; genetic epigenesis; genetics; metabolism; tumor cell line; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Silencing; Humans; Ligands; NF-kappa B; Polysaccharides; Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins; YY1 Transcription Factor"
"Efficacy of acupressure to prevent adverse reactions to anti-tuberculosis drugs: Randomized controlled trials [穴位按??防抗?核?物不良反?的?效:?机?照??]",2019,"Aim: To determine whether acupressure can prevent or relieve the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of anti-tuberculosis drugs. Background: People receiving drug treatment for TB often experience ADRs that may cause them to stop taking their medication. Acupressure is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that can be applied to alleviate or prevent disease symptoms. Design: A double-blinded, repeated-measures clinical trial in hospitals in Taiwan was carried out from April 2015 – May 2017. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to select 32 people (15 for the experimental group and 17 for the control group) aged >20?years who were taking anti-tuberculosis drugs. The people were randomized to receive 4-week of true acupressure and 4-weeks of sham acupressure. Acupressure therapy was given by a researcher in all cases. Both groups received treatment once per day on weekdays, with 15?min for each acupressure session. Outcomes (gastrointestinal irritation and adverse skin reactions) were assessed according to the people feedback and the physicians’ recordings during the treatment course, and during monthly follow-up visits for 6?months thereafter. Results: Both groups typically experienced gastrointestinal irritation and adverse skin reactions within 2?months of beginning anti-tuberculosis drug treatment. The 4-weeks intervention involving relevant acupressure points successfully relieved both types of side effects in both immediate and delayed manner. Conclusions: When correctly implemented, acupressure can prevent and relieve the ADRs of anti-tuberculosis drugs, and motivate people to complete their treatment course. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","tuberculostatic agent; acupressure; adverse drug reaction; aged; drug eruption; female; gastrointestinal tract; human; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); Taiwan; treatment outcome; tuberculosis; very elderly; Acupressure; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antitubercular Agents; Drug Eruptions; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis"
"The detrimental effect of asymmetric dimethylarginine on cholesterol efflux of macrophage foam cells: Role of the NOX/ROS signaling",2019,"Background: Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor and has been proposed to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, little is known about its role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effect of ADMA on cholesterol metabolism and its underlying molecular mechanism. Methods: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced macrophage foam cells were used as an in vitro model. Apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE?/?) hyperlipidemic mice were used as an in vivo model. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate protein expression. Luciferase reporter assays were used to assess the activity of promoters and transcription factors. Conventional assay kits were used to measure the levels of ADMA, cholesterol, triglycerides, and cytokines. Results: Treatment with oxLDL decreased the protein expression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 (DDAH-2) but not DDAH-1. Incubation with ADMA markedly increased oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophages. ADMA impaired cholesterol efflux following oxLDL challenge and downregulated the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 by interfering with liver X receptor α (LXRα) expression and activity. Additionally, this inhibitory effect of ADMA on cholesterol metabolism was mediated through the activation of the NADPH oxidase/reactive oxygen species pathway. In vivo experiments revealed that chronic administration of ADMA for 4 weeks exacerbated systemic inflammation, decreased the aortic protein levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1, and impaired the capacity of reverse cholesterol transport, ultimately, leading to the progression of atherosclerosis in apoE?/? mice. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the ADMA/DDAH-2 axis plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol metabolism in macrophage foam cells and atherosclerotic progression. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","ABC transporter A1; ABC transporter G1; apolipoprotein E; dimethylargininase; dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1; dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2; liver X receptor alpha; n(g),n(g) dimethylarginine; oxidized low density lipoprotein; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aorta; Article; atherosclerosis; cholesterol metabolism; cholesterol transport; controlled study; down regulation; foam cell; human; human cell; in vivo study; inflammation; lipid storage; macrophage; macrophage foam cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction"

"Survival after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and oesophagectomy versus definitive chemoradiotherapy for patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Background: Whether there is a difference in survival after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery (CRT-S) compared with definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) in patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains controversial. Methods: Patients with SCC who underwent curative treatment from 2008 to 2014 were identified from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Propensity score matching was undertaken to balance pretreatment clinical variables. Overall survival was compared between patients undergoing CRT-S or dCRT. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for overall survival. Results: A total of 5832 patients with clinical stage II and III oesophageal SCC receiving CRT-S (1754) or dCRT (4078) were included. After propensity score matching, each group included 1661 patients. The 3-year overall survival rate for patients treated with CRT-S was 41·1 per cent compared with 17·9 per cent for those who had dCRT (P < 0·001). In multivariable analysis, treatment modality was an independent prognostic factor in the overall cohort before propensity score matching: hazard ratio 0·45 (95 per cent c.i. 0·40 to 0·51) for CRT-S versus dCRT (P < 0·001). In separate analyses of patients with clinical stage II and those with stage III disease, CRT-S was associated with significantly better overall survival than dCRT. Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and oesophagectomy is associated with better overall survival than dCRT in patients with stage II and III oesophageal SCC. ? 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chemoradiotherapy; comparative study; computer assisted radiography; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus resection; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; priority journal; survival rate; tumor localization; tumor volume"
"Current status of congregate meal services for elderly people and self-perceived benefits of the participants by using Taipei City as an example",2019,"Objectives: To investigate the status of congregate meal services and understand the benefits of participation on congregate meal services and the associated factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The participants were the providers and users at congregate meal service sites. We collected data by using stratified proportionate cluster sampling and face-to-face interviews using self-developed structured questionnaire as a tool. Hierarchical linear models were used to identify factors associated with participation. Results: We obtained questionnaire responses from 35 provider (response rate, 94.6%) and 613 user questionnaire (response rate, 69.6%); 89% sites provided services less than 3 days per week. The average scores of self-perceived benefits of users on psychological and social dimensions were higher than the physiological dimensions. Those with higher participation frequency had higher self-perceived benefit scores. In addition, users at the sites providing services more than 3 days per week had higher self-perceived benefit scores. Conclusions: The frequency of participation and that of providing congregate meal services per week are associated with participation benefits. We suggest that Taiwan government to encourage and subsidize congregate meal service sites to increase the service frequency to up to 5 days a week and thus improve the self-perceived benefits of the users. ? 2019 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

"The core pattern of Chinese herbal formulae and drug-herb concurrent usage in patients with dementia",2019,"More than 40% dementia patients received traditional Chinese Medicine treatment. However, the prescription pattern of Chinese herbal formulae (CHF) for treating neurocognitive or behavioral disorders in patients with dementia has not been elucidated. This large-scale survey aimed is to evaluate core patterns of CHF and drug-herb concurrent use in patients with dementia.We analyzed patients with a diagnosis of dementia from one million cohorts of the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in the National Health Insurance Research Database, between 1997 and 2008. Of 18,141 newly diagnosed dementia patients, 3471 patients received CHF for mental and nervous system diseases. There were 13,254 outpatient visits, with 60,968 formulae prescriptions. We calculate the frequency and proportion of combined use, identify drug-herb concurrent usage, and determine core prescription patterns. Also, we drew network graphs of co-prescription pairs which occurred more than 200 times.Chinese medicine prescription patterns changed as dementia progressed.During the first 3 years after the diagnosis of dementia, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Gan-Mai-Da-Zao-Tang, and Ban-Xia-Bai-Zhu-Tian-Ma-Tang were the core CHF prescribed for mental and nervous system disorders. However, during the later stages of dementia, Suan-Zao-Ren-Tang, Gui-Pi-Tang, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, and Wen-Dan-Tang were the core CHF prescribed. Benzodiazepines were the most common sedative drugs combined with traditional Chinese formulae.The results of this study suggest that TCM prescription were different in various stages of dementia, and indicated the frequently combined use of the TCM formulae and Benzodiazepines in dementia care.","antidepressant agent; anxiolytic agent; central nervous system agents; herbaceous agent; kamisyoyo san; neuroleptic agent; nootropic agent; suanzaoren; dementia; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; human; public health; severity of illness index; Taiwan; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Antidepressive Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Central Nervous System Agents; Dementia; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; Humans; National Health Programs; Nootropic Agents; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan"
"Contributions of animal models to the mechanisms and therapies of transthyretin amyloidosis",2019,"Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) is a fatal systemic disease caused by amyloid deposits of misfolded transthyretin, leading to familial amyloid polyneuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy, or a rare oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis. A good model system that mimic the disease phenotype is crucial for the development of drugs and treatments for this devastating degenerative disorder. The present models using fruit flies, worms, rodents, non-human primates and induced pluripotent stem cells have helped researchers understand important disease-related mechanisms and test potential therapeutic options. However, the challenge of creating an ideal model still looms, for these models did not recapitulates all symptoms, particularly neurological presentation, of ATTR amyloidosis. Recently, knock-in techniques was used to generate two humanized ATTR mouse models, leading to amyloid deposition in the nerves and neuropathic manifestation in these models. This review gives a recent update on the milestone, progress, and challenges in developing different models for ATTR amyloidosis research. ? 2019 Ibrahim, Liu, Yeh and Tsai.","transthyretin; amino acid substitution; ATTR amyloidosis; Caenorhabditis elegans; clinical feature; clinical research; Drosophila melanogaster; genotype phenotype correlation; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; inflammation; invertebrate model; liver transplantation; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; primate; protein expression; protein misfolding; Review; thermodynamics"
"Influenza vaccination and risk of respiratory failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A nationwide population-based case-cohort study",2019,"Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disease which causes a considerable disease burden. Patients with COPD are at a higher risk for influenza infection and influenza vaccination are recommended at this high risk patient group. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the association between influenza vaccination and the risk of respiratory failure (RF) in COPD patients. Methods: From 2001 to 2005, patients with newly diagnosed COPD were identified from the NHIRD, and were followed until 2010. We explored the influenza vaccination rate among this COPD cohort. Furthermore, patients who experienced RF were defined as case group, whereas the others were defined as control group. Baseline characteristic were compared and association between influenza vaccination and RF were evaluated. Results: The rate of influenza vaccination was significantly higher in patients age ?65 years than those age <65 years (54.8% vs. 4%, p < 0.001). The vaccine cohort had more comorbidities, more health care utilization and more frequent acute exacerbations as compared with nonvaccine cohort. In multivariable logistic regression, influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of respiratory failure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–0.96). In subgroup analysis, we found that the association was insignificant in patients age <65 years, patients with relatively unstable disease status and patient did not receive influenza vaccination annually. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination was associated with a decreased risk of RF in patients with COPD. Recommendation of annual influenza vaccination should be made when managing this high-risk patient group. ? 2017","bronchodilating agent; influenza vaccine; steroid; influenza vaccine; adult; aged; Article; case control study; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; disease exacerbation; female; health care system; health care utilization; human; influenza vaccination; major clinical study; male; middle aged; respiratory failure; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk reduction; seasonal influenza; Taiwan; very elderly; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; complication; influenza; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; respiratory failure; risk; vaccination; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiratory Insufficiency; Risk; Taiwan; Vaccination"
"A probabilistic model for reducing medication errors: A sensitivity analysis using Electronic Health Records data",2019,"Objectives: Medication-related clinical decision support systems have already been considered as a sophisticated method to improve healthcare quality, however, its importance has not been fully recognized. This paper's aim was to validate an existing probabilistic model that can automatically identify medication errors by performing a sensitivity analysis from electronic medical record data. Methods: We first built a knowledge base that consisted of 2.22 million disease-medication (DM) and 0.78 million medication-medication (MM) associations using Taiwan Health and Welfare data science claims data between January 1st, 2009 and December 31st, 2011. Further, we collected 0.6 million outpatient visit prescriptions from six departments across five different medical centers/hospitals. Afterward, we employed the data to our AESOP model and validated it using a sensitivity analysis of 11 various thresholds (α = [0.5; 1.5]) that were used to identify positive DM and MM associations. We randomly selected 2400 randomly prescriptions and compared them to the gold standard of 18 physicians’ manual review for appropriateness. Results: One hundred twenty-one results of 2400 prescriptions with various thresholds were tested by the AESOP model. Validation against the gold standard showed a high accuracy (over 80%), sensitivity (80–96%), and positive predictive value (over 85%). The negative predictive values ranged from 45 to 75% across three departments, cardiology, neurology, and ophthalmology. Conclusion: We performed a sensitivity analysis and validated the AESOP model in different hospitals. Thus, picking the optimal threshold of the model depended on balancing false negatives with false positives and depending on the specialty and the purpose of the system. ? 2018","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Errors; Hospitals; Knowledge based systems; Medical computing; AESOP; Clinical decision support systems; Electronic health record; Electronic medical record; Medication errors; Negative predictive value; Positive predictive values; Probabilistic modeling; Sensitivity analysis; Article; cardiology; clinical decision support system; electronic health record; false positive result; gastroenterology; gold standard; human; knowledge base; major clinical study; measurement accuracy; medication error; metabolism; neurology; ophthalmology; outpatient care; predictive value; prescription; probability; sensitivity analysis; Taiwan; urology; medication error; prevention and control; statistical model; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Medication Errors; Models, Statistical; Taiwan"
"The dose-response effects of uric acid on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy in healthy individuals",2019,"Background and aim: Hyperuricemia (HUA) is associated with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular risks in various populations. HUA is also able to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in mouse models. However, the dose-response effects of serum uric acid (SUA) on the prevalence of MetS and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are unclear. Methods and results: We retrospectively collected data from 18,932 individuals who underwent an annual health examination between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2016. We excluded those with systemic diseases or missing questionnaires. The primary study endpoints were the prevalence of MetS and LVH, which were defined by the criteria for the Taiwanese population and the “SPRINT” trial. The cohort consisted of 17,913 individuals with a mean age of 31.2 years (SD 7.4) and a mean body mass index of 24.6 kg/m 2 (SD 3.6); 87.1% of the individuals were men. The prevalence rates of HUA, MetS, and LVH were 29.5%, 9.4%, and 0.32%, respectively, in the overall study population. The HUA group was predominantly male and had significantly poorer lifestyle choices and greater laboratory cardiometabolic biomarker values than did the normouricemic group. However, the frequencies of physical activity were comparable between the two groups. After adjusting for confounders, SUA was associated with MetS (OR:1.473, 95% CI:1.408–1.540, P &lt; 0.001) and LVH (OR:1.301, 95% CI:1.064–1.591, P = 0.01). Conclusion: We demonstrated that the dose-response effects of SUA are associated with the prevalence of MetS and electrocardiographic LVH in healthy individuals from Taiwan. Based on this evidence, future studies should investigate urate-lowering therapy and cardiovascular benefits in individuals with HUA (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03473951). ? 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","alanine aminotransferase; biological marker; C reactive protein; cholesterol; creatinine; glucose; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; uric acid; uric acid; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; blood pressure; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; dose response; dyslipidemia; electrocardiography; female; glomerulus filtration rate; gout; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; human; hypertension; hyperuricemia; incidence; kidney function; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; mortality; normal human; physical activity; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; systolic blood pressure; uric acid blood level; waist circumference; blood; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; hyperuricemia; metabolic syndrome X; predictive value; prevalence; risk assessment; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Biomarkers; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Hyperuricemia; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Uric Acid; Young Adult"
"Incidence of soft tissue sarcoma in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study (2007–2013)",2019,"Background: Asian studies on soft tissue sarcoma (STS) incidence, irrespective of the primary site, are scant. Methods: STS data were acquired from the population-based 2007–2013 Taiwan Cancer Registry of the Health and Welfare Data Science Center, Taiwan. Histological subtype-, site-, sex-, and age-specific STS incidence rates were analyzed according to the 2013 classification of the World Health Organization. Results: In total, 11,393 patients with an age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 5.62 (95% confidence interval, 5.51–5.73) per 100,000 person-years were identified. Overall, a male predominance (sex-standardized incidence rate ratio, 1.2) was noted, and the rate increased with age, peaking at >75 years. Approximately 30% of STSs occurred in connective, subcutaneous, and other soft tissues and 70% in other sites. In addition to connective, subcutaneous, and other soft tissues, the three most common primary sites were the stomach (15.9%), skin (14.3%), and small intestines (10.5%). Gastrointestinal stromal tumor was the most common subtype (29.2%; ASIR, 1.55/100,000 person-years), followed by liposarcoma (11.5%; ASIR, 0.63/100,000 person-years) and leiomyosarcoma (9.7%; ASIR, 0.53/100,000 person-years). Compared with relevant data from Western countries, the incidence rate of angiosarcomas was higher than that in other regions, whereas the incidence rates of leiomyosarcoma and Kaposi sarcoma were lower than those in other regions. Conclusion: STS incidence varied by histological subtype, sex, age, and primary site in an Asian population. Our results suggested regional and racial discrepancies in the incidence rates of certain STS subtypes. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","angiosarcoma; Article; cancer incidence; cancer patient; colon; esophagus; Ewing sarcoma; female; gastrointestinal stromal tumor; histopathology; human; Kaposi sarcoma; leiomyosarcoma; liposarcoma; major clinical study; male; observational study; priority journal; rectum; retrospective study; rhabdomyosarcoma; skin; small intestine; soft tissue sarcoma; stomach; synovial sarcoma; Taiwan"
"CXCL2/CXCR2 axis induces cancer stem cell characteristics in CPT-11-resistant LoVo colon cancer cells via Gαi-2 and Gαq/11",2019,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) exist in colon cancer and exhibit characteristics of stem cells which are due to lineages of tissues where they arise. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-undergoing cancer cells display CSC properties and therapeutic resistance. Cancer and stromal cells comprise of a tumor microenvironment. One way the two populations communicate with each other is to secret CXC ligands (CXCLs). CXCLs are capable of causing chemotaxis of specific types of stromal cells and control angiogenesis. Double immunofluorescence, western blot analysis, and colony-formation assay were carried out to compare parental and CPT-11-resistant LoVo cells. CPT-11-R LoVo colon cancer cells showed increased expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL8. They displayed significantly increased intracellular protein levels of CXCL2 and CXCR2. CPT-11-R LoVo cells showed significantly elevated expression in aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24), cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). CXCL2 knockdown by short hairpin RNA resulted in reduced expression of CSC proteins, cyclins, EMT markers, G proteins, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Finally, Gαi-2 was found to promote expression of CSC genes and tumorigenesis which were more apparent in the resistant cells. In addition, Gαq/11 showed a similar pattern with exceptions of EpCAM and MMP9. Therefore, CXCL2–CXCR2 axis mediates through Gαi-2 and Gαq/11 to promote tumorigenesis and contributes to CSC properties of CPT-11-R LoVo cells. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1; cell protein; chemokine receptor CXCR2; cluster of differentiation 24 protein; cluster of differentiation 44 protein; CXCL1 chemokine; CXCL2 chemokine; CXCL3 chemokine; CXCL9 chemokine; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; epithelial derived neutrophil activating factor 78; g alpha i 2 protein; g alpha q 11 protein; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; guanine nucleotide binding protein; interleukin 8; irinotecan; lentivirus vector; matrix metalloproteinase; messenger RNA; protein; short hairpin RNA; small interfering RNA; stromal cell derived factor 1; unclassified drug; angiogenesis; Article; cancer stem cell; carcinogenesis; cell motility; colon cancer; colony formation; endothelium cell; genetic transfection; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; immunofluorescence microscopy; LoVo cell line; mRNA expression level; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; transient transfection; tumor microenvironment; Western blotting"
"Clinical significance of human cytomegalovirus viruria and the effect of antiviral therapy in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients",2019,"Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised host. The clinical significance of asymptomatic CMV viruria in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains unclear. This study aims to clarify whether antiviral therapy is associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Methods: HSCT recipients whose urine was culture-positive for CMV were retrospectively reviewed and followed. Viruria episodes were divided according to whether or not antiviral therapy was used. Mortality and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 2 years following CMV viruria were compared between patients with and without antiviral therapy. Results: Sixty-two episodes of culture-proven asymptomatic CMV viruria were identified in 28 HSCT recipients. Antiviral therapy was used in 35 (56.5%) and spared in 27 (43.5%) viruric episodes. Compared with the baselines, there were no significant difference in the decrements of eGFR between the two groups at the end the 1st year (4.78 vs 5.02 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.968) and the 2nd year (1.13 vs 7.66 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.276). Antiviral therapy for asymptomatic CMV viruria was also not associated with a favorable survival (p = 0.288). On the other hand, presence of CMV viremia correlated with a poorer survival (2-year mortality rate 60% vs 13.33%, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Antiviral therapy for asymptomatic CMV viruria is not associated with a clear clinical benefit in HSCT recipients. Further studies may be needed to identify if specific patient populations may benefit from antiviral therapy in CMV viruria. ? 2017","cyclosporine; dexamethasone; ganciclovir; prednisolone; valganciclovir; antivirus agent; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; adult; antiviral therapy; aplastic anemia; Article; asymptomatic infection; brain hemorrhage; clinical article; clinical outcome; controlled study; cytomegalovirus infection; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; embryonal carcinoma; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; graft recipient; graft versus host reaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; Human cytomegalovirus; immunosuppressive treatment; invasive aspergillosis; kidney function; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multiple myeloma; myelodysplastic syndrome; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nonhuman; out of hospital cardiac arrest; Pneumocystis pneumonia; pneumonia; retrospective study; survival rate; testis carcinoma; urine culture; viremia; virus culture; virus load; asymptomatic infection; comparative study; Cytomegalovirus; cytomegalovirus infection; drug effect; glomerulus filtration rate; graft recipient; isolation and purification; mortality; urine; viremia; virology; young adult; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Asymptomatic Infections; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Transplant Recipients; Urine; Viral Load; Viremia; Young Adult"
"Clinical significance of J wave in prediction of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with acute myocardial infarction",2019,"Background: J wave syndrome and myocardial ischemia are related with malignant ventricular arrhythmia (VA). The characteristics of dynamic J wave in patients with early phase of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and subsequent VA or electrical storm (ES) have not been well evaluated. Objective: We investigated the utility of J wave in the prediction of VA and ES in patients within the early phase of AMI. Methods: This study retrospectively enrolled 208 patients (mean age 69 ± 15 years, 171 males) with AMI. Of them, 50 patients had experienced VA during hospitalization and 24 had ES. The clinical and electrocardiographic characteristics of these patients with and without VA were compared. Results: Patients with VA had a higher incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and J wave compared with those without VA. The hazard ratio (HR) of J wave for VA was 4.31 (p < 0.01) and CKD was 2.64 (p < 0.01). In the VA group, ES patients had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) (HR 2.73, p = 0.02) and J wave (HR 4.21, p < 0.01). If the AMI patients had J wave, the OR for mortality was 2.14 (p = 0.03), VA events was 6.23 (p < 0.01), and ES events was 12.15 (p < 0.01). If VA patients had J wave, the mortality rate will significantly increase (OR 68.62, p = 0.01). Conclusion: The AMI patients who develop VA in the early phase of AMI had a higher incidence of J wave and CKD, and those who develop ES had a higher incidence of J wave and DM. It seems that J wave in AMI patients is a poor prognostic factor, and we found that J wave will increase mortality, VA events, and ES events. The majority locations of J wave were inferior leads although there was no relationship between the locations and VA incidence. If the VA patients had inferior or lateral J wave, it would further increase the risk of mortality. ? 2018 Japanese College of Cardiology","acute heart infarction; aged; Article; cardiovascular mortality; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; electrocardiogram; electrocardiography; female; follow up; heart ventricle arrhythmia; hospitalization; human; incidence; J wave; major clinical study; male; medical record review; observational study; prediction; QRS interval; retrospective study"
"Synergistic effect of low handgrip strength and malnutrition on 4-year all-cause mortality in older males: A prospective longitudinal cohort study",2019,"Background: No studies have yet examined the interrelationship of malnutrition and low handgrip strength in terms of mortality. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential synergistic effects of malnutrition and low handgrip strength on mortality among older adults living in a retirement community. Methods: This prospective longitudinal cohort study recruited subjects aged 65 years and over from a veterans care home in Taiwan in 2013. Nutritional status was assessed using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF, malnutrition was MNA-SF<12); muscle strength was measured by handgrip strength (low handgrip strength was handgrip strength <26 kg). The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test was used to estimate survival differences between groups and Cox proportional regression model was used to estimate the adjusted difference in 4-year all-cause mortality between groups. Results: Recruited for the present study were 333 male participants (mean age 85.4 ± 5.7 years). Of these, 50.2% had malnutrition and 54.7% had low handgrip strength. Compared with subjects with no malnutrition and low handgrip strength, those with malnutrition had significantly greater risk of 4-year all-cause mortality (adjusted hazards ratio: 2.05, 95% confident interval [CI]: 1.04–4.01); hazard ratio increased to 3.41 (95% CI 1.93–6.04) for those with both malnutrition and low handgrip strength. Conclusions: Malnutrition was an independent risk factor for 4-year all-cause mortality and low handgrip strength with malnutrition synergistically increased the mortality risk. Further study is needed to confirm the effectiveness of integrated programs to assist those at risk. ? 2019","aged; all cause mortality; Article; cohort analysis; community living; confidence interval; controlled study; disease association; geriatric patient; grip strength; hazard ratio; human; Kaplan Meier method; log rank test; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; mortality risk; muscle strength; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prospective study; retirement; survival; Taiwan; very elderly; veteran"

"Hemodialysis interval and its association with emergency care and mortality: A nationwide population-based cohort study",2019,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) incidence in Taiwan is highest worldwide. This study analyzed the relationship between health resource use and patients on hemodialysis (HD) asking for medical help as well as the outcomes in Taiwan.This was a retrospective cohort study that analyzed the medical data of patients on dialysis, which were collected from the National Health Insurance Database of Taiwan for the period 2000 to 2010. The study sample was screened out, and new patients starting HD from 2001 to 2005 were considered.The daily distribution of patients with ESRD in the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (MWF) and Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday (TTS) groups who underwent emergent HD showed remarkable person-time on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. The disease (complication) distribution in the MWF group was higher than that in the TTS group, and the statistics of heart-failure-associated diseases were significantly different. Considering 5-year survival status, the mortality rate of patients with HD was 21.94% (255 of 1162), among which those with a history of cerebrovascular disease and diabetes were 68.63% and 72.16%, respectively.Long interdialytic intervals may induce emergency dialysis. Therefore, the frequency of emergent HD therapy has increased (thrice a week), as predicted in the current HD policy.","chronic kidney failure; emergency health service; female; follow up; hemodialysis; human; male; middle aged; mortality; procedures; retrospective study; Taiwan; time factor; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Dialysis; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Time Factors"
"Efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of daclatasvir, asunaprevir plus ribavirin for HCV genotype-1b infection without NS5A resistance-associated substitutions",2019,"Background/Purpose: Treatment with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) for 24 weeks provided a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of over 90% in hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV-1b) infected patients without non-structural 5A (NS5A) resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at the L31 and Y93 sites. In this study, we investigated whether adding ribavirin to the DCV + ASV combination could shorten the original treatment regimen to 12 weeks without compromising the treatment efficacy for HCV-1b patients without NS5A RASs. Methods: In the prospective, open-label, single-arm, nationwide multi-center phase III study, a total of 70 interferon-na?ve or interferon-experienced HCV-1b patients without baseline L31/Y93 RASs received daclatasvir (60 mg/day) and asunaprevir (100 mg twice daily) plus weight-based ribavirin (1000–1200 mg/day) for 12 weeks, with a 12-week post-treatment follow-up. The primary end-point was the rate of undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Results: The SVR12 rate was 97.1% (68/70) and 100% (68/68) in the full-analysis-set and the per-protocol population, respectively. None of the 68 patients who completed the 12-week treatment experienced relapse during post-treatment follow-up. Two patients withdrew from the study at treatment days 21 and 34 due to anorexia and fatigue, which were considered ribavirin-related and resolved post medication cessation. A total of 4 serious adverse events were reported and considered treatment-unrelated. No deaths or grade 4 adverse events requiring hospitalization was observed throughout the study. Conclusion: Truncated regimen of DCV + ASV plus ribavirin for 12 weeks was highly effective and safe in HCV-1b patients without NS5A L31/Y93 RAS. ? 2018","asunaprevir; bilirubin; daclatasvir; hemoglobin; nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor; ribavirin; virus RNA; antivirus agent; asunaprevir; BMS-790052; imidazole derivative; isoquinoline derivative; NS-5 protein, hepatitis C virus; ribavirin; sulfonamide; viral protein; acute pyelonephritis; adult; age; anemia; appendicitis; Article; depression; dizziness; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug safety; dyspnea; fatigue; female; follow up; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; heart palpitation; hepatitis C; hepatitis C genotype 1b infection; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1b; hepatitis C virus subtype 1b infection; human; hyperbilirubinemia; insomnia; liver cirrhosis; male; middle aged; multicenter study; open study; phase 3 clinical trial; pneumonia; prospective study; pruritus; rash; relapse; treatment duration; treatment response; upper respiratory tract infection; ureter stone; virus load; aged; antiviral resistance; blood; chronic hepatitis C; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; genetics; Hepacivirus; sustained virologic response; Taiwan; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Drug Resistance, Viral; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Imidazoles; Isoquinolines; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Ribavirin; RNA, Viral; Sulfonamides; Sustained Virologic Response; Taiwan; Viral Nonstructural Proteins"
"Androgen deprivation therapy and the risk of tenosynovitis in prostate cancer patients",2019,"Objectives: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) use in prostate cancer (PCa) patients has been reported to have an association with rheumatoid arthritis. We aimed to assess the impact of ADT on the subsequent risk of tenosynovitis. Methods: Using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan between 2001 and 2013, 3309 patients with PCa were identified. Among them, 729 ADT patients comprised the study group with 729 matched non-ADT controls. We used a 1:1 propensity score matched analysis. The demographic characteristics and comorbidities of the patients were analyzed; Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of tenosynovitis. Results: There were 224 (15.3%) patients with newly diagnosed tenosynovitis. Compared with non-ADT patients, ADT patients had a lower risk of subsequent tenosynovitis with an adjusted HR of 0.38 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28–0.51; P < 0.001]. Conclusions: ADT use apparently did not increase the risk of tenosynovitis in patients with PCa.

"Utilization and safety of percutaneous lung biopsy: A 10-year nationwide population-based study",2019,"Percutaneous lung biopsy is a technique used for sampling peripherally located lung masses and has been gaining in popularity. However, its exact utilization is unknown, and its safety has not been well studied. The current study aimed to assess the trend of utilization and study the safety of this procedure. Using the National Health Insurance Research Database, we retrospectively determined the total number of procedures that were performed on subjects older than 20 years between 2001 and 2010. We also estimated the rates of major complications, such as pneumothorax, requiring intercostal drainage. A total of 630 percutaneous biopsies were performed in 2001, while 3814 were performed in 2010, representing a 6.1-fold increase. The compound annual growth rate was 22.1%. The number of hospitals that performed the procedure increased from 55 to 99. Pneumothorax requiring drainage occurred in 1.5% of the procedures. The factors associated with a higher complication rate included male gender, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rural hospital, and low-volume hospital. Percutaneous lung biopsies are a relatively safe procedure, and their performance has been rapidly increasing. The number of procedures performed by a hospital was associated with the complication rate. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The relationship between musical preferences and Type D personality",2019,"Emotion regulation is one of the main reasons that people listen to music, and personality traits have been shown to exert significant influence in shaping musical preferences. Type D personality is a psychological risk factor for adverse health outcomes. However, no music studies have yet examined the effect of Type D personality on musical preferences, which may provide some preliminary insight into clinical applications. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between Type D personality and musical preferences. An online survey investigating musical preferences (Revised version of the Short Test of Musical Preferences [STOMP-R]) and Type D personality was administered. In total, 196 participants completed the survey, of which half were from an Eastern culture and half from a Western culture. Forty per cent of the participants were categorised as having Type D personality, and no significant association of gender or nationality with Type D classification was observed. However, the links between Type D personality and the Punk genre (p =.047), and between non-Type D personality and the Jazz genre (p =.008) were indicated. Moreover, differences were observed in the factor structure of STOMP-R. The exploratory results facilitate the understanding of links between personality traits and music listening and provide new insight into musical preference dimensions. ? The Author(s) 2017.",""
"Human papillomavirus infection and anal cytology in Taiwanese homosexual men with and without HIV infection",2019,"Introduction: Anal cancer screening has not been adopted by Taiwanese care providers. The study aim was to explore the differences of anal cytology and HPV detection among men with and without HIV. Methodology: In this case-control study, men with HIV who attended one of the outpatient clinics of Taoyuan General Hospital were enrolled as cases. Men who had experienced condomless sex and tested HIV negative were enrolled as controls. Anal swabs were collected for thin-preparation anal cytology and HPV genotyping. Results: A total of 288 men who had tested positive for HIV and 208 who had tested HIV negative were enrolled; 75% of subjects with HIV and 30.3% of those without HIV had tested positive for various types of HPV (P < 0.001). Anal cell dysplasia, including atypical squamous cells with undetermined significance (ASCUS), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), or atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H), were noted in 20.8% of men with HIV and 4.8% of those without HIV (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, HIV serostatus, history of sexually transmitted infections, having male sexual partners, and practice of anal sex were correlated significantly with detection of any type of HPV. Additionally, both oncogenic and non-oncogenic HPV types were significantly associated with anal cytology dysplasia. Conclusions: We strongly suggest that there should be awareness of anal HPV infection and related anal cellular dysplasia in at-risk populations. ? 2019 Wang et al.","Human immunodeficiency virus antibody; low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; unclassified drug; adult; anus cancer; Article; atypical squamous cell with undetermined significance; atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cytology; dysplasia; genotype; high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; homosexual male; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; marriage; men who have sex with men; nonhuman; Papanicolaou test; papillomavirus infection; questionnaire; serodiagnosis; sexually transmitted disease; smoking; squamous cell; viral disease CLIA; Western blotting"
"A new ALBI-based model to predict survival after transarterial chemoembolization for BCLC stage B hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Background & Aims: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a standard treatment for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the outcome varied. This study aimed to develop a model to predict the outcome of TACE in HCC patients. Methods: Consecutive 570 treatment-na?ve BCLC stage B HCC patients undergoing TACE as the initial treatment from 2007 to 2016 were retrospectively enrolled. Factors associated with survival were analysed. Patients undergoing TACE from 2007 to 2011 constituted the training cohort (n?=?293), while patients undergoing TACE from 2012 to 2016 constituted the validation cohort (n?=?277). Homogeneity and corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) were compared between each prognostic model. Results: A total of 1796 TACE sessions were performed for the 570 patients during the median follow-up period of 18.3?months. By multivariate analysis, beyond up-to-11 criteria (hazard ratio [HR]?=?1.694, P?<.001), alpha-foetoprotein >200?ng/mL (HR?=?1.771, P?<.001) and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2 or 3 (HR?=?1.817, P?<.001) were independent predictors of overall survival (OS) in the training cohort. An ALBI-TAE model based on the three independent predictors of OS from the training cohort was developed to classify HCC patients into four subgroups. The performance of the ALBI-TAE model was superior to other prognostic models with lowest AICc values and highest homogeneity in both the training and validation datasets as well as the overall cohort. Conclusions: Albumin-bilirubin grade is an important factor associated with survival in BCLC stage B HCC patients undergoing TACE. ALBI-TAE model can be applied to select patients who can get most benefit from TACE. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Alterations of oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates by glutamine in PBMCs of SLE patients",2019,"We evaluated plasma glutamine levels and basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (mOCR B ) and basal extracellular acidification rate (ECAR B ) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) patients and healthy controls (HCs). Lower plasma glutamine levels correlated with higher SLE disease activity indexes (p = 0.025). Incubated in DMEM containing 100 mg/dL glucose, SLE-PBMCs displayed lower mOCR B (p = 0.018) but similar ECAR B (p = 0.467) to those of HC-PBMCs, and their mOCR B got elevated (p &lt; 0.001) without altering ECAR B (p = 0.239) by supplementation with 2 or 4 mM glutamine. We conclude that impaired mitochondrial respiration of SLE-PBMCs could be improved by glutamine under euglycemic condition. ? 2018","glucose; glutamine; glutamine; acidification; adult; amino acid blood level; Article; cell metabolism; comparative study; controlled study; correlational study; disease activity; disease association; extracellular matrix; female; gene dosage; glycolysis; human; human cell; male; middle aged; mitochondrial respiration; molecular pathology; oxygen consumption; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; systemic lupus erythematosus; aged; blood; chemistry; cohort analysis; metabolism; mitochondrion; mononuclear cell; pathology; plasma; systemic lupus erythematosus; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Glutamine; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Middle Aged; Mitochondria; Oxygen Consumption; Plasma"
"Assessment of Deep Learning Using Nonimaging Information and Sequential Medical Records to Develop a Prediction Model for Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer",2019,"Importance: A prediction model for new-onset nonmelanoma skin cancer could enhance prevention measures, but few patient data-driven tools exist for more accurate prediction. Objective: To use machine learning to develop a prediction model for incident nonmelanoma skin cancer based on large-scale, multidimensional, nonimaging medical information. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used a database comprising 2 million randomly sampled patients from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2013. A total of 1829 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer as their first diagnosed cancer and 7665 random controls without cancer were included in the analysis. A convolutional neural network, a deep learning approach, was used to develop a risk prediction model. This risk prediction model used 3-year clinical diagnostic information, medical records, and temporal-sequential information to predict the skin cancer risk of a given patient within the next year. Stepwise feature selection was also performed to investigate important and determining factors of the model. Statistical analysis was performed from November 1, 2016, to October 31, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results: A total of 1829 patients (923 women [50.5%] and 906 men [49.5%]; mean [SD] age, 65.3 [15.7] years) with nonmelanoma skin cancer and 7665 random controls without cancer (3951 women [51.5%] and 3714 men [48.4%]; mean [SD] age, 47.5 [17.3] years) were included in the analysis. The 1-year incident nonmelanoma skin cancer risk prediction model using sequential diagnostic information and drug prescription information as a time-incorporated feature matrix could attain an AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.87-0.91), with a mean (SD) sensitivity of 83.1% (3.5%) and mean (SD) specificity of 82.3% (4.1%). Carcinoma in situ of skin (AUROC, 0.867; -2.80% loss) and other chronic comorbidities (eg, degenerative osteopathy [AUROC, 0.872; -2.32% loss], hypertension [AUROC, 0.879; -1.53% loss], and chronic kidney insufficiency [AUROC, 0.879; -1.52% loss]) served as more discriminative factors for the prediction. Medications such as trazodone, acarbose, systemic antifungal agents, statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and thiazide diuretics were the top-ranking discriminative features in the model; each led to more than a 1% decrease of the AUROC when eliminated individually (eg, trazodone AUROC, 0.868; -2.67% reduction; acarbose AUROC, 0.870; -2.50 reduction; and systemic antifungal agents AUROC, 0.875; -1.99 reduction). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that a risk prediction model may have potential predictive factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer. This model may help health care professionals target high-risk populations for more intensive skin cancer preventive methods. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Divalproex and its effect on suicide risk in bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis of multinational observational studies",2019,"Background: Divalproex has become the most prevalent mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder. However, little is known its effects in the prevention of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder, and recent FDA announcement indicated an increased risk of suicidality when using anti-epileptic agents such as divalproex. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of divalproex on suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder. Methods: A search strategy was used for the PubMed, Embase, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, ClinicalKey, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov until June 13th, 2018. Peer-reviewed observationally clinical studies in humans, investigating the association of divalproex and suicidality in patients with bipolar disorder were included. A random-effects meta-analysis was implemented to calculate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for suicidality among patients receiving divalproex and those without. Results: Total 6 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in the incidence rates (reported as [RR]; 95% CI) of suicide attempts (0.921; 0.383–2.215) or completed suicides (0.607; 0.180–2.043) between participants receiving divalproex vs. no medication. There was no significant difference in the incidence rates of suicide attempts (0.815; 0.453–1.466) or completed suicides (1.009; 0.410–2.484) between participants receiving divalproex and carbamazepine. Limitations: The significantly heterogeneous sample sources and study design amount the included trials. Conclusions: Treatment with divalproex did not reduce or increase the incidence of suicide-related events in patients with bipolar disorder. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","carbamazepine; valproate semisodium; tranquilizer; valproic acid; Article; bipolar disorder; clinical outcome; drug effect; follow up; human; incidence; mental patient; meta analysis; observational study; priority journal; psychopharmacotherapy; suicide; suicide attempt; systematic review; bipolar disorder; international cooperation; observational study; statistics and numerical data; suicide; Antimanic Agents; Bipolar Disorder; Humans; Internationality; Observational Studies as Topic; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted; Valproic Acid"
"Progression risk stratification of asymptomatic Waldenstr?m macroglobulinemia",2019,"BACKGROUND Waldenstr?m macroglobulinemia (WM) is preceded by asymptomatic WM (AWM), for which the risk of progression to overt disease is not well defined. METHODS We studied 439 patients with AWM, who were diagnosed and observed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between 1992 and 2014. RESULTS During the 23-year study period, with a median follow-up of 7.8 years, 317 patients progressed to symptomatic WM (72%). Immunoglobulin M 4,500 mg/dL or greater, bone marrow lymphoplasmacytic infiltration 70% or greater, b2-microglobulin 4.0 mg/dL or greater, and albumin 3.5 g/dL or less were all identified as independent predictors of disease progression. To assess progression risk in patients with AWM, we trained and cross-validated a proportional hazards model using bone marrow infiltration, immunoglobulin M, albumin, and beta-2 microglobulin values as continuous measures. The model divided the cohort into three distinct risk groups: a high-risk group with a median time to progression (TTP) of 1.8 years, an intermediate-risk group with a median TTP of 4.8 years, and a low-risk group with a median TTP of 9.3 years. We validated this model in two external cohorts, demonstrating robustness and generalizability. For clinical applicability, we made the model available as a Web page application (www.awmrisk.com). By combining two cohorts, we were powered to identify wild type MYD88 as an independent predictor of progression (hazard ratio, 2.7). CONCLUSION This classification system is positioned to inform patient monitoring and care and, for the first time to our knowledge, to identify patients with high-risk AWM who may need closer follow-up or benefit from early intervention. ? 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology","albumin; beta 2 microglobulin; creatinine; hemoglobin; immunoglobulin kappa chain; immunoglobulin lambda chain; immunoglobulin M; lactate dehydrogenase; M protein; myeloid differentiation factor 88; adult; aged; anemia; Article; asymptomatic disease; blood viscosity; bone marrow; cancer patient; cancer survival; cause of death; cohort analysis; death certificate; disease association; disease course; disease exacerbation; disease specific survival; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; evidence based practice; family history; female; follow up; gene mutation; high risk patient; high risk population; human; intermediate risk population; leukocyte; low risk population; lymphocyte count; lymphocytic infiltration; major clinical study; male; medical record review; patient assessment; patient care; patient monitoring; patient risk; platelet count; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; proportional hazards model; risk factor; very elderly; Waldenstroem macroglobulinemia"
"Beyond health care: Volunteer work, social participation, and late-life general cognitive status in Taiwan",2019,"Significance: In addition to the complexity associated with health care coverage and its utilization by older people, I hypothesize that social engagement promotes a better later-life general cognitive status beyond health care availability as is provided by Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI)system. The present study thus explores whether social engagement, specifically social participation and volunteer work, is independently associated with later-life general cognitive status after adjusting for health service utilization among older Taiwanese via the NHI system. Methods: Using a population-based natural experiment study design, data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA, 1993–2007)was analyzed. Mixed-effects models were conducted to estimate the relative effects of volunteer work, social participation, and NHI on general cognitive status over time, while taking health status, medical care utilization, community development, and social support into consideration. Results: The multivariate findings showed that a better general cognitive status is significantly associated with being actively involved in volunteer work (β = 0.14, p < 0.01)and social participation (β = 0.14, p < 0.01). In addition, NHI is also significantly associated with a higher level of general cognitive status (β = 0.10, p < 0.01). Discussion: This investigation suggests that social engagement has significant impacts on late-life general cognitive status, even taking into account the NHI system and its related utilization effects. The results highlight the importance of volunteer work and social participation among older Taiwanese because such social involvement produces a positive effect on their general cognitive status beyond health care itself. Furthermore, the contribution of productive activities to enhance late-life cognitive health is underscored. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","aging; cognition; health care; health insurance; health status; social participation; adult; aging; article; controlled study; female; health care utilization; health status; human; human experiment; longitudinal study; male; medical care; national health insurance; social participation; social support; Taiwan; volunteer; Taiwan"
"A positive legacy of trauma? A study on the impact of natural disasters on medical utilization",2019,"Objective: The impact of natural disasters on medical utilization is largely unknown and often overlooked how it affects bereaving and non-bereaving survivors. The aim of this study is to determine the medical utilization between both survivor groups and long-term effects. Study design: A 10-year 1999-2009 population-based retrospective study by using the National Health Insurance claim database and the Household Registration database from the Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan. Settings: Taiwan 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake-affected areas. Participants: A total of 49 834 individuals which included 1183 bereaving survivors and 48 651 non-bereaving earthquake survivors. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measures: Medical utilization of bereaving and non-bereaving survivors. Results: The results showed that bereaving survivors had significantly more outpatient visits before the earthquake, within 3-month period and 1 year after earthquake (odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, 1.16 and 1.08). However, after 1 year after earthquake their outpatient visits were not significantly different from non-bereaving, and even significantly less in some years. Inpatient visits of bereaving survivors had similar trend to outpatient visits, i.e. visits were more both before earthquake and within 3-month period after earthquake (OR = 1.59 and 1.89), however, they were not significantly higher than non-bereaving survivors for the following years of the study. Conclusion: Our study reveals that compared to non-bereaving survivors, bereaving survivors slightly had higher medical utilization in the beginning stage of earthquake, i.e. for the first 3-month period or 1 year after earthquake. However, there were no differences between these two groups in medical utilization including outpatient and inpatient visits in long run. ? 2018 The Author(s).","adolescent; adult; aged; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; earthquake; female; health care cost; health care utilization; human; inpatient visit; major clinical study; male; natural disaster; outpatient care; patient care; population research; priority journal; retrospective study; Review; survivor; Taiwan; trend study; bereavement; earthquake; epidemiology; health service; hospitalization; middle aged; natural disaster; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bereavement; Child; Earthquakes; Female; Health Services; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Natural Disasters; Retrospective Studies; Survivors; Taiwan"
"Tumor stem-like cell-derived exosomal RNAs prime neutrophils for facilitating tumorigenesis of colon cancer",2019,"Background: Cell-cell interactions maintain tissue homeostasis and contribute to dynamic alteration of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Communication between cancer and host cells not only promotes advanced disease aggression but also determines therapeutic response in cancer patients. Despite accumulating evidence supporting the role of tumor-infiltrating immunocytes in modulating tumor immunity, the interplay between heterogeneous tumor subpopulations and immunocytes is elusive. Methods: We expanded colorectal cancer stem cells (CRCSCs) as cancer spheroids from the murine colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line CT26 to interrogate tumor-host interactions using a syngeneic tumor model. RNA-sequencing analysis of host cells and tumor exosomes was performed to identify molecular determinants that mediate the crosstalk between CRCSCs and immunocytes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to validate the clinical significance in CRC patients. Results: The expanded CT26 cancer spheroids showed increased stemness gene expression, enhanced spheroid and clonogenicity potential, and an elevated tumor-initiating ability, characteristic of CRCSCs. By examining immune cell composition in syngeneic tumor-bearing mice, a systemic increase in CD11b + /Ly6G High /Ly6C Low neutrophils was observed in mice bearing CRCSC-derived tumors. An increased secretion of CRCSC exosomes was observed in vitro, and through in vivo tracking, CRCSC exosomes were found to be transported to the bone marrow. Moreover, CRCSC exosomes prolonged the survival of bone marrow-derived neutrophils and engendered a protumoral phenotype in neutrophils. Mechanistically, tumor exosomal tri-phosphate RNAs induced the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) through a pattern recognition-NF-κB signaling axis to sustain neutrophil survival. CRCSC-secreted CXCL1 and CXCL2 then attracted CRCSC-primed neutrophils to promote tumorigenesis of CRC cells via IL-1β. Moreover, neutrophil depletion using a Ly6G-specific antibody (clone 1A8) attenuated the tumorigenicity of CRCSCs. In human specimens, CRC patients exhibiting an active CRCSC signal (Snail + IL8 + ) showed elevated tumor infiltration of MPO + neutrophils, and high (in the top 10%) MPO expression predicted poor survival of CRC patients. Conclusions: This study elucidates a multistep CRCSC-neutrophil interaction during advanced cancer progression. Strategies targeting aberrant neutrophil activation may be developed for combating CSC-related malignancy. ? 2019 The Author(s).","CD11b antigen; CXCL1 chemokine; CXCL2 chemokine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 8; RNA; transcription factor Snail; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone marrow cell; cancer infiltration; cancer stem cell; cancer survival; cell composition; cell survival; clonogenesis; colon cancer; colon carcinogenesis; controlled study; exosome; gene expression; host interaction; immunocompetent cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; infant; mouse; neutrophil; nonhuman; phenotype; protein expression; RNA sequence; signal transduction; tumor spheroid"
"Maternal pregnancy-induced hypertension increases the subsequent risk of neonatal candidiasis: A nationwide population-based cohort study",2019,"Objective: Neonatal candidiasis is a leading infectious cause of significant morbidity and mortality in premature birth mainly due to impaired physical barriers and immature immune system of fetus. Maternal pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) has been reported to be able to disturb the neonatal immune system, which could cause the increased possibility of neonatal infection. Therefore, we hypothesized that maternal PIH may increase the risk of neonatal candidiasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether PIH increased the risk of neonatal candidiasis and identify the predictive risk factors. Materials and methods: Patients with newly diagnosed PIH between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013 were selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). For each patient in the PIH cohort, 4 subjects without PIH, matched for age and year of delivery, were randomly selected as the comparison cohort. A Cox proportional regression model was used to estimate the risks of neonatal candidiasis in both cohorts. Results: Among the 23.3 million individuals registered in the NHIRD, 29,013 patients with PIH and 116,052 matched controls were identified. Patients with PIH had a higher incidence of neonatal candidiasis than did those without PIH. According to the multivariate analysis, PIH (odds ratio [OR] = 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11–3.19, p < 0.0228), single parity (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.00–3.65, p < 0.0499), and preterm birth (OR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.84–6.93, p = 0.0002) were independent risk factors for the development of neonatal candidiasis. Conclusion: Patients who had a history of PIH was associated with an increased risk of having infants who develop neonatal candidiasis compared with those without PIH. Additionally, preterm birth was an independent risk factor for the development of neonatal candidiasis. ? 2019","adult; Article; candidiasis; cerebrovascular disease; cesarean section; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; comparative study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; female; human; infection risk; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; neonatal candidiasis; parity; premature labor; retrospective study; candidiasis; case control study; extremely low birth weight; factual database; health survey; immunology; maternal hypertension; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; proportional hazards model; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Adult; Candidiasis; Case-Control Studies; Cesarean Section; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight; Infant, Extremely Premature; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature, Diseases; Parity; Population Surveillance; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Drafting eligible biotech and immunotherapy claims",2019,"The very recent US Supreme Court and Court of Appeals for Federal Circuit (CAFC) cases have dramatically changed the standard of patent eligibility. Several groundbreaking innovations were thus determined to be patent ineligible. The patent ineligibility would impact on the innovation s of the field of biomarkers, diagnostic methods and personalize cancer immunotherapy. To solve the thorny problem of eligibility, this study retrospectively analyzes all CAFC related cases and presents a flow chart determining patent eligibility based on the courts’ decisions. Our analysis indicates the best way to avoid eligible rejection or invalidation is that an invention cannot fall within the categories of natural law, natural phenomenon or abstract idea. Thus, claiming non-natural cDNA, involving a step to grow a transformed cell or adding a means clause in a method claim would be some possible solutions. Moreover, based on the flow chart, even though a claim with substantive limitation but not well-understood, routine or conventional activities would be patent eligible; no one has successfully made the argument in the CAFC so far. We believe that this flow chart can serve as a set of guidelines for determining patent eligibility. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","BRCA1 protein; complementary DNA; programmed death 1 ligand 1; administrative claims (health care); amino acid sequence; base pairing; breast cancer; cancer immunotherapy; clinical decision making; court; genetic predisposition; genetic screening; human; jurisprudence; maternal serum; Note; ovary cancer; patent; prenatal diagnosis; real time polymerase chain reaction"
"Laser Ablation Therapy for Pediatric Patients with Intracranial Lesions in Eloquent Areas",2019,"Background: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is an alternative, less-invasive, and, in some circumstances, effective treatment for patients with intracranial pathology including epilepsy and some tumors. For intracranial lesions in eloquent areas, resection by conventional craniotomy proves often to be a challenge, including in the care of pediatric patients. Herein, we reviewed our experience with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided LITT as treatment for pediatric patients with intracranial lesions in eloquent areas and evaluate neurologic function and clinical outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with intracranial lesions in eloquent speech and motor areas who underwent MRI-guided LITT. Clinical evaluation, including neurologic function and neuropsychological testing, was conducted according to clinical considerations. MRI pre- and postoperative imaging was reviewed to compare the change of lesion size. Results: Five pediatric patients received MRI-guided LITT of intracranial lesions in eloquent cortex. One patient experienced complications secondary to MRI-guided LITT, but neither was discharged with a neurologic deficit. Conclusions: For intracranial lesions in the eloquent cortex, conventional craniotomy with surgical resection is a challenge for neurosurgeons, especially pediatric patients. MRI-guided LITT provides a less-invasive and potentially effective option for treatment in the management of pediatric epilepsy and tumors. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adolescent; Article; brain damage; child; childhood disease; clinical article; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; cortical dysplasia; craniotomy; electroencephalogram; endotracheal intubation; female; follow up; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; intractable epilepsy; laser interstitial thermal therapy; laser surgery; male; medical history; neuroimaging; neurosurgeon; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pediatric patient; postoperative period; proton therapy; retrospective study; school child; simple partial seizure; skin incision; surgical patient; brain disease; case report; computer assisted surgery; evaluation study; interventional magnetic resonance imaging; low level laser therapy; neuropsychological test; neurosurgery; procedures; seizure; sensorimotor cortex; Adolescent; Brain Diseases; Child; Female; Humans; Laser Therapy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Neurosurgical Procedures; Seizures; Sensorimotor Cortex; Surgery, Computer-Assisted"
"System accuracy assessments with a blood glucose meter with combined glucose and ?-hydroxybutyrate measurement capabilities",2019,"Background: We evaluated the Wellion Galileo GLU/KET blood and ketone (?-Hydroxybutyrate, ?-OHB) meter to demonstrate that it meets ISO15107:2015 regulatory approval criteria. Research Design and Methods: A total of 100 subjects (52 female, age: 30 to 84?years, diabetes: 10 type 1/90 type 2) with blood glucose levels distributed over the entire measurement range as required by the ISO15197 protocol were tested (double determinations with 3 strip lots and two devices). A similar test protocol was followed to test ?-OHB strip performance (reference devices: YSI 2300plus for glucose and STANBIO ?-HOB LiquiColor TestKit for ?-OHB). Precision was tested for glucose with 3 blood glucose concentrations (?-OHB: 2 control solutions). Results: All glucose test-strip lots met the strict ISO acceptance criteria. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) was 4.9% and all data pairs were in zone A of the consensus error grid. The ?-OHB test-strips also met the pre-defined acceptance criteria. Within-run and between-run precision was calculated to be 2.3% and 0.7% for the glucose strips (3.7%/0.8% for the ketone strips).

"Polymorphisms of the DNA repair gene EXO1 modulate cognitive aging in old adults in a Taiwanese population",2019,"Evidence indicates that the age-related neuropathological mechanisms associated with DNA repair genes may contribute to cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 155 DNA repair genes may be linked to cognitive aging independently and/or through complex interactions in an older Taiwanese population. A total of 3,730 Taiwanese subjects aged over 60 years from the Taiwan Biobank were analyzed. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered to all subjects, and MMSE scores were used to measure cognitive functions. Our data showed that out of 1,652 SNPs, the rs1776181 (P = 1.47 × 10 ?5 ), rs1776177 (P = 8.42 × 10 -7 ), rs1635510 (P = 7.97 × 10 -6 ), and rs2526698 (P = 7.06 × 10 -6 ) SNPs in the EXO1 gene were associated with cognitive aging. The association with these SNP remained significant after performing Bonferroni correction. Additionally, we found that interactions between the EXO1 and RAD51C genes influenced cognitive aging (P = 0.002). Finally, we pinpointed the influence of interactions between EXO1 and physical activity (P &lt; 0.001) as well as between DCLRE1C and physical activity (P &lt; 0.001). Our study indicated that DNA repair genes may contribute to susceptibility in cognitive aging independently as well as through gene-gene and gene-physical interactions. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DNA cross link repair 1c protein; exonuclease; exonuclease 1; nucleic acid binding protein; Rad51 protein; Rad51C protein; unclassified drug; adult; aged; aging; Article; biobank; cognition; cognitive aging; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; DNA repair; female; gene expression; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; multicenter study; physical activity; priority journal; protein protein interaction; single nucleotide polymorphism; Taiwanese"
"Dabigatran Reduces Liver Fibrosis in Thioacetamide-Injured Rats",2019,"Background: Liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver failure. Unfortunately, the antifibrotic agents are limited. Thrombin activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Therefore, we investigated the effects of a direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, on liver fibrosis. Methods: Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with thioacetamide (TAA, 200?mg/kg twice per week) for 8 or 12?weeks to induce liver fibrosis. The injured rats were assigned an oral gavage of dabigatran etexilate (30?mg/kg/day) or vehicle in the last 4?weeks of TAA administration. Rats receiving an injection of normal saline and subsequent oral gavage of dabigatran etexilate or vehicle served as controls. Results: In the 8-week TAA-injured rats, dabigatran ameliorated fibrosis, fibrin deposition, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in liver, without altering the transcript expression of thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor-1. In vitro, dabigatran inhibited thrombin-induced HSC activation. Furthermore, dabigatran reduced intrahepatic angiogenesis and portal hypertension in TAA-injured rats. Similarly, in the 12-week TAA-injured rats, a 4-week treatment with dabigatran reduced liver fibrosis and portal hypertension. Conclusions: By inhibiting thrombin action, dabigatran reduced liver fibrosis and intrahepatic angiogenesis. Dabigatran may be a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of liver fibrosis. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","alpha smooth muscle actin; collagen type 1; dabigatran etexilate; fibrin; hydroxyproline; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; myeloperoxidase; proteinase activated receptor 1; sodium chloride; thrombin; thrombin receptor; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; transforming growth factor beta1; antithrombin; collagen; dabigatran; fibrin; mitogen activated protein kinase; thioacetamide; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiangiogenic activity; Article; blood biochemistry; body weight; cell activation; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; enzyme phosphorylation; fibrin deposition; hepatic stellate cell; hepatitis; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver protection; liver weight; male; mean arterial pressure; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; portal hypertension; portal vein blood pressure; priority journal; protein expression; rat; spleen weight; Sprague Dawley rat; thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis; treatment duration; animal; cell line; cell protection; chemically induced; experimental liver cirrhosis; liver; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); pathology; pathophysiology; phosphorylation; portal hypertension; toxic hepatitis; Animals; Antithrombins; Cell Line; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Collagen; Cytoprotection; Dabigatran; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Fibrin; Hepatic Stellate Cells; Hypertension, Portal; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis, Experimental; Male; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Phosphorylation; Portal Pressure; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Thioacetamide"
"Do-not-resuscitate status is correlated with the prescribed use of systemic strong opioid analgesics in patients with terminal cancer: an observational study",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the possible correlation between the do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and the prescribed use of systemic strong opioid analgesics (SSOA) among patients with terminal cancer in Taiwan. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study used data from a single tertiary care medical center. We identified patients with terminal cancer who died after signing a DNR order between 2008 and 2016. Subsequently, we reviewed their clinical characteristics, DNR consent type, survival time after DNR declaration, and SSOA dose. Results: Of the 4123 patients enrolled for this study, 1380 (33.5%) had received SSOA before DNR and 2742 (66.5%) had received SSOA after DNR (p < 0.001). SSOA doses administered after the DNR order were significantly higher than those administered before the DNR order (median, 78 vs. 60?mg, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Patients’ DNR status likely influenced physician decision in prescribing SSOA. However, additional studies are necessary to clarify the factors that influence the decision-making of physicians regarding SSOA prescription. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","analgesic agent; fentanyl; hydromorphone; morphine; morphine sulfate; opiate; oxycodone; narcotic analgesic agent; adult; Article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer patient; colorectal cancer; cross-sectional study; do not resuscitate order; drug use; esophagus cancer; female; female genital tract cancer; human; leukemia; liver cancer; lung cancer; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; medical ethics; middle aged; mouth cancer; observational study; patient identification; prescription; priority journal; prostate cancer; retrospective study; stomach cancer; study design; survival time; Taiwan; terminal disease; tertiary care center; decision making; epidemiology; mortality; neoplasm; resuscitation; Analgesics, Opioid; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Resuscitation Orders; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Tertiary Care Centers"
"Risk score for predicting mortality in people with dementia: A nationwide, population-based cohort study in Taiwan with 11 years of follow-up",2019,"Objective: Many researchers and physicians attempt to determine the prognosis and short- and long-term mortality risks of dementia for formulating suitable care plans for patients and their families. However, the published prediction models have been insufficient for this purpose and have worked only in certain specific populations. For medical autonomy and end-of-life decisions, an informative tool to predict 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year mortality rates for dementia patients merits further investigation. Methods: Patients aged ? 65 years who received ICD-9-CM diagnoses of dementia between 2002 and 2009 were identified from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and followed until the end of 2013. Patient characteristics and comorbidities that were considered potential risk factors for mortality were assessed. Mortality-predicting risk scores were developed using a regression coefficient-based scoring approach. In total, 6,556 patients were identified and then randomly divided into a derivation cohort (n = 4,371) and validation cohort (n = 2,185). Results: By the end of the study, 1,693 of the 4,371 dementia patients (38.7%) in the derivation cohort were deceased. Mean duration of followup was 6.26 years. Eleven acute and chronic factors were identified for building the predictive score model, which produced scores from 0 to 24 points (higher scores indicated higher mortality). The score model exhibited good predictive power for various life expectancies (area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 6-month = 0.852, 1-year = 0.779, 2-year = 0.725, 3-year = 0.721, 5-year = 0.703) and good calibration in the validation cohort (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, χ2 = 4.709, P = .788). Conclusions: The developed predictive score model may be the first tool that uses the same clinical factors to determine both short- and longterm mortality risks in patients with dementia. ? 2019 Copyright Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.","acute disease; aged; Article; chronic disease; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; data base; dementia; female; follow up; human; ICD-9-CM; life expectancy; major clinical study; male; mortality; population research; priority journal; risk assessment; Taiwan"
"Quantitative diagnosis of rotator cuff tears based on sonographic pattern recognition",2019,"The lifetime prevalence of shoulder pain is nearly 70% and is mostly attributable to subacromial disorders. A rotator cuff tear is the most severe form of subacromial disorders, and most occur in the supraspinatus. For clinical examination, shoulder ultrasound is recommended to detect supraspinatus tears. In this study, a computer-aided tear classification (CTC) system was developed to identify supraspinatus tears in ultrasound examinations and reduce inter-operator variability. The observed cases included 89 ultrasound images of supraspinatus tendinopathy and 102 of supraspinatus tear from 136 patients. For each case, intensity and texture features were extracted from the entire lesion and combined in a binary logistic regression classifier for lesion classification. The proposed CTC system achieved an accuracy rate of 92% (176/191) and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) of 0.9694. Based on its diagnostic performance, the CTC system has promise for clinical use. ? 2019 Public Library of Science.

"Foveal microvascular anomalies on optical coherence tomography angiography and the correlation with foveal thickness and visual acuity in retinopathy of prematurity",2019,"Purpose: To assess foveal microvascular structure and the correlation between foveal retinal thickness and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in children with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study. A total 42 eyes in 23 patients with history of anti-vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) agent treatment and 51 eyes of 27 healthy age-matched subjects as the control group were analyzed. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and foveal vessel density (VD) were measured by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Foveal thickness was measured by cross-sectional OCT. Correlations between FAZ area, foveal VD, foveal thickness, BCVA, gestational age (GA), and birth body weight (BBW) were performed. Results: ROP children had a significantly smaller FAZ area and higher foveal VD, and the foveal thickness was significantly higher as compared to controls (all P < 0.0001). We noted a significant negative correlation between FAZ area and foveal thickness. In addition, a significant positive correlation between foveal VD and foveal thickness was identified. With regard to prematurity status, gestational age and birth body weight were both significantly correlated with FAZ area, foveal VD, and fovea inner retinal thickness. Multivariable analysis showed that thicker inner retinal thickness and higher superficial vascular density were associated with suboptimal visual acuity. Conclusion: By using OCT-A, we identified significant foveal microvascular anomalies in ROP children. The correlation between the microvascular anomalies, central foveal thickness, and suboptimal visual acuity was also noted. Because of the retrospective nature, more studies are necessary to further establish the relationship. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","bevacizumab; ranibizumab; Article; best corrected visual acuity; body weight; case control study; child; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; female; foveal microvascular structure; gestational age; human; male; medical history; optical coherence tomography angiography; prematurity; preschool child; priority journal; retinal thickness; retrolental fibroplasia; retrospective study; school child; sexually transmitted disease; visual system parameters; eye fundus; fluorescence angiography; microvasculature; newborn; optical coherence tomography; pathology; procedures; retina blood vessel; retina fovea; retrolental fibroplasia; vascularization; visual acuity; Case-Control Studies; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Fovea Centralis; Fundus Oculi; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Microvessels; Retinal Vessels; Retinopathy of Prematurity; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity"
"HER2 immunohistochemical scores provide prognostic information for patients with HER2-type invasive breast cancer",2019,"Aims: Invasive breast cancer patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemical (IHC) scores of 3+ or 2+ with reflex in-situ hybridisation (ISH) positivity are suitable for anti-HER2 therapies. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the prognoses between IHC 3+ patients and IHC 2+/ISH+ patients are different. Methods and results: We analysed the clinicopathological information of 886 consecutive cases of HER2-positive early breast cancer. The influences of the patients’ age, cancer stage, hormone receptor status and anti-HER2 treatment were adjusted using a multivariate Cox regression model. Both HER2 copy numbers and HER2 ISH ratios of the IHC 3+ group were significantly higher than those of the IHC 2+/ISH+ group. The outcomes of IHC 3+ patients were significantly better than those of IHC 2+/ISH+ patients in the univariate and multivariate analyses. HER2 copy numbers of ?8 represented the best prognostic value, and it was chosen to be the cut-off value. The reflex ISH for IHC 2+ patients with high HER2 copy numbers (?8) predicted a better overall survival than that for those with low HER2 copy numbers. Conclusion: HER2 IHC scores and HER2 copy numbers can provide prognostic information for patients with HER2-positive invasive breast cancer. Both IHC 3+ and IHC 2+ patients with high HER2 copy numbers had a better prognosis. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; hormone receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; tumor marker; adult; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; early cancer; female; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; middle aged; outcome assessment; overall survival; priority journal; proportional hazards model; recurrence free survival; survival rate; aged; biosynthesis; breast tumor; fluorescence in situ hybridization; immunohistochemistry; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; pathology; prognosis; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Receptor, ErbB-2"

"Relationship between polyunsaturated fatty acid and eating disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Objectives: Eating disorders result in poor nutrition, poor physical conditions and even suicidality and mortality. Although polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have attracted attention in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, their role in eating disorders remains unknown. This meta-analysis investigates the differences of PUFA levels between patients with eating disorders and healthy controls, and the potentially beneficial effects of PUFAs in such patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis under the random effects model. Result: Eleven studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with controls, 379 patients with eating disorders had significantly higher plasma levels of alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, stearidonic acid, osbond acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, and total omega-3 fatty acids; and lower levels of total omega-6 fatty acids and omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Eating disorders were associated with significantly higher red blood cell membrane levels of palmitoleic acid and oleic acid and lower levels of adrenic acid, arachidonic acid, and total omega-6 fatty acids. In addition, PUFA supplements were associated with a benefit to body weight outcomes but not disease severity and mood symptoms in interventional trials. Discussion: This meta-analysis indicates abnormal levels of PUFAs in peripheral blood tissues in patients with eating disorders. The relationship between PUFAs and eating disorders should be interpreted cautiously considering the specific lipid metabolism under starvation state. To investigate the role of PUFAs on psychopathological and therapeutic effects in eating disorders, further larger clinical studies are warranted. ? 2019","adrenic acid; arachidonic acid; icosapentaenoic acid; linolenic acid; oleic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; osbond acid; palmitoleic acid; placebo; polyunsaturated fatty acid; stearidonic acid; unclassified drug; anorexia nervosa; Article; body weight; depression; disease association; disease severity; eating disorder; erythrocyte membrane; fatty acid analysis; fatty acid blood level; human; lipid metabolism; meta analysis; mood disorder; obsessive compulsive disorder; pathophysiology; priority journal; starvation; systematic review"
"YWHAZ amplification/overexpression defines aggressive bladder cancer and contributes to chemo-/radio-resistance by suppressing caspase-mediated apoptosis",2019,"The objective of this study was to characterize the oncogenic actions of a recently identified cancer-associated gene YWHAZ (also named as 14-3-3 ζ/δ) in urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder (UCUB). A genome-wide study revealed YWHAZ to be involved in the amplicon at 8q22.3, and its genetic amplification was detected predominantly in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the association of YWHAZ overexpression with higher tumor stages, lymph node/vascular invasion, and mitotic activity. Univariate and multivariate analyses further indicated the prognostic potential of YWHAZ for more aggressive cancer types. Both gene set enrichment analysis and STRING network studies suggested involvement of YWHAZ in regulating caspase-mediated apoptosis. Ectopic expression of YWHAZ in bladder cells with low endogenous YWHAZ levels boosted cell resistance to doxorubicin and cisplatin, as well as to ionizing radiation. Conversely, YWHAZ-knockdown using specific shRNA in cells with high endogenous YWHAZ levels diminished survival activity, suppressing cell growth and increasing cell death. Our findings confirm the essential role played by YWHAZ in sustaining cell proliferation during chemo/radiotherapy. Treatments based on anti-YWHAZ strategies may thus be beneficial for UCUB patients overexpressing YWHAZ. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Effects of whey protein nutritional supplement on muscle function among community-dwelling frail older people: A multicenter study in China",2019,"Background: Frailty, featured by the presence of fatigue, weight loss, decrease in grip strength, decline gait speed and reduced activities substantially increase the risk of falls, disability, hospitalizations, and mortality of older people. Nutritional supplementation and resistance exercise may improve muscle function and reverse frailty status. Objective: To evaluate whether whey protein supplements can improve muscle function of frail older people in addition to resistance exercise. Methods: 115 community-dwelling older adults who met the Fried's criteria for frailty from four hospitals’ out-patients clinic in Beijing, China completed the study. It's a case–control study which whey protein was used as daily supplementation for 12 weeks for active group and regular resistance exercise for active group and control group. Handgrip strength, gait speed, chair-stand test, balance score, and SPPB score were compared in both groups during the 12-week follow-up. Results: Overall, 115 subjects were enrolled for study with 66 in active group and 49 in control group. Handgrip strength, gait speed, and chair-stand time were all significantly improved in both groups with significant between-group differences. The active group improved significantly in handgrip strength compared with the control group, which between-group effect (95% confidence interval) for female was 0.107 kg (0.066–0.149), p = 0.008 and for male was 0.89 kg (0.579–1.201), p = 0.007. For chair-stand time, between-group effect (95% confidence interval) was ?2.875 s (?3.62 to ?2.124), p = 0.004 and for gait speed, between-group effect (95% confidence interval) was 0.109 m/s (0.090 to 0.130), p = 0.003. Conclusions: The 12-week intervention of whey protein oral nutritional supplement revealed significant improvements in muscle function among the frailty elderly besides aiding with resistance exercise. These results warrant further investigations into the role of a multi-modal supplementation approach which could prevent adverse outcomes among frailty elderly at risk for various disabilities. ? 2019","C reactive protein; glycosylated hemoglobin; whey protein; aged; Article; body equilibrium; case control study; chair stand test; China; community dwelling person; controlled study; diet supplementation; female; frailty; grip strength; hemoglobin blood level; human; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; Mini Nutritional Short Form; multicenter study; muscle function; musculoskeletal system inflammation; nutritional assessment; priority journal; protein blood level; resistance training; walking speed"
"Timely eradication of HCV viremia by PegIFN/RBV is crucial in prevention of post RFA recurrence in CHC-HCC patients",2019,"Background: Secondary prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) with interferon-based therapy has been proved effective. However, tertiary prevention with PegIFN/RBV therapy of HCC recurrence seems limited effect in CHC-HCC patients post curative therapies. This study aims to investigate the timing and impact of PegIFN/RBV treatment on prevention of HCC recurrence in patients after RFA treatment. Methods: From 2013 to 2016, a total of 137 CHC-HCC patients from a 508 patient based cohort receiving complete RFA treatment in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center were retrospectively recruited. Pre-RFA patient demographics were analyzed by cox regression analysis for prediction on tumor recurrence. Statistics analysis was performed with SPSS V.20 (IBM, USA). Results: The mean age of the 137 patients were 69.6 year-old and 71.5% of patients were cirrhotic. After propensity score matching, one hundred and two patients were enrolled into the analysis. Fifty-one patients (50%) received PegIFN/RBV therapy and twenty-seven patients (52.9%) achieved SVR. Patients who could achieve SVR had lower tumor recurrence rate than non-SVR and untreated groups (29.6% vs. 66.7% vs. 49.0%, P = 0.030). The effect is more prominent in those achieve SVR prior to compared with after RFA despite not reach statistically significant (26.1% vs. 50.0%, P = 0.334). Conclusion: Timely treatment with SVR achievement has the lowest tumor recurrence rate in CHC-HCC patients. Secondary prevention might be even more important than tertiary prevention in CHC patients, especially regarding prevention of post RFA HCC recurrence. ? 2018","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; ribavirin; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; chronic hepatitis C; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; follow up; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; radiofrequency ablation; retrospective study; risk factor; viral clearance; viremia"
"Patterns of gray matter alterations in migraine and restless legs syndrome",2019,"Objectives: Migraine and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are often comorbid and share elements of pathology; however, their neuroanatomical underpinnings are poorly understood. This study aimed to identify patterns of gray matter volume (GMV) alteration specific to and common among patients with RLS, migraine, and comorbid migraine and RLS. Methods: High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 116 subjects: 27 RLS patients, 22 migraine patients, 22 patients with comorbid migraine and RLS, and 45 healthy controls. Direct group comparisons and conjunction analysis were first used to localize the distinct and shared neural signatures of migraine and RLS. We also investigated whether the shared neural signature could be replicated in an additional comorbid migraine/RLS group. Results: Compared with healthy controls, migraine patients showed GMV changes in the lateral occipital cortex, cerebellum, frontal pole, and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and RLS patients showed GMV changes in the thalamus, middle temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and MFG. In migraine, compared with RLS, GMV differences were found in the precuneus, lateral occipital and occipital fusiform cortex, superior frontal and precentral gyri, and cerebellum. Conjunction analyses for these disorders showed altered GMV in the MFG, also found in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. The GMV of the MFG also correlated with sleep quality in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. Interpretation: Migraine and RLS are characterized by shared and distinctive neuroanatomical characteristics, with a specific role of the MFG. These findings may be related to shared pathophysiology of these two distinct disorders. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Association between health behaviors and mood disorders among the elderly: A community-based cohort study",2019,"Background: According to a WHO report, nearly 15% of adults aged 60 and over suffer from a mental disorder, constituting 6.6% of the total disability for this age group. Taipei City faces rapid transformation towards an aging society, with the proportion of elderly in the total population rising from 12% in 2008 to 16% in 2016. The aim of this study is to identify the prevalence of mental disorders among the elderly in Taipei City and to elucidate risk factors contributing to mental disorders. Methods: The elderly health examination database was obtained from the Department of Health, Taipei City government, from 2005 to 2012. A total of 86,061 people underwent publicly funded health examinations, with 348,067 visits. Each year, there are around 43,000 elderly persons in Taipei City using this service. We used a mental health questionnaire including five questions to estimated relative risks among potential risk factors with the generalized estimating equations (GEE) model to measure the mental health status of the elderly. Mood disorders were measured with the Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) questionnaire. Age, education level, gender, marital status, living alone, drinking milk, eating vegetables and fruits, long-term medication, smoking status, frequency of alcohol consumption, frequency of physical activity, BMI, and number of chronic diseases were included as covariates. Results: The results show that being male (odds ratio (OR) 0.57; 95% CI = 0.56, 0.59), higher education (OR 0.88; 95% CI = 0.82, 0.95), no long-term medication (OR 0.57; 95% CI = 0.56, 0.58), and exercising three or more times per week (OR 0.94; 95% CI = 0.91, 0.98) were all positively correlated with better emotional status. However, being divorced (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.36), not drinking milk (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.14), not eating enough vegetables and fruits every day (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.73, 1.83), daily smoking (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.32), and having more chronic diseases (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.03) were all correlated with poor mental status among the elderly. Conclusions: The findings of this research can both estimate the prevalence of mood disorders at the community level, and identify risk factors of mood disorders at the personal level. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adverse event; aged; cohort analysis; female; follow up; health behavior; human; longitudinal study; male; marriage; mental health; mental health service; mood disorder; physiology; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; retrospective study; risk factor; smoking; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Community Mental Health Services; Diet, Healthy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Behavior; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Marital Status; Mental Health; Mood Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Smoking; Surveys and Questionnaires"

"Elevation of serum oxidative stress in patients with retina vein occlusions",2019,"Purpose: Retina vein occlusion (RVO) is a visual-threatening retinal disease that causes irreversible impaired quality of life. The contribution of oxidative stress behind clinical course of RVO was rarely investigated. The study aimed to measure the serum oxidative biomarker in patients with RVO to investigate further physical response. Methods: We measured the serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), Sirutin 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-r), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), orkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), orkhead box protein O3 (FOXO3), catalase, (SOD) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) among 19 patients with cataract as control group and 36 patients with RVO, respectively. Results: The mean MDA, 8OHdG and hydrogen peroxide in the serum were significantly higher in patients with RVO compared with the results in control group subjects. Whereas SIRT1, PPAR-r, PGC-1, FOXO1, FOXO3, catalase and SOD levels in serum were significantly decreased in patients with RVO compared with control group. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the serum level of MDA, 8OHdG and hydrogen peroxide is increased in patients with RVO. Among these, the elevation of MDA, 8OHdG and hydrogen peroxide suggests the increasing of serum oxidative stress in RVO patients. All enzymes related reactive oxygen species scavenge were decreased. Thus, focal RVO may increase systemic oxidative stress within serum. ? 2018 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

"Comparison of the Clinicopathological Characteristics and Genetic Alterations Between Patients with Gastric Cancer with or Without Helicobacter pylori Infection",2019,"Background: Helicobacter pylori (HP) can induce epithelial cells and intestinal metaplasia with genetic damage that makes them highly susceptible to the development of gastric cancer (GC). Materials and Methods: Between 2005 and 2010, 356 patients with gastric cancer who received curative surgery were enrolled. Analysis of HP, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, PIK3CA amplification, and mutation analysis of 68 mutations in eight genes using a mass spectrometric single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping technology was conducted. The clinicopathological characteristics of patients with or without HP infection were compared. Results: Among the 356 patients, 185 (52.0%) had HP infection. For intestinal-type GC, patients with HP infection were more likely to be younger and had fewer PI3K/AKT pathway genetic mutations than those without HP infection. For diffuse-type GC, patients with HP infection were characterized by less male predominance, less lymphoid stroma, fewer microsatellite instability-high tumors, and fewer PI3K/AKT pathway genetic mutations than those without HP infection. Patients with HP infection had less tumor recurrence and a better 5-year overall survival (87.7% vs. 73.9%, p =.012) and disease-free survival (64.1% vs. 51.3%, p =.013) than those without HP infection, especially for intestinal-type GC. For EBV-negative GC, patients with HP infection had fewer PI3K/AKT pathway mutations and a better 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival than those without HP infection. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HP infection was an independent prognostic factor regarding overall survival and disease-free survival. Conclusion: Patients with GC with HP infection were associated with fewer PI3K/AKT pathway genetic mutations and better survival than those without HP infection, especially for EBV-negative and intestinal-type GC. Implications for Practice: Patients with gastric cancer with Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection had fewer PI3K/AKT pathway genetic mutations, less tumor recurrence, and better survival than those without HP infection, especially for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative and intestinal-type gastric cancer. HP infection is an independent prognostic factor regarding overall survival and disease-free survival. Future in vivo and in vitro studies of the correlation among HP infection, PI3K/AKT pathway, and EBV infection in gastric cancer are required. ?

"Association of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with ectopic pregnancy and preterm labor in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study",2019,"Background Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infectious disease that causes tubal occlusion and other pelvic and abdominal adhesions. The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has increased due to the sexually active status of the young population. This leads to a more serious problem and a larger effect than previously observed. However, there have been few studies on this topic in Asian populations. Aim We aimed to evaluate the risk of preterm labor and/or ectopic pregnancy in Taiwanese women following PID. Design Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we designed a retrospective cohort study that included 12- to 55-year-old pregnant women between 2000 and 2010. We selected a 1:3 age-matched control group of non-PID women. The endpoint was any episode of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy; otherwise, the patients were tracked until 31 December 2010. Methods The risk factors for preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy were explored. For cases included from the index date until the end of 2010, we analyzed the risk of incident preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy. With the use of a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% CI and compared it with that of the control group. Results This study examined 30,450 patients with PID and 91,350 controls. During the follow-up period, patients in the PID group were more likely to develop preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy than patients in the control group. The cumulative incidence rates for developing preterm labor were 1.84% (561/30,450 individuals) in patients with PID and 1.63% (1492/ 91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. On the other hand, the cumulative incidence rate for developing ectopic pregnancy in patients with PID was 0.05% (14/30,450 individuals) but was only 0.04% (33/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. Compared with those without PID, the patients with PID had a 1.864 times (P<0.001) higher risk of developing preterm labor and a 2.121 times (P = 0.003) higher risk of developing ectopic pregnancy. Conclusion Our study provided evidence of an increased risk of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy in PID patients. ? 2019 Huang et al.

"Far-infrared therapy improves ankle brachial index in hemodialysis patients with peripheral artery disease",2019,"Ankle brachial index (ABI) is a diagnostic tool for peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is an important issue in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We enrolled 198 maintenance HD patients in this study. PAD is defined as ABI ? 0.90. Only PAD patients received far-infrared (FIR) therapy using the WS TY101 FIR emitter for 40?min during each HD session, three times weekly for 6?months. The ABI was measured at the bilateral lower extremities for 4 times [pre-dialytic timing (0?min) and 40?min after the initiation of HD session at both day 0 and 6?months after the FIR therapy]. The primary outcome is the change in ABI. There were 51 out of 198 patients with PAD. In comparison with the period without FIR therapy in the 51 PAD patients, 6?months of FIR therapy significantly improved the ABI of the right/left side for 0?min (from 0.77 ± 0.19 to 0.81 ± 0.20, p = 0.027/0.79 ± 0.20 to 0.81 ± 0.17, p = 0.049), 40?min during HD (from 0.73 ± 0.23 to 0.83 ± 0.19, p < 0.001/from 0.77 ± 0.21 to 0.83 ± 0.18, p < 0.001), and the?incremental change between 0 and 40?min (from ? 0.04 ± 0.14 to 0.05 ± 0.13, p = 0.007/from ? 0.05 ± 0.13 to 0.03 ± 0.11, p = 0.012), respectively. In conclusion, the application of FIR therapy for 40?min, three times weekly for 6?months, has improved the ABI of both lower extremities, thus providing a new strategy of PAD treatment in HD patients. ? 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","heparin; adult; aged; ankle brachial index; Article; blood flow; end stage renal disease; far infrared therapy; hemodialysis; hemodialysis patient; human; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; middle aged; oscillometry; outcome assessment; peripheral occlusive artery disease; priority journal; therapy effect; thermotherapy; treatment duration; treatment outcome; vascular patency; chronic kidney failure; complication; drug therapy; female; follow up; hemodialysis; infrared radiation; lower limb; male; peripheral occlusive artery disease; vascularization; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ankle Brachial Index; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infrared Rays; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Renal Dialysis; Treatment Outcome"
"Hospital level variations in the trends and outcomes of the nonoperative management of splenic injuries - a nationwide cohort study",2019,"Background: The long-term treatment trends of splenic injuries can provide guidance when treating trauma patients. The nonoperative management (NOM) of splenic injuries was introduced in early 1989. After decades of development, it has proven to be safe and is now the primary treatment choice worldwide. However, there remains a lack of nationwide registry data to support the feasibility and efficiency of NOM. Methods: We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a whole population-based cohort study. Patients admitted with blunt splenic injuries from 2002 to 2013 were identified. Demographic data, management methods, associated injuries, comorbidities and outcome parameters were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups by the type of admitting institution: a tertiary center or a non-center hospital. We also used 4 years as an interval to analyze the changes in epidemiological data and treatment trends. Comparisons of the results of NOM and surgical management were also performed. Results: A total of 12,455 patients were admitted with blunt splenic injuries between 2002 and 2013. Among the 11,551 patients treated in a single hospital after admission, patients underwent NOM more frequently at tertiary centers than at non-center hospitals (64.6% vs 50.3%). During the 12-year study period, the NOM rate increased from 56 to 73% in tertiary centers, while in noncenter hospitals, the rate only increased from 43 to 58%. The mortality rate decreased in tertiary centers from 8.9 to 7.2%, with no apparent change in noncenter hospitals. Complications occurred more frequently in the surgical management group. Conclusion: There is a trend toward the use of NOM for blunt splenic injury treatments, and the outcomes from the NOM groups were not inferior to those of the operation group. In addition, tertiary centers performed more NOM than did non-center hospitals and better met the international consensus. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; adult; aged; blunt trauma; cohort analysis; epidemiology; factual database; female; hospital; hospital mortality; human; injuries; length of stay; male; middle aged; mortality; pregnancy; spleen; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; tertiary care center; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Female; Hospital Mortality; Hospitals; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Spleen; Taiwan; Tertiary Care Centers; Wounds, Nonpenetrating; Young Adult"
"Oral glutamine supplements reduce concurrent chemoradiotherapy-induced esophagitis in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer",2019,"BACKGROUND: Complications related to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) such as acute radiation-induced esophagitis (ARIE) may cause significant morbidity and unplanned treatment delays in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We designed a prospective randomized study to assess the impact of glutamine (GLN) supplementation in preventing CCRT-induced toxicities of advanced NSCLC patients. METHODS: From September 2014 to September 2015, 60 patients diagnosed with NSCLC were included to the study. Thirty patients (50%) received prophylactic powdered GLN orally at a dose of 10?g/8?h. The prescribed radiation dose to the planning target volume was 30 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. The endpoints were radiation-induced esophagitis, mucositis, body weight loss, overall survival and progression-free survival. RESULTS: The 60 patients with NSCLC included 42 men and 18 women with a mean age?±?standard deviation of 60.3 years?±?18.2 (range, 44-78 years).At a median follow-up of 26.4 months (range 10.4-32.2), all patients tolerated GLN well. A administration of GLN was associated with a decrease in the incidence of grade 2 or 3 ARIE (6.7% vs 53.4% for Gln+ vs Gln-; P?=?.004). GLN supplementation appeared to significantly delay ARIE onset for 5.8 days (18.2 days vs 12.4 days; P?=?.027) and reduced incidence of weight loss (20% vs 73.3%; P?=?.01). DISCUSSION: Our study suggests a beneficial effect of oral glutamine supplementation for the prevention from radiation-induced injury and body weight loss in advanced NSCLC patients who receiving CCRT.","glutamine; adult; aged; chemoradiotherapy; controlled study; dietary supplement; esophagitis; female; human; incidence; lung tumor; male; middle aged; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; prospective study; radiation injury; radiotherapy dosage; randomized controlled trial; survival analysis; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Chemoradiotherapy; Dietary Supplements; Esophagitis; Female; Glutamine; Humans; Incidence; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Radiation Injuries; Radiotherapy Dosage; Survival Analysis"
"Transillumination method for intraoperative mapping subfascial plexus of free-style radial forearm flap",2019,"Background: Without well recognizing the vascular territories of the perforator, it might damage the pedicle and diminish the survival of the flap. This study described a transillumination method for intraoperative mapping of subfascial plexus of the perforator in radial forearm flap and also compared the perioperative outcomes and complications of the method with the standard folded, bipaddled forearm flap in head and neck reconstruction. Methods: Between January 2011 and December 2017, we applied the transillumination method in 12 patients who underwent head and neck reconstruction with forearm flaps immediately after surgical resection of oral cancer (case group). For comparison, we identified 12 age- and gender-matched patients who received head and neck reconstruction with folded, bipaddled radial forearm flaps (control group). Demographic factors, diagnosis, flap size, perioperative data, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. Results: There was no significant difference in harvesting time, operative time, or blood loss between the case and control groups. No patient experienced donor-site complication. There was no significant difference in recipient-site complication between the case and control groups. Conclusion: The transillumination method can allow plastic surgeons to easily identify the perforator vascular plexus of the radial forearm flap, which facilitates intraoperative flap design in head and neck reconstruction without increasing harvesting time and risk of postoperative complications.

"Natives as international medical graduates: A nationwide analysis in Taiwan",2019,"Introduction: International medical graduates (IMGs) play an important role in many Western countries because of globalization and physician shortages. While the IMGs investigated in most studies were immigrants, few studies have considered the situation in which people native to a given country have studied medicine abroad and then returned to practice in their home country. To illustrate that situation, our study aimed to investigate practicing IMGs in Taiwan by comparing practicing physicians' nationalities to the countries in which the medical schools the IMGs graduated from are located. Methods: Data were obtained from the annual official statistics released by the Taiwan Medical Association from 1998 to 2017. Results: The number of practicing IMGs in Taiwan increased from 834 (3.1% of 26,991 physicians) in 1998 to 1,733 (3.7% of 46,452) in 2017. Their medical schools were distributed across 37 countries, with graduates of schools in the Philippines (n?=?550), Poland (n?=?420), and Myanmar (n?=?364) accounting for 77.0% of all practicing IMGs in 2017. However, only 29, 0, and 253 physicians were themselves Filipinos, Polish, and Myanmarese, respectively. Conclusion: Most of the practicing IMGs in Taiwan are native Taiwanese. The real impact of IMGs in health policy-making and the existing quota system of admissions to medical schools thus deserve further investigations. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","article; health care policy; human; indigenous people; major clinical study; medical school; Myanmar; Philippines; physician; Poland; statistics; Taiwan; developing country; factual database; foreign medical graduate; supply and distribution; Taiwan; trends; Databases, Factual; Developing Countries; Foreign Medical Graduates; Humans; Taiwan"

"THe cardiovascular factors and metabolic syndrome in an elderly male chinese occupational population",2019,"Purpose This study was conducted to explore the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and identify associated risk factors in an elderly male occupational population in Taipei, Taiwan. Methods A total of 2734 healthy subjects over age 65 voluntarily presented to a teaching hospital for a physical checkup in 2010. Demographic data and blood test results were collected. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to NCEP ATP III criteria. Results The mean age of study participants was 74.4±6.6 years. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was estimated at 29.9% (95%CI: 28.2%-31.6%). After adjustment for confounding factors, higher body-mass index (OR=1.50, 95%CI 1.41-1.62), higher mean body fat (% of total mass, OR=1.11, 95%CI: 1.04-1.20), elevated serum uric acid (OR=1.13, 95%CI: 1.02-1.26), and elevated alanine aminotransferase (OR=1.01, 95%CI: 1.00-1.02), and sedentary lifestyle (yes vs. no, OR=1.22, 95%CI: 1.09-1.37) were identified as the most significant risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome.

"Clinical Features Associated with Survival Outcome in African-American Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma",2019,"BACKGROUND:African-Americans (AA) have a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lower survival. We characterized survival rates and clinical features associated with survival in AA vs. Caucasians with HCC over the past two decades.METHODS:HCC patients from three US medical centers were matched by year of diagnosis (1991-2016): AA (n = 578)/Caucasian (n = 578) and placed in one of two groups - HCC diagnosed prior to 2010 or 2010 and after. Data were obtained from chart review and the National Death Index. Multivariate and survival analysis controlling for key predictors were conducted.RESULTS:Prior to 2010, there was no difference in survival between Caucasians and AA (p = 0.61). After 2010, AA patients had poorer survival compared to Caucasians (35% vs. 44%, respectively, p = 0.044). Over time, survival improved for Caucasians (32% before 2010 vs. 44% after 2010, p = 0.003), but not AA (36% vs. 35%, p = 0.50). AA on presentation (in the after 2010 cohort) were more likely to have BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage C (24% vs. 15%, p = 0.010) and less likely to receive treatment (85% vs. 93%, p = 0.002) compared to matched Caucasians. BCLC beyond stage A (aHR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.26-2.43, p = 0.001) and child's class C (aHR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.23-3.41, p = 0.006) were the strongest predictors of mortality, while race was not.CONCLUSIONS:African-Americans presented with more advanced HCC and had poorer survival compared to Caucasians after 2010. Tumor stage was an independent predictor of mortality, but ethnicity was not. Further efforts are needed to improve early HCC diagnosis for AA. ?2018 by The American College of Gastroenterology.","sorafenib; adult; African American; Article; cancer mortality; cancer staging; cancer survival; Caucasian; chemoembolization; clinical feature; cohort analysis; ethnicity; female; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; liver transplantation; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; priority journal; radiofrequency ablation; survival analysis; United States; clinical trial; ethnology; health care disparity; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; mortality; multicenter study; African Americans; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cohort Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Survival Analysis; United States"
"The association between epididymo-orchitis and prostate cancer: A nationwide population-based cohort study",2019,"To determine whether epididymo-orchitis, a common infectious disease among men, is associated with subsequent prostate cancer (PCa) via a nationwide cohort study.This nationwide population-based study of patients treated from 2001 to 2013 included a total of 4991 patients with epididymo-orchitis as the study group and 19,922 matched patients without epididymo-orchitis as a control group. We tracked the patients in both groups for a 5-year period to identify any new cases of PCa. Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of PCa during this 5-year follow-up period.Of the 24,913 patients in the study, 235 (0.9%) were newly diagnosed with PCa during the 5-year follow-up period; 77 (1.5%) of those were from the epididymo-orchitis group and 158 (0.8%) were from the control group. Compared to the patients without epididymo-orchitis, the adjusted HR for PCa for the patients with epididymo-orchitis was 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-2.06) during the 5-year follow-up period. Ages of more than 70 years, higher incomes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were more strongly associated withPCa in the study group than in the control group.The results were associated with a 56% increased risk for PCa among patients with epididymo-orchitis. Epididymo-orchitis may play an etiological role in the development of PCa in Asian populations. Further studies are warranted, however, to investigate the relationship between epididymo-orchitis and PCa.","adult; aged; complication; epididymitis; factual database; health insurance; human; incidence; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; orchitis; proportional hazards model; prostate tumor; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Databases, Factual; Epididymitis; Humans; Incidence; Insurance, Health; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Orchitis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Canagliflozin inhibits growth of hepatocellular carcinoma via blocking glucose-influx-induced β-catenin activation",2019,"Accelerated glucose metabolism is critical in hepatocarcinogenesis, but the utilities of different glucose transporter inhibitors in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we examined a collection of glucose transporter inhibitors and found differential anti-HCC effects among these compounds. Canagliflozin (CANA), phloretin, and WZB117 decreased cellular glucose influx, but only CANA showed potent growth inhibition in HCC, which indicated a glucose-independent anti-HCC mechanism. Notably, we found that CANA treatment significantly downregulated the expression of β-catenin in HCC cells in. By co-treating cells with cycloheximide and MG-132, we proved that CANA promoted proteasomal degradation of β-catenin protein by increasing phosphorylation of β-catenin, and CANA-induced inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A was identified being responsible for this effect. Moreover, using Huh7 xenografted tumor model, CANA treatment was shown to delay tumor growth and improved the survival of HCC bearing mice. Our study highlights the unique dual β-catenin-inhibition mechanisms of CANA, which may provide new thoughts on treating HCC patient with concurrent diabetes, and, furthermore, on developing novel treatment targeting metabolic reprogram and/or WNT/β-catenin signaling in HCC. ? 2019, The Author(s).","antineoplastic agent; benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; beta catenin; canagliflozin; CD133 antigen; cyclin D1; cycloheximide; dapagliflozin; empagliflozin; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; glucose; glucose transport affecting agent; glucose transporter; glucose transporter 1; glucose transporter 3; phloretin; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A; proteasome; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; wzb 117; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer survival; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; drug dose increase; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; Huh-7 cell line; liver cell carcinoma; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein dephosphorylation; protein induction; protein phosphorylation; upregulation; Wnt signaling"
"Improving medication safety by cloud technology: Progression and value-added applications in Taiwan",2019,"Objectives: To develop and implement an integrated cloud technology with the aim of ensuring medication reconciliation during transitions of care and improve medication safety in aged societies. Methods: PharmaCloud is a new technical platform adopted by the National Health Insurance Administration of Taiwan to collect patients’ medication information via cloud technology. Using this platform, healthcare providers can access patients’ medication-related information with patient consent. Our hospital applied this technology and developed several approaches to collect and detect medication-related information and alert physicians for the purpose of enhancing patients’ medication safety. In addition, pharmacists were involved in the admission process to access medication data and provide optimal suggestions to physicians. Several indicators, including a reduction in the number of drug items in each prescription and medication expenditure, were employed to evaluate the overall effects of the cloud inquiry. Results: After the application of PharmaCloud, the average number of prescribed drug items significantly decreased (change of 0.04 to ?0.35 per prescription, p < 0.05), and the median medication expenditure significantly decreased by an average of 3.55 USD, (p < 0.05) per prescription. Intra-hospital medication duplication rates also showed a downward trend. Conclusions: The use of the cloud technology and value-added applications significantly improved patient medication safety. Further long-term beneficial effects in terms of medication safety and medical cost savings are expected. ? 2019 The Authors","Health insurance; Hospitals; Cloud technologies; Medical information; Patient safety; Pharmacist; PharmaCloud; Medical information systems; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; hypnotic sedative agent; neuroleptic agent; prescription drug; adult; Article; computerized provider order entry; drug cost; drug safety; female; human; information technology; male; medical information; medication therapy management; middle aged; pharmacist; prescription; priority journal; Taiwan; aged; cloud computing; health care delivery; hospitalization; medication therapy management; patient safety; physician; public health; Aged; Cloud Computing; Delivery of Health Care; Hospitalization; Humans; Medication Reconciliation; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Patient Safety; Pharmacists; Physicians; Prescription Drugs; Taiwan"
"Risk and coaggregation of major psychiatric disorders among first-degree relatives of patients with bipolar disorder: a nationwide population-based study",2019,"Background Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable mental illness that transmits intergeneratively. Previous studies supported that first-degree relatives (FDRs), such as parents, offspring, and siblings, of patients with bipolar disorder, had a higher risk of bipolar disorder. However, whether FDRs of bipolar patients have an increased risk of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains unclear.Methods Among the entire population in Taiwan, 87 639 patients with bipolar disorder and 188 290 FDRs of patients with bipolar disorder were identified in our study. The relative risks (RRs) of major psychiatric disorders were assessed among FDRs of patients with bipolar disorder.Results FDRs of patients with bipolar disorder were more likely to have a higher risk of major psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder (RR 6.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.95-6.30), MDD (RR 2.89, 95% CI 2.82-2.96), schizophrenia (RR 2.64, 95% CI 2.55-2.73), ADHD (RR 2.21, 95% CI 2.13-2.30), and ASD (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.92-2.29), than the total population did. These increased risks for major psychiatric disorders were consistent across different familial kinships, such as parents, offspring, siblings, and twins. A dose-dependent relationship was also found between risk of each major psychiatric disorder and numbers of bipolar patients.Conclusions Our study was the first study to support the familial coaggregation of bipolar disorder with other major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, MDD, ADHD, and ASD, in a Taiwanese (non-Caucasian) population. Given the elevated risks of major psychiatric disorders, the public health government should pay more attention to the mental health of FDRs of patients with bipolar disorder. ?

"Relationship between Changes in Prehospital Blood Pressure and Early Neurological Deterioration in Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage",2019,"The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between changes in prehospital blood pressure (BP) and the incidence of early neurological deterioration (END) after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) in patients who arrive at the emergency department (ED) with a normal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Records of consecutive adults with SICH transported by ambulance and treated in our ED from January 2015 to December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The study cohort included all patients with SICH occurring within the previous 6 hr who had a normal GCS score on ED arrival. Detailed information was retrieved from our hospital's intracerebral hemorrhage databank and then cross-checked in the medical and nursing charts to confirm completeness and accuracy. Early neurological deterioration was defined as a decrease of 2 or more points in the GCS score within 6 hr after ED arrival. The change in prehospital BP was defined as the BP on ED arrival minus the initial on-scene BP. An association between a change in prehospital BP and the occurrence of END was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses (multiple logistic regression analysis). Of the 168 patients evaluated, 36 (21.4%) developed END. Factors associated with END on univariate analysis were regular antiplatelet agent use, shorter elapsed time, on-scene systolic blood pressure (SBP), prehospital SBP increase of 15 mmHg or more, intraventricular extension of the hematoma, and the presence of 3 or more noncontrast computed tomographic signs of hematoma expansion. After adjusting for other covariates, an increase in prehospital SBP of 15 mmHg or more was significantly associated with a higher risk of END. In patients with SICH who arrive at the ED with a normal GCS score, an increase in the prehospital SBP of more than 15 mmHg is associated with a higher incidence of END. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Hurdle Poisson Regression Model for Identifying Factors Related to Noncompliance and Waiting Time for Confirmatory Diagnosis in Colorectal Cancer Screening",2019,"Objectives Population-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs that use a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) are often faced with a noncompliance issue and its subsequent waiting time (WT) for those FIT positives complying with confirmatory diagnosis. We aimed to identify factors associated with both of the correlated problems in the same model.Methods A total of 294,469 subjects, either with positive FIT test results or having a family history, collected from 2004 to 2013 were enrolled for analysis. We applied a hurdle Poisson regression model to accommodate the hurdle of compliance and also its related WT for undergoing colonoscopy while assessing factors responsible for the mixture of the two outcomes.Results The effect on compliance and WT varied with contextual factors, such as geographic areas, type of screening units, and level of urbanization. The hurdle score, representing the risk score in association with noncompliance, and the WT score, reflecting the rate of taking colonoscopy, were used to classify subjects into each of three groups representing the degree of compliance and the level of health awareness.Conclusion Our model was not only successfully applied to evaluating factors associated with the compliance and the WT distribution, but also developed into a useful assessment model for stratifying the risk and predicting whether and when screenees comply with the procedure of receiving confirmatory diagnosis given contextual factors and individual characteristics.

Methods: Using human TNBC cell lines of different subtypes, namely, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and BT-549 as in vitro models, antiproliferative effects of BBR were investigated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, trypan blue exclusion assay, and clonogenic assay. Furthermore, cell apoptosis and autophagy were analyzed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescent staining, and LC3 I/II-targeted Western blotting. Various cell growth-related signaling pathways (AKT/ERK/p38) and the expression of proteins present in various cell cycle kinase complexes were analyzed by Western blotting. Results: BBR concentration-dependently suppressed cell proliferation in MDA-MB-468 (0, 3, 6, and 12 μM) and MDA-MB-231 (0, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 μM). The inhibitory effect was not brought about by inducing cell apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy. Cell cycle analysis disclosed an increased S+G2/M fraction among the BBR-treated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells; while with the BBR-treated MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 lines, an increased G0/G1 fraction was found. In MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells, by Western blotting, BBR decreased the expression of Cyclin A and CDK1, On the other hand, in BBR-treated MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells, there was a decrease in Cyclin D and CDK4 expression. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the antiproliferation effects of BBR occur via different mechanisms in different subtypes of TNBC cells, which suggests that BBR has potential as a personalized treatment for TNBC patients. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","berberine; cyclin A; cyclin dependent kinase 1; protein kinase B; synaptophysin; trypan blue; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; BT-549 cell line; clonogenic assay; controlled study; drug effect; drug inhibition; drug mechanism; flow cytometry; human; human cell; immunofluorescence test; in vitro study; MDA-MB-231 cell line; MDA-MB-453 cell line; MDA-MB-468 cell line; MTT assay; percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase; priority journal; triple negative breast cancer; trypan blue assay; Western blotting"
"Clinical characteristics of Candida tropicalis fungaemia with reduced triazole susceptibility in Taiwan: a multicentre study",2019,"Candida tropicalis is the second most common Candida species causing fungaemia in Taiwan, and decreased susceptibility to fluconazole has been reported. This study analysed the clinical characteristics of adult patients with C. tropicalis fungaemia and the antifungal susceptibilities of isolates at five tertiary hospitals in Taiwan (1 July 2011 to 30 June 2014). A standardised case record form was used retrospectively to collect demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics, antifungal treatment and outcomes. MICs of non-duplicate isolates were determined using Sensititre TM YeastOne TM and were interpreted using cut-off values recommended by the CLSI. A total 248 patients were diagnosed over the study period; 30-day crude mortality was 52.0%. Multivariate analysis showed that high Charlson comorbidity index ?4 (OR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.22–3.59; P = 0.008), neutropenia (OR = 4.61, 95% CI 1.42–15.00; P = 0.011) and treatment with an azole-based regimen (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17–0.90; P = 0.028) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. A total of 33.9% of isolates were non-susceptible to fluconazole (MIC 50 , 2 mg/L; MIC 90 , 16 mg/L; MIC range, 0.25 to &gt;256 mg/L), whilst 56.9% to voriconazole (MIC 50 , 0.25 mg/L; MIC 90 , 1 mg/L; MIC range, 0.015 to &gt;8 mg/L) according to CLSI clinical breakpoints. There was no significant correlation between overall mortality and MICs of fluconazole or voriconazole. This study showed high mortality in patients with C. tropicalis fungaemia, and azole-based antifungal treatment could improve outcomes regardless of fluconazole MICs of infecting isolates compared with patients without any treatment within 48 h. ? 2018","amphotericin B; anidulafungin; caspofungin; fluconazole; flucytosine; itraconazole; micafungin; posaconazole; triazole derivative; voriconazole; antifungal agent; fluconazole; voriconazole; adult; antifungal susceptibility; Article; Candida tropicalis; candidemia; Charlson Comorbidity Index; controlled study; demography; female; human; major clinical study; male; MIC50; MIC90; minimum inhibitory concentration; mortality; neutropenia; nonhuman; priority journal; retrospective study; Taiwan; aged; antifungal resistance; Candida tropicalis; candidiasis; clinical trial; drug effect; fungemia; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; middle aged; multicenter study; Aged; Antifungal Agents; Candida tropicalis; Candidiasis; Drug Resistance, Fungal; Female; Fluconazole; Fungemia; Humans; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Voriconazole"
"Using the pleiotropic characteristics of curcumin to validate the potential application of a novel gene expression screening platform",2019,"Curcumin is a polyphenol derived from curcumin longa that exhibits anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. The consumption of foods at supernutritional levels to obtain health benefits may paradoxically result in negative health outcomes. In the present study, multiple targeting characteristics of curcumin were analyzed using our gene expression screening system, which utilized the gene expression signatures of curcumin from human hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer cells to query gene expression databases and effectively identify the molecular actions of curcumin. In agreement with prediction, curcumin inhibited NF-κB and Aurora-A, and induced G2/Marrest and apoptosis. Curcumin-suppressed NF-κB was identified through inhibition of PLCG1, PIK3R1, and MALT1 in the CD4-T-cell-receptor-signaling NF-κB cascade pathway. The results suggest that our novel gene expression screening platform is an effective method of rapidly identifying unknown biological functions and side effects of compounds with potential nutraceutical benefits. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated enterovirus A71 vaccine in children 3–6?years and 2–35?months of age- an open-label, randomized phase IIb clinical trial",2019,"Background: Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) infection can cause severe debilitating complications and even death in young children. The immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated whole EV-A71 virus vaccine were assessed in children 2 months to 6 years of age. Methods: This was an open-label, multi-center and randomized phase IIb study, which divided into part A and B. In part A, children 36 months to 6 years of age were enrolled and randomized into 3 groups, receiving 0.5 μg total viral protein (TP) with adjuvant Al(OH)3, 1.0 μg TP with Al(OH)3 or 1.0 μg TP only. Two doses of vaccines were administered at a 28-day interval and blood was taken before immunization, at week 4, 8, 28 and 52 (optional) for virus neutralization assay. Safety profiles were also monitored. After safety profiles had shown no concerns, children 2 months to 35 months of age (part B) were subsequently enrolled following the same protocol. Results: A total of 135 children completed two doses of immunization, including 58 in part A and 77 in part B. Both adjuvanted 0.5 μg and 1.0 μg TP elicited significant raise of neutralizing antibody titers and seroconversion rate was up to 93.75–100.0% after 2 doses of immunization. Adjuvanted 1.0 μg TP induced higher titers of neutralizing antibodies than adjuvanted 0.5 μg TP. By contrast, non-adjuvanted 1.0 μg TP was not immunogenic. No major adverse events were reported. Conclusions: This EV-A71 vaccine containing adjuvant is immunogenic and safe in children 2 months to 6 years of age. Clinical Trials Registration.

"BA6 induces apoptosis via stimulation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in human lung cancer cells",2019,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world, with a five-year survival rate of less than 30%. Clinically effective chemotherapeutic treatments at the initial stage may eventually face the dilemma of no drug being effective due to drug resistance; therefore, finding new effective drugs for lung cancer treatment is a necessary and important issue. Compounds capable of further increasing the oxidative stress of cancer cells are considered to have anticancer potential because they possessed the ability to induce apoptosis. This study mainly investigated the effects of BA6 (heteronemin), the marine sponge sesterterpene, on lung cancer cell apoptosis, via modulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). BA6 has cellular cytotoxic activities against a variety of cancer cell lines, but it has no effect on nontumor cells. The BA6-treated lung cancer cells show a significant increase in both cellular ROS and mtROS, which in turn caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The increase of oxidative stress in lung cancer cells treated with BA6 was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of antioxidant enzymes Cu/Zn SOD, MnSOD, and catalase. In addition, OXPHOS performed in the mitochondria and glycolysis in the cytoplasm were inhibited, which subsequently reduced downstream ATP production. Pretreatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO reduced BA6-induced apoptosis through the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, which was accompanied by increased cell viability, decreased mtROS, enhanced MMP, and suppressed expression of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins. In conclusion, the results of this study clarify the mechanism of BA6-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, suggesting that it is a potentially innovative alternative to the treatment of human lung cancer.

"Saliva Pepsin Detection and Proton Pump Inhibitor Response in Suspected Laryngopharyngeal Reflux",2019,"Objectives/Hypothesis: To evaluate the prediction value of saliva pepsin detection for an 8-week proton pump inhibitor (PPI) response in patients with a Reflux Symptoms Index (RSI) score ?13, which indicates possible laryngopharyngeal reflux. Study Design: Prospective individual single-cohort study. Methods: Patients were recruited who had experienced chronic laryngopharyngeal symptoms (RSI score ?13) for more than 3 months after excluding other etiologies. The patients received PPI (40 mg of esomeprazole once daily) treatment for 8 weeks. Prior to treatment, the patients submitted saliva/sputum samples that were collected during the time symptoms were observed. The samples were taken for pepsin detection, and performed using the commercially available Peptest lateral flow device. The association of the Peptest results and PPI response were statistically analyzed with the χ 2 test. Results: Seventy-four patients completed the study, and upon completion of PPI treatment, the mean RSI score was significantly reduced from 19.22 ± 5.18 to 8.99 ± 5.69. Forty-four (59.5%) patients exhibited a good response as defined by an RSI score reduction ?50%. The results of the Peptest were semiquantitatively graded as 0, 1, 2, 3 (negative, weak positive, moderate positive and strong positive, respectively) based upon the visual intensity of the test sample line as compared to the control line. Twenty-four patients (32.4%) exhibited grade 3 strong positive results. The Peptest strong positive results (P &lt;.05) were significantly associated with a good PPI response, with the positive predictive value being 79.2%. Conclusions: Analysis of strong positive results for pepsin detection in saliva/sputum samples may be a useful, noninvasive method for predicting better PPI response in patients with suspected reflux induced chronic laryngopharyngeal symptoms.

"Identification and characterization of the lncRNA signature associated with overall survival in patients with neuroblastoma",2019,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a commonly occurring cancer among infants and young children. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been using as prognostic biomarkers for therapeutics and interventions in various cancers. Considering the poor survival of NB, the lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies must be improved. This work proposes an overall survival time estimator called SVR-NB to identify the lncRNA signature that is associated with the overall survival of patients with NB. SVR-NB is an optimized support vector regression (SVR)-based method that uses an inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm for feature selection. The dataset of 231 NB patients that contains overall survival information and expression profiles of 783 lncRNAs was used to design and evaluate SVR-NB from the database of gene expression omnibus accession GSE62564. SVR-NB identified a signature of 35 lncRNAs and achieved a mean squared correlation coefficient of 0.85 and a mean absolute error of 0.56 year between the actual and estimated overall survival time using 10-fold cross-validation. Further, we ranked and characterized the 35 lncRNAs according to their contribution towards the estimation accuracy. Functional annotations and co-expression gene analysis of LOC440896, LINC00632, and IGF2-AS revealed the association of co-expressed genes in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The risk factors of early acetabular failure after bipolar hemiarthroplasty because of fracture of the femoral neck",2019,"Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of leg length discrepancy in geriatric patients with early failure of bipolar hemiarthroplasty and to identify related failure patterns and risk factors. Methods: In this retrospective study, the risk factors of early acetabulum failure within 5 years of hemiarthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fracture were compared with a control group of patients who had implant survival for at least 5 years after hemiarthroplasty. The basic data, leg length discrepancy, femoral offset, and the shell size were evaluated. Results: Of all risk factors, there was a significant difference in increased leg length between the two groups. The mean difference in leg length was 7.8 ± 5.9mm in the early acetabular failure group and ?1.7 ± 6.2mm in the control group. For an increase in leg length of >6mm, the odds ratio of early acetabular failure was 25-fold greater when compared with the control group. Conclusion: Increased leg length was significantly associated with early acetabular failure after bipolar hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture among geriatric patients. It is critical to avoid increase in leg length after bipolar hemiarthroplasty.

"Slide-free imaging of hematoxylin-eosin stained whole-mount tissues using combined third-harmonic generation and three-photon fluorescence microscopy",2019,"Intraoperative margin assessment of surgical tissues during cancer surgery is clinically important, especially in the case of tissue conserving surgery like Mohs micrographic surgery in which minimization of the surgical area is considered crucial. Frozen pathology is the gold standard of assessing excised tissues for signs of remaining cancerous lesions. The current protocol, however, is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Instead of the complex frozen sectioning, staining, and traditional white light microscopy imaging protocol, optically sectioned histopathological imaging of hematoxylin-eosin stained whole-mount skin tissues with a subfemtoliter resolution is demonstrated by using nonlinear microscopy in this study. With our proposed method, the reagents of staining and the contrast of imaging are fully consistent with the current clinical standard of frozen pathology, thus facilitating rapid intraoperative assessment of surgical tissues for future applications.Slide-free nonlinear microscopy imaging of H&E stained whole-mount skin tissue showing the morphology of sweat glands. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"The clinical features and mortality risk factors of cytomegalovirus infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus",2019,"Background: The clinical features and outcomes of cytomegalovirus (CMV) diseases in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are unknown. We analyzed such data from a medical center in Taiwan. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with SLE who were diagnosed with CMV diseases between 2006 and 2016 in Taipei Veterans General Hospital Taiwan. Clinical and laboratory parameters and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results: The study enrolled 56 eligible patients with CMV diseases and separated them into survival (n = 24) and mortality (n = 32) groups. All cases showed a significantly high incidence of pneumonitis (71.43%). The patients in the mortality group had a higher SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI)-2000 (p = 0.009), more cases of recent methylprednisolone pulse therapy (p = 0.013) and pancytopenia (p = 0.001), stronger evidence of CMV infection demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood (p < 0.001) and bronchoalveolar lavage (p = 0.021), and more concurrent infections (bacteremia p = 0.026; fungemia p < 0.001). Conclusions: Recent pulse therapy, pancytopenia, and concurrent infections constituted risk factors for mortality in patients with SLE and CMV infection. Among mortality patients, PCR rather than serological tests (IgM antibodies) helped to arrive at an earlier diagnosis. ? 2018","antibiotic agent; azathioprine; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; immunoglobulin M antibody; methylprednisolone; mycophenolate mofetil; mycophenolic acid; prednisolone; rituximab; steroid; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; all cause mortality; Article; bacteremia; clinical feature; concurrent infection; corticosteroid therapy; cytomegalovirus infection; Cytomegalovirus retinitis; female; fungemia; human; leukopenia; lung lavage; major clinical study; male; medical record review; mixed infection; mortality; mortality risk; observational study; opportunistic infection; pancytopenia; plasmapheresis; polymerase chain reaction; proteinuria; retrospective study; SLEDAI; survival; systemic lupus erythematosus; Taiwan; thrombocytopenia; virus pneumonia; comorbidity; Cytomegalovirus; cytomegalovirus infection; incidence; middle aged; mortality; risk factor; systemic lupus erythematosus; Adult; Comorbidity; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Female; Humans; Incidence; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rituximab; Steroids; Taiwan"
"Early detection of electromechanical dysfunction in patients with idiopathic premature ventricular contractions",2019,"Background: Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) induced by subtle cardiac dysfunction are missed by echocardiography. We evaluated acoustic cardiography for detection of early electromechanical dysfunction in patients with idiopathic PVCs and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and investigated the impact of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in reversing this adverse effect. Methods: Eighty-six patients with PVCs and 33 normal controls having normal LVEF were studied. Fifty PVC patients were in the ablation group and 36 in the nonablation group. %Electromechanical activation time (%EMAT), %left ventricular systolic time (%LVST), third (S3) and fourth heart sound (S4), and systolic dysfunction index (SDI) during sinus rhythm (SR) were measured by acoustic cardiography (Audicor, Inovise Medical, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA) pre- and postablation. In 28?patients, acoustic parameters were compared during SR without PVCs, and SR with single PVC, ? 2 PVCs, or ventricular tachycardia over 10-second Audicor recording in a single patient at different times. Twenty-four-hour acoustic cardiographic and acoustic cardiographic Holter recording were used to assess the impact of PVC burden on electromechanical function in 41 patients. Results: %EMAT, S3, S4, and SDI showed significant worsening in the PVC versus control group. %EMAT and SDI were worsened with increasing PVC number in a 10-second strip. %EMAT showed significant linear increment with increasing PVC burden. There was a significant improvement in %EMAT, %LVST, S3, S4, and SDI postablation in patients with PVCs.

"Association Between Long-term Exposure to PM2.5 and Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes in Taiwan: A National Retrospective Cohort Study",2019,"BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM with an aerodynamic diameter ?2.5 ?m; PM2.5) contributes to an elevated incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in North America and Europe, but there is limited empirical evidence for Asian countries. This study determined the association between and the exposure-response relationship for PM2.5 and the incidence of T2D in Taiwan. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted for the years 2001-2012. Health information, including age, sex, health insurance premium, type of occupation, medication, and disease status, was retrieved from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. Monitoring data for PM2.5 came from the Environmental Protection Administration of Taiwan, and Land-use Regression modeling was used to approximate participants' long-term exposure to PM2.5. Cox proportional hazards models with a generalized estimating equation to account for the correlation within the locations of the medical facilities were used to estimate the association between exposure to PM2.5 and the incidence of T2D, adjusting for the potential confounders. We also examined effect modification of sex, age, hyperlipidemia, and National Health Insurance premium for the association. RESULTS: Forty-eight thousand six hundred eleven new cases of diabetes were identified among 505,151 eligible participants, with the median follow-up of 12 years. Positive associations were identified between long-term exposure to PM2.5 exposure and the incidence of T2D. An increase of 10 μg/m PM2.5 was associated with an 11.0% increase in the risk of contracting diabetes (95% confidence interval = 8.0%, 13.0%). The results show that there is an almost linear relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and the incidence of T2D. Sex, age, hyperlipidemia, and National Health Insurance premium acted as effect modifiers of the association between diabetes incidence and levels of PM2.5 exposure in Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: In the population in Taiwan, long-term exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk of incidence of T2D by 11%. This effect is more pronounced in elderly male patients who exhibit hyperlipidemia and in individuals who have a lower insurance health insurance premium.",""
"Successful treatment with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir plus ribavirin in acute hepatitis C-infected patient with hepatic decompensation",2019,"Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection has evolved rapidly in recent years due to the invention of interferon-free direct antiviral agents (DAAs). However, evidence and recommendations for acute hepatitis C (AHC) virus infection by DAAs are still limited, especially for those whose disease presents with hepatic decompensation. Here, we report a case with genotype 1b AHC virus infection, complicated by hepatic decompensation and the patient received sofosbuvir and daclatasvir plus low dose ribavirin for 12 weeks. Serum hepatitis C virus RNA significantly declines after therapy and became undetectable at week 8 and it remained undetectable at 12 weeks after finishing therapy; sustained virological response was impressed. Our findings support that combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir plus ribavirin can be used for genotype 1b, AHC virus infection patients with overt hepatic decompensation.

"Risk factors for intraoperative hypoxemia during monopulmonary ventilation: an observational study [Fatores de risco para hipoxemia intraoperat?ria durante ventila??o monopulmonar: estudo observacional]",2019,"Background: Left double?lumen endotracheal tubes have been widely used in thoracic, esophageal, vascular, and mediastinal procedures to provide lung separation. Lacking clear objective guidelines, anesthesiologists usually select appropriately sized double?lumen endotracheal tubes based on their experience with 35 and 37 Fr double?lumen endotracheal tubes, which are the most commonly used. We hypothesized the patients with a left main bronchus of shorter length (<40 mm) had a greater chance of experiencing desaturation during one lung ventilation, due to obstruction in the orifice of the left upper lobe with the bronchial tube. Methods: We included 360 patients with a left double?lumen intubated between September 2014 and August 2015. The patient's age, sex, height, weight, and underlying disease were recorded along with type of surgical procedure and the desaturation episodes. In addition, the width of the trachea and the width and length of the left bronchus were measured using computed tomography. Result: Patients with a left main bronchus length of less than 40 mm who underwent intubation with a left double?lumen endotracheal tubes had significantly higher incidence of desaturation (Odds Ratio (OR: 8.087)) during one?lung ventilation. Other related factors of patients identified to be at risk of developing hypoxia were diabetes mellitus (OR: 5.368), right side collapse surgery (OR: 4.933), and BMI (OR: 1.105).

"Albumin-bilirubin grade may determine the outcomes of patients with very early stage hepatocellular carcinoma after radiofrequency ablation therapy",2019,"BACKGROUND: To assess long-term prognoses of patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) < 2?cm (the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer, BCLC stage 0) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 271 patients with BCLC stage 0 HCC who had undergone RFA at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 2002 to 2016. Factors determining poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence after RFA were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: After a median follow-up duration of 43.4 months, 76 patients had died. The cumulative 5- and 10-year OS rates were 67.1% and 56.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis disclosed age > 65 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.608, 95% confidence interval, [CI] 1.015-2.545; p = 0.043), platelet count < 100,000/mm (HR 1.704, 95% CI 1.027-2.828; p = 0.039), and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2 or 3 (HR 2.191, 95% CI 1.261-3.805; p = 0.005) were the independent risk factors predicting worse OS. One-hundred twelve patients had tumor recurrence after undergoing RFA. Multivariate analysis showed that ALBI grade 2 or 3 (HR 1.825, 95% CI 1.288-2.585; p = 0.001) was the only one independent risk factor associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) after RFA. Most of the subgroup analyses also demonstrated that patients with ALBI grade 2 or 3 had poorer OS and RFS than those with ALBI grade 1. CONCLUSION: For patients with BCLC stage 0 HCC, RFA could provide a long-term outcome with a 10-year overall survival rate of 56.4%. Moreover, the ALBI grade can discriminate prognosis in such patients.","bilirubin; serum albumin; aged; blood; cancer staging; female; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; middle aged; mortality; pathology; radiofrequency ablation; retrospective study; survival rate; tumor recurrence; Aged; Bilirubin; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Radiofrequency Ablation; Retrospective Studies; Serum Albumin; Survival Rate"
"Chloramphenicol induces autophagy and inhibits the hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha pathway in non-small cell lung cancer cells",2019,"Chloramphenicol is an inexpensive and excellent bactericidal antibiotic. It is used to combat anaerobic infections in the Third World countries, whereas its systemic application has been abandoned in developed countries. However, in recent years, clinicians have reintroduced chloramphenicol in clinical practice. In this study, chloramphenicol was found to repress the oxygen-labile transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), in hypoxic A549 and H1299 cells. Furthermore, it suppressed the mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 1, eventually decreasing VEGF release. Chloramphenicol initiated the autophagy pathway in treated cells, as observed by the increase in formation of Atg12-Atg5 conjugates, and in beclin-1 and LC3-II levels. The chloramphenicol-mediated HIF-1α degradation was completely reverted by autophagic flux blockage. In HIF-1α-overexpressing cells, the formation of HIF-1α/SENP-1 (Sentrin/SUMO-specific protease 1) protein complex seemed to facilitate the escape of HIF-1α from degradation. Chloramphenicol inhibited HIF-1α/SENP-1 protein interaction, thereby destabilizing HIF-1α protein. The enhancement in HIF-1α degradation due to chloramphenicol was evident during the incubation of the antibiotic before hypoxia and after HIF-1α accumulation. Since HIF-1α plays multiple roles in infections, inflammation, and cancer cell stemness, our findings suggest a potential clinical value of chloramphenicol in the treatment of these conditions. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The long term microbiota and metabolic status in patients with colorectal cancer after curative colon surgery",2019,"Whether there are subsequent changes of metabolic profiles and microbiota status after partial colectomy remains unknown. We evaluated and compared long-term effects of microbiota status and metabolic profiles in early colorectal cancer (CRC) patients after curative colectomy to the controls. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed metabolic syndrome occurrence in 165 patients after curative partial colectomy with right hemicolectomy (RH) or low anterior resection (LAR) and 333 age-sex matched controls. Fecal samples from some of those with RH, LAR, and controls were analyzed by next-generation sequencing method. The occurrences of metabolic syndrome were significantly higher in patients after RH, but not LAR, when compared with the controls over the long term (> 5 years) follow- up (P = 0.020). Compared with control group, RH group showed lower bacterial diversity (P = 0.007), whereas LAR group showed significantly higher bacterial diversity at the genera level (P = 0.016). Compared with the control group, the principal component analysis revealed significant differences in bacterial genera abundance after RH and LAR (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly lower in the RH group than the control group (22.0% versus 49.4%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, early CRC patients after RH but not LAR were associated with a higher occurrence of metabolic syndrome than the controls during long-term follow-up. In parallel with metabolic change, patients with RH showed dysbiosis with a tendency to decreased richness and a significant decrease in the diversity of gut microbiota. ? 2019 Lin et al.

"Id1 and Sonic Hedgehog Mediate Cell Cycle Reentry and Apoptosis Induced by Amyloid Beta-Peptide in Post-mitotic Cortical Neurons",2019,"Amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ), the neurotoxic component of senile plaques in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains, is known to trigger cell cycle reentry in post-mitotic neurons followed by apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, we have reported that Aβs stimulate the expression of inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id1) to induce sonic hedgehog (SHH) (Hung et al., Mol Neurobiol 53(2):793–809, 2016), and both are mitogens capable of triggering cell cycle progression. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that Aβ-induced Id1 and SHH contribute to cell cycle reentry leading to apoptosis in neurons. We found that Aβ triggered cell cycle progression in the post-mitotic neurons, as indicated by the increased expression of two G1-phase markers including cyclin D1 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), two G2-phase markers such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) into newly synthesized DNA, as well as the mitotic marker histone H3 phosphorylated at Ser-10. As expected, Aβ also enhanced caspase-3 cleavage in the cortical neurons. Id1 siRNA, the neutralization antibody against SHH (SHH-Ab), and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 all attenuated, in part or in full, the Aβ-induced expression of these cell cycle markers. Indeed, exogenous recombinant Id1 protein and the biologically active N-terminal fragment of SHH (SHH-N) were both sufficient to enhance the expression of cell cycle markers independent of Aβ. Taken together, our results revealed the critical roles of Id1 and SHH mediating Aβ-dependent cell cycle reentry and subsequently caspase-dependent apoptosis in the fully differentiated post-mitotic neurons, at least in vitro. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[25-35]; broxuridine; caspase 3; cyclin D1; cycline; histone H3; inhibitor of differentiation 1; palbociclib; retinoblastoma protein; small interfering RNA; sonic hedgehog protein; amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta-protein (25-35); cannabidiol; caspase 3; cycline; inhibitor of differentiation 1; neurotoxin; peptide fragment; piperazine derivative; protein kinase inhibitor; pyridine derivative; sonic hedgehog protein; sonic hedgehog protein, rat; amino terminal sequence; apoptosis; Article; brain cell; cell cycle; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle S phase; controlled study; DNA synthesis; mitosis; neurotoxicity; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; animal; apoptosis; biological model; brain cortex; cell culture; drug effect; human; metabolism; mitosis; nerve cell; pathology; phosphorylation; Sprague Dawley rat; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Apoptosis; Cannabidiol; Caspase 3; Cells, Cultured; Cerebral Cortex; Hedgehog Proteins; Humans; Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1; Mitosis; Models, Biological; Neurons; Neurotoxins; Peptide Fragments; Phosphorylation; Piperazines; Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Pyridines; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNA, Small Interfering; S Phase"
"The elderly have similar outcomes compared to younger patients after ORIF with locking plate for comminuted proximal humerus fracture",2019,"Objective: The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of elder and younger patients with comminuted proximal humerus fracture treated with osteosynthesis with locking plate. Methods: A total of 70 patients (30 males and 40 females; mean age 65.4 years) operated on for Neer 3- or 4-part proximal humeral fractures between 2010 and 2016 and followed for at least one-year were included in the study. The reduction was achieved through intraosseous window to minimize soft tissue stripping in all patients and structural allograft at metaphyseal diaphyseal junction was used aggressively to resist varus force. Group 1 consisted of 32 patients aged 70 or older (14 males and 18 females; mean age: 77.8 ± 5.1), while Group 2 consisted of 38 patients younger than 70 (16 males and 22 females; mean age: 58.2 ± 9.3). The groups were compared for their clinical and radiological outcomes. Results: There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes by Oxford score (54.8 ± 2.7 vs 56.6 ± 3.4, p = 0.13) and ASES score (89.7 ± 5.7 vs 90.8 ± 8.2, p = 0.68). Two groups had similar radiological outcomes regarding neck shaft angle, greater tip height and offset. However, group 2 had better final shoulder forward elevation (162.6 ± 8.7 vs 135.4 ± 14.7?, p < 0.05) and shorter duration to achieve maximal range of motion (4.37 ± 2.37 vs 8.14 ± 3.25 months, p < 0.05) than group 1. Two groups had similar complication rates (9.4% vs 7.9%). All the complications were related to greater tuberosity including mal-reduction and avulsion. Conclusion: With the prerequisite of good alignment with robust medial cortical support and untouched soft tissue over medial metaphysis area via intra-osseous reduction, comminution of proximal humeral fracture can achieve satisfactory result and low complication rate by osteosynthesis with locking plate system, regardless of age. In addition, we suggested to use structural bone graft for comminuted medial cortex fracture with multiple fragments or bony defect more than 2 cm.

"Effect of weight loss on the estimated glomerular filtration rates of obese patients at risk of chronic kidney disease: the RIGOR-TMU study",2019,"Background: Weight-reduction therapies, including bariatric surgery (BS), are standard treatments for severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes; however, the outcomes of these therapies are inconclusive for obese patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to investigate the effects of BS or non-surgical interventions on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and to determine whether BS can be recommended for renal function preservation based on body mass index (BMI) and eGFR changes in obese patients with CKD. Methods: This study used data from the weight Reduction Intervention on GFR in Obese Patients with Renal Impairment-Taipei Medical University (TMU) study, which was a large, long-term, propensity score-matched cohort study based on clinical data from patients who registered at weight-reduction centres at TMU and its affiliated hospitals from 2008 to 2016. The patients were stratified according to whether they had undergone BS and into the mild, moderate, and high CKD risk groups using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. The primary outcome was the eGFR calculated using the Taiwan Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Cox regression models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for eGFR decreases ?25%. Results: A total of 4332 obese patients were enrolled in this study. After propensity score matching, 1620 patients, including 60.2% women, with a mean age of 36.5 (9.9) years were divided into BS or non-surgery groups (n = 810 per group). The overall mean eGFRs increased by 4.4 (14) mL/min·1.73 m2 and decreased by 6.4 (16.0) mL/min·1.73 m2 in the BS and non-surgery groups, respectively. The decrease in BMI in the BS and non-surgery groups were 2.5 and 1.3 kg/m2, respectively. In the moderate/high CKD risk BS group, a significant correlation was evident between an increased eGFR and a reduced BMI (Spearman's correlation ?0.229, P &lt; 0.001). The Cox regression analysis showed that the BS group had a significantly lower risk of an eGFR decline ?25% at 12 months [adjusted HR (aHR) 0.47, P = 0.03). After BS, obese patients with hypertension or albuminuria had significantly lower risks of eGFR declines ?25% (aHR 0.37, P = 0.02 and aHR 0.13, P = 0.0018, respectively). Conclusions: Bariatric surgery was associated with eGFR preservation in all obese patients and, particularly, in those with moderate-to-high CKD risks. A longer term outcome study is warranted to determine the benefits of BS for CKD patients. ? 2019 The Authors.

"A performance guide for major risk factors control in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in Taiwan",2019,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease, carries a high morbidity and mortality. Risk factor control is especially important for patients with ASCVD to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines have been developed by the Taiwan Society of Cardiology, Taiwan Society of Lipids and Atherosclerosis, and Diabetes Association of Republic of China (Taiwan)to assist health care professionals in Taiwan about the control of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus. This article is to highlight the recommendations about blood pressure, cholesterol, and sugar control for ASCVD. Some medications that are beneficial for ASCVD were also reviewed. We hope the clinical outcomes of ASCVD can be improved in Taiwan through the implementation of these recommendations. ? 2019",""
"Combination Therapy with Dipyridamole and Clopidogrel for Secondary Stroke Prevention in Aspirin-Intolerant Patients After Myocardial Infarction: Results of a Nationwide Case-Control Study",2019,"Background and Purpose: Combination therapy with dipyridamole and clopidogrel in stroke prevention and long-term outcomes in aspirin-intolerant patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and previous stroke are unknown. This nationwide study analyzed the impact of dipyridamole and clopidogrel on secondary stroke prevention and long-term outcomes in aspirin-intolerant stroke patients after AMI. Methods: This was a nationwide, case-control study involving 186,112 first AMI patients, 78,607 of whom had a previous history of stroke. In the final analysis, we included 4637 patients taking clopidogrel alone and 208 patients using a combination of clopidogrel and dipyridamole. Results: The 12-year survival rate was not different between clopidogrel and clopidogrel–dipyridamole groups (log-rank p = 0.6247). Furthermore, there were no differences in event-free survival after stroke (log-rank p = 0.6842), gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (log-rank p = 0.9539), or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; log-rank p = 0.6191) between the two groups. Dipyridamole did not contribute significantly to AMI survival (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.84–1.15), and did not show benefits in any of the subgroups regardless of sex, age (younger or older than 75 years), comorbidities, percutaneous coronary intervention, or medications. Conclusion: No differences were observed in the 12-year survival rate between clopidogrel and clopidogrel–dipyridamole groups. The two groups had balanced event-free survival in recurrent stroke, ICH, GI bleeding, and myocardial infarction. ? 2019, The Author(s).","acetylsalicylic acid; aldosterone antagonist; angiotensin receptor antagonist; atropine; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; clopidogrel; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipyridamole; dopamine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; nicorandil; nitric acid derivative; aged; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cardiovascular mortality; case control study; comorbidity; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug hypersensitivity; drug safety; dual antiplatelet therapy; event free survival; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; human; major clinical study; male; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; secondary prevention; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; survival rate; survival time; treatment outcome"
"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and suicidality: The mediating effects of psychiatric comorbidities and family function",2019,"Objective: To explore the association between Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) and suicidality in children. Mediating effects of family function and psychiatric co-morbidities were also explored. Methods: This is a national representative cross-sectional survey of school-based sample of 4739 children aged 7–15. Logistic regression was used to assess the excess risks of suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempts) in 412 children with ADHD. Serial multiple mediator models were conducted to assess the mediating effects of family function and psychiatric comorbidities. Results: The prevalence of suicidality in children with ADHD was approximately 20% in Taiwan. After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of suicidality among children with ADHD was approximately four times higher than among non-ADHD children [(adjusted Odds Ratio [“OR”] = 3.82, 95% Confidence Interval (“CI”) (2.73, 5.34)] for suicidal ideation, adjusted OR = 4.18, 95% CI (2.57, 6.80) for suicide plan and adjusted OR = 4.45, 95% CI (1.99, 9.93) for suicide attempts. The mediating effects of anxiety/depression and conduct problems were about 20% and 8%, respectively, across all suicide outcomes. The mediating effects of family function were around 6–7% for suicidal ideation and 16–18% for suicide plan and suicide attempts. The effects of ADHD on suicidality, in general, remained after considering the mediating roles of family function and psychiatric comorbid conditions. Conclusions: Children with ADHD are at a high risk of suicide. Although the family function and psychiatric co-morbidities partially mediate this association, ADHD in itself is a potent suicide risk factor and should be an important target for suicide prevention. ? 2018","adolescent; anxiety; Article; attention deficit disorder; child; comorbidity; depression; family functioning; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; prevalence; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; Taiwan; attention deficit disorder; automutilation; cross-sectional study; depression; odds ratio; psychology; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; suicidal ideation; suicide; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Self-Injurious Behavior; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted; Taiwan"
"Reinforcement of patient education improved physicians’ adherence to guideline-recommended medical therapy after acute coronary syndrome",2019,"Background Prescription of guideline-recommended medicines after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been suboptimal. Tools for improving the use of medications have been developed, but they mainly targeted physicians. Objective We evaluated the effects of reinforcement of patient and family education on the usage of guideline-recommended secondary prevention medications. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected registry of patients with ACS who were admitted to a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan between February 2015 and April 2017. The control group included 76 patients discharged before implementing the electronic-based patient and family education (PFE) system. The intervention group included 206 patients discharged after implementation. The primary outcome was the prescription rate of all four guideline-recommended drugs. Predictors of adherence were also evaluated. Results The study cohort included 282 ACS patients (188 men and 94 women) with a mean age of 68.5 years (standard deviation, 14.2). The intervention group patients were younger, had more family history of premature cardiovascular disease, more dyslipidemia, and underwent more reperfusion therapy. The intervention group was prescribed more guideline-recommended drugs than the control group: dual antiplatelet agents, 79.61% vs. 47.37% (p<0.001); statins, 74.76% vs. 34.21% (p<0.001); beta-blockers, 81.07% vs. 46.05% (p<0.001); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, 62.62% vs. 38.16% (p<0.001); and a combination of all four medications, 39.32% vs. 14.47% (p<0.001). After adjusting baseline variables, the PFE system remained a significant contributor to adherence to these drugs use (P = 0.02).

"Aging, cognition, and the brain: effects of age-related variation in white matter integrity on neuropsychological function",2019,"Alterations in brain structure are viewed as neurobiological indicators which are closely tied to cognitive changes in healthy human aging. The current study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to investigate the relationship between age, brain variation in white matter (WM) integrity, and cognitive function. Sixteen younger adults (aged 20–28 years) and 18 healthy older adults (aged 60–75 years) underwent DTI scanning and a standardized battery of neuropsychological measures. Behaviorally, older adults exhibited poorer performance on multiple cognitive measures compared to younger adults. At the neural level, the effects of aging on theWM integrity were evident within interhemispheric (the anterior portion of corpus callosum) and transverse (the right uncinate fasciculus) fibers of the frontal regions, and the cingulum-angular fibers. Our correlation results showed that age-related WM differentially influenced cognitive function, with increased fractional anisotropy values in both the anterior corpus callosum and the right cingulum/angular fibers positively correlated with performance on the visuospatial task in older adults. Moreover, mediation analysis further revealed that the WM tract integrity of the frontal interhemspheric fibers was a significant mediator of age–visuospatial performance relation in older adults, but not in younger adults. These findings support the vulnerability of the frontal WM fibers to normal aging and push forward our understanding of cognitive aging by providing a more integrative view of the neural basis of linkages among aging, cognition, and brain. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; aged; article; cingulum (brain); clinical article; cognition; cognitive aging; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; frontal cortex; genu (corpus callosum); human; male; mediator; middle aged; uncinate fasciculus; young adult"
"Caffeic acid phenethyl ester rescues pulmonary arterial hypertension through the inhibition of AKT/ERK-dependent PDGF/HIF-1α in vitro and in vivo",2019,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by pulmonary arterial proliferation and remodeling, resulting in a specific increase in right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) and, ultimately right ventricular failure. Recent studies have demonstrated that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) exerts a protective role in NF-κB-mediated inflammatory diseases. However, the effect of CAPE on PAH remains to be elucidated. In this study, monocrotaline (MCT) was used to establish PAH in rats. Two weeks after the induction of PAH by MCT, CAPE was administrated by intraperitoneal injection once a day for two weeks. Pulmonary hemodynamic measurements and pulmonary artery morphological assessments were examined. Our results showed that administration of CAPE significantly suppressed MCT-induced vascular remodeling by decreasing the HIF-1α expression and PDGF-BB production, and improved in vivo RV systolic performance in rats. Furthermore, CAPE inhibits hypoxia-and PDGF-BB-induced HIF-1α expression by decreasing the activation of the AKT/ERK pathway, which results in the inhibition of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs) proliferation and prevention of cells resistant to apoptosis. Overall, our data suggest that HIF-1α is regarded as an alternative target for CAPE in addition to NF-κB, and may represent a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of PAH diseases. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Likelihood of a fecal occult blood test uptake among older adults: Comparisons between health professionals and healthcare volunteers based on the health belief model",2019,"Background: Health professionals and healthcare volunteers play a critical role in promoting uptake of the fecal occult blood test (FOBT), which is an effective screening method for colorectal cancer. However, previous studies paid less attention to investigating both groups regarding their intention to undergo the test. This study used the Health Belief Model (HBM) to explore the likelihood of an FOBT uptake among health professionals and healthcare volunteers aged 50 years or older. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted at public health centers in a county in northern Taiwan. Health professionals and healthcare volunteers were invited to complete the questionnaires. Overall, 391 valid questionnaires were obtained (response rate = 93.10%). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the associations among the variables based on the HBM. Results: The HBM explained 45, 44, and 50% of the variance in the likelihood of undergoing an FOBT in all participants, health professionals, and healthcare volunteers, respectively. The explained variance in healthcare volunteers outweighed that of professionals by 6%. Perceived benefits and self-efficacy significantly affected the likelihood of undergoing an FOBT. Self-efficacy significantly mediated the effects of perceived severity, benefits, and barriers on the likelihood of an FOBT uptake. A borderline significant difference in structural coefficients was found across groups. Conclusions: The HBM model was used to examine the likelihood of an FOBT uptake among health professionals and healthcare volunteers, and the results showed that self-efficacy was the optimal predictor of the likelihood of an FOBT uptake, followed by perceived benefits. Future multifactorial interventions to promote FOBT uptake among health professionals and healthcare volunteers aged 50-75 years could include these significant factors. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aged; attitude to health; behavior; colorectal tumor; comparative study; cross-sectional study; early cancer diagnosis; female; health care personnel; human; male; mass screening; middle aged; occult blood; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; self concept; Taiwan; very elderly; volunteer; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Health; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Intention; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Occult Blood; Self Efficacy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Volunteers"
"Factors causing prolonged mechanical ventilation and peri-operative morbidity after robot-assisted coronary artery bypass graft surgery",2019,"Robot-assisted coronary artery bypass graft [robot-assisted (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)] surgery is the latest treatment for coronary artery disease. However, the surgery extensively affects cardiac and pulmonary function, and the risk factors associated with peri-operative morbidity, including prolong mechanical ventilation (PMV), have not been fully examined. In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 382 patients who underwent robot-assisted internal mammary artery harvesting with mini-thoracotomy direct-vision bypass grafting surgery (MIDCABG) from 2005 to 2012 at our tertiary care hospital were included. The definition of PMV was failure to wean from mechanical ventilation more than 48?h after the surgery. Risk factors for PMV, and peri-operative morbidity and mortality were analyzed with a multivariate logistic regression model. Forty-three patients (11.3%) developed PMV after the surgery, and the peri-operative morbidity and mortality rates were 38 and 2.6%, respectively. The risk factors for PMV were age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the duration of one-lung ventilation for MIDCABG (beating time), and peak airway pressure at the end of the surgery. Furthermore, age and anesthesia time were found to be independent risk factors for peri-operative morbidity, whereas age, LVEF, and anesthesia time were the risk factors for peri-operative mortality. These findings may help physicians to properly choose patients for this procedure, and provide more attention to patients with higher risk after surgery to achieve better clinical outcomes. ? 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","adult; age; aged; airway pressure; anesthesia; Article; artificial ventilation; cohort analysis; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle revascularization; human; major clinical study; male; mini thoracotomy direct vision bypass grafting surgery; morbidity; one lung ventilation; operation duration; perioperative period; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; robot assisted surgery; surgical mortality; tertiary health care; thoracotomy; treatment failure; coronary artery bypass graft; follow up; middle aged; morbidity; postoperative care; postoperative complication; procedures; respiratory failure; risk factor; robotics; Taiwan; time factor; trends; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Insufficiency; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Robotics; Taiwan; Time Factors"
"A single-institution study of predisposing factors of patients with BAVMs to flow-related aneurysm",2019,"Background and purpose: The goal of this study was to assess the potential risk factors leading to flow-related aneurysm (FA) formation in patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) in Taiwanese. Methods: We recruited 890 patients with BAVMs: 72 had FA(s) and 818 did not. Several factors were assessed including patient's age, gender, BAVM volume and location, and Spetzler-Martin grade. Results: The 890 patients with BAVM had a mean age of 30 years (range: 2–84), mean BAVM volume of 10.6 mL (range: 0.13–91.4). BAVMs were ruptured in 42% of patients. Compared to BAVM patients without FAs, the 72 patients with FAs had older age (mean 41 yrs vs 31 yrs, p &lt; 0.001); larger average BAVM volume (39.6 mL vs 16.1 mL, p &lt; 0.001). No statistical significance in Spetzler-Martin grades (χ 2 value = 8.687 and p = 0.122) was found in terms of formation of FA. FA demonstrated similar gender distribution and BAVM location distribution (the χ 2 -value was 0.242 and 0.812, respectively). Conclusion: Patients with older age and large BAVM volume are more prone to FA. Gender, BAVM location, and BAVM grade are not statistically significant predisposing factors for FA. ? 2018","adolescent; adult; aged; aneurysm volume; Article; brain arteriovenous malformation; brain artery aneurysm; brain artery aneurysm rupture; brain stem; cerebellum; child; clinical assessment; comparative study; controlled study; coronary risk; disease predisposition; female; flow related aneurysm; frontal lobe; hemodynamic stress; human; major clinical study; male; occipital lobe; outcome assessment; parietal lobe; risk assessment; risk factor; sex allocation; Taiwanese; temporal lobe; thalamus; very elderly; aneurysm; artificial embolization; brain; brain angiography; brain arteriovenous malformation; causality; complication; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; pathology; preschool child; retrospective study; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aneurysm; Brain; Causality; Cerebral Angiography; Child; Child, Preschool; Embolization, Therapeutic; Female; Humans; Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Collagen 1A1 (COL1A1) is a reliable biomarker and putative therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinogenesis and metastasis",2019,"Increasing evidence shows that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a principal cause of cancer-related mortality globally, especially among Asian and African populations. Collagen type I α1 (COL1A1) is the major component of type I collagen. While aberrant expression of COL1A1 and COL1A2 is implicated in numerous cancers, the differential role of COL1A1 in malignant, premalignant and normal tissues remains unclear, and its clinical significance in HCC has not been elucidated. In this study, using bioinformatics analysis of publicly-available HCC microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we determined that COL1A1 is significantly upregulated in HCC tumor tissues in comparison to normal tissues. Our analysis also revealed that COL1A1 confers survival advantage and enhanced oncogenicity on HCC cells. Interestingly, the siRNA-mediated silencing of COL1A1 expression (siCOLIA1) suppressed HCC cells clonogenicity, motility, invasiveness and tumorsphere formation. Concomitantly, siCOL1A1 abrogated Slug-dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and HCC stemness gene-signature, by attenuating expression of stemness markers SOX2, OCT4 and CD133. The present study provides some mechanistic insight into COL1A1 activity in HCC and highlights its putative role as an important diagnostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in early development and metastasis of HCC. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Hypertension and Postoperative Pain: A Prospective Observational Study",2019,"Objectives. The relationship between pain and hypertension is of great pathophysiological and clinical interest in the pain field, but the mechanism is poorly understood. This study used the postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) dose and the visual analysis scale (VAS) score to assess the relationship between pain and hypertension. Methods. In this prospective study in a single-center hospital, 200 participants were enrolled and divided into three groups: normotensive group, hypertension without treatment group, and hypertension with treatment group. The participants scheduled for elective inhalational general anesthesia were interviewed at hospital admission. Results. A significant difference was observed in analgesic dosage on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 between the female normotensive group and female hypertension with treatment group (independent-samples, one-way analysis of covariance, age, and weight as covariates: P=0.021, 0.014, 0.032). No significant differences in the VAS scores and PCA dosages were observed between the male normotensive group and any one of the male hypertensive groups. Conclusion. We agree that hypertensive hypoanalgesia exists in some experimental settings. The mechanism linking postoperative pain and hypertension is far more complex than we initially believed. Therefore, more studies are required to investigate the roles that antihypertensive drugs, sex, and psychological stress play. Antihypertensive drugs may play a crucial role in mediating the relationship between pain and hypertension. Psychosocial factors were discussed but were not examined. ? 2019 Han-Liang Chiang et al.","adult; age; aged; Article; body weight; controlled study; disease association; female; general anesthesia; hospital admission; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; observational study; postoperative nausea and vomiting; postoperative pain; prospective study; sex difference; hypertension; middle aged; postoperative pain; sexual characteristics; analgesic agent; antihypertensive agent; Adult; Aged; Analgesics; Antihypertensive Agents; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Pain, Postoperative; Prospective Studies; Sex Characteristics"
"Systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroid disease – Experience in a single medical center in Taiwan",2019,"Background: To investigate the association of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with thyroid diseases in a medical center in central Taiwan. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort of 2796 SLE patients in a tertiary referral medical center from 2000 to 2013. We screened SLE by catastrophic illness registration from national insurance bureau; and thyroid diseases by ICD 9 codes, then confirmed by thyroid function test, auto-antibody, medical and/or surgical intervention. We compared the rate of hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) in SLE patients and the 11,184 match controls. We calculated the rate of these thyroid diseases and positive antibodies to thyroglobulin (ATGAb), thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) in SLE patients grouped by the presence of overlap syndrome and anti-dsDNA antibody. We also compared the association of thyroid diseases to severe SLE conditions, including renal, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and thrombocytopenia. Results: Compared to the matched controls, the cumulative incidence of thyroid disease, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and AITD, were all higher in SLE patients (p < 0.0001). The average age of SLE patients with thyroid diseases patients were older than those without thyroid diseases (p = 0.002). Those had euthyroid AITD were younger than other patients with thyroid diseases (p = 0.02). Up to 30.3% SLE patients had overlap syndrome and had higher relative risk of thyroid diseases than those without overlap syndrome, in terms of hypothyroidism and AITD, but not hyperthyroidism. SLE patients with thyroid diseases also carry higher risk for severe complications such as renal involvement (p = 0.024) central nervous system involvement (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: SLE patients had significantly higher rate of hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and AITD than the matched control. Among lupus patients, the risks of thyroid diseases are even higher in the presence of overlap syndrome. SLE patients with thyroid diseases had higher risk of renal and CNS involvement. ? 2017","thyroglobulin antibody; thyroid peroxidase antibody; autoantibody; autoantigen; DNA; iodide peroxidase; iron binding protein; thyroglobulin; TPO protein, human; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; autoimmune thyroiditis; central nervous system disease; cohort analysis; disease association; female; human; hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; retrospective study; systemic lupus erythematosus; Taiwan; thrombocytopenia; thyroid disease; age distribution; autoimmune thyroiditis; connective tissue disease; hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism; immunology; incidence; risk; systemic lupus erythematosus; thyroid disease; Adult; Age Distribution; Autoantibodies; Autoantigens; Cohort Studies; DNA; Female; Humans; Hyperthyroidism; Hypothyroidism; Incidence; Iodide Peroxidase; Iron-Binding Proteins; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk; Taiwan; Thyroglobulin; Thyroid Diseases; Thyroiditis, Autoimmune; Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Diseases"
"Spirometric reference values in heathy Chinese adults in Taiwan: The secular changes and comparison with other Asian populations",2020,"Background/purpose: Although the lung function test has played an important role in respiratory care for a long time, valid spirometry reference values in the Chinese population in Taiwan remain to be elucidated. Methods: 2963 healthy Taiwanese subjects aged 21 to 88 years (1765 males, 59.6%) from February 2015 to February 2017 were enrolled. The subjects attempted to meet the 2005 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines when performing forced expiratory spirograms. We would like to establish the spirometry predictive equations for forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, and lower limit of normal (LLN) in Taiwan and compare with other Asian populations. Results: We established the spirometry predictive equations using a linear model for the entire population, using age and height as independent variables, which best predicted all spirometry parameters for sea level and highland subjects. We found that the values of FEV1 and FVC for the Taiwanese subjects in our study were systematically lower than those reported in South Korea, Japan, and China, but higher than the values in Yang's 1993 and Pan's 1997 Taiwan study. Conclusion: This study addressed the up-to-date spirometry reference equations and values for a healthy adult Chinese population in Taiwan. ? 2019","adult; aged; article; China; controlled study; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; height; human; human experiment; independent variable; Japan; lung function; major clinical study; male; practice guideline; reference value; respiratory system; sea level; South Korea; spirography; spirometry; Taiwanese; female"
"Cellular prion protein transcriptionally regulated by NFIL3 enhances lung cancer cell lamellipodium formation and migration through JNK signaling",2020,"Tumor invasion and metastasis are the major causes of treatment failure and mortality in lung cancer patients. In this study, we identified a group of genes with differential expression in in situ and invasive lung adenocarcinoma tissues by expression profiling; among these genes we further characterized the association of the upregulation of PRNP, the gene encoding cellular Prion protein (PrPc), with lung adenocarcinoma invasiveness. Immunohistochemistry on clinical specimens showed an association of PrPc expression with invasive but not in situ lung adenocarcinoma. Consistently, the expression of PrPc was higher in the highly invasive than in the lowly invasive lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Knockdown of PrPc expression in cultured lung adenocarcinoma cells decreased their lamellipodium formation, in vitro migration and invasion, and in vivo experimental lung metastasis. Phosphorylation of JNKs was found to correlate with PrPc expression and the inhibition of JNKs suppressed the PrPc-induced up-regulation of lamellipodium formation, cell migration, and invasion. Moreover, we identified the nuclear factor, interleukin 3 regulated (NFIL3) protein as a transcriptional activator of the PRNP promoter. Accordingly, NFIL3 promoted lung cancer cell migration and invasion in a PrPc-dependent manner. High NFIL3 expression in clinical specimens of lung adenocarcinoma was also associated with tumor invasiveness. Overall, our observations suggest that the NFIL3/PrPc axis, through regulating lamellipodium formation and cell mobility via JNK signaling, plays a critical role in lung cancer invasiveness and metastasis. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",""
"Comparison of clinical characteristics of bacteremia from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica and other carbapenem-resistant, non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli at a tertiary medical center",2019,"Background: Acquired carbapenem resistance among non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB), such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex (ACB complex), is a serious problem in nosocomial infections. We previously reported that patients infected with the intrinsically carbapenem-resistant Elizabethkingia meningoseptica were associated with high mortality. However, little information is available regarding the clinical outcome of E. meningoseptica bacteremia when compared to that of other carbapenem-resistant NFGNB. Methods: We conducted an observational study that included consecutive patients with E. meningoseptica, carbapenem-resistant ACB complex, carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteremia at a Taiwanese medical center in 2015. We compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients with E. meningoseptica bacteremia and those with other carbapenem-resistant NFGNB bacteremia. Results: We identified 30 patients with E. meningoseptica, 71 with carbapenem-resistant ACB complex, 25 with S. maltophilia, and 17 with carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa bacteremia. The clinical characteristics, disease severity, and previous antibiotic exposures were similar between patients with bacteremia either due to E. meningoseptica or other carbapenem-resistant NFGNB. Patients with E. meningoseptica bacteremia had a higher rate of appropriate empirical antibiotics than those with other carbapenem-resistant NFGNB and was less associated with central venous catheterization. The 28-day mortality rates were similar between patients with E. meningoseptica and the other carbapenem-resistant NFGNB bacteremia (46.7% vs 46%, p = 0.949). Conclusion: The mortality rate of E. meningoseptica bacteremia was as high as other carbapenem-resistant NFGNB infections. The emerging E. meningoseptica infection calls for active surveillance and continued awareness from clinical physicians for this serious carbapenem-resistant infection. ? 2018","antibiotic agent; antifungal agent; cotrimoxazole; levofloxacin; piperacillin plus tazobactam; antiinfective agent; carbapenem derivative; adult; age; aged; antibiotic sensitivity; antibiotic therapy; APACHE; Article; bacteremia; carbapenem resistance; central venous catheterization; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical outcome; community acquired infection; disease severity; drug exposure; Elizabethkingia meningoseptica; Elizabethkingia meningoseptica infection; female; Gram negative bacterium; Gram negative bacterium infection; hematologic malignancy; hemodialysis; hospital infection; hospital mortality; human; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; neutropenia; non-fermenting Gram-negative bacterium; observational study; pleura effusion; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; retrospective study; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; survival; antibiotic resistance; bacteremia; Chryseobacterium; drug effect; Flavobacteriaceae infection; Gram negative bacterium; Gram negative infection; immunology; Kaplan Meier method; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; middle aged; mortality; odds ratio; pathogenicity; Taiwan; tertiary care center; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Carbapenems; Chryseobacterium; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Female; Flavobacteriaceae Infections; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Retrospective Studies; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Taiwan; Tertiary Care Centers"
"Downregulating Notch counteracts Kras G12D -induced ERK activation and oxidative phosphorylation in myeloproliferative neoplasm",2019,"The Notch signaling pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of human cancers, including hematopoietic malignancies. Its functions are highly dependent on the specific cellular context. Gain-of-function NOTCH1 mutations are prevalent in human T-cell leukemia, while loss of Notch signaling is reported in myeloid leukemias. Here, we report a novel oncogenic function of Notch signaling in oncogenic Kras-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). We find that downregulation of Notch signaling in hematopoietic cells via DNMAML expression or Pofut1 deletion significantly blocks MPN development in Kras G12D mice in a cell-autonomous manner. Further mechanistic studies indicate that inhibition of Notch signaling upregulates Dusp1, a dual phosphatase that inactivates p-ERK, and downregulates cytokine-evoked ERK activation in Kras G12D cells. Moreover, mitochondrial metabolism is greatly enhanced in Kras G12D cells but significantly reprogrammed by DNMAML close to that in control cells. Consequently, cell proliferation and expanded myeloid compartment in Kras G12D mice are significantly reduced. Consistent with these findings, combined inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation effectively inhibited the growth of human and mouse leukemia cells in vitro. Our study provides a strong rational to target both ERK signaling and aberrant metabolism in oncogenic Ras-driven myeloid leukemia. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","cytokine; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase 1; Notch receptor; oligomycin; selumetinib; cytokine; KRAS protein, human; mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase 1; Notch receptor; protein p21; animal cell; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cell expansion; cell proliferation; controlled study; DNMAML gene; down regulation; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug response; enzyme activation; female; gene; gene activation; gene deletion; gene expression; gene targeting; genetic association; hematopoietic cell; human; human cell; in vitro study; male; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; myeloproliferative neoplasm; nonhuman; Notch signaling; oncogene K ras; oxidative phosphorylation; Pofut1 gene; priority journal; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; genetics; MAPK signaling; mitochondrion; mutation; myeloid leukemia; myeloproliferative disorder; oxidative phosphorylation; signal transduction; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cytokines; Down-Regulation; Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1; Leukemia, Myeloid; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria; Mutation; Myeloproliferative Disorders; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Receptors, Notch; Signal Transduction; Up-Regulation"
"Improving outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by taking beta-blockers after acute myocardial infarction: a nationwide observational study",2019,"β-Blockers are a standard therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to their better short-term and long-term outcomes. However, β-blockers are often under-prescribed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with AMI, since they are thought be related to bronchospasm. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the usage of β-blockers and the risk of mortality in COPD patients after first AMI via a nationwide, population-based cohort study. In this retrospective study, we identified 186,326 patients with AMI diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2012, 23,116 of whom had COPD, from the National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 7609 patients (32.92%) were prescribed β-blockers, while 15,507 were not. The β-blocker patients were stratified into selective and non-selective β-blocker groups. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Selective β-blocker use showed a reduced risk of mortality, as compared with patients without β-blockers (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.89–0.98; p < 0.01) while non-selective β-blocker groups did not increase the risk of mortality compared to the patients without β-blockers (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.94–1.02; p = 0.38). In addition, the use of β-blockers was found to be associated with a reduced risk of mortality in most stratified analyses which was seen particularly in males, patients aged 65?years and above, and in individuals with an array of comorbidities. These findings suggest that β-blockers improve overall survival among COPD patients after first AMI. ? 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; acute heart infarction; aged; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; drug effect; drug use; female; follow up; human; ICD-9; long term survival; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; mortality risk; observational study; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; risk reduction; Taiwan; treatment duration; acute disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; complication; heart infarction; hospitalization; mortality; multivariate analysis; proportional hazards model; very elderly; Acute Disease; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Calcium Channel Blockers; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Myocardial Infarction; Proportional Hazards Models; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan"
"The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: Chronic primary pain",2019,"This article describes a proposal for the new diagnosis of chronic primary pain (CPP) in ICD-11. Chronic primary pain is chosen when pain has persisted for more than 3 months and is associated with significant emotional distress and/or functional disability, and the pain is not better accounted for by another condition. As with all pain, the article assumes a biopsychosocial framework for understanding CPP, which means all subtypes of the diagnosis are considered to be multifactorial in nature, with biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to each. Unlike the perspectives found in DSM-5 and ICD-10, the diagnosis of CPP is considered to be appropriate independently of identified biological or psychological contributors, unless another diagnosis would better account for the presenting symptoms. Such other diagnoses are called ""chronic secondary pain"" where pain may at least initially be conceived as a symptom secondary to an underlying disease. The goal here is to create a classification that is useful in both primary care and specialized pain management settings for the development of individualized management plans, and to assist both clinicians and researchers by providing a more accurate description of each diagnostic category. ? 2018 The Author(s).","analgesic agent; abdominal pain; analgesia; chronic burning mouth pain; chronic pain; chronic primary abdominal pain syndrome; chronic primary bladder pain syndrome; chronic primary chest pain syndrome; chronic primary epigastric pain syndrome; chronic primary visceral pain; chronic tension headache; classification; complex regional pain syndrome; cystalgia; epigastric pain; fibromyalgia; human; ICD-11; international association for the study of pain classification; irritable colon; jaw disease; musculoskeletal pain; orofacial pain; pelvis pain syndrome; personalized medicine; primary headache; primary medical care; priority journal; Review; thorax pain; transformed migraine; trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia; visceral pain; analgesia; chronic pain; International Classification of Diseases; Chronic Pain; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Pain Management"
"Therapeutic Effect of Modulating TREM-1 via Anti-inflammation and Autophagy in Parkinson's Disease",2019,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and neuroinflammation has been identified as one of its key pathological characteristics. Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) amplify the inflammatory response and play a role in sepsis and cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that the attenuation of TREM-1 activity produces cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages. However, no study has examined the role of TREM-1 in neurodegeneration. We showed that LP17, a synthetic peptide blocker of TREM-1, significantly inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cascades of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2, and nuclear factor-kappa B. Moreover, LP17 enhanced the LPS-induced upregulation of autophagy-related proteins such as light chain-3 and histone deacetylase-6. We also knocked down TREM-1 expression in a BV2 cell model to further confirm the role of TREM-1. LP17 inhibited 6-hydroxydopamine-induced locomotor deficit and iNOS messenger RNA expression in zebrafish. We also observed therapeutic effects of LP17 administration in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced PD syndrome using a rat model. These data suggest that the attenuation of TREM-1 could ameliorate neuroinflammatory responses in PD and that this neuroprotective effect might occur via the activation of autophagy and anti-inflammatory pathways. ? 2019 Feng, Chen, Sung, Kuo, Yang, Chen, Hung, Chen, Wen and Chen.

"ASTRIS: A global real-world study of osimertinib in >3000 patients with EGFR T790M positive non-small-cell lung cancer",2019,"Aim: Osimertinib is a third-generation, irreversible, oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We report real-world effectiveness and safety data. Patients & methods: EGFR T790M positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer adults, who received ?1 prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, received osimertinib 80 mg daily. Primary effectiveness outcome: overall survival. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included: investigator-assessed clinical response, progression-free survival, time-to-treatment discontinuation. Results: At data cutoff, 3015 patients had enrolled: 57.1% had investigator-assessed response (95% CI: 55.2-58.9). Median progression-free survival: 11.1 months (95% CI: 11.0-12.0) and median time-to-treatment discontinuation: 13.5 months (95% CI: 12.6-13.9). Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis-like events reported in 28 (1%) patients. Conclusion: Osimertinib demonstrated clinical effectiveness similar to efficacy observed in the clinical trial program with no new safety signals. Osimertinib is a drug used to treat a type of non-small-cell lung cancer with a change (mutation) in a gene called EGFR. We studied 3015 adults with non-small-cell lung cancer containing a specific EGFR mutation called T790M. The patients had osimertinib treatment once a day. Prior to receiving a new supply of tablets (every 6 weeks), patients were checked to see if the osimertinib treatment was helping to treat their cancer and if they were experiencing any side effects. Osimertinib appeared to reduce the size of cancerous growths (tumors) in most patients (57%). On average, patients had 11.1 months of osimertinib treatment before their cancer worsened. The effectiveness and side effects of osimertinib treatment seen in this study were similar to previous studies with osimertinib. ? 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.","afatinib; antineoplastic agent; avitinib; azd 3759; dacomitinib; epidermal growth factor receptor; epitinib; erlotinib; gefitinib; icotinib; nazartinib; osimertinib; poziotinib; rociletinib; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Article; brain infarction; cancer immunotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; central nervous system metastasis; deep vein thrombosis; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; dyspnea; female; fever; human; interstitial lung disease; lung embolism; lung infection; lung surgery; major clinical study; male; nausea; non small cell lung cancer; open study; outcome assessment; overall survival; pleura effusion; pneumonia; priority journal; progression free survival; QT prolongation; sample size; thrombocytopenia; treatment response; vomiting"
"Mortality associated with statins in men with advanced prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy",2019,"Objectives: Before launching large clinical trials to confirm the effects of statins in improving outcomes among men with prostate cancer (PC), the most appropriate target patient population and the type of statins need to be clearly identified. Patients and methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan Cancer Registry of 2008–2014. This study included 5749 men with locally advanced and metastatic PC who received only androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the first year after their cancer diagnosis. Statin users were defined as anyone who was prescribed statins for >28 days. An inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox model was used to estimate the effects of statin use on all-cause mortality and PC-specific mortality (PCSM) while treating the statin status as a time-dependent variable. Results: Overall, 2259 patients died, and 1495 of them died of PC during a median follow-up of 3.6 years from 1 year after their diagnosis. Statin use was associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70–0.86) and PCSM (HR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.68–0.86) for metastatic disease and all-cause mortality (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.54–0.81) for locally advanced disease. Patients who received atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin or pitavastatin showed a stronger reduction in mortality than those who received other statins. Benefits of statins were consistently observed in men who received post-diagnostic statins, even in those with high comorbidities or an old age. Conclusions: Our results suggest that only atorvastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin were associated with improved survival in advanced PC patients receiving ADT. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","antiandrogen; atorvastatin; fluindostatin; gonadorelin agonist; gonadorelin antagonist; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; mevinolin; pitavastatin; pravastatin; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; adult; advanced cancer; age; aged; all cause mortality; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer survival; cohort analysis; comorbidity; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; metastasis; mortality risk; overall survival; priority journal; prostate cancer; retrospective study"
"Effects of intratracheal captopril on severely meconium-injured piglet lungs",2019,"Background: Severe meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) may cause intractable respiratory failure in neonates. Targeting the renin-angiotensin system may be an effective way to treat such pulmonary dysfunction. Captopril has the potential to mitigate the severity of lung injury by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme. Methods: Twelve newborn piglets were intratracheally instilled with human meconium to induce severe MAS and were randomly treated with IT administration of captopril (0.5mg/kg) (IT-Cap group, n = 6), or sham air instillation (Control group, n = 6). Cardiopulmonary profiles were monitored for a total of 5 hours. Pulmonary history was examined to compare lung injury severity between groups. Results: There were no significant differences between the two study groups in gas exchange and lung compliance, peak inspiratory pressure, heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure over the 5-h experimental period, but there were trends toward lower blood pressure and pH in the IT-Cap group. Histopathological examinations revealed significantly higher lung injury scores in the dependent site of the control group than in the nondependent site of the control group and both sites of the IT-Cap group. Conclusion: Intratracheal captopril did not present significant beneficial effects on severe meconium-injured lungs within 5 hours after injury. Further studies with different disease severities and dosing strategies are required.

"Symptom severity, symptom interference and use of complementary and alternative medicine among survivors of colorectal and breast cancer after curative treatment in Taiwan",2019,"This study compared symptom severity, symptom interference and use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) between cancer survivors after curative treatment and individuals who did not have cancer. Factors associated with CAM use among cancer survivors were examined. A cross-sectional survey was conducted of 146 cancer survivors (77 breast and 69 colorectal cancer survivors who had completed conventional treatment 1–5?years previously and were cancer-free) from a hospital's cancer registration system (survivor group), and 161 healthy individuals without cancer (comparison group). The two groups were frequency-matched for sex and age. Findings indicated higher use of CAM in the survivor group (54.1%) than the comparison group (36.6%). There were no significant differences in overall symptom severity and interference between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression showed that prior use of CAM (OR?=?5.14, 95% CI: 2.34–10.69) and higher symptom interference (OR?=?1.04, 95% CI: 1.001–1.08) were positively related to CAM use in the survivor group. The survivors did not have higher symptom severity and symptom interference with daily life, but were more likely to use CAM than the comparison group. Medical staff should discuss symptom interference and use of CAM with cancer survivors to guide them in the appropriate use of CAM. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; alternative medicine; breast tumor; cancer survivor; case control study; colorectal tumor; cross-sectional study; fatigue; female; human; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pain; pathophysiology; questionnaire; severity of illness index; sleep disorder; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Adult; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Case-Control Studies; Colorectal Neoplasms; Complementary Therapies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pain; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep Wake Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"
"Decreased cerebral blood flow and improved cognitive function in patients with end-stage renal disease after peritoneal dialysis: An arterial spin-labelling study",2019,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between cognitive impairment and brain perfusion using arterial spin labelling (ASL) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing PD. Methods: ESRD patients undergoing PD were recruited. Laboratory screening, neuropsychological tests and ASL magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were conducted prior to and after 6 months of PD. Age- and sex-matched normal subjects without ESRD served as the control group. Comparisons of regional CBF between ESRD patients before or after undergoing PD and normal controls were performed. Correlations between biochemical, neuropsychological and CBF data were also conducted to evaluate the relationships. Results: ESRD patients showed poor performance in many of the neuropsychological tests; PD improved cognition in some domains. Pre-PD patients had higher mean CBF than post-PD patients and normal controls, but no significant difference was found between the normal controls and post-PD patients. Negative correlations were observed pre-PD (regional CBF in left hippocampus vs. perseverative responses, r = -0.662, p = 0.014), post-PD (mean CBF vs. haemoglobin level, r = -0.766, p = 0.002), and before and after PD (change in CBF in the left putamen vs. change in haematocrit percentage, r = -0.808, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Before PD, ESRD patients had increased cerebral perfusion that was related to poorer executive function, especially in the left hippocampus. Post-PD patients performed better in some cognitive test domains than pre-PD patients. The degree of anaemia, i.e., haemoglobin level or haematocrit percentage, might predict cognitive impairment in PD patients. Key Points: ? In this study, ESRD patients before PD had cerebral hyperperfusion that was related to poorer executive function. ? Post-PD patients performed better in some cognitive test domains than pre-PD patients did. ? The degree of anaemia might predict cognitive impairment in PD patients. ? 2018, The Author(s).","hemoglobin; spin label; adult; anemia; arterial spin labeling; Article; brain blood flow; brain perfusion; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; end stage renal disease; executive function; female; hematocrit; hemoglobin blood level; human; image analysis; laboratory test; left hippocampus; male; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome variable; peritoneal dialysis; priority journal; prospective study; brain; brain circulation; chronic kidney failure; cognition; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; Brain; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Peritoneal Dialysis; Spin Labels"
"Epstein-Barr virus induces expression of the LPAM-1 integrin in B cells in vitro and in vivo",2019,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects the oropharynx but, surprisingly, frequently induces B cell proliferation in the gut of immunosuppressed individuals. We found that EBV infection in vitro induces the expression of the LPAM-1 integrin on tonsillar B cells and increases it on peripheral blood cells. Similarly, LPAM-1 was induced in the tonsils of patients undergoing primary infectious mononucleosis. EBV-induced LPAM-1 bound to the MAdCAM-1 addressin, which allows B cell homing to the gastrointestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Thus, we hypothesized that EBV-induced LPAM-1 could induce relocation of infected B cells from the tonsil to the GALT. In situ hybridization with an EBER-specific probe revealed the frequent presence of EBV-infected cells in the pericolic lymph nodes of healthy individuals. Relocation of infected B cells into the GALT would expand the EBV reservoir, possibly protecting it from T cells primed in the oropharynx, and explain why EBV induces lymphoid tumors in the gut. IMPORTANCE EBV causes tumors in multiple organs, particularly in the oro- and na-sopharyngeal area but also in the digestive system. This virus enters the body in the oropharynx and establishes a chronic infection in this area. The observation that the virus causes tumors in the digestive system implies that the infected cells can move to this organ. We found that EBV infection induces the expression of integrin beta 7 (ITGB7), an integrin that associates with integrin alpha 4 to form the LPAM-1 dimer. LPAM-1 is key for homing of B cells to the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that induction of this molecule is the mechanism through which EBV-infected cells enter this organ. In favor of this hypothesis, we could also detect EBV-infected cells in the lymph nodes adjacent to the colon and in the appendix. ? 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

"Evaluation of PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 exposure and the resultant health risk of preschool children and their caregivers",2019,"Preschool children have a higher respiratory rate per unit body weight than adults, and their respiratory systems are not mature. Hence, children may have more health risks associated with particulate matter (PM) exposure. In this study, we assessed the exposure of preschool children and their caregivers to PM and the resulting health risks. The PM concentrations at heights of 60–80 cm (preschool children) and 150 cm (adults) were measured at ten indoor and eight outdoor sites in the Taipei metropolitan area from March 2015 to February 2017. Four PM2.5 and seven PM10 indoor measurements exceeded the indoor air quality standard of Taiwan, whereas only two PM2.5 outdoor measurements exceeded the ambient air quality standard. The outdoor PM concentrations were related to traffic emissions, whereas the indoor PM concentrations were associated with ventilation rate and occupant density. The chronic daily PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 intakes of preschool children were notably higher than those of adults. In addition, the hazard quotient resulting from PM2.5 exposure indicated a significant health risk for preschool children (93.74% greater than 1). Consequently, reducing the exposure of preschool children to PM2.5 is an emerging issue in the Taipei metropolitan area. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Air quality; Air quality standards; Health; Indoor air pollution; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Respiratory system; Risk assessment; Ambient air quality standards; Indoor air quality; Indoor measurement; Occupant densities; Outdoor measurements; Particulate Matter; Preschool children; Taipei cities; Health risks; adult; ambient air; article; breathing rate; caregiver; child; clinical article; controlled study; female; health hazard; height; human; human experiment; male; particulate matter; risk assessment; Taiwan; air pollutant; air pollution; caregiver; child care; environmental disease; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; exposure; indoor air pollution; particle size; particulate matter; preschool child; procedures; recreational park; respiratory tract disease; risk factor; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Caregivers; Child Care; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Illness; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Parks, Recreational; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Early white matter injuries associated with dopamine transporter dysfunction in patients with acute CO intoxication: A diffusion kurtosis imaging and Tc-99m TRODAT-1 SPECT study",2019,"Purpose: Patients with CO intoxication were demonstrated to exhibit white matter (WM) injuries, changes in substantia nigra, dopamine transporter dysfunctions of striatum and Parkinsonism symptoms. We aimed to investigate the relationship between WM injuries of dopaminergic pathways and dopamine transporter dysfunctions of the striatum in patients with acute CO intoxication using both diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT). Materials and methods: Seventeen patients with acute CO intoxication and 19 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects were enrolled. DKI data were acquired from all participants and Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 SPECT scan was performed on each patient. DKI datasets were fitted to obtain axial, radial and mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, axial, radial and mean kurtosis for voxel-based comparison. In addition, the TRODAT-1 binding ratio of the striatum was calculated using the occipital cortices as a reference. In significant regions, correlational analysis was performed to understand the relationship between DKI indices and TRODAT-1 binding ratio. Results: The results showed that DKI indices were significantly altered in multiple WM regions broadly involving the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit and nigrostriatal pathway. The correlation analysis further revealed significant correlations between DKI indices and the TRODAT-1 binding ratio in the nigrostriatal pathway (absolute correlation coefficients ranged from 0.5992 to 0.6950, p<0.05), suggesting that CO-induced early WM injuries were associated with dopamine transporter dysfunctions of striatum. Conclusion: We concluded that DKI and Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 SPECT scans were helpful in early detection of global WM injuries associated with dysfunctions of dopamine transporter in patients with acute CO intoxication. Key Points: ? Voxel-based diffusion kurtosis imaging analysis was helpful in globally detecting early white matter injuries in patients with acute CO intoxication. ? CO-induced early white matter injuries were broadly located in basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit and nigrostriatal pathway. ? Early white matter injuries in dopaminergic pathways were significantly correlated with dopamine transporter dysfunctions of the striatum. ? 2018, European Society of Radiology.","carbon monoxide; dopamine transporter; technetium 99m; dopamine transporter; radiopharmaceutical agent; technetium complex; technetium Tc 99m TRODAT-1; tropane derivative; adult; Article; brain region; carbon monoxide intoxication; clinical article; controlled study; corpus striatum; diffusion kurtosis imaging; dopaminergic system; early diagnosis; female; fractional anisotropy; human; male; mean diffusivity; neuroimaging; nigroneostriatal system; occipital cortex; parkinsonism; priority journal; single photon emission computed tomography; substantia nigra; white matter; white matter injury; acute disease; anisotropy; carbon monoxide intoxication; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; metabolism; procedures; single photon emission computed tomography; Acute Disease; Adult; Anisotropy; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Female; Humans; Male; Organotechnetium Compounds; Radiopharmaceuticals; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Tropanes; White Matter"
"Pregnancy-induced hypertension is an independent risk factor for meconium aspiration syndrome: A retrospective population based cohort study",2019,"Objective: Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), possibly resulting from fetal hypoxia, is a respiratory distress disorder in the infant. Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) can cause placental dysfunction and lead to fetal hypoxia, which may induce the development of MAS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association between PIH and MAS and to identify the predictive risk factors. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. We selected patients with newly diagnosed PIH and a matched cohort group from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), from January 1, 2000 till December 31, 2013. For each patient in the PIH cohort, 4 subjects without PIH, matched for age and year of delivery, were randomly selected as the comparison cohort. The incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome was assessed in both groups. Results: Among the 23.3 million individuals registered in the NHIRD, 29,013 patients with PIH and 116,052 matched controls were identified. Patients who experienced PIH had a higher incidence of MAS than did those without PIH. According to a multivariate analysis, PIH (odds ratio [OR] = 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49–1.93, p < 0.0001) was independently associated with increased risk of MAS. Additionally, age ?30 years (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.12–1.42, p = 0.0001), nulliparity (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01–1.27, p = 0.0367) and patients with diabetes mellitus (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.35–7.09, p = 0.0078) were also independent risk factors of MAS. Conclusion: Patients with PIH obtained higher subsequent risk for the development of MAS than those without PIH. Besides, age ?30 years, nulliparity and patients with diabetes mellitus are the independent risk factors of developing MAS. ? 2019","adult; Article; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; high risk pregnancy; human; incidence; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; meconium aspiration; nullipara; obstetric delivery; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; case control study; diabetes mellitus; factual database; longitudinal study; maternal hypertension; meconium aspiration; pregnancy; Taiwan; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Longitudinal Studies; Meconium Aspiration Syndrome; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan"

"Nonmedical prescription drug use of analgesics and sedatives/hypnotics in Taiwan: Results from the 2014 National Survey of Substance Use",2019,"Nonmedical prescription drug use (NMPDU)has become a major public health issue but little is known in Asian populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of NMPDU in Taiwan. Participants from the 2014 national survey of 17,837 individuals, aged 12 to 64 year, completed anonymously a computer-assisted self-interview. Past-year prescription drug use was divided into medical use only (MUO)and nonmedical use (NMU), defined as using the drug without a prescription, or more frequently, or in larger doses than prescribed. Problematic alcohol use was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), problematic drug use using the 20-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST), and depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Study-Depression (CES-D). The prevalence of past-year NMU was 3.02% for analgesics, 0.71% for sedatives/hypnotics, and 3.66% for either drug, with a very small overlap of NMU between analgesics and sedatives/hypnotics (0.07%). When individuals with NMU were compared to those without NMU (Non-NMU)and those with MUO, respectively, some correlates consistently identified, including young adulthood, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and greater AUDIT's scores for analgesics, as well as hard drug use and greater DAST's scores for sedatives/hypnotics. NMU was associated with greater CES-D's scores for both analgesics and sedatives/hypnotics when compared to Non-NMU but not to MUO. Robust correlates of NMPDU could offer implications for development of prevention strategies of NMPDU. ? 2019","alprazolam; analgesic agent; brotizolam; clonazepam; codeine phosphate; estazolam; fludiazepam; guaifenesin; hypnotic sedative agent; ipratropium bromide; lorazepam; midazolam maleate; morphine; paracetamol plus tramadol; tiotropium bromide; tramadol; triazolam; zaleplon; zolpidem tartrate; adolescent; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; child; controlled study; depression; drinking behavior; drug use; Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence; female; human; major clinical study; male; prescription drug misuse; prevalence; priority journal; screening test; smoking; substance use; Taiwan"
"Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A nationwide study in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Studies have suggested that a significant association exists between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and the offspring's attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) risk. However, this association has largely been unexplored among the Asian population, generally, and the Taiwanese population, specifically. Methods: In our study, 950 study pairs (children with ADHD [ICD-9-CM code: 314] and their mothers) and 3,800 control pairs (children without ADHD and their mothers) matched by demographic characteristics were identified between 1998 and 2008 from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Maternal use of acetaminophen was assessed in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester of pregnancy and over the period from 3 months before pregnancy to the date of last menstrual cycle. Results: Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for demographic data, gestational infections, comorbid perinatal conditions, and maternal mental health disorders indicated that exposure to acetaminophen in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40), both the first and second trimesters (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), or in any trimester (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring. Sensitivity analysis excluding gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders confirmed this association (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69). Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring, regardless of gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to acetaminophen leads to neurodevelopmental risks. ? 2019 Copyright Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.","paracetamol; adult; Article; attention deficit disorder; child; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; drug use; female; first trimester pregnancy; human; ICD-9; infection; major clinical study; male; menstrual cycle; mental disease; mental health; prenatal exposure; preschool child; priority journal; progeny; retrospective study; risk factor; school child; second trimester pregnancy; sensitivity analysis; Taiwan; third trimester pregnancy"

"Dynamic changes in long-term exposure to ambient particulate matter and incidence of hypertension in adults: A natural experiment",2019,"Many countries dedicated in mitigation of air pollution in the past several decades. However, little is known about how air quality improvement affects health. Therefore, we conducted current study to investigate dynamic changes in long-term exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) and incidence of hypertension in a large longitudinal cohort. We recruited 134 978 adults aged 18 years or above between 2001 and 2014. All the participants received a series of standard medical examinations, including measurements of blood pressure. The PM2.5 concentration was estimated using a satellite-based spatiotemporal model at a high resolution (1×1 km2). The change in long-term exposure to PM2.5 (ΔPM2.5) was defined as the difference between the values measured during follow-up and during the immediately preceding visit, and a negative value indicated an improvement in PM2.5 air quality. Time-varying Cox model was used to examine the associations between ΔPM2.5 and the development of hypertension. The results show that PM2.5 concentrations increased in 2002, 2003, and 2004, but began to decrease in 2005. Every 5 ?g/m3 change in exposure to PM2.5 (ie, a ΔPM2.5 of 5 ?g/m3) was associated with a 16% change in the incidence of hypertension (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.86). Both stratified and sensitivity analyses generally yielded similar results. We found that an improvement in PM2.5 exposure is associated with a decreased incidence of hypertension. Our findings demonstrate that air pollution mitigation is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Snoring sound energy as a potential biomarker for disease severity and surgical response in childhood obstructive sleep apnoea: A pilot study",2019,"Objective: To investigate the relationship between baseline snoring sound energy (SSE) and disease severity, changes in SSE after adenotonsillectomy, and the predictors of surgical success in children with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary referral medical centre. Participants: Thirty-two children with OSA whose apnoea-hypopnoea index ?5 or apnoea-hypopnoea index ?1.5 with OSA comorbidities were recruited. Patients with complicated OSA were excluded. All participants underwent snoring sound analysis, polysomnography, and adenotonsillectomy. Main outcome measures: Snoring sound energy and apnoea-hypopnoea index were assessed at baseline and 6?months after adenotonsillectomy. Surgical success was defined as a postoperative apnoea-hypopnoea index &lt;1.5. Results: The median age, body mass index, and apnoea-hypopnoea index was 9?years, 19.0?kg/m 2 , and 13.2?events/h, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that a baseline tonsil size of IV (odds ratio 15.7 [95% CI: 1.5-166.3]) and SSE of 801-1000?Hz?&gt;?21.9?dB (odds ratio 32.3 [95% CI: 2.6-396.6]) were significantly related to severe OSA. Following adenotonsillectomy, apnoea-hypopnoea index decreased significantly (P?&lt;?0.001). SSE of 41-200?Hz, 201-400?Hz and 801-1000?Hz also decreased significantly (P?=?0.04, 0.01 and 0.006, respectively). Baseline SSE of 801-1000?Hz?&lt;?8.5?dB significantly predicted surgical success (odds ratio 11.0 [95% CI: 1.4-85.2]). Conclusions: Our findings suggest the potential utility of SSE of 801-1000?Hz to screen for severe OSA, predict surgical success and assess therapeutic outcomes. Specific baseline SSE may represent a potential biomarker for childhood OSA. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adenotonsillectomy; age; apnea hypopnea index; Article; body mass; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; disease severity; female; human; male; odds ratio; organ size; pilot study; polysomnography; postoperative period; prediction; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; school child; sleep disordered breathing; snoring; sound analysis; sound intensity; tertiary care center; tonsil size; treatment outcome; treatment response; adenoidectomy; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; sleep disordered breathing; snoring; tonsillectomy; Adenoidectomy; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Snoring; Tonsillectomy"
"Incidence of iatrogenic pneumothorax following acupuncture treatments in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Pneumothorax is a rare complication of acupuncture and the risk factors are unclear. Objective: This study analysed the incidence of post-acupuncture pneumothorax requiring hospitalisation in a one-million-sample cohort derived from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Methods: We tracked this cohort between 1997 and 2012 and recorded all medical insurance information. Subjects were categorised according to gender, insurance amount, comorbidities, residential area, and number of acupuncture treatments. Pneumothorax risk was evaluated according to different demographic and medical variables by logistic regression analysis using an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: Overall, 411 734 patients undergoing 5 407 378 acupuncture treatments were identified with data collected over the first 7 days after acupuncture. The incidence rates of iatrogenic pneumothorax were 0.87 per 1 000 000 acupuncture treatments overall and 1.75 per 1 000 000 acupuncture treatments in “at-risk” anatomical areas. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that a history of thoracic surgery (aOR 7.85, 95% CI 3.49 to 9.25), chronic bronchitis (aOR 2.61, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.87), emphysema (aOR 4.87, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.96), pneumonia (aOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.72), tuberculosis (aOR 3.65, 95% CI 1.39 to 9.56), and lung cancer (aOR 3.85, 95% CI 1.53 to 9.73) may increase the post-acupuncture risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax. Men had a higher risk of pneumothorax than women (aOR 3.41, 95% CI 1.36 to 8.57). The number of treatments was not associated with risk of pneumothorax. Conclusions: Patients with a history of lung disease including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, lung cancer and pneumonia, and a history of thoracic surgery, might have an increased post-acupuncture risk of pneumothorax. This information may possibly help physicians avoid post-acupuncture pneumothorax. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""
"The Provision of Health Care by Family Physicians in Taiwan as Illustrated With Population Pyramids",2019,"Family physicians serve as personal doctors for individuals and their families and also act as gatekeepers of the health care system. If no special status is accorded to family physicians, however, then the rates at which health care recipients utilize their service might be affected. In the present cross-sectional study, representative claims data sets for 2010 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance program, a health care system in which beneficiaries are not required to register with a family physician, were used to investigate the provision of health care to the population by family physicians. Among 919?206 beneficiaries with a total of 13?713?199 ambulatory visits, 49.1% had visited family physicians, 34.1% had visited internists, 24.3% had visited pediatricians, and 38.9% had visited otolaryngologists. Women (χ2(1) = 538, P < .001) and patients aged 65 and above (χ2(1) = 16?000, P < .001) had a higher proportion of visiting family physicians rather than visiting other specialties. The onion-shaped population pyramid with family medicine visits was compatible with the general population, and the proportion of visiting family physicians increased with increasing age. Among 112?289 patients with essential hypertension, 63?379 patients with diabetes mellitus, and 80?090 patients with hyperlipidemia, only 35.3%, 32.0%, and 31.1%, respectively, had visited family physicians. The age and sex distributions of these patients were illustrated with population pyramids for data visualization and direct comparisons. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that the utilization of family physicians in Taiwan and the effectiveness of their associated role in chronic disease management still have room for improvement.","adolescent; adult; aged; ambulatory care; child; chronic disease; cross-sectional study; female; general practitioner; human; infant; male; medicine; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; psychology; public health; supply and distribution; Taiwan; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Medicine; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Physicians, Family; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Bronchoscopic cryosurgery for metastatic tumor causing central airway obstruction: A case report",2019,"RATIONALE: Bronchoscopic cryotherapy has been considered as one of the optional interventions for unresectable malignant central airway obstruction (CAO). And it provides high safety and effectiveness in airway patency re-establishment. This report describes the interventional bronchoscopic cryotherapy for a patient with CAO caused by squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. We display a series of dramatic change of chest radiographs before and after the intervention. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the middle third of the esophagus (initial staging, pT2N0M0; stage IIB; in January 2017) underwent Video-assisted esophagectomy and reconstruction with a gastric conduit via a substernal route. Following Chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography revealed disease progression with paratracheal metastases. Progressive dyspnea and chest pain lasted for a month, and he was admitted to the ER. DIAGNOSES: Blood gas analysis revealed type I respiratory failure (pH, 7.445; PaO2, 69.4 mmHg; PaCO2, 40.6 mmHg). Other laboratory data were grossly normal. Chest radiography revealed a total left lung collapse. Chest CT identified a tumor blocking the left mainstem bronchus with the consolidation of the left lung. INTERVENTIONS: Dexamethasone and epinephrine inhalation were administered for initial symptom relief. Bronchoscopy performed 4 days after admission revealed a huge tumor completely occluding the left mainstem bronchus orifice. The occlusion was completely resolved following cryotherapy. Then, the first course of palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin plus fluorouracil, followed by the second course a month later, was administered. OUTCOMES: The latest chest radiograph showed a patent airway. The patient's condition remained stable for at least the following 2 months. LESSONS: Malignant CAO is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Several acceptable bronchoscopy techniques exist for treatment. Cryotherapy has high safety and effectiveness in airway patency re-establishment.","aged; airway obstruction; bronchoscopy; case report; complication; cryosurgery; esophagus tumor; human; lung; lung tumor; male; pathology; procedures; secondary; squamous cell carcinoma; Aged; Airway Obstruction; Bronchoscopy; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cryosurgery; Esophageal Neoplasms; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Male"
"Comparison of Tunnel Enlargement and Clinical Outcome Between Bioabsorbable Interference Screws and Cortical Button-Post Fixation in Arthroscopic Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Prospective, Randomized Study With a Minimum Follow-Up of 2 Years",2019,"Purpose: To investigate the tunnel enlargement rate and clinical function by comparing double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using different fixation devices. Methods: Patients receiving primary arthroscopic double-bundle ACLR were screened and divided into 2 groups on the basis of the method of graft fixation: bioabsorbable interference screw (BS) group and cortical button (CB) group. Bone tunnel size was assessed digitally using magnetic resonance imaging, which was performed a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. Clinical evaluations were performed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, and KT-1000 arthrometer 2 years postoperatively. Results: Sixty patients receiving primary arthroscopic double-bundle ACLR were included. Overall, the BS group showed greater tunnel enlargement than the CB group, as well as a significantly increased rate of tunnel communication (P =.029). The average anteromedial tunnel enlargement rates for the BS and CB groups were 50% and 28%, respectively. The enlargement rate of the posterolateral (PL) femoral tunnel was similar in both groups. In the PL tibial tunnel, the CB group showed a significant increase in enlargement compared with the BS group (64% vs 45%, P =.0001). Both groups showed functional improvement in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and International Knee Documentation Committee score. No significant difference in postoperative functional outcomes was found between the 2 groups. Conclusions: The BS group showed significantly greater tunnel enlargement in anteromedial tunnels and an increased tunnel communication rate compared with the CB group. On the other hand, the CB group showed greater tunnel enlargement in tibial PL tunnels. Tunnel communication was observed mostly on the tibial side in the BS patients. Equivalent clinical function outcomes were noted at 2 years after surgery in both groups of patients. Level of Evidence: Level II, randomized controlled clinical trial. ? 2019 Arthroscopy Association of North America","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bone disease; bone tunnel enlargement; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; controlled study; device comparison; double bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; female; follow up; hamstring muscle; hamstring tendon; human; international knee documentation committee score; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal disease assessment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quality of life; range of motion; weight bearing"
"RNA-Binding Proteomics Reveals MATR3 Interacting with lncRNA SNHG1 to Enhance Neuroblastoma Progression",2019,"The interaction of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with one or more RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is important to a plethora of cellular and physiological processes. The lncRNA SNHG1 was reported to be aberrantly expressed and associated with poor patient prognosis in several cancers including neuroblastoma. However, the interacting RBPs and biological functions associated with SNHG1 in neuroblastoma remain unknown. In this study, we identified 283, 31, and 164 SNHG1-interacting proteins in SK-N-BE(2)C, SK-N-DZ, and SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells, respectively, using a RNA-protein pull-down assay coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Twenty-four SNHG1-interacting RBPs were identified in common from these three neuroblastoma cell lines. RBPs MATR3, YBX1, and HNRNPL have the binding sites for SNHG1 predicted by DeepBind motif analysis. Furthermore, the direct binding of MATR3 with SNHG1 was validated by Western blot and confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP). Coexpression analysis revealed that the expression of SNHG1 is positively correlated with MATR3 (P = 3.402 × 10 -13 ). The high expression of MATR3 is associated with poor event-free survival (P = 0.00711) and overall survival (P = 0.00064). Biological functions such as ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, RNA processing, and RNA splicing are significantly enriched and in common between SNHG1 and MATR3. In conclusion, we identified MATR3 as binding to SNHG1 and the interaction might be involved in splicing events that enhance neuroblastoma progression. ?

"17Α-Ethynylestradiol and 4-nonylphenol stimulate lung adenocarcinoma cell production in xenoestrogenic way",2019,"Lung cancer has been one of the major cancers leading to mortalities worldwide. In addition to smoking, estrogen is considered to play an important role in the lung cancer development because women have a higher proportion of adenocarcinoma than men. In the environment, there are many metabolites and waste products that mimic human estrogen structurally and functionally. 17α-Ethynylestradiol (EE2) which is used as an oral contraceptive is released into wastewater after being utilized. Moreover, 4-nonylphenol (NP) which is found in the petrochemical products and air pollutants reveals estrogenic activity. In the present study, 17β-estradiol (E2), EE2, and NP are administered to stimulate male lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and female lung adenocarcinoma cells (H1435). The results demonstrate that EE2 and NP stimulate A549 and H1435 cells proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Both estrogen receptors α and β are simultaneously activated. In response to estrogens, up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and extracellular signal-regulated kinase expression occurs. In conclusion, this is the first study to report that EE2 and NP exert a biotoxic effect to stimulate the proliferation of both male and female lung cancer cell in a dose- and time- dependent manner. The environmental hormones posing new challenges for lung cancer deserve further investigation. ? 2018","Cells; Cytology; Diseases; Endocrinology; Neptunium; Petrochemicals; EGFR; Environment; Environmental hormone; Epidermal growth factor receptors; Estrogen receptor; Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Lung Cancer; Petrochemical products; Biological organs; 4 nonylphenol; epidermal growth factor receptor; estrogen; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor beta; ethinylestradiol; mitogen activated protein kinase; 4-nonylphenol; estradiol; estradiol derivative; estrogen; ethinylestradiol; phenol derivative; atmospheric pollution; cancer; cell component; chemical compound; dose-response relationship; enzyme; enzyme activity; growth; hormone; nanoparticle; smoking; toxicity; wastewater; wastewater treatment; A-549 cell line; Article; cell proliferation; controlled study; female; h1435 cell line; hormonal regulation; human; human cell; lung adenocarcinoma cell line; male; MCF-7 cell line; MRC-5 cell line; MTT assay; protein expression; upregulation; Western blotting; drug effect; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; tumor cell line; A549 Cells; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Estradiol; Estradiol Congeners; Estrogens; Ethinyl Estradiol; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Phenols"
"Association between neighborhood greenspace and fasting plasma glucose from a large cohort study in Taiwan",2019,"Growing evidence suggests that greenness exposure improves health status, but few studies address diabetes, and research mainly comes from Western countries. This study hypothesizes that higher greenness exposure benefits glucose control with increased intensity of physical activity. We used data from a longitudinal health examination database in Taiwan during 2000–2014. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as an objective indicator of greenness in the neighborhood. Fasting plasma glucose served as an indicator of early diabetes diagnosis. A metabolic equivalent value (MET) based on a compendium of physical activities was used to estimate the intensity of physical activity. We applied a linear mixed-effect model with an individual-level random effect to investigate the relationship between neighborhood greenness and the fasting plasma glucose value stratified by four levels of physical activity. There are 341,211 participants with no diabetes, and 773,602 check-up visits included here. The fasting glucose among participants living in areas with higher green space was lower than that of those living in less green areas. The beneficial effects of greenspace on glucose were stronger for those with more physical activity, especially in the 500-m buffer. In the physically inactive group, compared with the lowest quantile (Q1) of cumulative average greenness, people living in the highest quantile (Q4) of greenness had 0.35 mg less glucose in each dl of plasma [95% confidence interval: ?0.50, ?0.20]. In the physically active group, people residing in the highest quantile (Q4) of greenness had 0.48 mg less glucose in each dl of plasma [95% confidence interval: ?0.73, ?0.23]. Higher residential greenness appears to be associated with lower glucose. Higher physical activity can mediate this association. Our results provide evidence that ensuring access to greenspace in residential neighborhoods may provide positive health outcomes and improve public health, and should be implemented in urban planning. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH","diabetes; glucose; greenspace; NDVI; neighborhood; physical activity; urban planning"
"Identification of acrolein metabolites in human buccal cells, blood, and urine after consumption of commercial fried food",2019,"Scope: Acrolein is a highly electrophilic α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and is associated with human diseases. It is formed by Maillard reaction during food processing and could be detected in the emissions of overheated cooking oils. Consequently, humans are at risk of acrolein exposure through consumption of such prepared food. Methods and results: We conducted three human studies that healthy subjects (21–30?years) were served fried foods including fried chicken and French fries from three commercial fast food restaurants. Acrolein-related metabolites including urinary 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPMA), serum acrolein-protein conjugates (Acr-FDP), and buccal acrolein-induced DNA damages (Acr-dG adducts) along with GSH levels in serum or buccal cells were investigated for different times after consumption. Conclusion: Urinary 3-HPMA levels were increased after 2-hr consumption of fried food with an elimination half-life of 10?hr. In addition, increased Acr-dG adducts in oral cavity were inversely correlated to buccal glutathione (GSH) levels after consumption. However, there was no significant change in systemic GSH levels or Acr-FDP adducts in serum. These results indicate that exposure of acrolein from consuming fried food affects local oral cavity homeostasis. This may provide a possible link between intake of fried food and increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Structural and functional characterization of β2-glycoprotein I domain 1 in anti-melanoma cell migration",2019,"We previously found that circulating β2-glycoprotein I inhibits human endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis by diverse mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the antitumor activities of β2-glycoprotein I using structure-function analysis and mapped the critical region within the β2-glycoprotein I peptide sequence that mediates anticancer effects. We constructed recombinant cDNA and purified different β2-glycoprotein I polypeptide domains using a baculovirus expression system. We found that purified β2-glycoprotein I, as well as recombinant β2-glycoprotein I full-length (D12345), polypeptide domains I-IV (D1234), and polypeptide domain I (D1) significantly inhibited melanoma cell migration, proliferation and invasion. Western blot analyses were used to determine the dysregulated expression of proteins essential for intracellular signaling pathways in B16-F10 treated with β2-glycoprotein I and variant recombinant polypeptides. Using a melanoma mouse model, we found that D1 polypeptide showed stronger potency in suppressing tumor growth. Structural analysis showed that fragments A and B within domain I would be the critical regions responsible for antitumor activity. Annexin A2 was identified as the counterpart molecule for β2-glycoprotein I by immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Interaction between specific amino acids of β2-glycoprotein I D1 and annexin A2 was later evaluated by the molecular docking approach. Moreover, five amino acid residues were selected from fragments A and B for functional evaluation using site-directed mutagenesis, and P11A, M42A, and I55P mutations were shown to disrupt the anti-melanoma cell migration ability of β2-glycoprotein I. This is the first study to show the therapeutic potential of β2-glycoprotein I D1 in the treatment of melanoma progression. ? 2019 The Authors.

"A powerful and efficient multivariate approach for voxel-level connectome-wide association studies",2019,"We describe an approach to multivariate analysis, termed structured kernel principal component regression (sKPCR), to identify associations in voxel-level connectomes using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data. This powerful and computationally efficient multivariate method can identify voxel-phenotype associations based on the whole-brain connectivity pattern of voxels, and it can detect linear and non-linear signals in both volume-based and surface-based rsfMRI data. For each voxel, sKPCR first extracts low-dimensional signals from the spatially smoothed connectivities by structured kernel principal component analysis, and then tests the voxel-phenotype associations by an adaptive regression model. The method's power is derived from appropriately modelling the spatial structure of the data when performing dimension reduction, and then adaptively choosing an optimal dimension for association testing using the adaptive regression strategy. Simulations based on real connectome data have shown that sKPCR can accurately control the false-positive rate and that it is more powerful than many state-of-the-art approaches, such as the connectivity-wise generalized linear model (GLM) approach, multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR), adaptive sum of powered score (aSPU) test, and least-square kernel machine (LSKM). Moreover, since sKPCR can reduce the computational cost of non-parametric permutation tests, its computation speed is much faster. To demonstrate the utility of sKPCR for real data analysis, we have also compared sKPCR with the above methods based on the identification of voxel-wise differences between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls in four independent rsfMRI datasets. The results showed that sKPCR had better between-sites reproducibility and a larger proportion of overlap with existing schizophrenia meta-analysis findings.

"Artocarpin induces cell apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells through endoplasmic reticulum stress and reactive oxygen species",2019,"Osteosarcoma is a malignant primary bone tumor that responds poorly to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, because of side effects and drug resistance in chemotherapy and the insufficiency of an effective adjuvant therapy for osteosarcoma, it is necessary to research novel treatments. This study was the first to investigate the anticancer effects of the flavonoid derivative artocarpin in osteosarcoma. Artocarpin induced cell apoptosis in three human osteosarcoma cell lines—U2OS, MG63, and HOS. Artocarpin was also associated with increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial dysfunction was followed by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and accompanied by decreased antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and increased proapoptotic protein Bak and Bax. Artocarpin triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by changes in cytosol calcium levels and increased glucose-regulated protein 78 and 94 expressions, and also increased calpains expression and activity. Animal studies revealed a dramatic 40% reduction in tumor volume after 18 days of treatment. This study demonstrated a novel anticancer activity of artocarpin against human osteosarcoma cells and in murine tumor models. In summary, artocarpin significantly induced cell apoptosis through ROS, ER stress, mitochondria, and the caspase pathway, and may thus be a novel anticancer treatment for osteosarcoma. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","acetylcysteine; antineoplastic agent; artocarpin; calpain 1; calpain 2; caspase 3; caspase 9; catalase; cytochrome c; diphenyliodonium salt; glucose regulated protein 78; glucose regulated protein 94; protein Bak; protein bcl 2; protein bcl xl; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cell death; cell survival; cell viability; chromatin condensation; comparative study; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA fragmentation assay; endoplasmic reticulum stress; enzyme activity; ex vivo study; homeostasis; HOS cell line; human; human cell; male; MG-63 cell line; mitochondrial membrane; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; osteosarcoma; priority journal; protein expression; tumor xenograft; TUNEL assay; U2OS cell line; Western blotting"
"Performance of fracture risk assessment tool in HIV-positive male individuals aged ?45?years on suppressive antiretroviral therapy",2019,"Introduction: An age-specific evaluation and management algorithm for reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is suggested for HIV-positive patients without major risk factors. Whether combination of BMD and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) may detect more individuals for therapeutic interventions remains unclear. We aimed to determine the prevalence of middle-aged or older HIV-positive males fitting the criteria of therapeutic interventions with different approaches. Methods: From July 2016 to February 2018, HIV-positive male patients aged ?45?years receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy were recruited in a cross-sectional study, at two designated hospitals for HIV care in northern Taiwan. Patients with malignancy, AIDS, pre-existing bone disease or immobilization were excluded. Information on clinical and demographic characteristics, FRAX questionnaire, activity questionnaire, BMD and serum 25(OH)D was obtained. FRAX scores combined with BMD (FRAX/BMD) and without BMD (FRAX) were calculated. The data were analysed on the basis of major risk factors for fragility fracture and age stratification, FRAX score and BMD results respectively. Results: We enrolled 330 patients with a mean age of 51.6?years and CD4 610?cells/μL, in whom 98.1% (n?=?324) underwent BMD assessment of one site or more. By FRAX, 6.7% (n?=?22) reached treatment thresholds (10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture ?20% and/or hip fracture ?3%). The prevalence of osteopenia (?2.5 &lt;T-score &lt;?1) and osteoporosis (T-score ??2.5) was 50.3% and 10.8% respectively. Compared with FRAX, FRAX/BMD identified 17.4% (95% CI 12.0% to 22.8%) more individuals who reached treatment thresholds (24.1% vs. 6.7%); even in the low-risk group (without major risks for fragility fracture, 45 to 49?years, n?=?129), FRAX/BMD identified 12.6% (95% CI 7.9% to 19.7%) more candidates (12.6% vs. 0%). Patients with BMI&lt;22?kg/m2 (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.86, 95% CI 1.62 to 5.05) and aged ?50?years (aOR 3.57, 95% CI 1.92 to 6.66) were more likely not to be identified as requiring treatment by FRAX but would be identified as requiring treatment by FRAX/BMD. The sensitivity and specificity of FRAX to detect candidates for interventions was 18.2% (95% CI 10.3% to 28.6%) and 97.9% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.3%) respectively. Conclusions: With FRAX as a screening approach among HIV-positive male patients aged ?45?years, addition of BMD assessment may detect more candidates for therapeutic management. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Cordycepin, isolated from medicinal fungus Cordyceps sinensis, enhances radiosensitivity of oral cancer associated with modulation of DNA damage repair",2019,"Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) is important for controlling oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which is often accompanied by significant acute and late toxicities. We investigated whether cordycepin, a small molecule extracted from Cordyceps sinensis, could enhance the radiosensitivity of oral cancer cells. Using colony formation assay, we demonstrated that cordycepin induces radiosensitizing effects on two OSCC cells. DNA histogram analysis showed that cordycepin combined with RT prolonged the RT-induced G2/M phase arrest. It protracted the duration of DNA double strand breaks, which was detected by immunofluorescent staining of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX). The underlying molecular mechanism might involve the downregulation of protein expression related to DNA damage repair, including phosphorylated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (p-ATM) and phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 2. Reciprocal upregulation of phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) expression was noted, and the radiosensitizing effect of cordycepin could be further augmented by Chk1 mRNA knockdown, indicating a compensatory DNA repair machinery involving phosphorylation of Chk1. In vivo, the combination of cordycepin and RT exhibited greater growth inhibition on xenografts and stronger apoptosis induction than RT alone, without exacerbating major toxicities. In conclusion, cordycepin increased the radiosensitivity of OSCC cells, which is associated with the modulation of RT-induced DNA damage repair machinery. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","ATM protein; checkpoint kinase 1; checkpoint kinase 2; cordycepin; histone H2AX; messenger RNA; cordycepin; deoxyadenosine derivative; radiosensitizing agent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; chemoradiotherapy; Chk1 gene; colony formation; controlled study; DNA determination; DNA repair; double stranded DNA break; down regulation; enzyme phosphorylation; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene knockdown; histogram; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; mouse; mouth cancer; nonhuman; Ophiocordyceps; protein expression; radiosensitivity; radiosensitization; treatment duration; tumor xenograft; upregulation; animal; Bagg albino mouse; chemistry; Cordyceps; DNA repair; drug effect; mouth tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cordyceps; Deoxyadenosines; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; DNA Repair; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Humans; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mouth Neoplasms; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents"
"Autonomic reactivity during reading of a somatic distress script in patients with somatic symptom disorder",2019,"Objective: The relationship between resting-state heart rate variability (HRV) and somatic symptom disorder (SSD) has been explored in several studies. We planned to examine HRV during the performance of psychological tasks, and assumed that it could be applied for the diagnosis of SSD. Methods: Fifty-three patients with SSD and 52 healthy controls were recruited. Demographic and psychological data were collected. Subjects' HRV was measured over five 5-minute blocks during which they viewed different scripts (resting state; health anxiety; somatic distress; depression; neutral topic). After each block they completed a self-assessment manikin. Generalized estimated equation analysis was used to analyze the impact of mental scripts, SSD and sex on physiological and psychological indicators. Results: In men there was a script*SSD interaction concerning high-frequency power (HF) involving the neutral script; SSD men showed significantly higher HF than healthy men when viewing neutral script. In women there were script*SSD interactions with respect to low-frequency power (LF) and HF involving the somatic distress script and a script*SSD interaction with respect to LF and emotional valence involving the neutral script; SSD women revealed significantly lower LF and HF than healthy women when viewing somatic distress script, they also showed significantly lower LF and higher valence than healthy ones during neutral script. The somatic distress script*SSD interaction still influenced LF and HF in women after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusion: In women cue-specific HRV is a better method of differentiating people with SSD from healthy individuals than resting-state HRV.

However, little is known about the relationship between FABP4 level and prolonged QT interval. The aim of this study was to investigate whether plasma FABP4 level is associated with a prolonged QT interval by analyzing 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) in patients with stable angina and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: This study included 397 consecutive patients with stable angina and CKD who were enrolled in a disease management program. Plasma FABP4 concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A 12-lead ECG recording was obtained from each patient. We assessed the relationships between FABP4 levels (both as a continuous variable and stratified by tertile) at admission and corrected QT (QTc) prolongation. Results: Patients with an abnormal QTc interval had higher median plasma FABP4 levels than those with borderline and normal QTc intervals (15.9 ng/mL vs. 10.2 ng/mL vs. 8.5 ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.0001). Statistically significant associations were observed between plasma FABP4 levels and QTc interval (β = 0.267, P < 0.0001). Using multivariate and trend analyses, a higher concentration of plasma FABP4 level was independently associated with QTc prolongation in patients with stable angina and CKD. Conclusion: In this study, plasma FABP4 levels were significantly higher in the patients with an abnormal QTc interval and were correlated with QTc prolongation. Further studies are required to elucidate whether plasma FABP4 plays a role in the pathogenesis of QTc prolongation. ? 2019 The Author(s).","C reactive protein; creatinine; fatty acid binding protein 4; glucose; hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; age; aged; Article; cholesterol blood level; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary angiography; creatinine blood level; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; electrocardiography; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; glucose blood level; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart rate; hematocrit; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; mortality; multivariate analysis; priority journal; protein blood level; QRS interval; QT prolongation; QTc interval; QTc prolongation; quantitative analysis; scoring system; stable angina pectoris; systolic blood pressure; urea nitrogen blood level"
"Daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin, is highly effective for all kinds of genotype-2 chronic hepatitis-C infection in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Based on the previously published results, 12 weeks of sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg/day plus ribavirin (RBV), the current direct antiviral agent regimen reimbursed by Bureau-of National-Health-Insurance (BNHI) of Taiwan for genotype-2 chronic hepatitis C (CHC), is suboptimal in efficacy, especially for difficult-to-treat subpopulations such as liver cirrhosis, previous interferon (IFN) treatment failure, and high viral-load. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SOF plus daclatasvir (DCV) for Taiwanese genotype-2 CHC patients. Methods: Between March 2017 and December 2018, a total of 50 consecutive genotype-2 CHC patients who completed 12 weeks combination of SOF (400 mg/day) plus DCV (60 mg/day) with or without RBV by investigators were enrolled for analyses. When RBV was added, weight-based (800-1200 mg/day) approach was applied. Sustained virological response (SVR12) was defined by undetectable HCV RNA (&lt;15 IU/mL) at the end and 12 weeks after completion of therapy. Results: The mean age was 62.0 ± 11.4 years, 16 (32.0%) of them were males and 20 (40.0%) of them failed to previous IFN. Severity of liver diseases was as follows: ?F2 fibrosis: 24.0%; F3 fibrosis: 40.0%, Child-Pugh A cirrhosis: 30.0%; and Child-Pugh B-C cirrhosis: 6.0%. The mean baseline HCV RNA level was 6.19 ± 0.91 log10 IU/mL and 30 (60.0%) had baseline HCV RNA ? 2 million IU/mL. The rates of undetectable HCV RNA (&lt;15 IU/mL) at weeks 2, 4, and end-of-treatment were 40%, 94%, and 100%, respectively. Majority (66.7%) of patients with detectable HCV RNA at week 2 belonged to low-level viremia (&lt;50 IU/mL). Subjective adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities were more common for patients combining RBV. Grades of AEs were generally mild and all patients finished therapy without interruption. After post-treatment follow-up, all 50 patients (100%) achieved SVR12. Conclusion: Our real-world cohort of Taiwan showed that a 12-week SOF/DCV-based treatment was well-tolerated and highly effective for genotype-2 CHC patients with or without liver cirrhosis.

"Differential impact of age on survival in head and neck cancer according to classic Cox regression and decision tree analysis",2019,"Objectives: To assess the impact of age on the survival of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using different statistical methods. Design: A retrospective population-based study. Setting: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Subjects and methods: A total of 28?639 patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC were enrolled between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2013. The effect of age on 5-year disease-specific survival was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for a multivariate analysis. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis that partitioned patients with significantly different Kaplan-Meier curves was introduced to identify the important cancer-related parameters influencing survival. Results: Uni- and multivariate analyses indicated that patients who were older than 60?years had poorer 5-year disease-specific survival regardless of tumour subsite and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. However, the CART analysis determined that age played only a minor role in survival after comparing with other prognosticators. The relative importance of age using the Gini index was as follows: 3.21% for oral cancer, 8.32% for oropharyngeal cancer, 2.56% for hypopharyngeal cancer and 16.51% for laryngeal cancer. Conclusions: Different to traditional statistical methods, the CART analysis which was used to identify homogeneous populations revealed that the impact of age varied for different patient groups according to the presence or absence of other prognosticators. This important information could help to guide our clinical decisions and future researches. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; age; aged; Article; cancer localization; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; decision tree; female; head and neck cancer; human; hypopharynx cancer; larynx cancer; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oropharynx cancer; priority journal; proportional hazards model; survival rate; survival time"
"Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Versus Upfront Esophagectomy in Clinical Stage II and III Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma",2019,"Background: The benefits of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NCRT) compared to upfront esophagectomy (UE) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is controversial. Our purpose was to determine whether clinical stages based on the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis staging system could guide treatment decision. Methods: Data from 2503 patients with clinical stages II and III ESCC diagnosed between 2008 and 2014 were obtained from a nationwide database. Propensity score matching was used to identify well-balanced pairs of patients. Cox proportional hazards regression and log-rank test were used in the survival analysis. The outcomes of patients receiving “NCRT followed by surgery” or “UE” strategies were compared. Results: The treatment modality (UE or NCRT) was not a prognostic factor in clinical stage II ESCC (HR: 0.97; p = 0.778). In contrast, the UE group demonstrated a significantly worse outcome compared with the NCRT group in clinical stage III ESCC (HR: 1.39; p < 0.001). After matching, patients who underwent UE for clinical stage II ESCC had median survival/3-year overall survival (OS) rates of 27.8?months/39.2% compared with 32.7?months/49.8% in the NCRT group (p = 0.508). The patients who underwent UE for clinical stage III ESCC had median survival/3-year OS rates of 17.9?months/28.2% in the UE group compared with 24.0?months/41.8% in the NCRT group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our data suggest that NCRT strategy improved survival compared with UE in clinical stage III ESCC but not in clinical stage II tumors. ? 2018, Society of Surgical Oncology.","antineoplastic agent; adult; Article; cancer staging; chemoradiotherapy; comparative study; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus resection; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; overall survival; survival rate; treatment outcome; adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; esophagus resection; esophagus tumor; follow up; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; neoadjuvant therapy; pathology; squamous cell carcinoma; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant; Combined Modality Therapy; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophagectomy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Staging; Survival Rate"
"Alirocumab Reduces Total Nonfatal Cardiovascular and Fatal Events: The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES Trial",2019,"Background: The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trial compared alirocumab with placebo, added to high-intensity or maximum-tolerated statin treatment, after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in 18,924 patients. Alirocumab reduced the first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint and was associated with fewer all-cause deaths. Objectives: This pre-specified analysis determined the extent to which alirocumab reduced total (first and subsequent) nonfatal cardiovascular events and all-cause deaths in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES. Methods: Hazard functions for total nonfatal cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemia-driven coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure) and death were jointly estimated, linked by a shared frailty accounting for patient risk heterogeneity and correlated within-patient nonfatal events. An association parameter also quantified the strength of the linkage between risk of nonfatal events and death. The model provides accurate relative estimates of nonfatal event risk if nonfatal events are associated with increased risk for death. Results: With 3,064 first and 5,425 total events, 190 fewer first and 385 fewer total nonfatal cardiovascular events or deaths were observed with alirocumab compared with placebo. Alirocumab reduced total nonfatal cardiovascular events (hazard ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.82 to 0.93) and death (hazard ratio: 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.71 to 0.97) in the presence of a strong association between nonfatal and fatal event risk. Conclusions: In patients with ACS, the total number of nonfatal cardiovascular events and deaths prevented with alirocumab was twice the number of first events prevented. Consequently, total event reduction is a more comprehensive metric to capture the totality of alirocumab clinical efficacy after ACS. ? 2019 The Authors","alirocumab; atorvastatin; placebo; rosuvastatin; alirocumab; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; monoclonal antibody; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug megadose; fatality; female; frailty; heart failure; heart infarction; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle revascularization; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; unstable angina pectoris; acute coronary syndrome; combination drug therapy; comparative study; follow up; middle aged; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Middle Aged"
"Morning surge in blood pressure and blood pressure variability in Asia: Evidence and statement from the HOPE Asia Network",2019,"Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. To effectively prevent end-organ damage, maintain vascular integrity and reduce morbidity and mortality, it is essential to decrease and adequately control blood pressure (BP) throughout each 24-hour period. Exaggerated early morning BP surge (EMBS) is one component of BP variability (BPV), and has been associated with an increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular events, independently of 24-hour average BP. BPV includes circadian, short-term and long-term components, and can best be documented using out-of-office techniques such as ambulatory and/or home BP monitoring. There is a large body of evidence linking both BPV and EMBS with increased rates of adverse cardio- and cerebrovascular events, and end-organ damage. Differences in hypertension and related cardiovascular disease rates have been reported between Western and Asian populations, including a higher rate of stroke, higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, greater salt sensitivity and more common high morning and nocturnal BP readings in Asians. This highlights a need for BP management strategies that take into account ethnic differences. In general, long-acting antihypertensives that control BP throughout the 24-hour period are preferred; amlodipine and telmisartan have been shown to control EMBS more effectively than valsartan. Home and ambulatory BP monitoring should form an essential part of hypertension management, with individualized pharmacotherapy to achieve optimal 24-hour BP control particularly the EMBS and provide the best cardio- and cerebrovascular protection. Future research should facilitate better understanding of BPV, allowing optimization of strategies for the detection and treatment of hypertension to reduce adverse outcomes. ?2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ambulatory monitoring; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure regulation; blood pressure variability; cardiovascular risk; China; circadian rhythm; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; evidence based practice; heart protection; high risk population; home monitoring; human; hypertension; India; Japan; prediction; priority journal; Review; risk factor; risk reduction; Taiwan; treatment planning"
"Outcomes of unplanned extubation in ordinary ward are similar to those in intensive care unit: A STROBE-compliant case-control study",2019,"Unplanned extubation (UE) may cause considerable adverse effects in patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV). Previous literature showed inconsistent prognosis in patients with UE. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical implications and outcomes of UE.The intubated adult patients with MV support in our hospital were enrolled, and they were divided into the UE and non-UE groups. Demographic data, admission unit, MV duration, overall weaning rate, and mortality rates were compared. The outcomes of UE in ordinary ward and intensive care unit (ICU) were also assessed.Totally 9245 intubated adult patients were included. UE occurred in 303 (3.5%) patients, and the UE events were 0.27?times/100 MV days. Old age, nonoperation related MV cause, and admission out of the ICU were significant factors associated with UE events. UE patients showed a trend of better overall weaning rate (71.9% vs 66.7%, P?=?.054) than non-UE. However, the in-hospital mortality rate (25.7% vs 24.8%, P?=?.713) were similar between the UE and non-UE patients. The reintubation rate of UE patients was 44.1% (142/322). Successful UEs were associated with patients in weaning process (52.8% vs 38.7%, P?=?.012), and patients received non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) support after UE (19.4% vs 3.5%, P?<?.001). Patients with successful UE had significantly shorter MV days, higher overall weaning rate, and lower mortality than those with unsuccessful UE. Outcomes of UE in ordinary ward and in ICU had similar MV duration, reintubation rate, overall weaning rate, and in-hospital mortality rate.The overall weaning rate and in-hospital mortality rates of the UE and non-UE patients were similar. UE occurred in ordinary ward had similar outcomes to those in ICU. Patients receiving MV should be assessed daily for weaning indications to reduce delayed extubation, and therefore, may decrease UE occurrence. Once the UE happened, NIPPV support may reduce the reintubation rate.","aged; artificial ventilation; case control study; epidemiology; extubation; female; health care facility; human; incidence; intensive care unit; male; middle aged; patient compliance; procedures; prognosis; retreatment; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; treatment outcome; ventilator weaning; Aged; Airway Extubation; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care); Patient Compliance; Patients' Rooms; Prognosis; Respiration, Artificial; Retreatment; Taiwan; Ventilator Weaning"
"Statins improve the long-term prognosis in patients who have survived sepsis: A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan (STROBE complaint)",2019,"Most patients diagnosed with sepsis died during their first episode, with the long-term survival rate upon post-sepsis discharge being low. Major adverse cardiovascular events and recurrent infections were regarded as the major causes of death. No definite medications had proven to be effective in improving the long-term prognosis. We aimed to examine the benefits of statins on the long-term prognosis of patients who had survived sepsis.Between 1999 and 2013, a total of 220,082 patients who had been hospitalized due to the first episode of sepsis were included, with 134,448 (61.09%) of them surviving to discharge. The surviving patients who were subsequently prescribed statins at a concentration of more than 30 cumulative Defined Daily Doses (cDDDs) during post-sepsis discharge were defined as the users of statin.After a propensity score matching ratio of 1:5, a total of 7356 and 36,780 surviving patients were retrieved for the study (statin users) and comparison cohort (nonstatin users), respectively. The main outcome was to determine the long-term survival rate during post-sepsis discharge.HR with 95% CI was calculated using the Cox regression model to evaluate the effectiveness of statins, with further stratification analyses according to cDDDs.The users of statins had an adjusted HR of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.27-0.31) in their long-term mortality rate when compared with the comparison cohort. For the users of statins with cDDDs of 30-180, 180-365, and >365, the adjusted HRs were 0.32, 0.22, and 0.16, respectively, (95% CI, 0.30-0.34, 0.19-0.26, and 0.12-0.23, respectively), as compared with the nonstatins users (defined as the use of statins <30 cDDDs during post-sepsis discharge), with the P for trend <.0001. In the sensitivity analysis, after excluding the surviving patients who had died between 3 and 6 months after post-sepsis discharge, the adjusted HR for the users of statins remained significant (0.35, 95% CI 0.32-0.37 and 0.42, 95% CI 0.39-0.45, respectively).Statins may have the potential to decrease the long-term mortality of patients who have survived sepsis. However, more evidence, including clinical and laboratory data, is necessary in order to confirm the results of this observational cohort study.Trial registration: CMUH104-REC2-115.","hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; adolescent; adult; aged; cohort analysis; comorbidity; demography; dose response; female; human; male; middle aged; mortality; prognosis; propensity score; regression analysis; risk factor; sepsis; socioeconomics; Taiwan; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Propensity Score; Regression Analysis; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Sepsis; Socioeconomic Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Lots of little ones: Analysis of charitable donations to a hospice and palliative care unit in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Charitable donations play a major role in the provision of hospice and palliative care (HPC) services, most of which are not reimbursed by health insurance programs. A good understanding of the constitution and use of donations is thus conducive to maintaining a high-quality HPC unit. Methods: The data sources were the publicly available balance sheet, work report, and donor lists of a foundation exclusively supporting one of the best HPC units in Taiwan in the fiscal year of 2017. The analysis included the donation amounts and frequencies by donor type (individual, corporate, and group) and the categories of expenses. Results: The foundation received 3033 donations worth a total of 7.8 million New Taiwan dollars (NTD) (approximately 258 thousand US dollars) in 2017. Two-thirds of the donations were allocated to the provision of direct care services. Of the 3033 donations, only 11 (0.4%) were worth 100 000 NTD or more, while 108 (3.6%) were valued between 10 000 and 99 999 NTD, 1268 (41.8%) were valued between 1000 and 9999 NTD, and 1646 (54.2%) were worth less than 1000 NTD. Of 1051 donors, 974 (92.7%) were individuals, 378 (36.0%) donated more than once, and 106 (10.1%) donated 12 or more times in one year. Conclusion: HPC services in Taiwan are sponsored by lots of individuals and small donations. For sustainability of standards-based and quality HPC services, the benevolence of the public should be thus cherished and adequately responded to. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","health care; health insurance; health services; hospital sector; standard (regulation); sustainability; adult; article; controlled study; female; hospice; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; palliative therapy; Taiwan; health insurance; Taiwan"
"Emergency Department Visits and Disease Burden Attributable to Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions in Elderly Adults",2019,"Many countries worldwide are aging rapidly, and the complex care needs of older adults generate an unprecedented demand for health services. Common reasons for elderly emergency department (ED) visits frequently involve conditions triggered by preventable infections also known as ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs). This study aims to describe the trend and the associated disease burden attributable to ACSC-related ED visits made by elderly patients and to characterize their ED use by nursing home residence. We designed a population-based ecological study using administrative data on Taiwan EDs between 2002 and 2013. A total of 563,647 ED visits from individuals aged 65 or over were examined. All elderly ED visits due to ACSCs (tuberculosis, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, sepsis, cellulitis and urinary tract infection (UTI)) were further identified. Subsequent hospital admissions, related deaths after discharge, total health care costs and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were compared among different ACSCs. Prevalence of ACSCs was then assessed between nursing home (NH) residents and non-NH residents. Within the 12-year observation period, we find that there was a steady increase in both the rate of ACSC ED visits and the proportion of elderly with a visit. Overall, pneumonia is the most prevalent among six ACSCs for elderly ED visits (2.10%; 2.06 to 2.14), subsequent hospital admissions (5.77%; 5.59 to 5.94) and associated mortality following admission (17.37%; 16.74 to 18.01). UTI is the second prevalent ACSC consistently across ED visits (2.02%; 1.98 to 2.05), subsequent hospital admissions (2.36%, 2.25 to 2.48) and mortality following admission (10.80%; 10.28 to 11.32). Sepsis ranks third highest in the proportion of hospitalization following ED visit (2.29%; 2.18 to 2.41) and related deaths after hospital discharge (7.39%; 6.95 to 7.83), but it accounts for the highest average total health care expenditure (NT$94,595 ± 120,239; ?US$3185.02) per case. When examining the likelihood of ACSC-attributable ED use, significantly higher odds were observed in NH residents as compared with non-NH residents for: pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.50–5.58); UTI (aOR: 4.44, 95% CI 3.97–4.98); sepsis (aOR: 3.54, 95% CI 3.06–4.10); and tuberculosis (aOR: 2.44, 95% CI 1.63–3.65). Here we examined the ACSC-related ED care and found that, among the six ACSCs studied, pneumonia, UTI and sepsis were the leading causes of ED visits, subsequent hospital admissions, related mortality, health care costs and DALYs in Taiwanese NH elderly adults. Our findings suggest that efficient monitoring and reinforcing of quality of care in the residential and community setting might substantially reduce the number of preventable elderly ED visits and alleviate strain on the health care system. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Clinical characteristics, antimicrobial resistance and capsular types of community-acquired, healthcare-associated, and nosocomial Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia",2019,"Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics, distribution of capsular types, and antimicrobial resistance of K. pneumoniae bacteremia among community-acquired (CA), healthcare-associated (HCA), and nosocomial infections. Methods: This retrospective study of patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia was conducted at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from January to December 2015. Clinical characteristics of K. pneumoniae bacteremia were collected. The K. pneumoniae isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and capsular genotyping. Results: In total, 337 patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia were identified: 70 (20.8%), 102 (30.3%), and 165 (48.9%) presented with CA, HCA, and nosocomial infection, respectively. The 28-day mortality of HCA bacteremia was lower than that of nosocomial bacteremia (17.6% versus 30.9%, p = 0.016); however, that of the HCA and CA bacteremia was similar (17.6% versus 14.3%, p = 0.557). CA isolates had the highest prevalence of virulent capsular types (51.4%), followed by HCA (36.3%) and nosocomial isolates (19.4%). The proportion of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates was highest in nosocomial infections (41.8%), followed by HCA (23.5%) and CA infections (5.7%). Conclusion: CA, HCA and nosocomial K. pneumoniae are distinct entities, as evidenced by the differences in clinical characteristics, antimicrobial resistance, and capsular types found in this study. ? 2019 The Author(s).","amikacin; cefepime; ceftriaxone; cefuroxime; ciprofloxacin; cotrimoxazole; ertapenem; gentamicin; imipenem; levofloxacin; tigecycline; abdominal infection; aged; antibiotic resistance; APACHE; Article; artificial ventilation; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; clinical feature; clinical outcome; community acquired infection; comorbidity; comparative study; descriptive research; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; female; genotype; Gram negative sepsis; healthcare associated infection; hospital infection; hospital mortality; human; immune deficiency; invasive procedure; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae infection; liver abscess; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; pneumonia; priority journal; respiratory failure; retrospective study; rmpA gene; rmpA2 gene; urinary tract infection; wild type"
"Symptom severity and interference assessment in geriatric survivors of urinary bladder cancer",2019,"Background/Purpose: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies of the lower genitourinary tract; nevertheless, research focused on symptoms of geriatric survivors of bladder cancer is limited. The purpose of this study was to explore associated factors with symptom severity and interference as well as its changes in different time among elderly bladder cancer survivors. Methods: Participants were recruited to the present longitudinal study from the outpatient department of a community hospital in northern Taiwan between February and August 2016. A demographic questionnaire and the Taiwanese version of the Anderson Symptom Inventory were used to collect data at three time points. Results: A total of 54 bladder cancer survivors were enrolled in the present study. Disturbed sleep was the most severe symptom. Symptom interference with daily life appeared to be emotional. Furthermore, the age, household income, primary caregiver, and urinary bladder cancer stage of the survivors were significantly associated with symptom severity; while, gender, age, and tumor stage were also found to be significantly associated with symptom interference with daily life. Conclusions: Various factors associated symptom severity and interference with daily life in this specific population were reported. In addition, symptom severity and interference with daily life in aging survivors with bladder cancer is unstable. This finding may imply that clinicians should assess the symptoms of such survivors continuously, in order to helpreduce symptom severity and interference with daily life. ? 2019, Asian Association for Frailty and Sarcopenia and Taiwan Association for Integrated Care.

"Suicidality Among Gay and Bisexual Men in Taiwan: Its Relationships with Sexuality and Gender Role Characteristics, Homophobic Bullying Victimization, and Social Support",2019,"This study aimed to examine the associations of suicidality in emerging adulthood with time of coming out, gender role nonconformity, sexual orientation, traditional and cyber homophobic bullying victimization, and family and peer support during childhood in gay and bisexual men in Taiwan. The frequency of “experiencing suicide ideation” and “attempting suicide” in the past year among 500 gay or bisexual men was examined. The participants’ time of coming out, level of subjective masculinity, sexual orientation, experiences of traditional and cyber homophobic bullying victimization, and levels of family and peer support during childhood were also evaluated. In total, 31% (n = 155) of participants reported experiencing suicide ideation (n = 82) or attempting suicide (n = 73). Early coming out, traditional homophobic bullying victimization, and low family support during childhood increased the risk of suicidality in emerging adulthood; by contrast, family support did not moderate the association of early coming out or traditional bullying victimization with current suicidality. A high proportion of participants reported experiencing suicide ideation and attempt in emerging adulthood. Hence, effective suicide prevention is required for gay and bisexual men. Suicide prevention programs should consider time of coming out, traditional homophobic bullying victimization, and level of family support. ? 2018 The American Association of Suicidology","adult; bisexuality; bullying; crime victim; gender identity; homophobia; human; male; male homosexuality; psychology; questionnaire; sexual and gender minority; social support; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Bisexuality; Bullying; Crime Victims; Gender Identity; Homophobia; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Support; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Continuity of outpatient care and avoidable hospitalization: A systematic review",2019,"OBJECTIVES: Continuity of care (COC) is a core element of primary care, which has been associated with improved health outcomes.

Studies published in English between 2008 and 2017 that measured the association between COC and at least 1 measure of ACSC hospitalizations were included in this review. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria and applied claims data to examine the association between COC and ACSC hospitalizations. Most studies (93.3%) demonstrated a statistically significant association of higher COC in the outpatient setting with reduced likelihood of hospitalization for either all ACSCs or a specific ACSC. A strong association was observed among studies focusing on patients with a specific ACSC. Additionally, most studies used the Bice-Boxerman COC index to measure COC and measured COC before a period of measuring ACSC hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified that increased COC in outpatient care is associated with fewer hospitalizations for ACSCs. Increasing COC is favorable for patients who are managing a specific ACSC. ? 2019 Ascend Media.

"Analysis of mutational spectra in metastatic colorectal carcinoma: KRAS as an indicator of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy",2019,"Objective: Mutation spectra in colorectal cancer with metastasis and its response to chemotherapy. Summary of Background Data: No molecular markers are available for selecting the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen (irinotecan or oxaliplatin) for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Methods: We enrolled 161 mCRC patients who underwent surgery for their primary tumors at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 2004 to 2010. The prevalence of gene mutations was measured and correlated with responses to different cytotoxic agents. Results: We detected 1,836 mutations in 12 genes. KRAS mutants affected 44.3% of the tumors. The rate of good response was insignificantly higher for patients with KRAS mutant tumors who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy compared with patients with KRAS wild-type tumors (65.6% versus 47.0%; P ? 0.15). For patients who received irinotecan-based chemotherapy, the rate of good response was similar in patients with wild-type (55.0%; n ? 11) and those with KRAS mutant tumors (54.5%; n ? 12; P ? 1). In patients with KRAS mutant tumors treated with an oxaliplatin-based regimen, the overall survival was 38.5 months (95% CI: 26.6–50.5 months), which was insignificantly better than that for patients treated with an irinotecan-based regimen (30.4 months; 95% CI: 15.8–45.1 months; P ? 0.206). Conclusions: Our data could not come to the conclusion that patient with KRAS mutation mCRC may have better response with oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy. Further study is needed to confirm the relationship between gene mutation and chemotherapy response. ? 2018 Chang et al.",""
"Platelet MicroRNA 365-3p Expression Correlates with High On-treatment Platelet Reactivity in Coronary Artery Disease Patients",2019,"Purpose: The expression level of platelet microRNAs (miRNAs) correlates with heart disease and may be altered by antiplatelet therapy. This study aims to assess whether certain miRNAs are associated with treatment response by platelets in patients who received percutaneous coronary intervention and antiplatelet therapy. The dynamic expression of certain miRNAs in patients receiving different antiplatelet regimens was also investigated. Methods: Healthy subjects (N = 20) received no-stent or antiplatelet therapy (as control), and patients (N = 155) who underwent stent implant and received treatment regimens that included aspirin plus clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or cilostazol were included. The association of miR-96-5p, miR-495-3p, miR-107, miR-223-3p, miR-15a-5, miR-365-3p, and miR-339-3p levels with treatment response, SYNTAX score, and HTPR was determined. Results: Of the different treatment regimens, ticagrelor was the most efficacious. At 24?h following drug administration, ROC analysis revealed that miR-339-3p and miR-365-3p had the highest sensitivity (74.3% and 90.0%, respectively) and specificity (71.4% and 93.3%) for detecting HTPR compared with the five other miRNAs. The SYNTAX score positively correlated with miR-223-3p and miR-365-3p levels at 24?h (P ? 0.006) and with miR-365-3p levels 7?days following drug administration (P = 0.014). The expression of all three miRNAs reached the highest levels in hyperresponsive (P2Y12 reaction unit < 85) followed by hyporesponsive (P2Y12 reaction unit ? 208) and then normoreactive. The normoreactive value was very close to that of controls. Conclusions: Our data suggest that miR-365-3p expression level correlates with the antiplatelet treatment response.

"Tribbles homolog 3 involved in radiation response of triple negative breast cancer cells by regulating notch1 activation",2019,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer for women in Taiwan and post-lumpectomy radiotherapy is one of the therapeutic strategies for this malignancy. Although the 10-year overall survival of breast cancer patients is greatly improved by radiotherapy, the locoregional recurrence is around 10% and triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are at a high risk for relapse. The aim of this paper is to understand the mechanisms of radioresistance in breast cancers which may facilitate the development of new treatments in sensitizing breast cancer toward radiation therapy. Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) is a pseudokinase protein and known to function as a protein scaffold within cells. It has been reported that higher TRIB3 expression is a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer patients with radiotherapy. In this study, we investigate the involvement of TRIB3 in the radiation response of TNBC cells. We first found that the expression of TRIB3 and the activation of Notch1, as well as Notch1 target genes, increased in two radioresistant TNBC cells. Knockdown of TRIB3 in radioresistant MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells decreased Notch1 activation, as well as the CD24-CD44+ cancer stem cell population, and sensitized cells toward radiation treatment. The inhibitory effects of TRIB3 knockdown in self-renewal or radioresistance could be reversed by forced expression of the Notch intracellular domain. We also observed an inhibition in cell growth and accumulated cells in the G0/G1 phase in radioresistant MDA-MB-231 cells after knockdown of TRIB3. With immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis, we found that, BCL2-associated transcription factor 1 (BCLAF1), BCL2 interacting protein 1 (BNIP1), or DEAD-box helicase 5 (DDX5) were the possible TRIB3 interacting proteins and immunoprecipitation data also confirmed that these proteins interacted with TRIB3 in radioresistant MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, the expression of TRIB3 in radioresistant TNBC cells participated in Notch1 activation and targeted TRIB3 expression may be a strategy to sensitize TNBC cells toward radiation therapy. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis comorbid with diabetic macular edema",2019,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis comorbid with diabetic retinopathy is uncommon. We report a case of bilateral CMV retinitis and diabetic retinopathy in a patient who underwent pancreas transplantation and share the experience of the treatment outcome. An 18-year-old male diagnosed with type-1 diabetes mellitus received pancreas transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy suffered from progressively blurred vision in both eyes for several days. His visual acuity was 20/100 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral diabetic macular edema (DME) without intraocular inflammatory signs in either eye. The DME subsided after 2 monthly intravitreal injections of aflibercept. However, bilateral panuveitis with CMV retinitis was observed after antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy. The retinitis subsided gradually but completely after systemic and intravitreal antiviral therapy. However, bilateral DME recurred and persisted despite repeated injections of aflibercept during the resting follow-up period. Our case suggests that CMV retinitis can coexist with other retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy. Treatment is difficult in such cases. ? 2019 Taiwan J Ophthalmol.",""
"Interferon α-inducible protein 27 is an oncogene and highly expressed in cholangiocarcinoma patients with poor survival",2019,"Objective: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a devastating disease. Interferon α-inducible protein 27 (IFI27), originally known to involve in innate immunity, is later found to intervene in cell proliferation, leading to inventive studies regarding the role of IFI27 in cancer treatment. We aimed to investigate the role of IFI27 in CCA. Materials and methods: Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays, Western blot, gene transfection and knockdown, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical stains, and xenograft animal model were applied. Results: IFI27 knockdown in CCA cells induced cell cycle arrest in S phase, resulting in lower cell proliferative rate in vitro and in vivo. IFI27 knockdown attenuated CCA cell migration and invasion through inhibition of epithelial–mesenchymal transition, which was supported by increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin and fibronectin. Filamentous actin level was also reduced. IFI27 knockdown further repressed expression and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), a strong stimulator of angiogenesis, through downregulation of c-jun and c-fos, which was supported in vitro by the finding that human vascular endothelial cells grew more slowly in conditioned medium of IFI27 knockdown on CCA cells and in vivo by the lower erythropoietin concentration found in the xenografted tumors derived from IFI27 knockdown on CCA cells. In addition, anti-VEGF-A antibody treatment was able to repress CCA cell growth. To the contrary, IFI27 overexpression could increase CCA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Clinically, higher IFI27 expression was linked to inferior overall survival of CCA patients. Conclusion: Our data strongly suggest that IFI27 could be deemed as a potential target for CCA treatment. ? 2019 Chiang et al.","actin; alpha interferon; alpha interferon inducible protein 27; erythropoietin; fibronectin; nerve cell adhesion molecule; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin antibody; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression; gene function; gene overexpression; gene targeting; human; human cell; IFI27 gene; in vitro study; in vivo study; major clinical study; metastasis; metastasis inhibition; migration inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; overall survival; protein synthesis inhibition; S phase cell cycle checkpoint; survival rate; tumor invasion; tumor xenograft"
"Breastfeeding Experiences of Taiwanese Mothers of Infants with Breastfeeding or Breast Milk Jaundice in Certified Baby-Friendly Hospitals",2019,"Purpose: The purpose was to explore the breastfeeding experiences of mothers of infants with breastfeeding or breast milk jaundice. Methods: In-depth qualitative interviews and content analysis were conducted with nine mothers of newborns with breastfeeding and/or breast milk jaundice who breastfed their babies during the first year postpartum. Results: Mothers' experiences can be described in four phases and six themes. (1) Prenatal stage: build breastfeeding belief, i.e., breastfeeding is best and a natural behavior, without awareness of neonatal jaundice; (2) stage after neonatal jaundice started to appear: include two themes, questioning beliefs in breastfeeding and happiness in being a mother. Mothers lacked knowledge and ignored the threat of neonatal jaundice, mainly focused on their physical discomforts and worried about insufficient breast milk; they also felt an intimate mother–infant bond through breastfeeding; (3) stage when newborns had confirmed diagnosis of breastfeeding or breast milk jaundice that required medical attention: include two themes, diagnosis of breastfeeding or breast milk jaundice and phototherapy caused negative emotions and regaining original beliefs about breastfeeding. They struggled through emotional swings and inconsistent advices about whether phototherapy and formula supplementation are needed. Then, they decided breastfeeding or breast milk jaundice is only temporary and retrieved initial beliefs of breastfeeding. (4) Stage after neonatal jaundice faded and mothers continued breastfeeding: insisting and adapting. Conclusion: Breastfeeding mothers were unaware of neonatal jaundice until medical attention was required; they experienced physical and mental distress and gradually learned to manage jaundice while insisting on breastfeeding through their breastfeeding beliefs and happiness in being mothers. ? 2019","adolescent; Article; artificial milk; breast feeding; breast milk; distress syndrome; emotion; experience; female; happiness; health belief; hospital; human; infant; knowledge; mother; mother child relation; newborn; newborn jaundice; phototherapy; priority journal; Taiwanese; adult; attitude to health; breast feeding; interview; newborn jaundice; psychology; Taiwan; Adult; Breast Feeding; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hospitals; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Jaundice, Neonatal; Mothers; Taiwan"
"What's wrong with neutrophils in lupus?",2019,"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) act by promoting phagocytosis, and are regarded as the first line of defense against pathogen invasion. However, recent investigations have revealed that they have many previously unknown functions. These functions include mitogen-induced cell-mediated cytotoxicity, production of cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and ectosomes/exosomes. Membrane exchange (trogocytosis) is also noted following direct cell-cell contact with other immune cells for modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. These observations strongly suggest that neutrophils may play an important role in the immune network. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototype of systemic autoimmune diseases characterised by the production of diverse antigen-driven autoantibodies against intra- and extracellular molecules. Multiple immune dysfunctions have been reported in SLE patients. These include excessive interferon alpha (IFN-α) expression, aberrant cytokine/chemokine/growth factor production, skewing of T cell immune responses toward Th2 and Th17 pathways, polyclonal B cell activation, increased apoptosis and NET formation, defective clearance of cell debris and NET-related molecules, and abnormal ectosome/exosome release in the plasma. We have demonstrated that SLE-PMNs per se exhibit aberrant cytokine/chemokine expression, defective glucose metabolism, and increased mitochondrial DNA D310 heteroplasmy with reduced redox capacity. Our data also indicate that autoantibodies purified from SLE sera disrupt PMN functions. In the present review, we discuss these abnormalities in detail and attempt to elucidate the potential roles of disrupted PMN functions in lupus pathogenesis.","discoid lupus erythematosus; extracellular trap; human; immunology; neutrophil; phagocytosis; systemic lupus erythematosus; Extracellular Traps; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Neutrophils; Phagocytosis"
"A Tri-fusion Reporter Mouse Reveals Tissue-Specific FGF1B Promoter Activity in vivo",2019,"Transgenic mice harboring imaging reporters take full advantage of imaging technologies in studies using living mice. Here, we established a tri-fusion multimodal reporter gene containing fragments from firefly luciferase, enhanced green fluorescent protein, and herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase and generated tri-fusion reporter Tg mice. Fibroblast growth factor type 1 (FGF1), a multifunctional mitogen to a wide range of tissues, regulates proliferation of neural stem cells of the brain, where FGF1 expression is initiated through activation of the FGF1B (F1B) promoter. The reporter mouse under the control of the human F1B promoter enables visualization in vivo where F1B activity is elevated, including tissues not only in the brain but also in the nasopharynx, skull, spine, and testes, particularly in Leydig cells. Treating Tg mice with the alkylating agent busulfan, which is known to eradicate Leydig cells and disrupt spermatogenesis in mice, eliminated the reporter signals. Restoring Leydig cells recovered reporter expression, indicating that the reporter can be used as a surrogate marker for Leydig cells. The F1B tri-fusion reporter mouse model can be utilized in longitudinal monitoring of the health status of the male reproductive system, such as in studies exploring the toxicity of chemicals to spermatogenesis.",""
"Excess mortality reduction given a “reduce patient mortality at all costs” scenario for mass burn casualties",2019,"Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the effect on medical resource use and mortality of full financial support from the government for treatment costs after a mass burn casualty event in Taiwan. Methods: All patients with burn injuries from the event were included (n = 483). Each burn patient from this incident was matched to a separate burn patient identified from the National Health Insurance database. Medical care usage and mortality were compared between groups at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals. Results: Regarding outpatient expenditure, burn patients from the mass casualty event had significantly higher levels of medical expenditure compared with their control counterparts at all intervals and levels of medical institution. For inpatient expenditure, patients from the mass casualty event only had higher expenditure for the first month, and excess procedures used by these patients mainly consisted of nonvital procedures such as rehabilitation training. The mortality rate was only slightly lower for this group of burn patients compared with their control counterparts. Conclusions: Full financial support by the government in terms of medical treatment may engender only marginal additional benefits in terms of mortality if burn treatment procedures are already well established in the country. ? 2019","adult; article; body weight; burn patient; controlled study; female; government; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; mass disaster; medical care; mortality rate; national health insurance; outpatient; Taiwan"
"Early Seroreversion After 2 Doses of Hepatitis A Vaccination in Human Immunodeficiency Virus–Positive Patients: Incidence and Associated Factors",2019,"Serological responses (Seroresponse) and durability of hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination are reduced among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Incidence of and associated factors with early seroreversion (loss of seroresponse) among HIV-positive patients who have achieved seroresponses after two doses of HAV vaccination remain unclear. In this multicenter study, we followed HIV-positive adults who had mounted seroresponses after completing two doses of HAV vaccination during a recent outbreak of acute hepatitis A between 2015 and 2017, a 1:4 case-control study was conducted to identify factors associated with seroreversion. Case patients were those with seroreversion, and controls were those with similar follow-up durations who were able to maintain seroresponses. During the study period, 49 of the 1,256 patients (3.9%) seroreverted after a median follow-up of 611 days. In a case-control study, seroreversion was more likely to occur in patients with a higher weight (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.703; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.292-2.323, per 10-kg increment) and HIV viremia at the time of vaccination (aOR, 2.922; 95% CI, 1.067-7.924), whereas positive seroresponse at 6 months of HAV vaccination and higher CD4 lymphocyte counts at vaccination were inversely associated with early seroreversion with an aOR of 0.059 (95% CI, 0.020-0.154) and 0.837 (95% CI, 0.704-0.979, per 100-cell/mm3increment), respectively, in multivariable analyses. Conclusion: During an outbreak setting, early seroreversion following two-dose HAV vaccination occurred in 3.9% of HIV-positive patients. Lower and delayed seroresponses to HAV vaccination, a higher weight, and HIV viremia and lower CD4 lymphocyte counts at the time of HAV vaccination were associated with early seroreversion. Regular monitoring of seroresponse and booster vaccination might be warranted, especially in HIV-positive adults with predictors of early seroreversion. ? 2019 The Authors.

"The effectiveness of teaching chest compression first in a standardized public cardiopulmonary resuscitation training program",2019,"Effectiveness of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is known to provide emergency medical services which reduce the number of deaths in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The survival at these patients is affected by the training level of the bystander, but the best format of CPR training is unclear. In this pilot study, we aimed to examine whether the sequence of CPR instruction improves learning retention on the course materials.A total of 95 participants were recruited and divided into 2 groups; Group 1: 49 participants were taught firstly how to recognize a cardiac arrest and activate the emergency response system, and Group 2: 46 participants were taught chest compression first. The performance of participants was observed and evaluated, the results from 1 pre-test and 2 post-tests between 2 groups were then compared.There was a significantly better improvement of participants in Group 2 regarding the recognition of a cardiac arrest and the activation of the emergency response system than of those in Group 1. At the post-test, participants in Group 2 had an improvement in chest compression compared to those in Group 1, but the difference was not statistically significant.Our study had revealed that teaching CPR first in a standardized public education program had improved the ability of participants to recognize cardiac arrest and to activate the emergency response system.","adult; comparative study; defibrillator; education; emergency health service; female; human; male; middle aged; mortality; out of hospital cardiac arrest; physiology; pressure; resuscitation; standards; thorax; Adult; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Defibrillators; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; Pressure; Thorax"

Materials and methods: PIONEER 6 is a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events (defined as being aged ?50 years and having established CV disease [CVD] or moderate [stage 3] chronic kidney disease [CKD], or being aged ?60 years with ?1 other CV risk factor). Patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (up to 14 mg) or placebo added to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is time to first occurrence of CV death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was to exclude an excess in CV risk with oral semaglutide by assessing non-inferiority versus placebo for the primary endpoint (non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio). PIONEER 6 is event-driven, with follow-up continuing until accrual of at least 122 primary outcome events. There is no pre-defined minimal duration. Results: Overall, 3183 patients have been enrolled (mean age 66.1 years, 31.6% females) in 214 sites across 21 countries. At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years, mean glycated haemoglobin concentration was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), and 84.6% of patients had established CVD/moderate CKD.

"Systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of hospital competition on quality of care: Implications for senior care",2019,"Background: Empirical studies examined the associations between hospital competition and quality of care by using different methodology, measures, patient groups and geographic locations; however, results remained inconclusive. This study aimed to apply meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of hospital competition on quality of care and to explore the potential implications to care for senior patients. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis combining results from various studies to obtain an overall outcome was performed. Measure of effect size, I2 test, meta-regression to find sources of heterogeneity, tests for publication bias, sensitivity analysis and cumulative analysis were performed. The mean effect size is estimated by coefficient and standard error with P values less than 0.05 which was considered statistically significant. Results: Based on the selection criteria, only 11 studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. The pooled effect of hospital competition on quality of care was reported by all of the 11 included studies. Results of the meta-analysis suggested that hospital competition reduced quality of care, but the overall effect was relatively insignificant from a statistical perspective (Point estimate = 0.008, 95% CI = -0.004 ? 0.020, P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Hospital competition slightly increased mortality rates of acute myocardial infarction, but not statistically significant. The negative impact may be lessened over time as medical technology, practices, and techniques improve. Older patients with complex care needs may be at risk for poorer quality of care related to hospital competition. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","acute heart infarction; Article; competition; effect size; elderly care; geographic distribution; geriatric patient; health care quality; hospital; human; methodology; mortality rate; priority journal; publication bias; sample size; sensitivity analysis; study design; systematic review"
"Two transcutaneous stimulation techniques in shoulder pain: Transcutaneous Pulsed Radiofrequency (TPRF) versus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS): A comparative pilot study",2019,"Objective. To compare the safety and efficacy of 2 transcutaneous stimulation techniques, transcutaneous pulsed radiofrequency (TPRF) versus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), in chronic shoulder tendonitis. Design. A prospective, randomized, and double-blind clinical trial. Setting. Academic pain service of a city hospital. Subjects. Fifty patients with sonography-confirmed shoulder tendonitis. Methods. Fifty patients were randomly allocated into two groups for electrical stimulation treatment with 3-month follow-ups: Group 1 n=25, TENS and Group 2 n=25, TPRF. Both groups underwent either treatment for 15 minutes every other day, three times total. Our primary goals were to find any treatment comfort level, adverse event, and changes in Constant-Murley shoulder (CMS) scores. The secondary goals were finding the changes in pain, enjoyment of life, and general activity (PEG) scores. Results. For primary goals, no adverse events were noted throughout this study. No differences were found between groups for treatment tolerability (3.20 + 0.87 vs. 2.16 + 0.75). Statistically significant lower PEG scores were noticeable with the TPRF group after the course (12.73 + 5.79 vs. 24.53 + 10.21, p=0.013). Their statistical significance lasted for 3 months although the difference gap diminished after 1 month. CMS scores were significantly higher in the TPRF group (70.84 + 6.74 vs. 59.56 + 9.49, p=0.007) right after treatment course but the significance did not last. Conclusions. In treating chronic shoulder tendinitis using two transcutaneous stimulation techniques, both TPRF and TENS are safe and effective. TPRF is superior to TENS. ? 2019 Mu-Lien Lin et al.","adult; adverse outcome; aged; Article; chronic disease; comparative effectiveness; Constant Murley (score); controlled study; double blind procedure; echography; electrostimulation; female; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; patient comfort; pilot study; prospective study; pulsed radiofrequency treatment; randomized controlled trial; safety procedure; shoulder pain; study design; tendinitis; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; transcutaneous pulsed radiofrequency; treatment duration; analgesia; complication; middle aged; procedures; pulsed radiofrequency treatment; shoulder pain; tendinitis; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; Adult; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Management; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Pulsed Radiofrequency Treatment; Shoulder Pain; Tendinopathy; Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation"
"Development and psychometric testing of the Chinese version of the Resilience Scale for Southeast Asian immigrant women who divorced in Taiwan",2019,"Background :Only a few studies exist on the resilience of divorced women. Furthermore, relevant instruments for assessing the resilience of divorced immigrant Southeast Asian women are rare. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to develop and examine a new Resilience Scale-Chinese version (RS-C) that is specific to divorced immigrant Southeast Asian women in Taiwan. Methods :The study was conducted in two phases. In phase 1, 20 items were used to evaluate face and content validities. In phase 2, a cross-sectional study was conducted. In total, 118 immigrant women participated in this study and were recruited from three nongovernmental organizations providing services for immigrants in Taipei City and Miaoli and Chiayi Counties. Psychometric properties of the instrument (i.e., internal consistency, test-retest reliability, item-to-total correlation, construct validity, and convergent validity) were examined. Significance was set at p < 0.05 for all statistical tests. Results: The final 16-item RS-C resulted in a three-factor model. The three factors, namely personal competence, family identity, and social connections, were an acceptable fit for the data and explained 54.60% of the variance. Cronbach's α of the RS-C was 0.85, and those of its subscales ranged from 0.77 to 0.82. The correlation value of the test-retest reliability was 0.87. The RS-C was significantly associated with the General Self-Efficacy scale and the Chinese Health Questionnaire-12. Conclusion: The RS-C is a brief and specific self-report tool for evaluating the resilience of divorced immigrant Southeast Asian women and demonstrated adequate reliability and validity in this study. This RS-C instrument has potential applications in both clinical practice and research with strength-based resiliency interventions. However, additional research on the RS-C is required to further establish its reliability and validity. ? 2019 Kuo et al.

"Amino acid-based metabolic profile provides functional assessment and prognostic value for heart failure outpatients",2019,"Functional capacity is a crucial parameter correlated with outcomes. The currently used New York Heart Association functional classification (NYHA Fc) system has substantial limitations, leading to inaccurate classification. This study investigated whether amino acid-based assessment on metabolic status provides an objective way to assess functional capacity and prognosis in heart failure (HF) outpatients. Plasma concentrations of histidine, ornithine, and phenylalanine (HOP) were measured on 890 HF outpatients to assess metabolic status by calculating the HOP score. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed in 387 patients to measure metabolic equivalents (MET) in order to define the functional class based on MET (MET Fc). Patients were followed for composite events (death/HF-related rehospitalization) up to one year. We found only 47% concordance between the MET Fc and NYHA Fc. HOP scores worked better than NYHA Fc for discriminating patients with MET Fc II and III from those with MET Fc I, with the optimal cutoff value set at 8.8. HOPscores ? 8 8 were associated with risk factors for composite events in different kinds of HF populations and were a powerful predictor of composite events in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis, HOPscores ? 8 8 remained a powerful event predictor, independent of other risk factors. Kaplan- Meier curves revealed that HOP scores of ? 8.8 stratified patients at higher risk of composite events in a variety of HF populations. In conclusion, amino acid-based assessment of metabolic status correlates with functional capacity in HF outpatients and provides prognostic value for a variety of HF populations.

"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of Parkinson’s disease in the elderly population: a meta-analysis",2019,"Purpose: Several studies have explored the impact of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the risk of Parkinson disease (PD). However, the extent to which NSAIDs may increase or decrease the risk of PD remains unresolved. We, therefore, performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies to quantify the magnitude of the association between NSAID use and PD risk in the elderly population. Methods: The electronic databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were used to search the relevant articles published between January 1990 and December 2017. Large (n ? 1000) observational design studies with a follow-up at least 1?year were considered. Two authors independently extracted information from the included studies. Random effect model was used to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (Cl). Results: A total of 17 studies with 2,498,258 participants and nearly 14,713 PD patients were included in the final analysis. The overall pooled RR of PD was 0.95 (95%CI 0.860–1.048) with significant heterogeneity (I 2 ?= 63.093, Q = 43.352, p &lt; 0.0001). In the subgroup analysis, the overall pooled RR of PD was 0.90 (95%CI 0.738–1.109), 0.96 (95%CI 0.882–1.055), and 0.99 (95%CI 0.841–0.982) from the studies of North America, Europe, and Asia. Additionally, long-term use, study design, individual NSAID use, and risk of PD were also evaluated. Conclusion: Despite the neuroprotective potential of NSAIDs demonstrated in some experimental studies, our findings suggest that there is no association between NSAIDs and the risk of Parkinson disease at the population level. Until further evidence is established, clinicians need to be vigilant ensuring that the use of NSAIDs remains restricted to their approved anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","acetylsalicylic acid; ibuprofen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; neuroprotective agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; aged; Article; drug exposure; drug safety; human; long term care; meta analysis; neuroprotection; Parkinson disease; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; short course therapy; systematic review; treatment duration; Parkinson disease; risk; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Humans; Neuroprotective Agents; Parkinson Disease; Risk"
"Dual-function nanostructured platform for isolation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma circulating tumor cells and EBV DNA detection",2019,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and plasma levels of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) DNA are sensitive prognostic tools for monitoring disease status in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Herein, we introduce a novel and low-cost platform for capturing CTCs, the Si nanowires/microscale pyramids (NWs/MPs) hierarchical substrate, which could capture NPC cells in vitro and also detect EBV DNA at very low concentrations. In this study, Si NWs/MPs hierarchical substrates with varying wire length were fabricated using a metal-assisted chemical etching method. Anti-EpCAM antibodies were further conjugated on the substrate for capturing NPC CTCs in vitro. Capture efficiency was evaluated using immunofluorescence and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was utilized to understand cell morphology. The Si NWs/MPs substrate was also transformed into a Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate by coating with Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) for detection of EBV DNA by Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that Si NWs/MPs with 20 min of etch time had the best capturing performance. Additionally, SEM observations revealed good contact of CTCs with Si NWs/MPs substrates. Moreover, the AgNPs-coated NWs/MPs substrate was shown to be a sensitive EBV DNA detector, by which the DNA detection limit can reach up to 10?13M. In conclusion, the Si NWs/MPs platform not only exhibits superior cell capturing ability, but also can sensitively detect EBV DNA at very low concentrations. This platform has great potential to become a promising diagnostic tool for monitoring disease status and prognostication of NPC patients. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cells; Cytology; Diagnosis; DNA; Etching; Morphology; Nanowires; Raman scattering; Silicon; Silver nanoparticles; Surface scattering; Tumors; Viruses; Capture efficiency; Circulating tumor cells; EpCAM; Low concentrations; Metal-assisted chemical etching; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM); Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); Substrates; nanomaterial; silicon nanowire microscale pyramid; silver nanoparticle; unclassified drug; virus DNA; Article; cell contact; cell isolation; cell structure; circulating tumor cell; controlled study; DNA determination; Epstein Barr virus; human; human cell; immunofluorescence test; in vitro study; limit of detection; material coating; nanofabrication; nasopharynx carcinoma; NPC-TW01 cell line; quantitative analysis; scanning electron microscopy; surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy"
"The association of sociodemographic factors and needs of haemodialysis patients according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs",2019,"Aim: To explore the association between the sociodemographic factors and the needs of patients undergoing haemodialysis in Taiwan. Background: Concomitant discomfort, including physical and mental aspects, affects the patients’ quality of life and their willingness to undergo haemodialysis. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a well-known tool to assess different levels of human needs. Method: We conducted a small-scale cross-sectional observational study using a structured needs assessment questionnaire on 159 patients from the Taipei Veterans General Hospital haemodialysis unit. Results: The overall mean scores of physical, mental, spiritual, other needs and needs in relation to medical staff care were 4.0?±?0.8, 3.2?±?0.8, 2.7?±?1.0, 3.1?±?0.9 and 4.1?±?0.7, respectively. The results showed that the patients’ highest need was in relation to medical staff care, followed by physical needs. Further analysis showed that patients who are still employed during the treatment process have higher mental, spiritual and other needs. Patient who is financially supported by their family has higher physical needs. Patients taken care of by paid caregivers have lower spiritual needs and other needs. This is also the same with patients who are religious as opposed to those who are nonreligious. Patients who have attained tertiary education have higher other needs compared with patients who have only achieved up to primary or secondary education. Conclusion: The study is the first in Taiwan to identify and quantify the needs of patients undergoing haemodialysis. When the needs of the patients are identified in relation to their sociodemographic factors, the medical staff can give the appropriate treatment in order to meet the needs and improve the patients’ well-being. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare providers should not only focus on the patients’ physiological needs, but should determine and address their other needs in various aspects in order to improve the quality and efficacy of the dialysis care process. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; article; caregiver; clinical practice; controlled study; education; female; general hospital; hemodialysis patient; human; major clinical study; male; Maslow's hierarchy of needs; medical staff; needs assessment; nursing care; observational study; quality of life; questionnaire; Taiwan; veteran; wellbeing; cross-sectional study; health care delivery; hemodialysis; middle aged; needs assessment; psychology; quality of life; social support; standards; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Quality of Life; Renal Dialysis; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"
"Apoptosis induction and AKT/NF-κB inactivation are associated with regroafenib-inhibited tumor progression in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo",2019,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)is a malignant lung cancer type with poor prognosis. NF-κB, the oncogenic transcription factor, has been recognized as an important mediator in progression of NSCLC. Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, was demonstrated to inhibit tumor progression through suppression of ERK/NF-κB signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. However, whether regorafenib inhibit progression of NSCLC is ambiguous. Thus, the major purpose of present study was to evaluate anticancer efficacy and underlying mechanism of regorafenib on tumor progression in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. CL-1-5-F4 cells were treated with regorafenib, NF-κB (QNZ)or AKT (LY294002)inhibitor for 24 or 48 h. Then, we performed cell viability assay, NF-κB reporter gene assay, transwell invasion assay and apoptosis related flow cytometry assay on cellular level to verify anti-cancer effect and mechanism of regorafenib. CL-1-5-F4 bearing animal model was treated with vehicle or regorafenib for 28 days. The therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of regorafenib in CL-1-5-F4 bearing animal model were investigated by tumor size evaluation, whole body computer tomography (CT)scan, Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E)stain and immunohistochemistry (IHC)stain. Our results demonstrated regorafenib significantly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we also found the suppression of AKT/NF-κB signaling was required for regorafenib inhibited expression of progression-related and invasion-related proteins. Our finding indicated apoptosis induction and suppression of AKT/NF-κB signaling were associated with regorafenib-inhibited progression of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. ? 2019 The Authors","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; protein kinase B; regorafenib; carbanilamide derivative; death receptor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; protein kinase B; pyridine derivative; regorafenib; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer size; cell invasion assay; cell viability assay; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; flow cytometry; histopathology; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; reporter gene; signal transduction; whole body CT; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; disease exacerbation; DNA damage; drug effect; drug screening; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; nude mouse; pathology; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Animals; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Disease Progression; DNA Damage; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Invasiveness; NF-kappa B; Phenylurea Compounds; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pyridines; Receptors, Death Domain; Signal Transduction; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Perturbational Gene-Expression Signatures for Combinatorial Drug Discovery",2019,"Bioinformatics; Cancer Systems Biology; Pharmacoinformatics ? 2019 The Author(s)Cancer is a complex disease that relies on both oncogenic mutations and non-mutated genes for survival, and therefore coined as oncogene and non-oncogene addictions. The need for more effective combination therapies to overcome drug resistance in oncology has been increasingly recognized, but the identification of potentially synergistic drugs at scale remains challenging. Here we propose a gene-expression-based approach, which uses the recurrent perturbation-transcript regulatory relationships inferred from a large compendium of chemical and genetic perturbation experiments across multiple cell lines, to engender a testable hypothesis for combination therapies. These transcript-level recurrences were distinct from known compound-protein target counterparts, were reproducible in external datasets, and correlated with small-molecule sensitivity. We applied these recurrent relationships to predict synergistic drug pairs for cancer and experimentally confirmed two unexpected drug combinations in vitro. Our results corroborate a gene-expression-based strategy for combinatorial drug screening as a way to target non-mutated genes in complex diseases. ? 2019 The Author(s)",""
"Risks of bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, and traumatic brain injury among siblings of patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder",2019,"Background: Previous studies have suggested that the unaffected siblings of patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience deficits in attention, impulsivity control, and behavior inhibition, which are associated with health-risk behaviors. However, risks to mental and physical health among the unaffected siblings of ADHD probands have rarely been investigated. Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5128 unaffected siblings of ADHD probands born between 1980 and 2000 were included in our study along with 20,512 age- and sex-matched controls, and they were followed from 1996 or birth until the end of 2011. Mental and physical health risks, including affective disorders, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and sexually transmitted infection were identified during the follow-up period. Results: Logistic regression analyses with adjustments for demographic data showed that the unaffected siblings were more likely to develop unipolar depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39–2.22), bipolar disorder (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1. 09–4.05), and TBI (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.14–1.36) than were the control group. Discussion: The unaffected siblings of patients with ADHD were prone to developing unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, and TBI later in life. ? 2018","adolescent; Article; attention deficit disorder; bipolar disorder; brother; controlled study; female; health hazard; high risk behavior; human; impulsiveness; major clinical study; major depression; male; mental health; priority journal; sex difference; sexually transmitted disease; sibling; sister; traumatic brain injury; attention deficit disorder; bipolar disorder; child; complication; depression; major depression; mood disorder; risk factor; Taiwan; traumatic brain injury; young adult; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Bipolar Disorder; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Child; Depressive Disorder; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Mood Disorders; Risk Factors; Siblings; Taiwan; Young Adult"

"Altered Central Autonomic Network in Baseball Players: A Resting-state fMRI Study",2019,"The physiological adaptive regulation of healthy population with a high fitness level is associated with enhanced cognitive control in brain. This study further investigated the effects of different levels of sporting experience on intrinsic brain networks involved in central autonomic processing using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We explored functional connectivity of four core regions within central autonomic network (CAN), namely posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC), left amygdala (AMYG), and right anterior (aINS) and left posterior insular cortices, in advanced and intermediate baseball players, and compared their strength of connectivity with individuals without baseball-playing experience. Functional connectivity maps across three groups confirmed a close relationship between CAN and large-scale brain networks in sensory, motor and cognitive domains. Crucially, both advanced and intermediate batters demonstrated enhanced connectivity between pMCC and sensorimotor network, between right aINS and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and between left AMYG and right putamen, than controls. These results reflected a stronger interregional coupling in sensorimotor and cognitive control, and in motor skill consolidation. In conclusion, we provided evidence that different levels of sporting experience could reorganize/enhance intrinsic functional connectivity for central autonomic processing. ? 2019, The Author(s).","adult; amygdala; article; baseball; controlled study; dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; executive function; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; insula; male; motor performance; putamen; rest"
"Potential therapeutic effect of curcumin, a natural mTOR inhibitor, in tuberous sclerosis complex",2019,"Background: Curcumin is a polyphenol natural product of the plant Curcuma longa. Recent studies suggest that curcumin inhibit mTOR activity in vitro, which prompts us to investigate curcumin function as a new class of mTOR inhibitor suitable for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) treatment. Purpose: We aim to investigate the efficacy of curcumin in the treatment of TSC related manifestations in animal model. Study Design: Solid lipid curcumin particle (SLCP), a novel curcumin formulation, was used to treat TSC related manifestations in Tsc2 knockout mice. Methods: The novel object recognition test was used to analyze the recognition memory function. The long-term potentiation was studied using electrophysiological analysis. Western blotting was used to assess the protein expression and activation status. Results: Recognition memory deficit began as early as 4 weeks of age in both male and female Tsc2 +/? mice. Oral administration with SLCP activates AMPK activity and inhibits mTOR activity in the brain tissue of Tsc2 +/? mice, and can rescue the electrophysiological abnormality and object recognition memory loss in the mice. Conclusions: Our results suggest that SLCP could be an effective treatment for TSC patients. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH","curcumin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin; solid lipid nanoparticle; curcumin; mTOR protein, mouse; protein kinase inhibitor; target of rapamycin kinase; Tsc2 protein, mouse; tuberin; AMPK signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; brain electrophysiology; brain tissue; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug formulation; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; female; hippocampal slice; knockout mouse; long term potentiation; male; memory; memory disorder; mouse; mTOR signaling; nonhuman; novel object recognition test; priority journal; protein expression; recognition; tuberous sclerosis; Western blotting; wild type mouse; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; brain; disease model; drug effect; genetics; human; metabolism; oral drug administration; pathology; tuberous sclerosis; Administration, Oral; Animals; Brain; Curcumin; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Humans; Long-Term Potentiation; Male; Memory Disorders; Mice, Knockout; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Tuberous Sclerosis; Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein"
"Sexually transmitted infection among adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder: A nationwide longitudinal study",2019,"Background: Evidence has shown a significant association between bipolar disorder and prevalence of risky sexual behaviors. However, the relationship between bipolar disorder and risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) requires further investigation, as do the effects of bipolar disorder medications on STI risk. Methods: In the present study, data from 26,028 adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder (ICD-9-CM code 296 except 296.2x, 296.3x, 296.9x, and 296.82) and 104,112 age- and sex-matched non-bipolar-disorder controls from 2001 to 2009 were selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients who contracted any type of STI-including human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, genital warts, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and trichomoniasis-during the follow-up period (from enrollment to the end of 2011) were identified. Results: Cox regression analysis with full adjustment for demographic data, psychiatric comorbidities, and bipolar disorder medications showed that bipolar disorder was an independent risk factor (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.62-4.66) for contracting an STI. Patients with bipolar disorder and substance and/or alcohol use disorders were at highest risk of STI occurrence. Long-term use of mood stabilizers (HR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.86) and atypical antipsychotics (HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.95) was associated with reduced risk for contracting STIs. Conclusions: Adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder exhibited an increased risk of subsequent STI during the follow-up period compared with those without bipolar disorder. Comorbidity of substance and alcohol use disorders further increased this risk. Long-term use of bipolar disorder medications (mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics) may reduce this risk. ?

"Risk factors and prediction model for persistent breast-cancer-related lymphedema: a 5-year cohort study",2019,"Purpose: Breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) can be a transient or persistent condition. The aims of this study were to (1) identify and weigh the risk factors for persistent lymphedema (PLE) among all patients with BCRL and (2) establish a prediction model for the occurrence of PLE. Methods: A cohort of 342 patients with BCRL with a median follow-up of 5?years after the onset of swelling was analyzed. PLE was defined as a hardening of the subcutaneous tissue, the persistence of the circumferential difference (CD) between arms, or a flare-up of swelling during follow-up. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for PLE, including tumors, treatments, and patient-related factors. The prediction accuracy of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Of the 342 patients with BCRL, 229 (67%) had PLE. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of lymph node metastases (p = 0.012), the maximal CD between arms at the first occurrence of swelling (p < 0.001), and the largest difference during follow-up (p < 0.001) were significant predictors for PLE. The corresponding AUC was 0.908. Although inclusion of body weight gains (p = 0.008) and maximal CD at the latest follow-up (p = 0.002) increased the analytical accuracy (AUC = 0.920), the resulting AUC values (p = 0.113) were not significantly different. Conclusions: BCRL is persistent in two thirds of patients. Patients with more lymph node metastases, weight gain, and larger CD since the onset of swelling and during follow-up have an increased likelihood of developing PLE. ? 2018, The Author(s).","docetaxel; paclitaxel; adult; Article; axillary lymph node; body mass; body weight gain; breast cancer-related lymphedema; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; internal mammary lymph node; longitudinal study; lymph node dissection; lymph node metastasis; lymphedema; major clinical study; male; middle aged; modified radical mastectomy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; persistent lymphedema; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; sentinel lymph node biopsy; simple mastectomy; subcutaneous tissue; supraclavicular lymph node; swelling; wide excision; breast cancer-related lymphedema; breast tumor; complication; lymphedema; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; Adult; Breast Cancer Lymphedema; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Lymph Node Excision; Lymphatic Metastasis; Lymphedema; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Taiwan"
"Role of mental health in the attitude toward same-sex marriage among people in Taiwan: Moderating effects of gender, age, and sexual orientation",2020,"Purpose: The aims of the study were to examine the role of mental health in peoples’ attitude toward same-sex marriage in Taiwan, as well as the moderating effects of gender, age, and sexual orientation on the association between mental health and attitude toward same-sex marriage. Methods: In total, 3235 participants were recruited through a Facebook advertisement. Each participant completed a questionnaire assessing attitude toward same-sex marriage and a 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5). Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between mental health and attitude toward same-sex marriage. Results: Poor mental health was significantly associated with a low level of support for same-sex marriage. Age and sexual orientation moderated the association between mental health state and support for same-sex marriage. A significant association between poor mental health and a low level of support for same-sex marriage was observed only in older participants but not in younger participants. Moreover, a significant association between poor mental health and a low level of support for same-sex marriage was indicated only in heterosexual participants but not in non-heterosexual participants. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that poor mental health was significantly associated with opposition to same-sex marriage. This relationship is more pronounced among older and heterosexual people. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","adult; advertising; article; female; gender; heterosexuality; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; mental health; multiple regression; questionnaire; rating scale; same-sex marriage; Taiwan"
"Increased risk of pelvic fracture after radiotherapy in rectal cancer survivors: A propensity matched study",2019,"To determine whether radiotherapy (RT) can increase pelvic fracture risk in rectal cancer survivors. Rectal cancer patients who underwent curative surgery between 1996 and 2011 in Taiwan were retrospectively studied using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. ICD-9 Codes 808, 805.4-805.7, 806.4-806.7, and 820 (including pelvic, sacrum, lumbar, and femoral neck fracture) were defined as pelvic fracture. Propensity scores for RT, age, and sex were used to perform one-to-one matches between the RT and non-RT group. Risks of pelvic and arm fractures were compared by multivariable Cox regression. Of the 32?689 patients, 7807 (23.9%) received RT, and 1616 suffered from a pelvic fracture (incidence rate: 1.17/100 person-years). The median time to pelvic fracture was 2.47?years. After matching, 6952 patients each in the RT and non-RT groups were analyzed. RT was associated with an increased risk of pelvic fractures in the multivariable Cox model (hazard ratio (HR): 1.246, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.037-1.495, P?=?0.019) but not with arm fractures (HR: 1.013, 95% CI: 0.814-1.259, P?=?0.911). Subgroup analyses revealed that RT was associated with a higher pelvic fracture rate in women (HR: 1.431, 95% CI: 1.117-1.834) but not in men, and the interaction between sex and RT was significant (P?=?0.03). The HR of pelvic fracture increased 2-4?years after RT (HR: 1.707, 95% CI: 1.150-2.534, P?=?0.008). An increased risk of pelvic fracture is noted in rectal cancer survivors, especially women, who receive RT. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Signaling pathway of globo-series glycosphingolipids and β1,3-galactosyltransferase V (β3GalT5) in breast cancer",2019,"The globo-series glycosphingolipids (GSLs) SSEA3, SSEA4, an Globo-H specifically expressed on cancer cells are found to correlat with tumor progression and metastasis, but the functional role of these GSLs and the key enzyme β1,3-galactosyltransferase (β3GalT5) that converts Gb4 to SSEA3 remain largely unclear. Her we show that the expression of β3GalT5 significantly correlates wit tumor progression and poor survival in patients, and the globo series GSLs in breast cancer cells form a complex in membrane lipi raft with caveolin-1 (CAV1) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) whic then interact with AKT and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP) respectively. Knockdown of β3GalT5 disrupts the complex and in duces apoptosis through dissociation of RIP from the complex t interact with the Fas death domain (FADD) and trigger the Fas dependent pathway. This finding provides a link between SSEA3 SSEA4/Globo-H and the FAK/CAV1/AKT/RIP complex in tumor pro gression and apoptosis and suggests a direction for the treatment o breast cancer, as demonstrated by the combined use of antibodie against Globo-H and SSEA4. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"Two separate functions of NME3 critical for cell survival underlie a neurodegenerative disorder",2019,"We report a patient who presented with congenital hypotonia, hypoventilation, and cerebellar histopathological alterations. Exome analysis revealed a homozygous mutation in the initiation codon of the NME3 gene, which encodes an NDP kinase. The initiation-codon mutation leads to deficiency in NME3 protein expression. NME3 is a mitochondrial outer-membrane protein capable of interacting with MFN1/2, and its depletion causes dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics. Consistently, the patient’s fibroblasts were characterized by a slow rate of mitochondrial dynamics, which was reversed by expression of wild-type or catalytic-dead NME3. Moreover, glucose starvation caused mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death in the patient’s cells. The expression of wild-type and catalytic-dead but not oligomerization-attenuated NME3 restored mitochondrial elongation. However, only wild-type NME3 sustained ATP production and viability. Thus, the separate functions of NME3 in mitochondrial fusion and NDP kinase cooperate in metabolic adaptation for cell survival in response to glucose starvation. Given the critical role of mitochondrial dynamics and energy requirements in neuronal development, the homozygous mutation in NME3 is linked to a fatal mitochondrial neurodegenerative disorder. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"Tissue doppler imaging predicts outcomes in hemodialysis patients with preserved left ventricular function",2019,"Background: Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition to arteriosclerosis (arterial stiffness) and atherosclerosis, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and LV systolic dysfunction are the major cardiac determinants of cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. Although LV diastolic dysfunction is common in patients with ESRD, its prognostic value is yet to be established. Methods: A total of 103 ESRD patients (52 females, 51 males, age 51 ± 14 years) receiving regular hemodialysis and with preserved LV systolic function were prospectively enrolled in the current study. A comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation was performed at baseline. LV diastolic function was assessed using Doppler mitral inflow velocity and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the mitral annulus velocity. Predictors for hospitalization and all-cause mortality were identified via Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results: There were 20 deaths and 46 hospitalizations during a follow-up period of 67.9 ± 20.2 months. After adjusting for age, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and carotid intima media thickness, Cox analysis demonstrated that ratio of early ventricular filling velocity (E) to early diastolic tissue velocity mitral annulus (E’) (E/E’) was a significant predictor for hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] 1.235 and 95% CI 1.115-1.368 per-1SD). E’ also independently predicted mortality (HR 0.682, 95% CI 0.472-0.985). The TDI parameters significantly correlated with the LV mass index and PWV. Conclusion: The findings of the current study suggest that diastolic function, as indexed by TDI, is an independent predictor of hospitalization and mortality in ESRD patients receiving regular hemodialysis and with preserved LV systolic function. The TDI parameters may reflect the impairment of arterial function and LV pressure overload.

"Trends of mortality in diabetic patients in Taiwan: A nationwide survey in 2005–2014",2019,"Background/Purpose: Diabetes mellitus has become a major cause of death worldwide. Many technologies have become available for managing diabetes and its complications. This study investigated the mortality trends in people with diabetes in Taiwan between 2005 and 2014. Methods: We used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, which is linked to the National Death Registry. Patients with at least three outpatient visits in 1 year or at least one hospital admission with the diagnosis of diabetes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] 250.x) were defined as diabetic patients. The main causes of death were classified using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM. Results: In 2005–2014, the number of diabetic patients increased from 1.3 to 2.2 million in Taiwan, and all-cause mortality in the patients decreased continuously across sexes and age groups (all, 3.45%–3.00%; women, 3.07%–2.70%; men, 3.82%–3.28%, all p < 0.001 for trends). The diabetic patients exhibited a shorter life expectancy than the entire population. The differences decreased from 2005 to 2014 (p < 0.001) and were greater when diabetes was diagnosed early in life. In 2014, the estimated loss of life was 2.6 and 3.2 years in the women and men, respectively, when diabetes was diagnosed at 40 years of age. The top five causes of death in diabetic patients were malignancy, diabetes, heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and pneumonia. Conclusion: The mortality and estimated loss of life of diabetic patients decreased significantly from 2005 to 2014, reflecting advancements in diabetes care in Taiwan. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cause of death; cerebrovascular disease; data base; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; disease registry; female; groups by age and sex; heart disease; hospital admission; human; ICD-10-CM; ICD-9-CM; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; mortality rate; national health insurance; outpatient care; pneumonia; Taiwan; trend study"
"Ectopic papilla of Vater in duodenum bulb: A hospital-based study",2019,"The major papilla of Vater can be ectopically present in the stomach, pyloric canal, duodenal bulb, and third or fourth portion of the duodenum. In this study, we determined the clinical significance of ectopic papilla of Vater by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP).A retrospective study was conducted by reviewing the medical records of 6133 patients receiving ERCP from 1988 to 2011. The diagnosis was confirmed if both the common bile duct (CBD) and the main pancreatic duct (PD) drained into the same opening, either by ERCP or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.Eight patients with major papilla of Vater in the duodenal bulb were identified among 6133 patients receiving ERCP from 1988 to 2011, with an incidence rate of 0.13%. The mean age was 67 years and patients were predominantly male. Duodenal bulb deformity was noted in all patients and three of them had shallow gastric and/or duodenal ulcers. Hook-shaped CBD configuration was seen only in half of our cases. Three patients with CBD stones were treated successfully after endoscopic sphincterotomy or papillary balloon dilation.Ectopic orifice of papilla is a rare finding of ERCP. Opacification of both the CBD and main PD from the same opening is an essential criterion for diagnosing an ectopic papilla of Vater in the duodenal bulb.","abnormalities; aged; ampulla of Vater; common bile duct disease; diagnostic imaging; duodenum; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic sphincterotomy; female; gallstone; human; incidence; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; male; middle aged; pancreas; procedures; retrospective study; Taiwan; Aged; Ampulla of Vater; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde; Cholangiopancreatography, Magnetic Resonance; Common Bile Duct Diseases; Duodenum; Female; Gallstones; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreas; Retrospective Studies; Sphincterotomy, Endoscopic; Taiwan"
"Intestinal iNKT cells migrate to liver and contribute to hepatocyte apoptosis during alcoholic liver disease",2019,"We investigated the migration of intestinal immune cells to the liver and their contribution to alcoholic liver disease. In mice fed ethanol, we found that an increased number of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which respond to the antigen presented by CD1d, migrated from mesenteric lymph nodes to the liver. iNKT cells react to lipid antigens, so we studied their activities in mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of Pparg (Pparg??IEC) as a model for altering intestinal lipidomic profiles. Levels of CD1d increased in intestines of ethanolfed Pparg?IEC mice, and in cell-tracking experiments, more iNKT cells migrated to the liver, compared with mice without disruption of Pparg. Livers of Pparg?IEC mice had increased markers of apoptosis and liver injury after ethanol feeding. iNKT cells isolated from livers of ethanol-fed Pparg?IEC mice induced apoptosis of cultured hepatocytes. An inhibitor of iNKT cells reduced ethanol-induced liver injury in Pparg?IEC mice. Duodenal tissues from patients with alcohol-use disorder have been found to have increased levels of CD1d compared with tissues from patients without alcohol overuse. Ethanol use, therefore, activates iNKT cells in the intestine to migrate to liver, where they—along with the resident hepatic iNKT cells— contribute to hepatocyte death and injury. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY In this article, we studied migration of intestinal immune cells into the liver in response to ethanol-induced liver disease. We found that chronic ethanol feeding induces expression of CD1d by enterocytes, which activate invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in mesenteric lymph nodes; activation is further increased with loss of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene and altered lipid profiles. The activated iNKT cells migrate into the liver, where they promote hepatocyte apoptosis. Patients with alcohol use disorder have increased expression of CD1d in the small intestine. Strategies to block these processes might be developed to treat alcoholic liver disease. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","albumin; alcohol; beta actin; CD1d antigen; CXCL1 chemokine; cytochrome P450 2E1; Fas ligand; immunoglobulin G3; lipid; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase C; retinoic acid receptor gamma; T lymphocyte receptor beta chain; tazarotene; alcohol liver disease; alcoholism; animal experiment; apoptosis; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; duodenum tissue; flow cytometry; immunohistochemistry; intestine; intestine cell; intestine epithelium cell; lipid metabolism; liver; liver cell; liver injury; male; mesentery lymph node; mouse; natural killer cell; nested polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; receptor down regulation; TUNEL assay"
"Trigeminal nerve atrophy predicts pain recurrence after gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery for classical trigeminal neuralgia",2019,"BACKGROUND Trigeminal nerve atrophy and neurovascular compression (NVC) are frequently observed in classical trigeminal neuralgia (CTN). OBJECTIVE To determine whether nerve characteristics contribute to Gamma Knife (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) surgery (GKS) outcomes in unilateral CTN without previous surgery. METHODS From 2006 to 2012, 67 patients with unilateral CTN without previous surgery received GKS with a maximal dose of 90 Gy delivered to the trigeminal nerve juxta brainstem. Two evaluators, blinded to the side of pain, analyzed the magnetic resonance images before GKS to obtain the parameters, including nerve cross-sectional area (CSA), vessel type of NVC, and site of NVC along the nerve. Correlations of the parameters with pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute [BNI] grades I-IIIb) and recurrence (BNI grades VI-V) were made by using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS The median CSA of the symptomatic nerves was significantly smaller than that of the asymptomatic nerves (4.95 vs 5.9 mm 2, P <.001). After adjustment for age and sex, larger nerve CSA was associated with lower initial pain relief (hazard ratio 0.81, P =.03) and lower pain recurrence after initial response (hazard ratio 0.58, P =.02). Patients with nerve atrophy (CSA of ? 4.4 mm 2 after receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) had a lower 5-yr probability of maintaining pain relief after initial response than those without nerve atrophy (65% vs 86%, P =.04). CONCLUSION Trigeminal nerve atrophy may predict pain recurrence in patients with initial post-GKS relief of CTN. Arterial and proximal NVC are not predictive of GKS outcomes. Future studies are required to determine optimal treatments for long-term pain relief in patients with CTN and trigeminal nerve atrophy. ?

"Determination of Pyruvate Metabolic Fates Modulates Head and Neck Tumorigenesis",2019,"Even with increasing evidence for roles of glycolytic enzymes in controlling cancerous characteristics, the best target of candidate metabolic enzymes for lessening malignancy remains under debate. Pyruvate is a main glycolytic metabolite that could be mainly converted into either lactate by Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA)or acetyl-CoA by Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 component α subunit (PDHA1)catalytic complex. In tumor cells, accumulating lactate is produced whereas the conversion of pyruvate into mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is less active compared with their normal counterparts. This reciprocal molecular association makes pyruvate metabolism a potential choice of anti-cancer target. Cellular and molecular changes were herein assayed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)cells in response to LDHA and PDHA1 loss in vitro, in vivo and in clinic. By using various human cancer databases and clinical samples, LDHA and PDHA1 levels exhibit reversed prognostic roles. In vitro analysis demonstrated that decreased cell growth and motility accompanied by an increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents was found in cells with LDHA loss whereas PDHA1-silencing exhibited opposite phenotypes. At the molecular level, it was found that oncogenic Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt)and Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)singling pathways contribute to pyruvate metabolism mediated HNSCC cell growth. Furthermore, LDHA/PDHA1 changes in HNSCC cells resulted in a broad metabolic reprogramming while intracellular molecules including polyunsaturated fatty acids and nitrogen metabolism related metabolites underlie the malignant changes. Collectively, our findings reveal the significance of pyruvate metabolic fates in modulating HNSCC tumorigenesis and highlight the impact of metabolic plasticity in HNSCC cells. ? 2019 The Authors","lactate dehydrogenase; lactate dehydrogenase A; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein kinase B; pyruvate dehydrogenase; pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component alpha; pyruvic acid; unclassified drug; lactate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; LDHA protein, human; pyruvate dehydrogenase; pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit; pyruvic acid; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer prognosis; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell motility; controlled study; gene silencing; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; MAPK signaling; metabolism; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; priority journal; protein depletion; protein expression; animal; cell proliferation; genetics; glycolysis; metabolism; mitochondrion; pathology; tumor cell line; xenograft; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Glycolysis; Heterografts; Humans; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lactic Acid; Mice; Mitochondria; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide); Pyruvic Acid; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck"
"Delayed effect of bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation in patients with treatment-resistant depression: A pilot study",2019,"Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, which has yielded promising results in treating major depressive disorder. However, its effect on treatment-resistant depression remains to be determined. Meanwhile, as an emerging treatment option, patients' acceptability of tDCS is worthy of attention. Methods: This pilot study enrolled 18 patients (women = 13) with treatment-resistant unipolar (n = 13) or bipolar (n = 5) depression. Twelve sessions of tDCS were administered with anode over F3 and cathode over F4. Each session delivered a current of 2 mA for 30 min per ten working days, and at the 4th and 6th week. Severity of depression was determined by Montgomery-?sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); cognitive performance was assessed by a computerized battery. Results: Scores of MADRS at baseline (29.6, SD = 9.7) decreased significantly to 22.9 (11.7) (p = 0.03) at 6 weeks and 21.5 (10.3) (p = 0.01) at 8 weeks. Six (33.3%) participants were therapeutically responsive to tDCS. MADRS scores of responders were significantly lower than those of non-responders at the 6th and 8th week. Regarding change of cognitive performance, improved accuracy of paired association (p = 0.017) and social cognition (p = 0.047) was observed at the 8th week. Overall, tDCS was perceived as safe and tolerable. For the majority of patients, it is preferred than pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Conclusions: TDCS can be a desirable option for treatment-resistant depression, however, its efficacy may be delayed; identifying predictors of therapeutic response may achieve a more targeted application. Larger controlled studies with optimized montages and sufficient periods of observation are warranted.

"Impact of prior pulmonary tuberculosis in treatment outcomes of HCAP and CAP patients in intensive care units",2019,"Background/purpose: It is controversial whether healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) belongs to a unique clinical entity or it shares common characteristics with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The impact of prior pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in clinical presentation and treatment outcome of ICU-admitted CAP and HCAP patients also remains unknown. Methods: We report a nationwide, multi-center, retrospective study. ICU-admitted CAP and HCAP patients from six medical centers in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. Patients were defined as either CAP or HCAP cases, and with and without prior PTB, according to the database of Taiwan CDC. The disease severity, microbiologic characteristics, and treatment outcomes between CAP and HCAP patients with or without prior PTB were compared and analyzed. Results: A total of 414 ICU-admitted patients, including 176 CAP cases and 238 HCAP cases were included for analysis during the study period. In both CAP and HCAP subgroups, the pneumonia severities, proportions of organ dysfunction, and microbiologic characteristics were similar between patients with and without prior PTB. In survival analysis, patients with prior PTB had higher 30-day mortality than those without prior PTB (38.9% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.021) in the CAP population. Multivariate analysis revealed that a history of prior PTB was an independent clinical factor associated with higher 30-day mortality rate in CAP patients (HR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.81–10.98, P = 0.001). Conclusion: History of prior PTB is an independent clinical factor for increased 30-day mortality rate in ICU-admitted CAP patients, but not in ICU-admitted HCAP patients. ? 2018","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter baumannii; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic lung disease; clinical evaluation; community acquired pneumonia; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; Enterobacter; Enterococcus faecium; female; health care associated pneumonia; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; intensive care unit; Klebsiella pneumoniae; length of stay; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mortality rate; multicenter study; nonhuman; pathogen load; Pneumonia Severity Index; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; respiratory failure; retrospective study; septic shock; smoking habit; Staphylococcus aureus; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; adult; clinical trial; community acquired infection; comorbidity; demography; epidemiology; hospital; hospitalization; lung tuberculosis; microbiology; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; pneumonia; regression analysis; risk factor; severity of illness index; statistical model; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Community-Acquired Infections; Comorbidity; Demography; Female; Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Multivariate Analysis; Pneumonia; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Young Adult"
"Glycemia lowering effect of an aqueous extract of hedychium coronarium leaves in diabetic rodent models",2019,"Hedychium coronarium has a long history of use worldwide as a food and in folk medicine. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of an aqueous extract of H. coronarium leaves (HC) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Two types of animal models were used in this study: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2DM (Wistar rats; N = 8) and C57BKSdb/db mice (N = 5). After treatment with HC for 28 days, glucose tolerance improved in both of the diabetic animal models. As significant effects were shown after 14 days of treatment in the STZ-induced T2DM model, we carried out the experiments with it. After 28 days of treatment with HC, the levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein were significantly improved in the STZ-induced T2DM model. The lesions degree of islet β-cells was decreased after the HC treatment. Although the insulin level increased moderately, the aldosterone level was significantly decreased in the HC-treated groups, suggesting that aldosterone might play an important role in this effect. In summary, HC is a natural product and it is worth exploring its effect on T2DM. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Cardiopulmonary bypass not induces dysrhythmia in elderly coronary artery bypass grafting patients",2019,"BACKGROUND Dysrhythmia is a serious complication associated with on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) and can yield poor prognoses after CABG surgery. In addition, affected patients may be at an increased risk of morbidity or mortality. This study evaluated on-pump CABG arrhythmogenic factors among patients who had undergone this type of surgery. METHODS This retrospective study recruited 47 patients admitted to Mackay Memorial Hospital from January to December 2015. We initially divided the patients into two groups based on age: Group I (elderly people aged ? 65 years old) and Group II (adults aged ? 64 years old). Second, we formed a relative dysrhythmia group for further analysis, which was divided into two subgroups: Group A (patients with dysrhythmia) and Group B (patients without dysrhythmia). The risks were further analzyed. RESULTS The mean age of the patients in Group I (73.25±7.17 years) was considerably higher than in Group II. The overall incidence of dysrhythmia was 33.3% in elderly patients who had undergone on-pump CABG. This study found that surgery length (213.88±59.74 min) was significantly associated with dysrhythmia. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a sensitivity cutoff point is obtained when the surgery period is longer than 170 min. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we demonstrated that elderly patients are a high-risk group for dysrhythmia and CPB is not related to dysrhythmia. Moreover, we demonstrated that the risk of dysrhythmia in elderly people increases when the surgery period is longer than 170 min. ? 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.","adult; age; aged; Article; calcium blood level; cardiopulmonary bypass; clinical article; congestive heart failure; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; female; heart arrhythmia; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; high risk population; human; hyperlipidemia; incidence; intensive care unit; length of stay; male; operation duration; perioperative period; postoperative period; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity"
"Clinical features of acute human immunodeficiency virus infection in Taiwan: A multicenter study",2019,"Background/purpose: Acute HIV infection is characterized by a high concentration of HIV RNA in the plasma and rapid depletion of the CD4 cell count. This multicenter, retrospective observational study aimed to characterize the manifestations of acuteHIV infection in Taiwan. Methods: Between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016, all patients aged 20 years or greater who presented with acute HIV infection were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at diagnosis were collected. Baseline laboratory assessment included hemogram, CD4 count, plasma HIV RNA load (PVL), serologic markers of syphilis and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, and serum biochemistry. Results: The proportion of acute HIV infection was 6.9% among the patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection during the study period. The most common presenting symptoms of acute HIV infection were fever, fatigue, and myalgia. The median PVL at diagnosis was 5.9 log10 copies/ml, and median CD4 count was 307 cells/mm3. A total of 68 patients (27%) had baseline CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3. Multiple logistic regression analysis, showed that the baseline CD4 count (OR, 4.02; p = 0.013) and aspartate aminotransaminase levels (OR, 3.49; p = 0.002) were associated with high PVL (&gt;5 log10 copies/ml); and high baseline PVL (OR, 2.64; p = 0.002) was associated with symptomatic acute HIV infection. Conclusions: Manifestations of acute HIV infection are nonspecific and of wide spectrum ranging from fever to severe illness. A higher proportion of patients with initial CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm3 or less during acute HIV infection warrants early, timely diagnosis and treatment to prevent rapid disease progression. ? 2018","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; creatinine; hemoglobin; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase inhibitor; integrase inhibitor; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; virus RNA; acute HIV infection; adult; antiretroviral therapy; arthralgia; Article; aseptic meningitis; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; blood biochemistry; body weight loss; candidiasis; CD4 lymphocyte count; chlamydiasis; clinical feature; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; condyloma; coughing; cryptococcosis; demography; diarrhea; disease association; fatigue; female; fever; genital ulcer; gonorrhea; headache; Hepatitis A virus; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; laboratory test; leukocyte count; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; mouth ulcer; myalgia; nausea; night sweat; observational study; pharyngitis; plasma; platelet count; pneumocystosis; rash; retrospective study; salmonellosis; syphilis; syphilis serology; Taiwan; urea nitrogen blood level; virus load; vomiting"
"Fibronectin promotes nasopharyngeal cancer cell motility and proliferation",2019,"Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated carcinoma. Fibronectin is regarded as a prognosticator in NPC and its involvement in cell motility has been reported in EBV infection and viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) overexpression NPC cell lines. However, its malignant potential in NPC cell lines without harbouring the EBV genome has not been investigated. We investigatd and compared among four NPC cell lines, and the results revealed a positive association between fibronectin levels and NPC cell motility as well as proliferation. Studies of antibody neutralization, exogenous addition, overexpression, and RNA interference confirmed a migration role of fibronectin in NPC cells involving integrin α5, Src, Rac1, and Cdc42, implying a mesenchymal-like cell movement. Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were identified as alternative activators of fibronectin expression and NPC cell migration. Besides cell migration, studies of RNA interference also showed a stimulatory effect of fibronectin in NPC cell proliferation. Mechanistic studies further revealed a subsequent reduction of HIF-1α, TGF-β1, cyclin D1, β-catenin, vimentin, and Slug together with decreased Src and Akt phosphorylation after fibronectin knockdown. Parallel studies in a xenograft tumor mice model further showed that tumor growth correlated well with elevation of circulating fibronectin and activation of the identified intracellular signaling molecules. The results of our study highlight a role of fibronectin in NPC cell motility and proliferation in concerted action with HIF-1α and TGF-β1 possibly through linking molecules Src and Akt. Fibronectin overexpression and autoantibody are known to have potential prognostic value in patients with NPC. Our findings shed light on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenic role of fibronectin in this disease. ? 2018","alpha5 integrin; beta catenin; cyclin D1; fibronectin; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; protein Cdc42; protein kinase B; protein tyrosine kinase; Rac1 protein; transcription factor Slug; transforming growth factor beta1; vimentin; fibronectin; small interfering RNA; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer cell; cell migration; cell motility; cell motion; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme phosphorylation; female; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; mesenchyme cell; mouse; nasopharynx cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; RNA interference; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell proliferation; drug screening; human; metabolism; nasopharynx tumor; nude mouse; pathology; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Female; Fibronectins; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; RNA, Small Interfering; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Influence of aging and visual feedback on the stability of hand grip control in elderly adults",2019,"Aging causes a gradual decrease in maximal grip strength and leads many elderly people to have to rely on visual feedback to compensate for poorer muscle strength in performing daily activities and preventing accidents. Previous studies have investigated age and visual feedback-related changes in grip strength. However, little is known about methods of determining the quality and stability of hand grip strength control in the elderly, which is important for understanding their ability to generate grip force when handling objects with and without visual feedback in daily living. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of aging and visual feedback on the stability of hand grip control in both hands in elderly adults. Forty-four healthy elderly persons (age 80.5 ± 4.53 years) and 36 young adults (age 32.69 ± 16.48 years) were recruited to execute grip force stability tasks using both hands at a 2 kg target force level. To perform the grip force stability task, the participants were asked to hold the dynamometer tightly in an attempt to achieve the target force level under visual and non-visual feedback conditions. Strength performances (grip force and coefficient of variation values) and stability of strength control (deviation error, variation error and force stability index values) for hand grip force stability tasks were calculated and analyzed. Compared with the visual feedback condition, the stability of grip force control in the hands of the young and elderly groups were significantly reduced in the non-visual feedback condition by 23.5%–57.1% (p <.05). The elderly group also showed significantly worse hand grip strength performances and stability of hand strength control than the young adult group (p <.05). Aging and non-visual feedback reduced the hand grip force output and stability of grip strength control of the hands.

Few studies exist concerning how this is represented in the news. This study investigated the prevalence, characteristics, and causes of WPV from major news portals and medical websites in China, to provide a direction on the prevention and control of this issue. Quantitative content analysis was used to examine Chinese news portals and medical websites from 2013 to 2017. 235 valid reported cases were found. The number of incidents peaked in 2015, during the summer. Most cases occurred in the mid-eastern region of mainland China, in tertiary hospitals, and in the emergency department. The perpetrators were mainly individual males from the young adult or middle-aged groups. The major cause of medical WPV was dissatisfaction with treatment and referral. In conclusion, the development of prevention and control strategies is crucial and should be in accordance with the evidence from the research conducted.","adult; article; China; content analysis; control strategy; emergency ward; human; male; middle aged; offender; prevalence; quantitative analysis; summer; tertiary care center; workplace violence; young adult"
"IRF6 and TAK1 coordinately promote the activation of HIPK2 to stimulate apoptosis during palate fusion",2019,"Cleft palate is a common craniofacial defect caused by a failure in palate fusion. The palatal shelves migrate toward one another and meet at the embryonic midline, creating a seam. Transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3)- induced apoptosis of the medial edge epithelium (MEE), the cells located along the seam, is required for completion of palate fusion. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) promotes TGF-β3-induced MEE cell apoptosis by stimulating the degradation of the transcription factor ΔNp63 and promoting the expression of the gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Because homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) functions downstream of IRF6 in human cancer cells and is required for ΔNp63 protein degradation in keratinocytes, we investigated whether HIPK2 played a role in IRF6-induced ΔNp63 degradation in palate fusion. HIPK2 was present in the MEE cells of mouse palatal shelves during seam formation in vivo, and ectopic expression of IRF6 in palatal shelves cultured ex vivo stimulated the expression of Hipk2 and the accumulation of phosphorylated HIPK2. Knockdown and ectopic expression experiments in organ culture demonstrated that p21 was required for HIPK2- and IRF6-dependent activation of caspase 3, MEE apoptosis, and palate fusion. Contact between palatal shelves enhanced the phosphorylation of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which promoted the phosphorylation of HIPK2 and palate fusion. Our findings demonstrate that HIPK2 promotes seam cell apoptosis and palate fusion downstream of IRF6 and that IRF6 and TAK1 appear to coordinately enhance the abundance and activation of HIPK2 during palate fusion. ? 2019 The Authors.","caspase 3; homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2; interferon regulatory factor 6; protein p21; transcription factor; transcription factor DNp63; transforming growth factor beta activated kinase 1; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; ectopic expression; embryo; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; epithelium cell; ex vivo study; gene silencing; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; organ culture; organogenesis; palate; palate fusion; priority journal; protein degradation"
"Evaluating BRCA mutation risk predictive models in a Chinese cohort in Taiwan",2019,"Accurate estimation of carrier probabilities of cancer susceptibility gene mutations is an important part of pre-test genetic counselling. Many predictive models are available but their applicability in the Asian population is uncertain. We evaluated the performance of five BRCA mutation risk predictive models in a Chinese cohort of 647 women, who underwent germline DNA sequencing of a cancer susceptibility gene panel. Using areas under the curve (AUCs) on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves as performance measures, the models did comparably well as in western cohorts (BOADICEA 0.75, BRCAPRO 0.73, Penn II 0.69, Myriad 0.68). For unaffected women with family history of breast or ovarian cancer (n = 144), BOADICEA, BRCAPRO, and Tyrer-Cuzick models had excellent performance (AUC 0.93, 0.92, and 0.92, respectively). For women with both personal and family history of breast or ovarian cancer (n = 241), all models performed fairly well (BOADICEA 0.79, BRCAPRO 0.79, Penn II 0.75, Myriad 0.70). For women with personal history of breast or ovarian cancer but no family history (n = 262), most models did poorly. Between the two well-performed models, BOADICEA underestimated mutation risks while BRCAPRO overestimated mutation risks (expected/observed ratio 0.67 and 2.34, respectively). Among 424 women with personal history of breast cancer and available tumor ER/PR/HER2 data, the predictive models performed better for women with triple negative breast cancer (AUC 0.74 to 0.80) than for women with luminal or HER2 overexpressed breast cancer (AUC 0.63 to 0.69). However, incorporating ER/PR/HER2 status into the BOADICEA model calculation did not improve its predictive accuracy. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Compare fuhrman nuclear and chromophobe tumor grade on chromophobe RCC",2019,"Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) has a favorable prognosis. Due to irregular nuclei and nuclear pleomorphism, chRCC has a high Fuhrman nuclear grade (FNG). The chromophobe tumor grade (CTG) is a novel three-Tier grading system that has been reported to be a better prognosticator than the traditional FNG. We compared the two nuclear grading systems in terms of patients' clinical outcomes. We performed this retrospective chart review of all patients with chRCC from 2000 to 2017. All pathologic features and CTG and FNG results were re-evaluated. Eighteen patients' records were reviewed with a mean follow-up of 70.6 months. The nuclear grading distribution was as follows: FNG 2, 56%; FNG 3, 39%; FNG 4, 5%; CTG 1, 78%; CTG 2, 17%; and CTG 3, 6%. Only one patient died. This patient had adrenal invasion, lung metastasis, sarcomatoid change and tumor necrosis, and the tumor was graded as FNG 4 and CTG 3. Overall survival was associated with both FNG and CTG. Chromophobe RCC was associated with a low rate of cancer-specific death and sarcomatoid differentiation. Both FNG and CTG were associated with overall survival. ? 2019 2019 Tsu-Feng Lin et al. published by De Gruyter.","adrenal metastasis; adult; aged; Article; cancer grading; cancer mortality; cancer survival; chromophobe tumor grade; clinical article; clinical outcome; female; follow up; fuhrman nuclear grade; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; lung metastasis; male; medical record review; overall survival; partial nephrectomy; priority journal; radical nephrectomy; renal cell carcinoma; retrospective study; sarcomatoid carcinoma; tumor invasion; tumor necrosis; tumor volume"
"Immunopathogenic mechanisms and novel immune-modulated therapies in rheumatoid arthritis",2019,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated peptide antibodies. The orchestra of the inflammatory process among various immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and reactive oxidative stress play critical immunopathologic roles in the inflammatory cascade of the joint environment, leading to clinical impairment and RA. With the growing understanding of the immunopathogenic mechanisms, increasingly novel marked and potential biologic agents have merged for the treatment of RA in recent years. In this review, we focus on the current understanding of pathogenic mechanisms, highlight novel biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMRADs), targeted synthetic DMRADs, and immune-modulating agents, and identify the applicable immune-mediated therapeutic strategies of the near future. In conclusion, new therapeutic approaches are emerging through a better understanding of the immunopathophysiology of RA, which is improving disease outcomes better than ever. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Effects of boschnaloside from Boschniakia rossica on dysglycemia and islet dysfunction in severely diabetic mice through modulating the action of glucagon-like peptide-1",2019,"Background: Boschniakia rossica is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine for tonifying kidney and improving impotence. Boschnaloside is the major iridoid glycoside in this herb but therapeutic benefits for diabetes remained to be evaluated. Hypothesis/Purpose: The current investigation aims to study the antidiabetic effect and the underlying pharmacological mechanisms. Study design and methods: Receptor binding, cAMP production, Ins secretion, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity assays were performed. Therapeutic benefits of orally administrated boschnaloside (150 and 300 mg/kg/day) were evaluated using severely 12-week old female diabetic db/db mice (Hemoglobin A1c &gt;10%). Results: Oral treatment of boschnaloside for 4 weeks improved diabetic symptoms including fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c, glucose intolerance, and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Ins Resistance, accompanied by circulating GLP-1active and adiponectin levels. In addition, bochnaloside treatment improved islet/β cell function associated with an alteration of the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 level. It was shown that boschnaloside interacted with the extracellular domain of GLP-1 receptor and enhanced glucose stimulated Ins secretion. Boschnaloside also augmented the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1. Finally, the presence of boschnaloside caused a reduction of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity while enhanced GLP-1 secretion from STC-1 cells. Conclusion: It appears that bochnaloside at oral dosage greater than 150 mg/kg/day exerts antidiabetic effects in vivo through modulating the action of GLP-1. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH","adiponectin; alanine aminotransferase; antidiabetic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; boschnaloside; cyclic AMP; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; ghrelin; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; iridoid; leptin; metformin; nitrogen; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; transcription factor PDX 1; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; Article; Boschniakia rossica; Chinese medicine; clinical evaluation; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease severity; drug effect; drug mechanism; dysglycemia; fasting; female; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; homeostasis model assessment; insulin like activity; mouse; nonhuman; Orobanchaceae; pancreas islet cell function; pancreas islet disease; priority journal; protein secretion; receptor binding; treatment duration"
"Risk-stratified management strategies for HBV reactivation in RA patients receiving biological and targeted therapy: A narrative review",2019,"It is estimated that more than two billion people around the world have been infected by Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Reactivation of HBV (rHBV) is a potentially fatal complication after biological therapy. With the increasing use of biologics and targeted therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who are refractory to conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, rHBV in those with past infection has become increasingly problematic, especially in HBV-endemic regions. Among those receiving biological therapy, the risk of rHBV varies according to the status of HBV infection and the degree of biologic-related immunosuppression. As rHBV is largely preventable, it is imperative that the risk status of rHBV in RA patients receiving biological and targeted therapy be stratified. Therefore, the aim of this review was to summarize the reported data on rHBV, and propose management strategies for RA patients with different risks of rHBV based on evidence presented in the current literature. ? 2017","abatacept; rituximab; tocilizumab; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; antirheumatic agent; antivirus agent; hepatitis B antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; disease course; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; immunosuppressive treatment; infection prevention; infection risk; molecularly targeted therapy; pathophysiology; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; risk assessment; virus reactivation; blood; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; immunology; molecularly targeted therapy; rheumatoid arthritis; virus activation; Antirheumatic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Antibodies; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Virus Activation"
"The relationship of seasonality and the increase in urinary tract infections among hospitalized patients with spinal cord injury",2019,"Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequent complication in patients who have spinal cord injury (SCI). The occurrence rate of UTI in this type of hospitalized patients was correlated to seasonality, age, and gender. Methods: Patients hospitalized during the 4-year study period with underlying SCI were identified from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with a discharge diagnosis of UTI were identified as those with SCI and UTI; they were divided into the following four age groups: <18 years, 18 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, and ?65 years. The gender, monthly number of cases, major complication rate, seasonal differences, and odds ratios (ORs) of associated factors were analyzed. Results: Data of 30 149 hospitalized patients diagnosed with SCI were retrieved. SCI and UTI were diagnosed in 3405 (11.3%) patients, of them 2296 were males (67.4%) and 1109 were females (32.6%). The UTI occurrence rate in hospitalized SCI patients was higher in males (11.8%) than in females (10.4%) (OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.15-1.34); it was highest in the ?65-year-old age group (12.8%) and lowest in the <18-year-old age group (5.8%) (OR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.83-3.44). The UTI occurrence rate varied from 7% to 18%, and it was highest in the summer (13.0% ± 2.6%) and lowest in the winter (10.2% ± 1.9%) (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.15-1.40). Acute pyelonephritis was the most common complication in SCI and UTI cases. Conclusion: The mean occurrence rate of UTI in hospitalized SCI patients was 11.3%; it was higher in males, in patients aged ?65 years, and in the summer. Therefore, physicians should pay attention to the occurrence of UTI in aged male patients with SCI, especially in the summer.

"Diversity of nasal microbiota and its interaction with surface microbiota among residents in healthcare institutes",2019,"Nasal microbial communities may have crucial implications for human health, including for residents of healthcare institutes (HCIs). Factors that determine the diversity of nasal microbiota in HCIs remain unclear. Herein, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to investigate the relationship between nasal and surface microbiota in three HCIs. Participants were classified into a hospitalised or nonhospitalised group based on their most recent date of hospitalisation. A total of 88 nasal samples and 83 surface samples were analysed. Dysgonomonas and Corynebacterium were the most abundant taxa in the surface and nasal samples, respectively. Significant differences were discovered in microbiota diversity among HCIs when comparing the surface and nasal samples. Fifteen taxa were identified as present in all the surface and nasal samples. SourceTracker analysis revealed that the ventilation conditions of environment might be associated with the proportion of shared microbial communities between nasal and surface. Additionally, as compared with the nonhospitalised group, the hospitalised group had a higher proportion of surface microbiota in their nasal samples, which might lead to a higher risk of human-related microorganisms or pathogens colonising the nasal cavity. The data suggest that nasal bacterial diversity could be influenced by both health status and living environment. Our results therefore highlight the importance of the indoor environment for HCI residents. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

"Therapeutic effects of acupuncture plus fire needle versus acupuncture alone in lateral epicondylitis: A randomized case-control pilot study",2019,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the short-term and intermediate-term efficacy of acupuncture plus fire needle therapy with that of acupuncture alone in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis (LE). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with LE who had persisted for at least 2 months were enrolled in this prospective, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled pilot trial. Twenty-one patients were randomized to the acupuncture plus fire needle group and 17 to the acupuncture-only group. The primary outcome was the visual analog scale pain score for the previous 24?hours and the secondary outcomes were the maximum grip strength, Patient-rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire score, and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-form Health Survey score. The values at baseline (pretreatment), at the end of treatment, and at 3 months after treatment were used to assess the short-term and intermediate-term effects of treatment. The data were analyzed using the Chi-square test and t test. RESULTS: Within-group analyses showed better results for acupuncture plus fire needle therapy in the short term and intermediate term. Differences in the severity of pain and secondary outcomes were significant in the intermediate term in the acupuncture group. At the end of treatment, none of the differences in outcome scores were significant, except for maximum grip strength in the affected hand in the acupuncture group. No significant between-group differences in short-term or intermediate-term outcomes were observed. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture plus fire needle therapy was effective in the short term in patients seeking improvement of LE. Twelve treatments were effective for relieving pain and improving disability in the intermediate term in patients with chronic LE in both study groups. The findings of the pilot study confirm the feasibility of proceeding to a larger randomized controlled study of the longer-term effects of acupuncture plus fire needle therapy in patients with LE.","acupuncture; adult; analgesia; arthralgia; case control study; complication; controlled study; devices; disability; elbow; female; human; male; middle aged; needle; pain measurement; pathophysiology; pilot study; procedures; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; tennis elbow; treatment outcome; young adult; Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Arthralgia; Case-Control Studies; Disability Evaluation; Elbow Joint; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Needles; Pain Management; Pain Measurement; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Single-Blind Method; Tennis Elbow; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Extended treatment of venous thromboembolism: A systematic review and network meta-analysis",2019,"Objective To evaluate efficacy and safety of oral anticoagulant regimens and aspirin for extended venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and conference proceedings for randomised controlled trials studying vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or aspirin for secondary prevention of VTE beyond 3 months. ORs (95% credible intervals) between treatments were estimated using random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies, totaling more than 22 000 patients, were included. Compared with placebo or observation and with aspirin, respectively, the risk of recurrent VTE was lower with standard-intensity VKAs (0.15 (0.08 to 0.24) and 0.23 (0.09 to 0.54)), low-dose factor Xa inhibitors (0.16 (0.06 to 0.38) and 0.25 (0.09 to 0.66)), standard-dose factor Xa inhibitors (0.17 (0.08 to 0.33) and 0.27 (0.11 to 0.65)) and the direct thrombin inhibitor (0.15 (0.04 to 0.37) and 0.23 (0.06 to 0.74)) although the risk of major bleeding was higher with standard-intensity VKAs (4.42 (1.99 to 12.24) and 4.14 (1.17 to 18.86)). Effect estimates were consistent in male patients and those with index pulmonary embolism or with unprovoked VTE and in sensitivity analyses. In addition, compared with placebo or observation, the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced with standard-intensity VKAs (0.44 (0.20 to 0.87)) and low-dose factor Xa inhibitors (0.38 (0.12 to 0.995)). Conclusions Standard-intensity VKAs and DOACs are more efficacious than aspirin for extended VTE treatment. Despite a higher risk of major bleeding, standard-intensity VKAs was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. Since overall efficacy and safety of standard-intensity VKAs and DOACs are in equipoise, patient factors, costs and patient preferences should be considered when recommending extending anticoagulation treatment. ? 2019 Author(s).","acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; placebo; thrombin inhibitor; acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular risk; drug efficacy; drug safety; human; lung embolism; mortality risk; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; risk assessment; risk factor; secondary prevention; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; venous thromboembolism; classification; complication; lung embolism; network meta-analysis; treatment outcome; venous thromboembolism; Anticoagulants; Aspirin; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Pulmonary Embolism; Risk Assessment; Treatment Outcome; Venous Thromboembolism"
"Integrated therapy decreases the mortality of patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis: A Taiwan-wide population-based retrospective study",2019,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: The issue of whether integrated treatment with conventional medicine (CM) and herbal medicine (HM) can reduce mortality in patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) had not been addressed. Aim of the study: In this study, we investigated the effect of integrated therapy on mortality in a retrospective PM/DM cohort in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Materials and methods: Patients with PM/DM were retrospectively enrolled from the PM/DM Registry of Catastrophic Illnesses cohort in the Taiwan NHIRD between 1997 and 2011. The patients were divided into an integrated medicine (IM) group that received CM and HM and a non-IM group that received CM alone. The Cox proportional hazards regression model and Kaplan-Meier method were used to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality. Results: Three hundred and eighty-five of 2595 patients with newly diagnosed PM/DM had received IM and 99 had received non-IM. The adjusted HR for mortality was lower in the IM group than in the non-IM group (0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.26–0.68, p < 0.001). The adjusted HR for mortality was also lower in the IM group that had received CM plus HM than in the group that received CM alone (0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.28–0.84, p < 0.05). The core pattern of HM prescriptions integrated with methylprednisolone, methotrexate, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide to decrease mortality included “San-Qi” (Panax notoginseng), “Bai-Ji” (Bletilla striata), “Chen-Pi” (Citrus reticulata), “Hou-Po” (Magnolia officinalis), and “Dan-Shan” (Salvia miltiorrhiza). Conclusion: Integrated therapy has reduced mortality in patients with PM/DM in Taiwan.

"Instability of brain connectivity during nonrapid eye movement sleep reflects altered properties of information integration",2019,"Nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is associated with fading consciousness in humans. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the spatiotemporal alterations of the brain functional connectivity (FC) in NREM sleep, suggesting the changes of information integration in the sleeping brain. However, the common stationarity assumption in FC does not satisfactorily explain the dynamic process of information integration during sleep. The dynamic FC (dFC) across brain networks is speculated to better reflect the time-varying information propagation during sleep. Accordingly, we conducted simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings involving 12 healthy men during sleep and observed dFC across sleep stages using the sliding-window approach. We divided dFC into two aspects: mean dFC (dFCmean) and variance dFC (dFCvar). A high dFCmean indicates stable brain network integrity, whereas a high dFCvar indicates instability of information transfer within and between functional networks. For the network-based dFC, the dFCvar were negatively correlated with the dFCmean across the waking and three NREM sleep stages. As sleep deepened, the dFCmean decreased (N0~N1 &gt; N2 &gt; N3), whereas the dFCvar peaked during the N2 stage (N0~N1 &lt; N3 &lt; N2). The highest dFCvar during the N2 stage indicated the unstable synchronizations across the entire brain. In the N3 stage, the overall disrupted network integration was observed through the lowest dFCmean and elevated dFCvar, compared with N0 and N1. Conclusively, when the network specificity (dFCmean) breaks down, the consciousness dissipates with increasing variability of information exchange (dFCvar). ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; article; clinical article; consciousness; controlled study; electroencephalogram; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; information science; male; nonREM sleep; wakefulness"
"Developing a decision-aid website for breast cancer surgery: An action research approach",2019,"Background: Patients with early-stage breast cancer have numerous options when choosing the type of breast surgery method to be applied. Each of these options lead to a similar long-term survival rate, but result in significant differences in appearance, function, cost, recurrence rate, and various other relevant considerations. However, the time available for detailed communication with each patient is often limited in clinics, which puts these women under great psychological stress and can hinder their surgery-related decision making. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a multipurpose surgery decision-making website providing medical information, psychological support, and decision-related simulation for women during breast cancer surgery-related decision making. Methods: Using the 4 steps of action research, which involve multigroup teamwork via regular team meetings, the following were performed: (1) Planning: searching, analyzing, and evaluating health websites to consensually decide the major infrastructure; (2) Action: work was performed simultaneously in 4 groups, which consisted of medical information collection and editing, patient interviews and data extraction, webpage content design, and programming to create or host the website; (3) Evaluation: the website was tested by clinical experts and focus groups of former breast cancer patients to assess its effectiveness and pinpoint appropriate improvements; and (4) Reflection: constant dialogue was conducted between the various participants at each step, which was used as the foundation and motivation of next plan-action-evaluation-reflection circle. Results: Using the action research approach, we completed the construction of our website, which includes the following: (1) “Woman’s Voice”—an animated comic depicting the story of a female breast cancer patient with interspersed questions for the users that will help them better empathize with the experience; (2) “Cancer Information Treasure House”—providing breast cancer surgery-related information through text, tables, pictures and a presentation video; (3) “Decision-making Simulator”—helping patients think through and check the pros and cons of the different surgical options via visual-based interactions including “Stairs Climbing” and “Fruit of Hope”; and (4) “Recommended Links”—providing reliable websites for further reference. Additionally, we have further improved the website based on the feedback received from postsurgery breast cancer patients and clinicians. We hope to continue improving to better meet both the patients’ and health providers’ needs and become a practical decision-making aid for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Conclusions: We have created the first breast cancer surgery decision-making assistance tool in Taiwan using a “Web-based” and multifunctional website design. This site aims to provide health care knowledge, psychological healing, and emotional support functions, as well as decision-making capability enhancement simulations. We look forward to assisting breast cancer patients in their decision-making process and expect our website to increase patient’s autonomy and improve their communication with clinicians. ?

"Association of iron deficiency anemia with tuberculosis in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study",2019,"Background Iron deficiency is associated with decreased cellular immunity, which may predispose patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) to increased risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). This study investigated the relationship between newly diagnosed IDA and TB infection in Taiwan. Methods The study included data on 21,946 patients with incident IDA and 87,555 non-IDA controls from a national database covering the period 2000–2012. IDA and non-IDA subjects were matched 1:4 on age, gender, and index year. The follow-up period was defined as the time from the initial IDA diagnosis to the date of developing TB or 31 December 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with the control group as the reference. Results The adjusted hazard ratio of TB for the IDA group was 1.99 (95% confidence interval, 1.77–2.25) compared with the control group. The subgroup analysis showed that for both genders, all age groups, and patients with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hepatitis B virus infection, the IDA group had significantly higher TB incidence. The association was significantly stronger within the 5 years after new IDA diagnosis for both genders and all age groups. Conclusions Higher TB incidence was discovered in the IDA group, especially for patients with comorbidities. ? 2019 Chu et al.

Collectively, microorganisms have been estimated to account for ?20% of all cancers worldwide. Recent advances in metagenomics and bioinformatics have provided new insights on the microbial ecology in different tumors, pinpointing the roles of microorganisms in cancer formation, development and response to treatments. Furthermore, studies have emphasized the importance of host-microbial and inter-microbial interactions in the cancer microbiota. These studies have not only revolutionized our understanding of cancer biology, but also opened up new opportunities for cancer prevention, diagnosis, prognostication and treatment. This review article aims to summarize the microbiota in various cancers and their treatments, and explore clinical applications for such relevance. ? 2018 The Authors","article; bioinformatics; cancer prevention; carcinogenesis; diagnosis; ecology; human; intestine flora; metagenomics; nonhuman; organismal interaction; treatment response; biology; genetics; intestine flora; microbiology; neoplasm; Computational Biology; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Metagenomics; Neoplasms"
"Comparable progression of spinocerebellar ataxias between Caucasians and Chinese",2019,"Introduction: The aim of this study is to reappraise the progression of the five most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) in the Chinese population and to establish a much-needed critical comparison with that in other ethnic groups. There are very few longitudinal cohort studies of SCAs in Asian populations. An intriguing finding in an earlier study demonstrated a faster progression of SCA among Chinese than that among Caucasians. Methods: Patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 or SCA17 were consecutively assessed using the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) for five years. A linear mixed model was used to compare the annual progression rates measured using the SARA among patients with different SCA subtypes. Predictors of the progression rates were analyzed. Results: A total of 199 patients with SCA (10 with SCA1, 37 with SCA2, 118 with SCA3, 25 with SCA6 and 9 with SCA17) were enrolled. The mean annual increase in SARA scores was 1.23 points for SCA1, 1.52 points for SCA2, 1.60 points for SCA3, 0.99 points for SCA6 and 3.26 points for SCA17. A larger CAG repeat length (?74) was associated with faster progression in SCA3, whereas a lower total SARA score at the first visit (<12) was associated with faster clinical progression in SCA6. Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that the annual progression rates of SCA2 and SCA3 are comparable between Han Chinese and other ethnic populations. More studies are warranted to confirm the rapid progression of SCA17 observed in our cohort. ? 2018","adult; Article; Caucasian; cohort analysis; comparative study; disease classification; disease course; disease duration; disease severity; ethnic difference; female; Han Chinese; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; priority journal; rating scale; spinocerebellar degeneration; statistical model"
"Creation of nurse-specific integrated interprofessional collaboration and team-efficiency scenario/video improves trainees’ attitudes and performances",2019,"Background: It is importance to train the interprofessional collaboration (IPC) and team-efficiency (TE) of medical trainees. This prospective study evaluates whether implementation of scenario/video-created workshops in integrated IPC and TE (IIT) program provides additional benefits for IPC-TE skills of nursing trainees. Methods: Mock simulation with two IIT scenarios was held as preintervention IPC-TE assessment. Basic and advanced workshops were arranged for teams of intervention groups for creation of discipline-specific scenario and video. Thirty-six nursing trainees were randomized into teams of five members (three nursing students, one standardized medical student, and one standardized trainees of other profession) in either intervention (scenario plus video and scenario) or control groups. After intervention, all groups received the formal simulation-based assessment using another two IIT scenario. In addition to instructors-based assessment of team’ performance in mock and formal IIT simulation using interprofessional team collaboration scale (AITCS), self-assessment of attitudes and program-value score were completed by each trainee, using attitudes toward interprofessional health care teams scale (ATIHCTS) at all stages. Results: Nursing trainees in intervention group gave high satisfaction score to this IIT intervention. In comparison with control group, greater increase in instructor-assessed team performance in the “partnership,” “cooperation,” and “shared decision making” domains of AITCS and the self-assessed “quality of care delivery” and TE domains of ATIHCTS were noted in the intervention groups. The overall improvement was greater in the scenario plus video group than those in the scenario group. Further, these improvements among nursing trainees persisted until follow-up stage at 4-weeks later. Conclusion: For nursing trainees, our study suggested that implementation of a scenario creation-based training resulted in additional improvement in trainee’ IPC and TE behaviors and attitudes. Additionally, making video of newly created nurse-specific scenario enhances partnership and cooperation among nursing trainees and their interprofessional team members.

"Therapeutic potential of vitamin D in AGE/RAGE-related cardiovascular diseases",2019,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the leading threats to human health. The advanced glycation end product (AGE) and receptor for AGE (RAGE) signaling pathway regulates the pathogenesis of CVDs, through its effects on arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, and cytoskeletal function. Targeting the AGE/RAGE pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy for ameliorating CVDs. Vitamin D has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. Experimental findings have shown that vitamin D regulates AGE/RAGE signaling and its downstream effects. This article provides a comprehensive review of the mechanistic insights into AGE/RAGE involvement in CVDs and the modulation of the AGE/RAGE signaling pathways by vitamin D. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","advanced glycation end product receptor; alagebrium; aminoguanidine; benfotiamine; vitamin D; advanced glycation end product; advanced glycation end product receptor; AGER protein, human; alagebrium; aminoguanidine; calcium; cardiotonic agent; guanidine derivative; thiazole derivative; vitamin D; arterial stiffness; atherosclerosis; biological activity; calcium homeostasis; cardiac muscle cell; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; disorders of mitochondrial functions; drug effect; heart failure; heart ventricle hypertrophy; human; hypertension; modulation; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; protein function; Review; signal transduction; skeleton malformation; vitamin D metabolism; actin filament; animal; blood; diabetic cardiomyopathy; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury; myocarditis; pathology; ultrastructure; Actin Cytoskeleton; Animals; Calcium; Cardiotonic Agents; Diabetic Cardiomyopathies; Gene Expression Regulation; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Guanidines; Humans; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Myocarditis; Oxidative Stress; Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products; Signal Transduction; Thiazoles; Vascular Stiffness; Vitamin D"
"A quantitative image analysis using MRI for diagnosis of biliary atresia",2019,"Purpose: Biliary atresia is a life-threatening disease that needs early diagnosis and management. Recently, MRI images have been used for the diagnosis of biliary atresia with improved accuracy of diagnosis when other imaging modalities such as ultrasonography are equivocal. This study aimed to evaluate the juxta-hilar extrahepatic biliary tree using MRI images to determine a quantitative value for diagnosing biliary atresia. Materials and methods: This retrospective study was approved by the Ethical Committee at Mackey Memorial Hospital (IRB Number: 15MMHIS149e). Between January 2010 and December 2015, twenty-five patients with surgically confirmed biliary atresia were enrolled (age 18–65 days). Another 25 patients with clinically or surgically diagnosed idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (age 6–64 days) and 20 patients with non-hepatobiliary disease (age 6–65 days) were considered control group and normal subjects, respectively. The diameter of the enlarged, T2-hyperintense structure was measured using MRI images by two radiologists both blinded. The cut-off value for a biliary atresia diagnosis was obtained by area under the curve analysis. Results: The diameter of the T2-hyperintense structure at porta hepatis in biliary atresia (4.79 ± 1.14 mm) is larger than in idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (1.72 ± 0.42 mm) or in non-hepatobiliary disease (1.72 ± 0.35 mm) (p < 0.05). The optimum cut-off value for diagnosing biliary atresia was 3.1 mm with 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Conclusion: The value of the enlarged, T2-hyperintense structure measured on MRI images was significantly increased in biliary atresia and may be useful in diagnosing biliary atresia. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Disease control; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Area under the curves; Bile ducts; Biliary atresia; Hepatobiliary disease; Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis; Imaging modality; Quantitative image analysis; Quantitative values; Diagnosis; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bile duct atresia; bilirubin blood level; cholangiography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; echography; female; human; image analysis; intrahepatic bile duct; major clinical study; male; newborn; newborn hepatitis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; radiological parameters; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; abnormalities; bile duct atresia; diagnostic imaging; extrahepatic bile duct; infant; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Bile Ducts, Extrahepatic; Biliary Atresia; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Retrospective Studies; Ultrasonography"
"The utilization of automated external defibrillators in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Increasing attention to care of patient succumbed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and evidence for improved survival have resulted in many countries to encourage the use automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by legislation. In Taiwan, the amendment of the Emergency Medical Services Act mandated the installation of AEDs in designated areas in 2013. Since then, 6151 AEDs have been installed and registered in mandated and non-mandated locations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utilization of AEDs at mandated and non-mandated locations. Methods: This paper analyzed 217 cases in whom AEDs was used between July 11, 2013 and July 31, 2015. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Results: The highest frequency of AEDs used was in long-term care facilities, accounting for 34 (15.7%) cases. The second and third highest was in schools and commuting stations. The highest utilization rate of registered AED was in long-term care facilities (73.9%), the second was in residential areas, and the third was in hot spring areas. Employees at the designated locations or medical personnel operated the AED in 143 cases (84.6%), and bystanders, relatives, friends or others operated the AEDs in 26 cases (15.4%). On-site Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) after applying AEDs occurred in 76 cases (45.8%). Conclusion: Long-term care facilities had the highest utilization of AEDs and government should pay more attention to enforce the installing of AEDs in these places. The government also needs to promote the education public on how to search the AEDs locations. ? 2018","adult; aged; Article; commuting station; do not resuscitate order; emergency health service; employee; female; friend; health care facility; health care utilization; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; medical personnel; out of hospital cardiac arrest; residential area; resuscitation; return of spontaneous circulation; school; Taiwan; thermal spring; traffic and transport; very elderly; defibrillator; epidemiology; health care survey; legislation and jurisprudence; middle aged; mortality; out of hospital cardiac arrest; procedures; resuscitation; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Defibrillators; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Migraine with active headache was associated with other painful physical symptoms at two-year follow-up among patients with major depressive disorder",2019,"Background Few studies have investigated the associations of comorbid migraine with other painful physical symptoms (PPS) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) at the two-year follow-up point. This study aimed to investigate this issue. Methods At baseline, 155 outpatients with MDD were enrolled. Migraine was diagnosed at baseline according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders. At follow-up, data of 101 subjects were analyzed. The average intensities of head, bone and/or joints, back, chest, abdomen, neck and/or shoulder, general muscle, and limb pain in the past week were evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). At follow-up, active headache was defined as a score on the VAS > 3. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the associations of migraine at baseline with other PPS at follow-up. Results Compared with the migraine with inactive headache group and the non-migraine group, patients with migraine with active headache had significantly higher intensities of other PPS and a lower remission rate of depression. There were no significant differences in the pain intensities of the other seven PPS between the migraine with inactive headache group and the non-migraine group. Headache intensity was significantly correlated with the intensities of other PPS at baseline and follow-up. Migraine with active headache independently predicted other PPS after controlling for depression and anxiety at baseline. Conclusions Migraine with active headache among MDD patients could predict other PPS. Prevention and treatment of headache might help to decrease other PPS and improve the prognosis of depression. Integration of treatment for depression and headache is indicated. ? 2019 Hung et al.

"Real-world anti-viral treatment decisions among chronic hepatitis C patients in Taiwan: The INITIATE study",2019,"Background/Purpose: While direct-acting antiviral regimens have been approved for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients in Taiwan, reimbursement is limited to certain populations. Thus, pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) remains the standard of care for many patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the percentage of CHC patients who were recommended and willing to receive PEG-IFN/RBV, and to identify reasons why patients were not recommended or unwilling to receive treatment. Methods: 822 Taiwanese CHC patients were enrolled from May–August 2016 in this cross-sectional study. PEG-IFN/RBV recommendation and patient willingness to receive treatment were evaluated through surveys. Patient characteristics associated with treatment recommendation and willingness were assessed. Results: 311 (37.8%) patients were recommended PEG-IFN/RBV while 102 (12.4%) were willing to follow treatment recommendation. Rates of recommendation and willingness were lower in treatment-experienced, hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (GT1) and cirrhotic patients, and those treated in Northern Taiwan. Multivariate analyses found factors such as prior treatment experience, GT1, cirrhosis and low hemoglobin levels to be associated with lower recommendation rates while advanced age, GT1 and low baseline viral loads were associated with lower willingness rates. Physicians' top reasons for not recommending PEG-IFN/RBV included the wish to wait for better treatment options (60.3%), prior treatment failure (21.3%) and patients’ advanced age (20.9%). Patients were unwilling to receive treatment mainly due to concerns about side effects (91.4%), the wish to wait for better treatment options (71.3%) and inconvenience (25.4%). Conclusion: A minority of Taiwanese CHC patients were recommended PEG-IFN/RBV, of which few were willing to receive treatment. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","hemoglobin; peginterferon; ribavirin; virus RNA; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; chronic hepatitis C; comorbidity; compensated liver cirrhosis; cross-sectional study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; groups by age; hemoglobin blood level; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; Hepatitis C virus genotype 3; Hepatitis C virus genotype 6; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1a; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1b; human; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; middle aged; multicenter study; nonhuman; observational study; patient-reported outcome; platelet count; prospective study; sex difference; Taiwan; treatment failure; treatment response; virus load; chronic hepatitis C; combination drug therapy; drug effect; genotype; Hepacivirus; multivariate analysis; physiology; statistical model; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Ribavirin; Taiwan; Treatment Failure; Viral Load"
"Validity of acute myocardial infarction inpatient process measures on the report card in Taiwan",2019,"Objectives: To investigate the validity of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) process measures on the public report card in Taiwan. If the quality measure of report card is highly valid, then it can enhance confidence over the use of report cards by citizens, and physicians would be more willing to make improvements based on the results of performance. Methods: The study analyzes the associations between the 5 process measures reported and the negative outcome measures from 2011 to 2012. Subjects were selected from the National Health Insurance Association (NHIA) admission files and had a principal diagnosis of acute AMI (ICD-9-CM 410) during the study period. The main outcome measures include return to the emergency department (ED) within 3 days, unscheduled readmission within 14 days, and 30-day mortality at the patient and hospital levels. Results: Four process measures are all negatively associated with the outcomes at hospital level, except for the LDL examination. Conclusions: Regarding the requirement for validity transparency of a report card, our research suggests that these process measures currently used on the AMI report card in Taiwan are valid based on their associations with negative outcomes. In other words, a hospital that achieves high scores on process measures probably also realizes better outcome quality.

"Prediction of clinical events in hemodialysis patients using an artificial neural network",2019,"Advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires routine renal replacement therapy (RRT) that involves hemodialysis (HD) which may cause increased risk of muscle spasms, cardiovascular events, and death. We used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method to predict clinical events during the HD sessions. The vital signs, captured using a non-contact bed-sensor, and demographic information from the electronic medical records for 109 patients enrolled in the study was used. Weka Workbench software was used to train and validate the ANN model. The prediction model was built using a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm as part of the ANN with 10-fold cross-validation. The model showed mean precision and recall of 93.45% and AUC of 96.7%. Age was the most important variable for static feature and heart rate for dynamic feature. This model can be used to predict the risk of clinical events among HD patients and can support decision-making for healthcare professionals. ? 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.

"A subanalysis of Taiwanese patients from ODYSSEY South Korea and Taiwan study evaluating the efficacy and safety of alirocumab",2019,"Background: Alirocumab can provide significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, data regarding its efficacy and safety in Asians are limited. Methods: A subgroup analysis of Taiwanese patients (n = 116) in a randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in South Korea and Taiwan (ODYSSEY KT, clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02289963) was performed. Patients with hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk on maximally tolerated statin were randomized to alirocumab (75 mg every 2 weeks; with dose increased to 150 mg at Week 12 if LDL-C ? 70 mg/dL at Week 8) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24. Safety was assessed for a total of 32 weeks. Results: At Week 24, the percent change in calculated LDL-C in the alirocumab group (n = 57) was ?51%, whereas that in the placebo group (n = 59) was 2.5%. Alirocumab significantly improved other lipid parameters, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and A1, lipoprotein (a), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the alirocumab group reached an LDL-C target below 70 mg/dL than those in the placebo group (81.3% vs 15.4%). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between both groups. Conclusion: Alirocumab treatment provided a favorable effect on LDL-C levels and other lipid parameters, and was generally well-tolerated in patients from Taiwan. The results of current analysis were consistent with the overall ODYSSEY phase 3 program.

"The efficacy of intraoperative periarticular injection in Total hip arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Periarticular injection (PAI) is a regional analgesia method performed in total hip arthroplasty (THA) for postoperative pain relief. However, its efficacy and safety is still inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the safety of PAI and to determine if PAI provides better pain relief and reduce the consumption of opioids after THA. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and the Cochrane Library comprehensively. Only randomized control trials were included in our meta-analysis. Eleven studies that compared the efficacy of PAI with the control group were included. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and Jadad score were applied to assess the quality of the included studies. We used the recommendations by the Cochrane Collaboration to reduce bias and to ensure our results were reliable and veritable. Results: Our analysis demonstrated that PAI was more effective than the control group with a lower visual analog scale (VAS) score during rest at 24 h (P = 0.003), 48 h (P = 0.002), and VAS score with activity at 24 h (P = 0.04). There was also less amount of opioid consumption (P = 0.01). There were no differences in length of hospital stay (P = 0.526) and postoperative nausea rate (P = 0.153). Conclusion: Compared with the control group, PAI showed better pain relief and less amount of opioid consumption after THA. Our meta-analysis suggests that PAI is a safe and effective multimodal analgesia technique that can be used for THA. ? 2019 The Author(s).","opiate; local anesthetic agent; narcotic analgesic agent; analgesia; clinical assessment; clinical effectiveness; drug use; health care quality; human; length of stay; meta analysis; patient safety; periarticular drug administration; postoperative nausea; postoperative pain; Review; scoring system; surgical risk; systematic review; total hip replacement; visual analog scale; wound complication; adverse event; analgesia; hip replacement; intraarticular drug administration; pain measurement; postoperative nausea and vomiting; postoperative pain; procedures; treatment outcome; Analgesics, Opioid; Anesthetics, Local; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Humans; Injections, Intra-Articular; Length of Stay; Pain Management; Pain Measurement; Pain, Postoperative; Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting; Treatment Outcome"
"Systemic Epstein-Barr Virus-positive T-Cell Lymphoma of Childhood Presentation with Hemophagocytosis",2019,"A 2-year-old Asian girl presented to our facility for the evaluation of thrombocytopenia. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin under the impression of immune thrombocytopenia. However, her body temperature spiked and progressive pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal liver function, coagulopathy, and pulmonary infiltration developed. The final diagnosis was systemic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive T-cell lymphoma of childhood with hemophagocytic syndrome. This type of cancer is extremely rare but occurs more commonly in Asians. Its prognosis is generally poor, and a treatment strategy is yet to be established. Double staining for EBV-encoded RNA and CD3 or CD8 is crucial for diagnosis. This type of lymphoma must be diagnosed differentially from acute EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, which is considered nonmalignant. This case report highlights the importance of awareness of this type of rare cancer, a comprehensive diagnostic approach, and close communication between primary care physicians and pathologists. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"A longitudinal, cross-lagged panel analysis of loneliness and depression among community-based older adults",2019,"In the present study, we intended to examine the temporal association between loneliness and depression among community-based older adults. We analyzed data on 3,920 persons with a mean age of 67.6 years at baseline from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the temporal association between loneliness and depression over a period of 14 years. The results showed that the temporal association between loneliness and depression was bidirectional but stronger and more robust for depression as the initial symptom. Loneliness at Time 1 and 3, respectively, significantly predicted depression at Time 2 and 4. Depression at each time point had a significant effect on subsequent loneliness, even considering covariates. Future prevention programs for older adults with depression should also target at dealing with their loneliness, and vice versa. This study also highlights the need to assess and to manage the two symptoms simultaneously. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.","aged; aging; article; controlled study; female; human; loneliness; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mental health; structural equation modeling; Taiwan"
"Clinical significance of post-treatment viral load of cytomegalovirus in patients with hematologic malignancies",2019,"Objectives: Patients with hematologic diseases were at high risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) diseases. In the present study, we compare various prognostic factors during CMV viremia, with specific emphasis on the relationship between viremia eradication and the long-term prognosis of patients after each episode. Methods: Adult patients with hematologic diseases who had a detectable CMV viral load (VL) (equal to or above 150 copies/mL) were included in the study. Medical records were reviewed for demographic data including age, sex, hematologic and other underlying diseases, status of stem cell transplantation, antiviral medication, serum CMV viral load before and after antiviral treatment. Results: A total of 101 episodes of CMV viremia occurred in patients with hematologic diseases. Comparison of various prognostic factors revealed non-survivors more frequently suffered from pneumonia and concomitant bacterial or fungal infections, had less frequently undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and had higher peak VLs during viremic episodes. After antiviral therapy, eradication of viremia was much less frequently achieved in non-survivors. The Kaplan–Meier curves revealed that patients with detectable end-treatment VL had lower survival rates even if the antivirals were administered for more than 21 days. In a multivariate Cox proportional-hazard model, a detectable VL at the end of antiviral therapy independently predicted mortality within 180 days. Conclusions: In patients with hematologic diseases suffering CMV viremia, failure to eradicate viremia after antiviral therapy indicates a higher chance of mortality and can be regarded as a useful indicator in evaluating the patient's long-term prognosis. ? 2019",""
"The usefulness of prophylactic use of acetazolamide in subjects with acute mountain sickness",2019,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms of acetazolamide (ACZ) in the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness (AMS) remain unclear. This study evaluated the changes in physiological variables of sleep and heart rate variability (HRV) in subjects with earlier history of AMS who underwent prophylactic treatment of ACZ. METHODS: Nonacclimatized healthy subjects were transported using a bus from 555 m to 3150 m within 3 hours. Polysomnography (PSG) was performed 3 days before ascent (T0), for two consecutive nights at 3150 m (T1 and T2), and 2 days after descent (T3). HRV was measured before sleep and after awakening from T0 to T3. AMS was diagnosed using a self-reported Lake Louise score questionnaire. Subjects found confirmed to have AMS were enrolled in this study. The physiological variables and HRV were compared in AMS subjects without (control group) and with prophylactic ACZ (prophylactic ACZ group). RESULTS: Thirteen AMS subjects were enrolled. The PSG results were analyzed in eight and HRV were analyzed in nine of the 13 subjects. The prophylactic use of ACZ in the subjects with a history of AMS significantly improved sleep efficiency (p = 0.012) and awakening percentages (p = 0.017) at T1, significantly higher levels of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and lower values of partial pressure end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO2) at four time points. Furthermore, they had a higher rapid eye movement sleep percentage (p = 0.05) at T2. Prophylactic ACZ treatment significantly increased the normalized unit of high frequency at T1 after awakening (p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Significantly higher quality of sleep, higher SaO2 during sleep, and lower PETCO2 at high altitude were found in the subjects with a history of AMS using prophylactic ACZ before rapid ascent. ACZ may accelerate the acclimatization process for rapid ascents to high altitudes by increasing parasympathetic tone based on HRV analyses.","acetazolamide; carbon dioxide; oxygen; acute disease; adult; altitude disease; blood; drug effect; female; heart rate; human; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; polysomnography; sleep; Acetazolamide; Acute Disease; Adult; Altitude Sickness; Carbon Dioxide; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oxygen; Polysomnography; Sleep"
"A potential treatment of low intensity pulsed ultrasound on cavernous nerve injury for erectile dysfunction",2019,"Erectile dysfunction after nerve injury is a common disease after radical prostatectomy. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family, which plays an important role in the survival of existing neurons, the differentiation of new neurons, and synaptic plasticity. It has been demonstrated that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) accelerates bone healing and axonal regeneration after injury. LIPUS may also be able to stimulate neuronal activity and enhance the levels of neurotrophic factors. Evidence suggests that elevated levels of BDNF in the brain have protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have shown that the treatment on cavernous nerve injury repair, and protective effect plus neuro-regeneration effect by low-intensity pulsed ultrasound. They shared the similar mechanism including several trophic factors stimulation, Pl3K/akt pathway activation, and anti-fibrosis mechanism. We hypothesized that due to its combined neuroregenerative and protective effects, the non-invasive and easy-to-use method of LIPUS stimulation could have a therapeutic effect on erectile dysfunction stemming from cavernous nerve injury. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","brain derived neurotrophic factor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; protein kinase B; BDNF protein, human; brain derived neurotrophic factor; animal experiment; animal model; Article; electrostimulation; enzyme activation; erectile dysfunction; male; nerve fiber regeneration; nerve injury; non invasive procedure; nonhuman; Pi3K/Akt signaling; postoperative period; prostatectomy; protein function; rat; animal; degenerative disease; erectile dysfunction; inflammation; injuries; innervation; metabolism; nerve regeneration; penis; Sprague Dawley rat; theoretical model; ultrasound; Animals; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Erectile Dysfunction; Inflammation; Male; Models, Theoretical; Nerve Regeneration; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Penis; Prostatectomy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Ultrasonic Waves"
"Antithrombotic treatment may reduce mortality among new-onset atrial fibrillation patients with gray-zone risk of stroke: A population-based Cohort study",2019,"Summary In clinical practice, some atrial fibrillation (AF) patients were classified as having low and moderate stroke risk by the CHADS2 score (?1) in 2001 but in 2012 they were not truly classified as low risk of stroke accord-ingtotheCHA2DS2-VASc score (?2) (defined gray zone). Therefore, a treatment gap exists in gray zone AF patients. This study aimed to evaluate whether gray zone AF patients could benefit from reduced all-cause mortality under antithrombotic treatment. This was a longitudinal cohort study performed using data from claim forms submitted to the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance from January 2000 to December 2011. The new-onset AF patients consisted of a gray zone cohort with a total of 1237 patients being enrolled. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality between 2001 and 2011. Patients in the gray zone receiving antithrombotic treatment had a significant reduction in all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.28] compared with the no treatment group [warfarin only: HR, 0.28 (95% CI, 0.15-0.52); warfarin + Aspirin: HR, 0.21(95% CI, 0.15-0.30); and Aspirin only: HR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.16-0.29)]. All-cause mortality was notably increased when any of the following risk factors were present: age 65-74 years, age ?75 years, chronic kidney disease, and vascular disease. We concluded that AF patients in the gray zone must receive either anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet treatment and there is a lower mortality in these groups during long-term follow-up. Further investigation is needed to observe whether the antithrombotic drugs have benefits for patients with AF with a CHA2DS2-VAScscore&lt;2. ? 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

"Energy intake at different times of the day: Its association with elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels",2019,"Background and aims: This study examined the association between macronutrient intake at different times of the day and blood lipid levels. Methods and results: The study was based on the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan, a cross-sectional study of non-institutionalized and non-pregnant healthy adults (?19-years-old). A one-day (24 h) dietary recall assessed participants’ food intake. Fasting plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were determined. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was estimated based on the Friedewald formula. According to the data of eligible subjects (n = 1283), the time of energy intake was categorized into three meal times 0500–0929 (morning), 1130–1329 (noon), and 1730–2029 (evening), along with three snack times 0930–1129 (mid-morning), 1330–1729 (afternoon), and 2030–0459 (night). Energy and macronutrient intake were calculated for the 6 time periods, based on 24 h recall data. An adjusted regression model showed that by transferring 100 kcal intake at night to the morning or noon, LDL cholesterol would be lower by 1.46 (95% CI: 2.42–0.50) and 1.27 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.24–0.30), respectively. Transferring 100 kcal of fat intake at night to earlier periods was associated with a lower LDL cholesterol level, especially transferring to noontime (significantly lower by 5.21 mg/dL, 95% CI: [7.42–2.99]) and evening (significantly lower by 3.19 mg/dL, 95% CI: [6.29–0.08]). Conclusions: Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol had the same pattern of association with the timing of energy intake. The study showed that elevated total and LDL cholesterol were positively associated with nighttime energy and fat intake. ? 2019","cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; biological marker; cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Article; beverage; body mass; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; cross-sectional study; employment status; energy expenditure; fast food; fat intake; female; food composition; food intake; human; interview; lipid blood level; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; macronutrient; major clinical study; male; meal; metabolic equivalent; middle aged; normal human; outcome assessment; physical activity; physical examination; priority journal; protein intake; seasonal variation; self report; young adult; aged; blood; comparative study; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; meal; nutrition; Taiwan; time factor; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, LDL; Cross-Sectional Studies; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Meals; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Taiwan; Time Factors; Young Adult"
"Clinical Significance of Bioimpedance Spectroscopy in Critically Ill Patients",2019,"Background: Early fluid resuscitation is a key aspect in the successful management of critically ill patients, but the optimal goal for volume control after the acute stage of critical illness remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of bioimpedance spectrometry for fluid management in critically ill patients. Methods: In this prospective observational study, patients who consented to participate were screened within the first 24 hours of admission to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) from February 4, 2015, to January 31, 2016. Information on demographics, comorbidities, primary reasons for admission, baseline laboratory data, and ventilator or inotropic use were documented. Data of fluid intake, fluid output, and body weight were recorded for the first 3 days of ICU admission. Bioimpedance spectrometry was performed on the first and third days after ICU admission. All participants were followed until death or hospital discharge. Results: Of the 140 enrolled patients (median age: 70 years, interquartile range: 60-77 years), 23 (16.4%) patients died during hospitalization. Independent predictors of hospital mortality were Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (per 1 point increase, odds ratio [OR]: 1.101) and overhydration (OH) volume on the first day (per 1 L increase, OR: 1.216). Compared to normal OH status (OH volume between ?1 and 1 L), hyper OH status (OH volume < ?1 L) on the third day after ICU admission was an independent predictor of hospital death (OR: 7.609). Normal OH status on the third day was associated with greater numbers of ICU-free and ventilator-free days. Conclusion: Bioimpedance spectrometry can be used to predict outcomes in critically ill patients. Increased OH volume on day 1 and hyper OH volume on day 3 of ICU admission are associated with a greater risk of hospital mortality. Volume status on day 3 is associated with durations of ventilator use and ICU stay. ?

"SOX2 promoter hypermethylation in non-smoking Taiwanese adults residing in air pollution areas",2019,"Background: Both SOX2 promoter methylation and air pollution have been associated with lung cancer risk. However, little has been done to assess SOX2 promoter methylation in individuals living in air pollution areas. The aim of this study was to investigate SOX2 promoter methylation in non-smoking Taiwanese adults living in areas with different levels of air pollution especially particulate matter with diameter &lt; 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Methods: A total of 1142 individuals aged 30-70 years were recruited. Data on SOX2 methylation, residence, age, and exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) among others were extracted from the Taiwan Biobank dataset (2008-2015). After excluding former and current smokers, alongside those with incomplete information, a total of 461 non-smokers comprising 176 men and 285 women were included in the study. Participants' residences were grouped under northern and central/southern areas because air pollution (PM2.5) is lower in northern compared to central and southern areas. Results: The methylation levels in men (0.16310 ± 0.01230) and women (0.15740 ± 0.01240) were significantly different (P &lt;.0001). In both sexes, the SOX2 promoter region was shown to be significantly hypermethylated in central and southern areas compared with the northern areas. The regression coefficient (β) was 0.00331 (P = 0.0257) in men and 0.00514 (P &lt;.0001) in women. Conclusion: SOX2 was significantly hypermethylated in both men and women residing in central and southern areas. The consistency in the results for both sexes shows that SOX2 promoter methylation could serve as a potential biomarker for industrial air pollution exposure. Moreover, it might reflect predisposition to cancer. Hence, healthy non-smokers at precancerous stages who have not been clinically diagnosed could be identified. ? 2019 The Author(s).","transcription factor Sox2; SOX2 protein, human; transcription factor Sox; adult; aged; air pollution; Article; biobank; female; human; male; methylation; particle size; priority journal; promoter region; sex; Taiwan; Taiwanese; air pollution; analysis; DNA methylation; drug effect; genetics; middle aged; passive smoking; promoter region; regression analysis; Adult; Aged; Air Pollution; DNA Methylation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regression Analysis; SOXB1 Transcription Factors; Taiwan; Tobacco Smoke Pollution"
"Facilitating a change model in age-friendly hospital certification: Strategies and effects",2019,"The ageing population is a powerful and transformative demographic force. The World Health Organization (WHO) has encouraged the development of an age-friendly hospital (AFH) network. However, no specific implementation strategies or best practices of AFH standards have been produced. This study sought to apply Kotter’s change model to the elements included in a successful AFH certification process and to evaluate the changes in employees’ knowledge of ageing and their attitudes toward the elderly. This was an observational study that utilized a pre- and posttest design, before and after an age-friendly hospital certification process was implemented. Participants were 163 hospital employees in Taiwan, who completed both pre- and postquestionnaires. The self-administered online questionnaire consisted of three sections: The Facts on Ageing Quiz, the Geriatric Attitudes Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. Following introduction of the intervention, the change process began, and later Kotter’s model was brought in as a descriptive framework. The results showed that Kotter’s eight-step framework is a good choice for thinking about how to change practice and make healthcare more age-friendly. Employee knowledge of ageing and their attitudes toward the elderly improved after this certification process. Appointing a chief executive officer, forming a steering committee, obtaining interdepartmental and interdisciplinary cooperation, and “soliciting support” for new policies from all employees, were identified as key factors influencing the success of age-friendly hospital (AFH) certification. This is the first study to apply Kotter’s eight-step framework of organizational change to an AFH certification process. ? 2019 Kuo, Chen.

"Noncontrast Chest Computed Tomographic Imaging of Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome",2019,"There are physiological consequences of overeating that can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this review article is to acquaint the reader with the current state of the art in the non-cardiac-gated, noncontrast chest computed tomographic (NCCT) imaging biomarkers of the metabolic syndrome and their prognostic significance found in the lower neck and chest. NCCT imaging biomarkers associated with metabolic syndrome in the chest include premature coronary artery calcification, acceleration of large vessel arterial and valvular calcifications associated with atherosclerosis, and pulmonary arterial enlargement from pulmonary hypertension associated with sleep apnea. These easily identified imaging biomarkers have prognostic implications for major adverse cardiac events (MACE). These NCCT chest-imaging biomarkers are likely targets for artificial intelligence algorithms to harvest for longitudinal assessment of their individual and multifactorial contributions to chronic disease, MACE, and mortality. Early recognition and treatment of these common disorders may help improve patient outcomes and quality of life while decreasing medical costs. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Pharmacological and psychological interventions for generalized anxiety disorder in adults: A network meta-analysis",2019,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a significant and common mental illness with a lifetime prevalence of 3.7%. Regardless of the complexity of treatment decisions for GAD, few studies have conducted systematic comparisons of the efficacies of varying interventions. Thus, this study performed a valid network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to synthesize direct and indirect evidence for alternative interventions for GAD. We searched four major bibliographic databases, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed, for published RCTs of adult patients with a diagnosis of GAD and allowed for all comorbidities. A total of 91 articles (14,812 participants) were identified in the final NMA. The results showed that all pharmacological treatments except for serotonin modulators and second-generation antipsychotics had greater effects than placebo: norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (standardized mean difference (SMD) ?1.84, 95% credible interval ?3.05 to ?0.62), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (?0.91, ?1.62 to ?0.20), melatonergic receptor agonists (?0.68, ?1.15 to ?0.21), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; ?0.67, ?0.90 to ?0.43), azapirones (?0.58, ?1.00 to ?0.17), anticonvulsants (?0.56, ?0.85 to ?0.28), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; ?0.54, ?0.79 to ?0.30), and benzodiazepines (BZDs; ?0.40, ?0.65 to ?0.15).

"Betel quid containing safrole enhances metabolic activation of tobacco specific 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)",2019,"Cigarette smoking (CS)and betel quid (BQ)chewing are two known risk factors that have synergistic potential for the enhancing the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)in Taiwan. Most mutagens and carcinogens are metabolically activated by cytochrome P450 (CYP450)to exert their mutagenicity or carcinogenicity. Previous studies have shown that metabolic activation of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), by CYP2A6 activity determines NNK-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, safrole affects cytochrome P450 activity in rodents. However, the effect of BQ safrole on the metabolism of tobacco-specific NNK and its carcinogenicity remains elusive. This study demonstrates that safrole (1 mg/kg/d)induced CYP2A6 activity, reduced urinary 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL)levels, and increased NNK-induced DNA damage, including N7-methylguanine, 8-OH-deoxyguanosine and DNA strand breaks in a Syrian golden hamster model. Furthermore, altered NNK metabolism and increased NNK-induced DNA damage were also observed in healthy subjects with CS and BQ chewing histories compared to healthy subjects with CS histories. In conclusion, BQ containing safrole induced tobacco-specific NNK metabolic activation, resulting in higher NNK-induced genotoxicity. This study provides valuable insight into the synergistic mechanisms of CS- and BQ-induced OSCC. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical activation; DNA; Ketones; Mammals; Metabolism; Betel quid; Cigarette; CYP2A6; Metabolic activation; Oral cancer; Oral squamous cell carcinomata; Synergistic mechanism; Tobacco specific nitrosamines; Tobacco; 4 (methylnitrosamino) 1 (3 pyridyl) 1 butanol; 4 (methylnitrosamino) 1 (3 pyridyl) 1 butanone; cytochrome P450 2A6; 4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone; cytochrome P450 2A6; nitrosamine; safrole; cancer; carcinogen; health risk; metabolite; organic compound; risk factor; smoking; tobacco; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; betel quid; cigarette smoking; controlled study; DNA strand breakage; enzyme activity; genotoxicity; human; human experiment; male; metabolic activation; nonhuman; Syrian hamster; toxicity testing; urinalysis; animal; chemically induced; drug effect; enzymology; female; hamster; liver; metabolic activation; metabolism; mouth tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; Taiwan; tobacco; tobacco use; toxicity; urine; Taiwan; Mesocricetus auratus; Nicotiana tabacum; Piper betel; Rodentia; Activation, Metabolic; Animals; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cricetinae; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6; Female; Humans; Liver; Mouth Neoplasms; Nitrosamines; Safrole; Taiwan; Tobacco; Tobacco Use"
"DNA damage, liver injury, and tumorigenesis: Consequences of DDX3X loss",2019,"The pleiotropic roles of DEAD-box helicase 3, X-linked (DDX3X), including its functions in transcriptional and translational regulation, chromosome segregation, DNA damage, and cell growth control, have highlighted the association between DDX3X and tumorigenesis. However, mRNA transcripts and protein levels of DDX3X in patient specimens have shown the controversial correlations of DDX3X with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevalence. In this study, generation of hepatocyte-specific Ddx3x-knockout mice revealed that loss of Ddx3x facilitates liver tumorigenesis. Loss of Ddx3x led to profound ductular reactions, cell apoptosis, and compensatory proliferation in female mutants at 6 weeks of age. The sustained phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γH2AX) and significant accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks in liver indicated that the replicative stress occurred in female mutants. Further chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that DDX3X bound to promoter regions and regulated the expression of DNA repair factors, DDB2 and XPA, to maintain genome stability. Loss of Ddx3x led to decreased levels of DNA repair factors, which contributed to an accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, replication stress, and eventually, spontaneous liver tumors and DEN-induced HCCs in Alb-Cre/+;Ddx3x flox/flox mice. Implications: These data identify an important role of DDX3X in the regulation of DNA damage repair to protect against replication stress in liver and HCC development and progression. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","ddb2 protein; DEAD box helicase 3; DEAD box protein; histone H2AX; protein; transcription factor Sp1; unclassified drug; xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein; aged; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; carcinogenesis; cell death; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromosome segregation; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; DNA replication; double stranded DNA break; down regulation; excision repair; female; gene deletion; gene knockout; genomic instability; in vitro study; inflammation; liver cell carcinoma; liver injury; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression level; protein phosphorylation; single stranded DNA break"
"Post-intensive care unit respiratory failure in older patients liberated from intensive care unit and ventilator: The predictive value of the National Early Warning Score on intensive care unit discharge",2019,"Aim: The older adult population is continuously growing worldwide and there is increasing use of medical recourse in older patients, especially for those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care and mechanical ventilation (MV). The present study aimed to investigate the burden and predictors of post-ICU respiratory failure in older ICU patients weaned from MV. Methods: In the present retrospective study, older ICU patients aged ?60 years, who were successfully weaned from MV and discharged to the general ward from the ICU of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2011, were included. Biomarkers on ICU discharge, as well as the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) were recorded and calculated. The outcome measure was post-ICU respiratory failure before day 14 (PIRF-14) requiring reinstitution of MV. Logistical regression was used to assess the predictors for PIRF-14. Results: Of 272 patients included, 23 (8.5%) developed PIRF-14. The post-ICU in-hospital mortality rates were 47.8% and 6.8% in patients with and without PIRF-14 (adjusted OR 12.597, 95% CI 4.368–36.331). In a multivariate analysis, the levels of NEWS and hemoglobin on ICU discharge were independent predictors for PIRF-14 (adjusted OR 1.273, 95% CI 1.076–1.507 and 0.645, 95% CI 0.474–0.879). In particular, patients with a NEWS of ?10 and subsequent PIRF-14 had a 15-fold increased risk of mortality as compared with those without both factors (adjusted OR 15.418, 95% CI 4.344–54.720). Conclusions: PIRF-14 is associated with high mortality in older ICU patients, and NEWS is a significant predictor for PIRF-14, which could be used to early identify patients at risk of post-ICU respiratory failure in the specific population.

"Gamma knife radiosurgery for the treatment of cavernous sinus meningiomas: post-treatment long-term clinical outcomes, complications, and volume changes",2019,"Purpose: To evaluate the outcomes of patients who underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for the treatment of cavernous sinus (CS) meningiomas. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological outcomes of 95 patients with CS meningiomas at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1993 and 2011. The study cohort comprised 27 men and 68 women with a median age of 50?years (range 29–79?years). The median pre-GKRS tumor volume was 6.6?ml (range 0.9–35.7?ml). The median margin dose was 12?Gy (range 11–21?Gy). The clinical factors related to favorable outcomes were assessed. Results: The median follow-up period was 59 (range 12–209) months. At the final follow-up, the tumor volume regressed in 70 patients (74%) and progressed in eight (8%). Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that the progression-free survival rates at 5 and 10?years were 92.7% and 81.2%, respectively. Three patients (3.2%) experienced exacerbated cranial nerve dysfunction following radiosurgery. Confined tumors were found to be an independent prognostic factor for tumor control and shorter times to regression in the multivariable analyses. No risk factor for tumor progression was identified in either the univariate or multivariate analyses. Conclusions: GKRS provides good long-term tumor control and is associated with low cranial nerve–related morbidity development rates in patients with small- to medium-sized CS meningiomas. Confined tumor could be an independent prognostic factor for tumor control and shorter times to regression in multivariate analysis. Life-long follow-up is mandatory in such settings, even for outpatients with shrunken or stabilized tumors. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cavernous sinus; cranial neuropathy; craniotomy; female; gamma knife radiosurgery; human; major clinical study; male; meningioma; middle aged; progression free survival; retrospective study; Taiwan; treatment failure; tumor recurrence; tumor regression; tumor volume; cavernous sinus; follow up; meningioma; mortality; pathology; postoperative complication; radiosurgery; survival rate; treatment outcome; tumor volume; Adult; Aged; Cavernous Sinus; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Meningeal Neoplasms; Meningioma; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Radiosurgery; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Burden"
"PD-L1 is a double-edged sword in colorectal cancer: the prognostic value of PD-L1 depends on the cell type expressing PD-L1",2019,"Purpose: To investigate the associations between programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells (TCs) or PD-L1 on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and the microsatellite instability (MSI) status in colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: In total, 238 CRC patients were enrolled. PD-L1 expression and MSI status were studied by immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction. The χ2 test was used to compare characteristics. The Kaplan–Meier method was used for survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the prognostic influence of clinicopathological factors. Results: Eighteen patients (7.6%) were had MSI-high (MSI-H) CRC. The number of patients with PD-L1 expression on TCs, stromal TIICs and intraepithelial TIICs was 13 (5.5%), 64 (26.9%) and 45 (18.9%), respectively. The MSI-H phenotype was significantly associated with younger age, right sidedness, mucinous component, high grade, stromal TIICs expressing PD-L1 (P = 0.042) and intraepithelial TIICs expressing PD-L1 (P &lt; 0.001), but not TCs expressing PD-L1. PD-L1-expressing TCs were an independent marker of poor prognosis [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.387, P = 0.003], and PD-L1-expressing stromal TIICs were an independent marker of good prognosis (HR = 0.551, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: PD-L1-expressing TCs were a marker of poor prognosis; in contrast, PD-L1-expressing TIICs were a marker of good prognosis.

"SCUBE1-enhanced bone morphogenetic protein signaling protects against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury",2019,"We previously reported that the membrane-bound SCUBE1 (signal peptide-CUB-epithelial growth factor domain-containing protein 1) forms a complex with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) ligand and its receptors, thus acting as a BMP co-receptor to augment BMP signal activity. However, whether SCUBE1 can bind to and facilitate signaling activity of BMP7, a renal protective molecule for ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) insult, and contribute to the proliferation and repair of renal tubular cells after I/R remains largely unknown. In this study, we first showed that I/R-induced SCUBE1 was expressed in proximal tubular cells, which coincided with the expression of renoprotective BMP7. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that SCUBE1 directly binds to BMP7 and its receptors, functioning as a BMP co-receptor to promote BMP7 signaling. Furthermore, we used a new Scube1 deletion (Δ2) mouse strain to further elucidate the renal pathophysiological function of SCUBE1 after I/R injury. As compared with wild-type littermates, Δ2 mice showed severe renal histopathologic features (extensive loss of brush border, tubular necrosis, and tubular dilation) and increased inflammation (neutrophil infiltrate and induction of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) during the resolution of I/R damage. They also showed reduced BMP signaling (phosphorylated Smad1/5/8) along with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of renal tubular cells. Importantly, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of SCUBE1 enhanced BMP signaling and conferred a concomitant survival outcome for Δ2 proximal tubular epithelial cells after hypoxia–reoxygenation treatment. The protective BMP7 signaling may be facilitated by stress-inducible SCUBE1 after renal I/R, which suggests potential targeted approaches for acute kidney injury. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","bone morphogenetic protein; bone morphogenetic protein 2; interleukin 6; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; osteogenic protein 1; signal peptide cub epithelial growth factor domaincontaining protein 1; Smad1 protein; Smad5 protein; Smad8 protein; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; bone morphogenetic protein receptor; ligand; messenger RNA; osteogenic protein 1; protective agent; protein binding; Scube1 protein, mouse; signal peptide; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; cell survival; comparative study; disease exacerbation; enzyme activity; genetic transfection; Hep-G2 cell line; histopathology; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; kidney injury; kidney ischemia; kidney tubule cell; kidney tubule necrosis; mouse; nonhuman; outcome assessment; priority journal; renal protection; reperfusion injury; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; TUNEL assay; Western blotting; animal; epithelium cell; fibroblast; gene deletion; genetics; HEK293 cell line; kidney; kidney proximal tubule; male; metabolism; pathology; protein subunit; reperfusion injury; signal transduction; upregulation; Animals; Apoptosis; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7; Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors; Cell Proliferation; Epithelial Cells; Fibroblasts; Gene Deletion; HEK293 Cells; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Kidney; Kidney Tubules, Proximal; Ligands; Male; Mice; Protective Agents; Protein Binding; Protein Subunits; Reperfusion Injury; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; Up-Regulation"
"Group B Streptococcal infection in neonates and colonization in pregnant women: An epidemiological retrospective analysis",2019,"Background: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is one of the major causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Universal GBS screening with intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) in pregnant women were initiated in 2012 in Taiwan. This study aimed to analyze the most recent maternal GBS colonization rate and the changes in neonatal GBS infection rate from 2011 to 2016. Methods: All pregnant women and their live born neonates between January 2011 and June 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Whether GBS screening was done, screening results, presence of risk factors, the use of antibiotics, and neonatal outcome were analyzed. In addition, hospitalized neonates diagnosed with GBS infections were retrieved for comparison of early onset disease (EOD) (<7 days) and late onset disease (LOD) (?7 days). Results: A total of 9535 women delivered babies during the study period. The maternal GBS screening rate was 71.0% and the colonization rate was 22.6%. The overall neonatal invasive GBS infection rate was 0.81 per 1000 live births and the vertical transmission rate was 1.2%. After 2012, the invasive neonatal GBS infection rate declined from 1.1–1.6? to 0.6–0.7? in 2014 and thereafter, the GBS EOD incidence rate declined from 2.8? to 0.0–0.6?, but the LOD incidence rate remained approximately 0.7?. Infants with EOD had strong association with obstetric risk factors. Conclusions: Taiwan's universal GBS screening with IAP program reduced the incidence rate of neonatal GBS EOD to be lower than 1? after 2012. Pediatricians still should pay attention to infants with GBS LOD since its incidence rate remained unchanged. ? 2017","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Article; bacterial colonization; disease association; disease course; early onset disease; female; group B streptococcal infection; human; incidence; late onset disorder; live birth; major clinical study; male; newborn; newborn infection; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; retrospective study; risk factor; screening; vertical transmission; adult; antibiotic prophylaxis; isolation and purification; mass screening; microbiology; pathogenicity; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prevention and control; Streptococcus agalactiae; Streptococcus infection; Taiwan; treatment outcome; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Male; Mass Screening; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus agalactiae; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"Mechanical stretch induces hair regeneration through the alternative activation of macrophages",2019,"Tissues and cells in organism are continuously exposed to complex mechanical cues from the environment. Mechanical stimulations affect cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, as well as determining tissue homeostasis and repair. By using a specially designed skin-stretching device, we discover that hair stem cells proliferate in response to stretch and hair regeneration occurs only when applying proper strain for an appropriate duration. A counterbalance between WNT and BMP-2 and the subsequent two-step mechanism are identified through molecular and genetic analyses. Macrophages are first recruited by chemokines produced by stretch and polarized to M2 phenotype. Growth factors such as HGF and IGF-1, released by M2 macrophages, then activate stem cells and facilitate hair regeneration. A hierarchical control system is revealed, from mechanical and chemical signals to cell behaviors and tissue responses, elucidating avenues of regenerative medicine and disease control by demonstrating the potential to manipulate cellular processes through simple mechanical stimulation. ? 2019, The Author(s).","beta catenin; bone morphogenetic protein 2; fibroblast growth factor 10; fibroblast growth factor 2; interleukin 4; Ki 67 antigen; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; Wnt protein; bone morphogenetic protein 2; chemokine; recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2; recombinant protein; scatter factor; somatomedin C; transforming growth factor beta; cell; genetic analysis; hair; homeostasis; instrumentation; mechanical property; molecular analysis; regrowth; repair; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; cell maturation; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; female; flow cytometry; gene expression; genetic analysis; hair follicle; hair growth; hair regeneration; homeostasis; immune response; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; macrophage; mechanical stimulation; mechanical stretch; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; real time polymerase chain reaction; regeneration; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; stretching; tissue reaction; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cell differentiation; cell motion; cytology; genetics; growth, development and aging; hair; macrophage; mechanical stress; metabolism; physiology; regeneration; skin; stem cell; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Chemokines; Female; Hair; Hair Follicle; Hepatocyte Growth Factor; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Macrophages; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Recombinant Proteins; Regeneration; Skin; Stem Cells; Stress, Mechanical; Transforming Growth Factor beta"
"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in stage I endometrial cancer: A single-institution outcome",2019,"Objective: Postoperative radiotherapy for early endometrial cancer has been investigated in several randomized trials. These trials demonstrate that it reduces loco-regional recurrence, but has no impact on overall survival. The aims of this study were to better understand the role of adjuvant radiotherapy and determine predictors for loco-regional recurrence or development of distant metastasis. Materials and methods: A retrospective medical records review was performed on patients with surgical stage I endometrial cancer treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 2006 and 2013. Multivariable analysis was conducted using Cox regression for prognostic predictors. Results: A total of 337 patients were identified. The estimated five-year overall survival and loco-regional recurrence-free survival were 96.3% and 97.9% in the non-radiotherapy group, and 91.6% and 97.1% in the radiotherapy group (p = 0.06 overall survival, p = 0.956 loco-regional recurrence-free survival). Multivariable analysis revealed that elevated preoperative serum Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) level (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.54), age older than 60 years old (HR = 3.34), and depth of myometrial invasion > 50% (HR = 3.37) were significant factors in overall survival. Elevated preoperative CA-125 level (HR = 5.37), age older than 60 years (HR = 6.57), positive lymphovascular space invasion (HR = 50.20), and adjuvant radiotherapy (HR = 0.05) were independent predictors of loco-regional recurrence-free survival. For distant metastasis, deep myometrial invasion was a significant risk factor. Conclusions: Postoperative radiotherapy delivery is an independent predictor for loco-regional recurrence-free survival but has no impact on overall survival in this population. Preoperative CA-125 level is a risk factor for loco-regional recurrence, and deep myometrial invasion was correlated with distant metastasis. ? 2019","CA 125 antigen; adjuvant radiotherapy; adult; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; controlled study; distant metastasis; endometrium cancer; female; follow up; human; local recurrence free survival; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; medical record review; metastasis free survival; middle aged; overall survival; recurrence risk; retrospective study; risk factor"
"Using a Text Mining Approach to Explore the Recording Quality of a Nursing Record System",2019,"Background: Most nursing records in Taiwan have been computerized, resulting in a large amount of unstructured text data. The quality of these records has rarely been discussed. Purpose: This study used a text mining method to analyze the quality of a nursing record system to establish an auditing model and associated tools for nursing records, with the ultimate objective of improving the quality of electronic nursing records. Methods: This study utilized a retrospective method to collect the electronic nursing records of 6,277 patients who had been discharged from the internal medicine departments of a medical center in northern Taiwan from January to June 2014. SAS Enterprise Guide Version 6.1 and SAS Text Miner Version 13.2 software were used to perform text mining. Nursing experts were invited to examine the electronic nursing records. The text mining results were compared against a benchmark that was developed by the experts, and the efficiency of SAS Text Miner was examined using the criteria of specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy. Results: In this study, 27,356 nurse-formulated events were used in the analysis. The results of the nurse-formulated events showed an 8.08% similar error with system-formulated events, 29.72% were identified as necessary and appropriate names, 17.53% were retained, 10.15% involved error event names, and 34.52% were not classified. In this study, the sensitivity of SAS text mining in the training (testing) data set was 96% (95%), and the specificity and accuracy were both 99% (99%). Conclusions: The results of this study show that text mining is an effective approach to auditing the quality of electronic nursing records. SAS Text Miner software was shown to identify inappropriate nursing record content quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, the results of this study may be included in in-service education teaching materials to promote the writing of better nursing records to improve the quality of electronic nursing records. ?

"Health-related quality of life in children and adolescent with different types of scoliosis: A cross-sectional study",2019,"BACKGROUND: The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was affected in children and adolescents with scoliosis. However, there was lack of study to compare the HRQoL among patients with different types of scoliosis. We aimed to investigate whether the HRQoL differs among patients with idiopathic, congenital, neuromuscular, and syndromic scoliosis. METHODS: Children and adolescents with scoliosis were recruited from a single tertiary hospital. The HRQoL, as assessed by the child health questionnaire 50-item parent form, was compared with a reference health sample group using the effect size (ES). Intergroup differences related to scoliosis subtype and severity were explored. RESULTS: A total of 67 participants with scoliosis (24 idiopathic, 15 congenital, 15 neuromuscular, and 13 syndromic) were analyzed. The HRQoL in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis was affected the most, in both physical (ES range: 0.97-2.4) and psychosocial domains (ES range: 0.92-2.58). To a lesser extent, the physical (ES range: 0.99-1.13) and psychosocial (ES range: 0.8-1.18) domains were also affected in patients with syndromic scoliosis. The domains of family activities (ES = 1.1), role/social-emotional/behavioral (ES = 0.99), general health perception (ES = 0.94), and self-esteem (ES = 0.87) were affected in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. In contrast, only the general health perception domain (ES = 1.27) was affected in patients with congenital scoliosis. Scoliosis severity correlated with scores in the physical domains and some psychosocial domains, while treatment type correlated with scores in the physical domains only. Scoliosis subtype and severity both affected the physical and psychosocial domains, with a stronger impact for subtype. CONCLUSION: Differences in the HRQoL exist among scoliosis subtypes, with neuromuscular scoliosis being most affected. Although the scoliosis subtype and severity both affect the HRQoL, the subtype is more influential than severity.","adolescent; child; classification; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; preschool child; psychology; quality of life; scoliosis; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Scoliosis"
"High metabolic rate and stem cell characteristics of esophageal cancer stem-like cells depend on the Hsp27–AKT–HK2 pathway",2019,"Tumor progression with chemoresistance and local recurrence is commonly happened during treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Cancer stem cells (CSC) may respond for tumor progression. However, there are few reports regarding metabolism of esophageal CSCs with clinical correlation. In this work, we demonstrated that ESCC cell lines in spheroid culture display CSC phenotypes, including increased ALDH activity, chemoresistance and tumor initiation, which are dependent on Hsp27 activation. Esophageal CSCs also exhibit reprogrammed metabolic features particularly higher glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which are regulated via the Hsp27–AKT–HK2 pathway. Moreover, HK2 is required for maintenance of CSC phenotypes. Inhibition of CSC metabolism reduces cell growth and tumor formation. Clinically, patients who underwent surgical resection for esophageal cancer, and displayed overexpression of both Hsp27 and HK2, had the worst prognosis of all expression types. In conclusion, stem cells features and aberrant metabolic reprogramming of esophageal CSCs depend on the Hsp27–AKT–HK2 pathway. Targeting Hsp27 and HK2 could be novel therapeutic strategy for treating esophageal cancer and warrants further investigation. ? 2019 UICC","aldehyde dehydrogenase; cisplatin; deoxyglucose; fluorouracil; heat shock protein 27; hexokinase; hexokinase 2; metformin; protein kinase B; quercetin; unclassified drug; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer stem cell; cell culture; controlled study; drug resistance; enzyme activity; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line; gene; gene overexpression; glycolysis; HK2 gene; Hsp27 gene; human; human cell; human tissue; male; metabolic rate; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; phenotype; priority journal; protein modification; tumor volume; upregulation"
"Subjective Cognitive Decline in the Community Is Affected at Multiple Aspects of Mental Health and Life Quality: A Cross-Sectional Study of the Community Medicine of Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital",2019,"Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is one of the early warning signs of objective cognition impairment and dementia. Methods: This cross-sectional study screened SCD and studied multiple domains of mental health, lifestyle, and life quality of the community-dwelling people in the northern coastal region of Taiwan. Results: Among 426 valid AD8 questionnaires, a cutoff of score 2 divided subjects into 115 with SCD (SCD+) and 311 without SCD (SCD-). Analysis of age, sex, body compositions, and blood tests revealed an older age (60.7 ± 10.9 years) of the SCD+ group than the SCD- group (57.6 ± 12.0 years, p < 0.05). Further exclusion of subjects younger than 50 years eliminated age differences and left 100 with SCD (SCD+-50) and 229 without (SCD-50). Multidomain comparisons of the SCD+-50 group over the SCD-50 group were made: the Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire found a higher likelihood of depression; the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index revealed suboptimal sleep quality; the SF-36 showed inferior function of all 8 aspects of quality of life; the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile documented a less health-seeking lifestyle of nutrition, self-actualization, and stress management. Conclusions: Aging increased the SCD risk. People with SCD had suboptimal performance in mental health and life quality in addition to subjective cognition problems. ? 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

"Targeting cellular metabolism modulates head and neck oncogenesis",2019,"Considering the great energy and biomass demand for cell survival, cancer cells exhibit unique metabolic signatures compared to normal cells. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most prevalent neoplasms worldwide. Recent findings have shown that environmental challenges, as well as intrinsic metabolic manipulations, could modulate HNSCC experimentally and serve as clinic prognostic indicators, suggesting that a better understanding of dynamic metabolic changes during HNSCC development could be of great benefit for developing adjuvant anti-cancer schemes other than conventional therapies. However, the following questions are still poorly understood: (i) how does metabolic reprogramming occur during HNSCC development? (ii) how does the tumorous milieu contribute to HNSCC tumourigenesis? and (iii) at the molecular level, how do various metabolic cues interact with each other to control the oncogenicity and therapeutic sensitivity of HNSCC? In this review article, the regulatory roles of different metabolic pathways in HNSCC and its microenvironment in controlling the malignancy are therefore discussed in the hope of providing a systemic overview regarding what we knew and how cancer metabolism could be translated for the development of anti-cancer therapeutic reagents. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Mitochondrial-DNA-associated TLR9 signalling is a potential serological biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer",2019,"Mitochondrial (mt) DNA has been long suggested to contribute to carcinogenesis, and a variety of mutations in mtDNA have been confirmed to be related to various early stages of cancers; these data revealed that the detection of mtDNA in clinical samples may be a promising approach for cancer diagnosis. In the present study, the serum mtDNA in healthy donors and groups of patients with cancer was detected. It was revealed that patients with lung cancer without metastasis had more mtDNA in serum compared to patients with metastasis. Moreover, TLR9-associated signalling was activated in vitro after treatment with a synthetic CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) called ODN-M362. In addition, our data revealed that TLR9 and its adaptor protein, MyD88, were induced by ODN-M362 in a dose-dependent manner. A human cytokine array to evaluate stimulation of cytokine secretion by ODN-M362 was also used. Our findings may identify the role that TLR9 and mtDNA play in lung cancer progression and metastasis. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Association between risk factors of metabolic syndrome with lung function",2019,"Background/Objectives: Increased evidence suggests that metabolic syndrome (MetS) is correlated with lung function impairment. This study aimed to explore the associations between MetS risk factors and the lung function. Subjects/Methods: The cross-sectional study included 6945 participants attending health examination between 2010 and 2012 in Taiwan. MetS was assessed according to the criteria of National Cholesterol Education Program III. Spirometric parameters were measured to define lung function. The relationships were tested using multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses. Results: The prevalence of MetS was significantly higher in males (16.2%) than females (3.8%). Although the prevalence of restrictive lung disease (RLD) was comparable between genders (20.7 and 21.0%), males with co-existent MetS had a higher prevalence of RLD than females (27.4 vs. 18.0%). Abdominal obesity, indicated by waist circumference (WC) and weight-to-height ratio (WHtR), was the most significant factor associated with lung function decline. Other components of MetS also showed statistically significant relationships, but very weak, with lung function. There was a trend toward an increased prevalence of RLD with the increasing number of MetS scores in males, independent of age, smoking, and body mass index. Conclusions: Abdominal obesity was the key component of MetS associated with mechanical effect on lung function impairment in a prime-age adult population. Although RLD was not associated with increased probability of having MetS, the participants with more MetS scores were at a higher risk of losing lung function. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",""
"Frequency of Intracranial Hemorrhage with Low-Dose Aspirin in Individuals Without Symptomatic Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",2019,"Importance: Use of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events remains controversial because increased risk of bleeding may offset the overall benefit. Among major bleeding events, intracranial hemorrhage is associated with high mortality rates and functional dependency. Objective: To assess the risk of intracranial hemorrhage associated with low-dose aspirin among individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January 1966 to October 30, 2018. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials that compared low-dose aspirin (daily dose ?100 mg) vs control and recorded the end points of intracranial hemorrhage separately for active treatment and control groups were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: A random-effect estimate was computed based on the Mantel-Haenszel method. Relative risk with 95% CI was used as a measure of aspirin vs control on risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were any intracranial hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural or extradural hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, for aspirin vs control. Results: The search identified 13 randomized clinical trials of low-dose aspirin use for primary prevention, enrolling 134446 patients. Pooling the results from the random-effects model showed that low-dose aspirin, compared with control, was associated with an increased risk of any intracranial bleeding (8 trials; relative risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13-1.66; 2 additional intracranial hemorrhages in 1000 people), with potentially the greatest relative risk increase for subdural or extradural hemorrhage (4 trials; relative risk, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.08-2.18) and less for intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patient baseline features associated with heightened risk of intracerebral hemorrhage with low-dose aspirin, compared with control, were Asian race/ethnicity and low body mass index. Conclusions and Relevance: Among people without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, use of low-dose aspirin was associated with an overall increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, and heightened risk of intracerebral hemorrhage for those of Asian race/ethnicity or people with a low body mass index. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Kinome-wide screening with small interfering RNA identified polo-like kinase 1 as a key regulator of proliferation in oral cancer cells",2019,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the major leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, with limited effective markers for diagnosis and therapy, which has caused a low overall survival rate in the past decades. Kinases play important roles in tumor development and malignancy in various types of cancer. However, little is known about the role of kinases in OSCC cells. In this study, an arrayed kinome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library was used to screen oral cancer cell lines and counter assayed with normal fibroblast cells to identify the genes required for cancer cell proliferation. We found that polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) was one of the most potent genes required for OSCC cell proliferation. The knockdown of PLK1 with a siRNA or antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) consistently diminished cyclin-B1 (CCNB1) expression/phosphorylation and the G2-M phase transition. Similar effects were observed in cells treated with the PLK1 kinase inhibitor BI6727. Besides, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis revealed that PLK1 was elevated in tumor tissues and associated with short survival in patients with OSCC. We also found that PLK1 expression was highly correlated with the expression of its downstream effector, CCNB1, in patients with OSCC. Coexpression of the two genes resulted in a poor prognosis of OSCC patients, particularly those in the advanced stages of OSCC. Taken together, our results suggest that PLK1 might be a diagnostic or therapeutic marker for OSCC. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Predicting Procedure-specific Morphine Consumption of Intravenous Patient-controlled Analgesia with Random-effect Model Approach",2019,"Introduction: Surgical procedure is an important predictor for analgesic consumptions of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) for acute pain. Objectives: The aim of this study was to better fit the analgesic consumptions of IV-PCA with regard to the different surgical procedures. Materials and Methods: A statistical model (random-effect model) was proposed to develop procedure-specific morphine consumptions for various surgical procedures of IV-PCA. After the model was developed, an independent data set was used for external validation. Results: The results showed a significant influence for morphine consumption coming from surgical procedures. Different surgical procedures resulted in a wide range of morphine consumptions. The surgical procedure with the highest morphine consumption was the resection of the pancreas with open approach (76.92 mg), while the lowest one was for the excision of the uterus with open method (34.3 mg). The external validation showed good model performance. The quantitative rank for surgical procedures was also presented. Discussion: Adopted IV-PCA regimens for different surgical procedures are therefore strongly recommended and incorporated into postoperative acute pain management. Copyright ? 2018 The Author(s).

"The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: Chronic secondary headache or orofacial pain",2019,"This article describes chronic secondary headache and chronic orofacial pain (OFP) disorders with respect to the new International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). The section refers extensively to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) of the International Headache Society that is implemented in the chapter on Neurology in ICD-11. The ICHD-3 differentiates between primary (idiopathic) headache disorders, secondary (symptomatic) headache disorders, and OFP disorders including cranial neuralgias. Chronic headache or OFP is defined as headache or OFP that occurs on at least 50% of the days during at least 3 months and lasting at least 2 hours per day. Only chronic secondary headache and chronic secondary OFP disorders are included here; chronic primary headache or OFP disorders are listed under chronic primary pain syndromes that have been described in a companion publication. The subdivisions of chronic secondary OFP of ICHD-3 are complemented by the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders and contributions from the International Association for the Study of Pain Special Interest Group on Orofacial and Head Pain and include chronic dental pain. The ICD-11 codes described here are intended to be used in combination with codes for the underlying diseases, to identify patients who require specialized pain management. In addition, these codes shall enhance visibility of these disorders in morbidity statistics and motivate research into their mechanisms. ? 2018 The Author(s).","chronic pain; face pain; headache and facial pain; homeostasis; ICD-11; jaw disease; morbidity; mouth pain; neuralgia; pain assessment; patient identification; priority journal; Review; secondary headache; tooth pain; vascular disease; chronic pain; classification; complication; face pain; human; International Classification of Diseases; international cooperation; organization; standards; Chronic Pain; Facial Pain; Headache Disorders; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; International Cooperation; Organizations"
"Procedure-Specific Risk Prediction for Recurrence in Patients Undergoing Lobectomy or Sublobar Resection for Small (?2 cm) Lung Adenocarcinoma: An International Cohort Analysis",2019,"Introduction: This work was performed to develop and validate procedure-specific risk prediction for recurrence following resection for early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and investigate risk prediction utility in identifying patients who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). Methods: In patients who underwent resection for small (?2 cm) lung ADC (lobectomy, 557; sublobar resection, 352), an association between clinicopathologic variables and risk of recurrence was assessed by a competing risks approach. Procedure-specific risk prediction was developed based on multivariable regression for recurrence. External validation was conducted using cohorts (N = 708) from Japan, Taiwan, and Germany. The accuracy of risk prediction was measured using a concordance index. We applied the lobectomy risk prediction approach to a propensity score–matched cohort of patients with stage II-III disease (n = 316, after matching) with or without ACT and compared lung cancer–specific survival between groups among low- or high-risk scores. Results: Micropapillary pattern, solid pattern, lymphovascular invasion, and necrosis were involved in the risk prediction following lobectomy, and micropapillary pattern, spread through air spaces, lymphovascular invasion, and necrosis following sublobar resection. Both internal and external validation showed good discrimination (concordance index in lobectomy and sublobar resection: internal, 0.77 and 0.75, respectively; and external, 0.73 and 0.79, respectively). In the stage II-III propensity score–matched cohort, among high-risk patients, ACT significantly reduced the risk of lung cancer–specific death (subhazard ratio 0.43, p = 0.001), but not among low-risk patients. Conclusions: Procedure-specific risk prediction for patients with resected small lung ADC can be used to better prognosticate and stratify patients for further interventions. ? 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","antineoplastic agent; adult; age; aged; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer grading; cancer recurrence; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; Germany; high risk patient; human; human cell; human tissue; Japan; low risk patient; lung adenocarcinoma; lung lobectomy; lung resection; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; male; micropapillary pattern; necrosis; overall survival; pleural invasion; prediction; priority journal; propensity score; retrospective study; risk factor; sex; smoking; solid pattern; spread through air space; sublobar resection; Taiwan; tumor volume"
"Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) Facilitates Pressure Overload–Induced Dysfunction in the Diabetic Heart",2019,"Patients with diabetes are more prone to developing heart failure in the presence of high blood pressure than those without diabetes. Yes-associated protein (YAP), a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, is persistently activated in diabetic hearts, and YAP plays an essential role in mediating the exacerbation of heart failure in response to pressure overload in the hearts of mice fed a high-fat diet. YAP induced dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes through activation of transcriptional enhancer factor 1 (TEAD1), a transcription factor. Thus, YAP and TEAD1 are promising therapeutic targets for diabetic patients with high blood pressure to prevent the development of heart failure. ? 2019","oncostatin M; transcription factor; transcriptional enhancer factor 1; unclassified drug; verteporfin; Yes associated protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cell dedifferentiation; controlled study; diabetic cardiomyopathy; disease exacerbation; female; haploinsufficiency; heart function; heart left ventricle failure; heart left ventricle overload; hippo signaling; human; human tissue; in vivo study; lipid diet; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pathogenesis; positive feedback; protein function; signal transduction; survival rate; tissue level; upregulation"
"The mid-term outcome of dialysis-dependent patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty: A retrospective study",2019,"BACKGROUND: Dialysis-dependent patients undergoing primary total knee and total hip arthroplasty have been associated with higher in-hospital mortality and complication rates. We investigated the mid-term implant survival, patient survival, and functional outcomes in these patients and reviewed our complications. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed dialysis-dependent patients undergoing primary total knee or total hip arthroplasty in our hospital between November 2004 and January 2015, with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Thirty-four patients with 39 total knee arthroplasties were included (M:F, 33.3%:66.7%, mean age: 68.8 years, mean follow-up: 55.9 ± 28.3 months). Twenty-seven patients with 31 total hip arthroplasties were included (M:F, 22.6%:77.4%, mean age: 62.3 years, mean follow-up: 55.8 ± 23.4 months). RESULTS: In the total knee arthroplasty group, there were two in-hospital mortality cases (3.5%) and two cases of implant failure (5.1%). The mean Knee Society Score was 84.0 ± 20.7. In the total hip arthroplasty group, there were three cases of implant failure (9.7%). The mean Harris Hip Score was 81.1 ± 23.9. The complications we encountered for both groups were instability and infection. CONCLUSION: Dialysis-dependent patients who had undergone total joint arthroplasty are associated with high mortality rate. In our experience, satisfactory mid-term results can be achieved in these patients with manageable complications and low-implant failure rates.","adult; aged; female; hemodialysis; hip replacement; hospital mortality; human; knee replacement; male; middle aged; mortality; retrospective study; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Dialysis; Retrospective Studies"
"Does “hospital loyalty” matter? Factors related to the intention of using a mobile app",2019,"Purpose: This study aimed to explore the association between hospital loyalty, perceived usefulness of a mobile app, perceived ease of use of that mobile app, and satisfaction with the app’s use as well as predicting patients’ intended use of the app. Patients and methods: Purposive sampling was adopted in a cross-sectional survey. The participants were outpatients at the traditional Chinese medicine departments of three hospitals in northern Taiwan (n=125). The self-report questionnaire comprised information about sociodemographics and scales related to hospital loyalty, perceived usefulness of the mobile app, its perceived ease of use, satisfaction with its use, and its usage intention. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results: The four factors explained 70% variance in usage intention. The perceived usefulness of the mobile app directly and indirectly affects their usage intention, but its perceived ease of use had only indirect effects on the usage intention. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence the usage intention through satisfaction. The women’s hospital loyalty does not directly affect the usage intention of the mobile app, but indirectly affects it through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the mobile app. Conclusion: Intended use of the app by women is mainly related to their experience of which is usefulness, ease of use and satisfaction of service are the most important factors contributing to continuous use. Hospital loyalty does not directly affect intention to use as expected. The influence of loyalty must be related to the patients’ perception of the product, in terms of usefulness, ease to use, and satisfaction. The finding is helpful to understand patients’ preference and support their behavioral adherence. ? 2019 Lin et al.","adult; article; Chinese medicine; female; human; major clinical study; mobile application; multicenter study; outpatient; perception; questionnaire; sampling; satisfaction; self report; structural equation modeling; Taiwan"
"Exploration of microbiota targets for major depressive disorder and mood related traits",2019,"Growing evidence suggests the link between gut microbiota and mood regulation. The current study aimed to identify microbiota targets for major depressive disorder (MDD) and mood-related traits in Taiwanese samples, while taking into account the influence of dietary patterns. We recruited 36 MDD patients and 37 healthy controls for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We assessed nutrient content using food frequency questionnaire, and mood related phenotypes, including depressive severity, anxiety, and perceived stress. Analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) models were performed to evaluate microbiota compositions between patients and controls, while adjusted for fat intake% and sequencing platforms. We found 23 taxa (4 phyla, 7 families and 12 genera) to be associated with depression and beta diversity was differed between groups. Phylum Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were overrepresented in MDD patients. At genus level, Bifidobacterium (7%) and Blautia (8%) had relatively high abundance among MDD patients, while Prevotella (16%) had high abundance in controls. Holdemania exhibited moderate correlation with anxiety (r = 0.65) and perceived stress level (r = 0.49) mainly in MDD patients but not controls. Pathway analyses revealed that pentose phosphate and starch and sucrose metabolism processes were important pathways for depression via microbiota functions. In conclusion, our results revealed microbiota targets for depression that are independent of fat intake. It is worthwhile to conduct further studies to replicate the current findings and to integrate with biochemistry and metabolomics data to better understand the functions of identified targets. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","antidepressant agent; pentose phosphate; RNA 16S; starch; Actinobacteria; adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; Beck Anxiety Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory; Bifidobacterium; Blautia; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; dietary pattern; disease severity; DSM-5; fat intake; female; Firmicutes; food frequency questionnaire; gene sequence; human; intestine flora; major depression; male; metabolomics; microbiome; mood disorder; mood disorder assessment; nutrient content; nutritional assessment; pentose phosphate cycle; phenotype; Prevotella; priority journal; schedule for ff disorders and schizophrenia lifetime; stress; sucrose metabolism; Taiwan"
"Identification of potential biomarkers related to glioma survival by gene expression profile analysis",2019,"Background: Recent studies have proposed several gene signatures as biomarkers for different grades of gliomas from various perspectives. However, most of these genes can only be used appropriately for patients with specific grades of gliomas. Methods: In this study, we aimed to identify survival-relevant genes shared between glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lower-grade glioma (LGG), which could be used as potential biomarkers to classify patients into different risk groups. Cox proportional hazard regression model (Cox model) was used to extract relative genes, and effectiveness of genes was estimated against random forest regression. Finally, risk models were constructed with logistic regression. Results: We identified 104 key genes that were shared between GBM and LGG, which could be significantly correlated with patients' survival based on next-generation sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas for gene expression analysis. The effectiveness of these genes in the survival prediction of GBM and LGG was evaluated, and the average receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) area under the curve values ranged from 0.7 to 0.8. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were involved in eight significant pathways and 23 molecular functions. Moreover, the expressions of ten (CTSZ, EFEMP2, ITGA5, KDELR2, MDK, MICALL2, MAP 2 K3, PLAUR, SERPINE1, and SOCS3) of these genes were significantly higher in GBM than in LGG, and comparing their expression levels to those of the proposed control genes (TBP, IPO8, and SDHA) could have the potential capability to classify patients into high- and low- risk groups, which differ significantly in the overall survival. Signatures of candidate genes were validated, by multiple microarray datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus, to increase the robustness of using these potential prognostic factors. In both the GBM and LGG cohort study, most of the patients in the high-risk group had the IDH1 wild-type gene, and those in the low-risk group had IDH1 mutations. Moreover, most of the high-risk patients with LGG possessed a 1p/19q-noncodeletion. Conclusion: In this study, we identified survival relevant genes which were shared between GBM and LGG, and those enabled to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups based on expression level analysis. Both the risk groups could be correlated with the well-known genetic variants, thus suggesting their potential prognostic value in clinical application. ? 2019 The Author(s).","tumor marker; transcriptome; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; CTSZ gene; EFEMP2 gene; female; gene; gene expression profiling; gene mutation; genetic identification; glioblastoma; glioma; high risk population; human; IPO8 gene; ITGA5 gene; KDELR2 gene; low risk population; major clinical study; male; MAP 2 K3 gene; MDK gene; MICALL2 gene; next generation sequencing; PLAUR gene; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; SDHA gene; SERPINE1 gene; SOCS3 gene; TBP gene; brain tumor; genetics; glioma; middle aged; pathophysiology; prognosis; proportional hazards model; risk factor; survival analysis; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Brain Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Female; Glioblastoma; Glioma; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; Transcriptome"
"Cancer is not a risk factor for bullous pemphigoid: 10-year population-based cohort study",2019,"Background: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune bullous disease. Whether there is an increased risk for subsequent BP among patients with cancer is still unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the risk for subsequent BP in patients with cancer. Methods: This nationwide population-based cohort study was based on data obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database between 2000 and 2011. A total of 36 838 patients with cancer and 147 352 age-, sex- and index-date-matched controls were recruited. The hazard ratio (HR) of subsequent BP in the patients with cancer was analysed using a Fine–Gray competing risk regression model with mortality as the competing event. Results: The incidence of BP per 100 000 person-years was 17·2 in the patients with cancer and 19·8 in the controls; therefore, the crude incidence rate ratio was 0·87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·53–1·36]. The HR of subsequent BP in the patients with cancer was 0·47 (95% CI 0·23–0·94) using the Fine-Gray competing risk regression model. Age (HR 1·05, 95% CI 1·03–1·07), diabetes mellitus (HR 1·69, 95% CI 1·10–2·59) and cerebrovascular disease (HR 2·14, 95% CI 1·36–3·34) were independent risk factors for BP. Conclusions: The incidence of BP in patients with cancer was not higher than in the control group. Cancer is not a risk factor for BP. ? 2018 British Association of Dermatologists","adult; Article; bile duct carcinoma; bladder cancer; brain cancer; breast cancer; bullous pemphigoid; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer registry; cerebrovascular disease; cohort analysis; colon cancer; comparative study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; esophagus cancer; female; gallbladder cancer; Hodgkin disease; human; incidence; kidney cancer; leukemia; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; melanoma skin cancer; middle aged; mouth cancer; multiple myeloma; nasopharynx cancer; national health insurance; nervous system cancer; nonhodgkin lymphoma; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; pharynx cancer; population research; priority journal; prostate cancer; rectum cancer; risk factor; stomach cancer; thyroid cancer; uterine cervix cancer"
"Visfatin promotes monocyte adhesion by upregulating ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells via activation of p38-PI3K-AKT signaling and subsequent ROS production and IKK/NF-κB activation",2019,"Background/Aims: Visfatin is known to act as a mediator in several metabolic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effect of visfatin on the adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to human vascular endothelial cells and the underlying mechanism. Methods: Monocytes adhesion to endothelial cells was determined by using fluorescence-labeled monocytes. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells were measured by western blotting. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by using a fluorescent dye. The amounts of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and phosphorylation of inhibitory factor of NF-κB (IκB) were determined by using western blot analysis. The translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was determined by using immunofluorescence. Results: Here we showed that visfatin significantly caused the upregulation of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in endothelial cells, as well as enhanced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Moreover, we found that inhibition of PI3K, Akt, and p38 MAPK activation significantly prevented visfatin-enhanced expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Visfatin enhanced ROS production and IKK/NF-?B activation and then led to upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and enhanced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. These effects were also p38/PI3K/Akt-dependent. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that visfatin promoted monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion by increasing ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression via the activation of p38/PI3K/Akt signaling and downstream ROS production and IKK/NF-?B activation. ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Semaphorin 3A in Ankylosing Spondylitis",2019,"Background/Purpose: To determine serum semaphorin 3A (Sema 3A) levels in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods: Serum Sema 3A was measured in 46 AS patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs). For the patients, we recorded demographic data, disease activity, functional index & global assessment, detected human leukocyte antigen-B27 (HLA-B27), and measured erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) & C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: Sema 3A was higher in AS patients than in HCs (3.98 ± 2.57 vs. 1.34 ± 0.48 ng/ml, p = 0.013). Area under the curve (AUC) of standard receiver operating characteristic (ROC) has suggested that Sema 3A > 2 ng/ml is better to predict the higher Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI, > 4) than ESR or CRP. There were good correlations between higher Sema 3A and uveitis, Sch?ber's test, as well as interstitial lung disease. AS patients undergoing anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies for 3 months exhibited a positive correlation of change in Sema 3A (ΔSema 3A) with disease activity fluctuation [ΔBASDAI, ΔBath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and ΔBath Ankylosing Spondylitis - Global score (BAS-G)]. Conclusion: Serum Sema 3A level was increased in AS patients and was inversely correlated to Sch?ber's test. Serum Sema 3A is better as a bio-marker than ESR or CRP to correlate with high disease activity in AS patients, and it is also a good indicator for monitoring disease activity and functional status during anti-TNF treatment. Also, Sema 3A may be taken as a predictor for extra-articular presentations in AS, but this needs further study to elucidate. ? 2017","C reactive protein; HLA B27 antigen; semaphorin 3A; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; antirheumatic agent; biological marker; C reactive protein; HLA B27 antigen; semaphorin 3A; adult; ankylosing spondylitis; Article; Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; correlational study; demography; disease activity; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; Global Assessment of Functioning; human; interstitial lung disease; male; predictive value; protein blood level; receiver operating characteristic; treatment duration; uveitis; ankylosing spondylitis; blood; middle aged; questionnaire; severity of illness index; Adult; Antirheumatic Agents; Biomarkers; Blood Sedimentation; C-Reactive Protein; Female; HLA-B27 Antigen; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; ROC Curve; Semaphorin-3A; Severity of Illness Index; Spondylitis, Ankylosing; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Successful treatment of vertical root fracture through intentional replantation and root fragment bonding with 4-META/MMA-TBB resin",2019,"Background/Purpose: Vertical root fracture (VRF) is a complication in endodontically treated teeth. This study aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of treatment of 6 VRF teeth with intentional replantation and root fragment bonding with 4-methacryloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride/methyl methacrylate-tri-n-butyl borane (4-META/MMA-TBB) resin. Methods: A series of 6 complete VRF teeth (one incisor, one canine, one premolar, and 3 M) were treated through intentional replantation and root fragment bonding with 4-META/MMA-TBB resin. Results: This study included 6 VRF teeth in 6 patients (one man and 5 women; mean age, 44 ± 8 years). All 6 teeth had VRF in the bucco-lingual direction and one tooth had concomitant VRF in the mesio-distal direction. The root thickness was classified as thick in all 6 teeth. Of the 6 VRF teeth, 4 had biting, percussion, or palpation pain, 4 had gingival swelling, 3 had sinus tracts, 3 had discomfort, and one had tooth mobility. Radiographically, 5 of the 6 teeth had periradicular radiolucent lesions, 4 of which exhibited complete regression and one of which exhibited nearly complete regression after root fragment bonding therapy. Because all 6 treated teeth exhibited sound function in the oral cavity after a follow-up period ranging from 33 to 74 (mean, 50 ± 15) months, the clinical outcomes were all considered to be successful. Conclusion: For a VRF tooth, in addition to tooth extraction, intentional replantation combined with root fragment bonding with 4-META/MMA-TBB resin is a successful treatment modality that can be used to preserve a complete VRF tooth. ? 2018","4 methacryloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride; methylmethacrylate tri n butyl borane; resin; unclassified drug; 4-methacryloxyethyltrimellitic acid anhydride; boron derivative; methacrylic acid; methacrylic acid methyl ester; methylmethacrylate-tributylborane resin; resin cement; adult; Article; bite; buccolingual direction; canine tooth; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; cone beam computed tomography; female; follow up; gingivitis; human; incisor; male; mandibular first molar; mesiodistal direction; middle aged; pain; palpation; percussion; periodontal disease; premolar tooth; radiography; root fragment bonding; surgical technique; thickness; tooth disease; tooth extraction; tooth fracture; tooth replantation; treatment outcome; vertical root fracture; diagnostic imaging; endodontic procedure; injuries; procedures; surgery; tooth extraction; tooth fracture; tooth replantation; tooth root; Adult; Boron Compounds; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Female; Humans; Male; Methacrylates; Methylmethacrylates; Middle Aged; Resin Cements; Root Canal Therapy; Tooth Extraction; Tooth Fractures; Tooth Replantation; Tooth Root; Treatment Outcome"
"Very rare condition of multiple Gaucheroma: A case report and review of the literature",2019,"Background: This study presented a 3 years old boy with Gaucher disease (GD)who was treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)for 19 months and then developed multiple Gaucheroma. Review of literature was performed simultaneously. Methods: The medical chart and literature were reviewed. A boy presented at the age of 15 months with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly. GD was confirmed by enzyme assay and gene mutations. ERT was administered right after the diagnosis. When the boy was 3 years old, multiple masses were discovered during a regular checkup abdominal MRI and biopsy revealed Gaucheroma. We also reviewed 20 GD patients with Gaucheroma and Gaucher cell infiltrated lymphadenopathies. Conclusion: Gaucheroma is a rare condition of regularly treated GD patients. This patient even showed poor response to doubled ERT doses. The imaging studies are necessary for Gaucher patients to detect Gaucheroma and determine their malignancy. Regular checkups are recommended in all GD patients even with regular treatment, due to the possibility of having deteriorating change, like Gaucheroma. ? 2019 The Authors","imiglucerase; abdominal distension; anemia; Article; Bayley Scales of Infant Development; bone marrow biopsy; case report; cell infiltration; child; clinical article; dried blood spot testing; enzyme assay; enzyme replacement; Gaucher disease; Gaucher disease cell line; Gaucheroma; gene mutation; hepatosplenomegaly; histopathology; human; lymphadenopathy; lysosome storage disease; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; preschool child; pseudotumor; splenomegaly; thrombocytopenia; treatment duration; tumor biopsy; tumor volume"
"Predictors for lower urinary tract symptoms and the urinary specific quality of life in prostate cancer patients: One-year follow-up",2019,"Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and is becoming a growing concern in global epidemiology. Quality of life of patients has become a major outcome for cancer care but limited study investigated quality of life of PCa patients. Our study is to investigate predictors for treatment outcomes of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), nocturia, and the urinary specific quality of life (uQoL) in PCa patients one year following treatment. Methods: A prospective study of 131 consecutive patients was conducted with outcome measurements before treatment, at 3 months, 6 months, and one year following therapy. We utilized the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire to collect data. Generalized estimating equations were performed to identify predictors for major outcomes of LUTS, nocturia, and uQoL. Results: LUTS increased slightly over time, but nocturia and uQoL were improved from baseline to 12 months. Results of the interaction analysis indicated that patients with TNM stage 3 compared with those with stage 2 had a reduction in LUTS from diagnosis to 6 months. Patients who received surgery or radiation compared to hormone therapy had worse nocturia from diagnosis to 6 months compared to those of patients who received hormone therapy. Higher body mass index (BMI) decreased the uQoL from diagnosis to 3 months, and higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level deteriorated the uQoL from diagnosis to 12 months. Conclusion: TNM stage and BMI affected the LUTS. Patients undergone a prostatectomy or radiation therapy showed more frequency of nocturia, BMI and PSA were also risk factors for nocturia. Moreover, patients’ age, BMI, and PSA affected uQoL. In such patients, we recommend close monitoring of patients’ specific characteristics such as TNM stage, BMI, and PSA for a better quality of life.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein counteracts BST2-mediated restriction of virus-like particle release",2019,"BST2/tetherin, an interferon-inducible antiviral factor, can block the cellular release of various enveloped viruses. We previously reported that human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) infection can alleviate the BST2 tethering of HIV-1 virions by downregulating cell surface BST2, suggesting that coronaviruses are capable of encoding anti-BST2 factors. Here we report our new finding that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein, similar to Vpu, is capable of antagonizing the BST2 tethering of SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HIV-1 virus-like particles via BST2 downregulation. However, unlike Vpu (which downmodulates BST2 by means of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways), BST2 downregulation is apparently mediated by SARS-CoV S through the lysosomal degradation pathway only. We found that SARS-CoV S colocalized with both BST2 and reduced cell surface BST2, suggesting an association between SARS-CoV S and BST2 that targets the lysosomal degradation pathway. According to one recent report, SARS-CoV ORF7a antagonizes BST2 by interfering with BST2 glycosylation1. Our data provide support for the proposal that SARS-CoV and other enveloped viruses are capable of evolving supplementary anti-BST2 factors in a manner that requires virus replication. Further experiments are required to determine whether the BST2-mediated restriction of authentic SARS-CoV virions is alleviated by the SARS-CoV spike protein. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bone marrow stromal antigen 2; BST2 protein; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein; unclassified drug; virus spike protein; Article; controlled study; dimerization; down regulation; Human coronavirus 229E; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; nonhuman; protein function; protein glycosylation; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; SARS coronavirus; virion; virus inhibition; virus like agent; virus release; virus replication"
"Hypoxia-induced H19/YB-1 cascade modulates cardiac remodeling after infarction",2019,"Rationale: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) has been identified as a pivotal novel regulators in cardiac development as well as cardiac pathogenesis. lncRNA H19 is known as a fetal gene but it is exclusively abundant in the heart and skeletal muscles in adulthood, and is evolutionarily conserved in humans and mice. It has been reported to possess a significant correlation with the risk of coronary artery diseases. However, the function of H19 is not well characterized in heart. Methods: Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mouse models with left anterior descending coronary artery-ligation surgery were utilized to evaluate the functionality of H19 in vivo. For mechanistic studies, hypoxia condition were exerted in in vitro models to mimic cardiac ischemic injury. Chromatin isolation by RNA immunoprecipitation (ChIRP) was performed to reveal the interacting protein of lncRNA H19. Results: lncRNA H19 was significantly upregulated in the infarct area post-surgery day 4 in mouse model. Ectopic expression of H19 in the mouse heart resulted in severe cardiac dilation and fibrosis. Several extracellular matrix (ECM) genes were significantly upregulated. While genetic ablation of H19 by CRISPR-Cas9 ameliorated post-MI cardiac remodeling with reduced expression in ECM genes. Through chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP), we identified Y-box-binding protein (YB)-1, a suppressor of Collagen 1A1, as an interacting protein of H19. Furthermore, H19 acted to antagonize YB-1 through direct interaction under hypoxia, which resulted in de-repression of Collagen 1A1 expression and cardiac fibrosis. Conclusions: Together these results demonstrate that lncRNA H19 and its interacting protein YB-1 are crucial for ECM regulation during cardiac remodeling. ?

"Risk and predictors of subsequent cancers of patients with newly-diagnosed atrial fibrillation — A nationwide population-based study",2019,"Aims: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) may be at higher risk for cancer, possibly due to the presence of coexisting risk factors. In this study, we investigate the magnitude and predictors of this potential risk within a population-based study. Methods and results: The study cohort included 332,555 AF patients aged ?20 years without past history of cancer. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used as a measure of relative risk, comparing observed cancer incidence among patients with AF with that expected based on cancer incidence in the Taiwanese population. During the observation period, 22,911 incident cancers occurred with an incidence of 1.65%/year. Compared with the general population, AF patients had a significantly higher cancer risk with a SIR of 1.37 (95%CI = 1.36–1.39). Patients with new-onset AF had an elevated cancer risk which was highest within 1 year (SIR = 2.30; 95%CI, 2.25–2.36) and persisted beyond 10 years after AF was diagnosed (SIR = 1.18; 95%CI, 1.11–1.25). Age ? 65 years, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver cirrhosis were significantly associated with development of cancers among AF patients. The hazard ratio of cancers increased from 1.40 (95%CI = 1.28–1.53) for patients having 1 risk factor to 5.14 (95%CI = 4.03–6.06) for patients with 6 risk factors, in comparison to those without any risk factors. Conclusion: In the nationwide cohort study, we show that AF patients had a higher risk of cancer. Age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, COPD and liver cirrhosis are important risk factors of cancer among AF patients.

"Relationship between fasting plasma glucose and incidence of diabetes in children and adolescents",2019,"Aim: To investigate the appropriate fasting plasma glucose threshold by which to define prediabetes in children and adolescents, based on its ability to predict incident paediatric diabetes. Methods: In a nationwide survey of diabetes and renal disease conducted between 1992 and 2000 in all school-aged children in Taiwan, those with abnormal results in repeated urine tests received further physical examination and blood tests. Students who had blood tests for at least two time points were selected for the present study (N = 12 119). The incidence of paediatric diabetes, adjusted hazard ratio and predictive power of fasting plasma glucose were analysed. Results: The incidence of paediatric diabetes increased with increasing fasting plasma glucose levels. Groups with fasting plasma glucose >5.6 mmol/l had a higher adjusted hazard ratio. The adjusted hazard ratio of incident diabetes for participants with higher fasting plasma glucose rose continuously when using a higher threshold for fasting plasma glucose. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for fasting plasma glucose was 0.628 for predicting paediatric diabetes. The association between fasting plasma glucose and incident paediatric diabetes and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were similar in boys and girls and were higher in the age group 12–18 years. According to receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal thresholds, sensitivity and specificity were 4.75 mmol/l, 65% and 51%, respectively, for those aged 6–11 years and 5.19 mmol/l, 60% and 73%, respectively, for those aged 12–18 years. Conclusion: Fasting plasma glucose is associated with the incidence of paediatric diabetes. The results of the present study can be used as reference data to suggest a cut-off value to define paediatric prediabetes. ? 2019 Diabetes UK","glucose; adolescent; adolescent disease; adult; Article; blood examination; blood sampling; child; childhood disease; diabetes mellitus; family history; fasting; follow up; glucose blood level; health survey; human; impaired glucose tolerance; incidence; kidney disease; major clinical study; physical examination; practice guideline; urinalysis; urine sampling"
"Association between asymmetric dimethylarginine and in-stent restenosis tissue characteristics assessed by optical coherence tomography",2019,"Background: Impaired bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO)and endothelial dysfunction may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of in-stent restenosis (ISR)after coronary stenting. We aimed to investigate the relation between asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous NO synthase inhibitor, and the ISR lesions tissue characteristics assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods and results: Forty-five patients with symptomatic ISR lesions (17 bare metal stents, 28 drug-eluting stents, medium implantation duration: 58.0 months)were evaluated by OCT for in-stent tissue characteristics and calcification. We defined neoatherosclerosis as the presence of lipid or calcified neointima in ISR lesions, and 12 (26.7%), 33 (73.3%)ISR lesions were classified as with homogenous neointima and neoatherosclerosis respectively. The patients with neoatherosclerosis have significantly higher plasma ADMA levels compared to those of patients with homogenous neointima (1.12 ± 0.21 μmol/l versus 0.83 ± 0.08 μmol/l, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the plasma ADMA level of ISR lesions with intra-stent calcification (n = 24, 53.3%)was also significantly higher than those of ISR lesions without (n = 21, 46.7%; p < 0.001). There was a highly significant association between plasma ADMA level and intra-stent relative calcium index (mean calcium arc × calcium length)/(360 × analyzed length)(p < 0.001, r = 0.702). In multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, eGFR, plasma ADMA level remained the only significant predictor for the presence of neoatherosclerosis (p = 0.008)and intra-stent calcification (p < 0.001). In contrast, plasma ADMA level correlated with intra-stent relative lipid core index (mean lipid core arc × lipid core length)/(360 × analyzed length)only in subgroup without intra-stent calcification (p = 0.004, r = 0.596, multivariate-adjusted p = 0.022). Conclusions: Increased plasma ADMA levels were associated with the development of in-stent neoatherosclerosis and calcification. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","n(g),n(g) dimethylarginine; adult; aged; amino acid blood level; Article; clinical article; controlled study; coronary angiography; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery calcification; coronary stenting; disease association; female; human; human tissue; in-stent restenosis; male; medical history; neointima; optical coherence tomography; priority journal; tissue characterization; treatment duration"
"High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation enhanced treadmill training effects on gait performance in individuals with chronic stroke: A double-blinded randomized controlled pilot trial",2019,"Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with treadmill training has been suggested to modulate corticomotor activity and improve gait performance in people with Parkinson's disease. Research question: It is unclear whether this combination therapy has a similar effect in people with stroke. The current study aimed to investigate whether high-frequency rTMS enhances the effects of subsequent treadmill training in individuals with chronic stroke. Methods: Fourteen participants meeting the selection criteria were randomly assigned to either the experimental (n = 8) or control (n = 6) group. The experimental group received 5 Hz rTMS prior to treadmill training three times per week for 3 weeks. The control group received sham rTMS before treadmill training. Walking speed, gait symmetry, corticomotor excitability, motor function of the lower extremities, and muscle activity during walking were measured before intervention, after intervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Results: The walking speed, spatial asymmetry of gait, and motor function of the lower extremities improved significantly in the experimental group, and these improvements exhibited significant differences in between-group comparisons. However, there was no significant difference in corticomotor excitability or brain asymmetry ratio after the intervention in each group. Significance: The current results revealed that applying 5 Hz high-frequency rTMS over the leg motor cortex in the affected hemisphere enhanced the effects of subsequent treadmill training on gait speed and spatial asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke. Improvement in gait speed persisted for at least 1 month in individuals with chronic stroke. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; brain asymmetry; cerebrovascular accident; chronic disease; clinical article; controlled study; corticomotor excitability; double blind procedure; electromyography; excitability; female; follow up; gait; hemisphere; human; lower limb; male; middle aged; motor control; motor performance; muscle contraction; pilot study; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; walking speed; aged; cerebrovascular accident; gait; kinesiotherapy; motor cortex; multimodality cancer therapy; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; stroke rehabilitation; transcranial magnetic stimulation; treatment outcome; Aged; Combined Modality Therapy; Double-Blind Method; Electromyography; Exercise Therapy; Female; Gait; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Cortex; Pilot Projects; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Treatment Outcome"
"Loneliness in young adulthood: Its intersecting forms and its association with psychological well-being and family characteristics in Northern Taiwan",2019,"Objectives Most researchers have examined forms of loneliness as discrete and emotional distress. The approach proposed in this study captures the reality that many persons experience more than one dimension of loneliness-varying degrees coupled with their psychological well-being in a family context. This study explores the latent structure of loneliness during young adulthood and its association with psychological well-being, as well as how these are related to their family characteristics in adolescence. Methods Data are from 2,748 young people, a cohort sample from the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP). Loneliness was assessed by a 6-item de Jong-Gierveld short scale with emotional and social loneliness domains. We describe the clustering between loneliness domains and psychological well-being, namely depressive symptoms, self-esteem, suicidal thoughts, and alcohol use using latent class cluster analysis. In addition to incorporating the Taiwanese family context, multivariate multinomial logistic regression models included data on family cohesion and parental guan (parental control) in adolescence. This might be associated with choices in partnership and childbearing, and influence loneliness in young adulthood. Results Our results demonstrate a three-cluster model of loneliness involving emotional loners, serious emotional loners, and severe emotional/social loners. We also found that a feeling of serious emotional loneliness and severe emotional/social loneliness were significantly associated with psychological well-being, even adjusting for individual characteristics. Among young adults who had a partner, the married adults were significantly less likely to feel serious emotional loneliness than those who were living alone. Furthermore, young adults with stronger family cohesion during early adolescence were less likely to suffer from serious emotional loneliness (Relative risk ratios [RRR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.91) and severe emotional/ social loneliness (RRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.85) in young adulthood. Discussion This measurement strategy provides a foundation for future research into how experts can address loneliness clusters in order to better understand psychological well-being during young adulthood and family context in adolescence. This is important because our results suggest that the various loneliness domains do not occur independently, but rather are embedded in patterns and are associated with family characteristics. ? 2019 Chiao et al.","adult; alcohol consumption; Article; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; depression; disease association; disease course; disease severity; emotionality; family attitude; family size; female; human; human experiment; loneliness; male; marriage; normal human; outcome assessment; parental behavior; pregnancy; psychological well-being; risk factor; self esteem; social behavior; suicidal ideation; Taiwan; young adult"
"Boosting treatment stabilization in patients of amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder",2019,"Background: To investigate boosting effects on treatment stabilization in the mandatory treatment modality for patients of amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder. Methods: This is a retrospective follow-up study over a period from January 2013 to December 2018. We analyzed 425 patients of amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder under mandating treatments. Treatment stabilization for a given patient was defined once 4 negative urinalysis had been observed. We developed a dynamic monitoring model of boosting effects informed by the available data, specifically the number of negative urine samples required to reach stabilization, the sum of urinalyses done at the time when the given number of negative urine samples had been observed and who the patient was. To represent the simulated population, a Monte Carlo method was used to generate p-values from 1000 experiments conducted on a computer. Results: In the observed samples, the probability of 4 negative results in urinalysis from 4 outpatient visits was 75.5%. In comparison, the probability for achieving 4th negative results in urinalysis over 4 visits from negative binominal distribution was 57.3%, and from the computer simulation, 49.8%. The observed samples had significantly higher probability of achieving 4 negative results in urinalysis over 4 outpatient visits (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The mandatory treatment modality boosted treatment stabilization for patients of amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder. The major benefit of using the monitoring model is the ability to monitor boosting effects of stabilization. Results supported the effectiveness of this mandatory treatment modality and can be implemented in deferred-prosecution based treatment modality. ? 2018","amphetamine; midomafetamine; adult; alcoholism; amphetamine dependence; Article; bipolar disorder; comparative study; computer simulation; female; follow up; group therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; men who have sex with men; Monte Carlo method; opiate addiction; outpatient department; patient counseling; priority journal; psychosis; retrospective study; therapy effect; urinalysis; urine sampling"
"Determinants for quality of life trajectory patterns in patients with type 2 diabetes",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of the study was to identify quality of life (QoL) trajectory patterns and the determinants in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methods: A longitudinal design was employed. Totally, 466 patients with T2DM recruited from five diabetic clinics in Taiwan were participants of this study. Demographic and disease characteristics, biomedical factors (HbA1c levels and body mass index), psychosocial factors (self-care behaviors, social support, resilience, diabetes distress), and QoL were collected at baseline. QoL was further measured every 6?months for four waves after baseline. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify QoL trajectory patterns. The multinomial logistic regression was further applied to explore the important determinants of different QoL trajectory patterns. Results: The “steadily poor” (n = 27, 5.8%), “consistently moderate” (n = 174, 37.3%), and “consistently good” (n = 265, 56.9%) trajectory patterns were identified. The HbA1c levels (OR 2.16) and diabetes distress (OR 1.18) were important for determining participants in the “steadily poor” QoL trajectory pattern. HbA1c levels (OR 1.25) and diabetes distress (OR 1.14) were important for determining participants in the “consistently moderate” QoL trajectory pattern. Conclusions: To prevent development of relatively worse QoL trajectory patterns in patients with T2DM in a timelier manner, healthcare providers could regularly assess the QoL and provide intervention, especially for those with high HbA1c levels and high diabetes distress. Meanwhile, early intervention for decreasing HbA1c levels and diabetes distress may improve the trajectory development of QoL in patients with T2DM. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","hemoglobin A1c; adult; Article; body mass; diabetes mellitus; distress syndrome; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; psychological resilience; quality of life; self care; social psychology; social support; Taiwan; longitudinal study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; psychology; quality of life; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life"
"Probiotic Therapy for Treating Behavioral and Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials",2019,"The therapeutic potentials of probiotics in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains controversial, with the only existing systematic review on this topic published in 2015. Results from new trials have become available in recent years. We therefore conducted an updated systematic review, to assess the efficacy of probiotics in relieving behavioral symptoms of ASD and gastrointestinal comorbidities. Our review includes two randomized controlled trials, which showed improvement of ASD behaviors, and three open trials, all which exhibited a trend of improvement. Four of these trials concluded from subjective measures that gastrointestinal function indices showed a trend of improvement with probiotic therapy. Additional rigorous trials are needed to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplements in ASD. ? 2019, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.","probiotic agent; autism; behavior; clinical trial (topic); drug effect; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal tract; human; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Behavioral Symptoms; Clinical Trials as Topic; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Probiotics"
"Genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis using set-based association tests",2019,"The identification of gene-environment interactions (G × E) may eventually guide health-related choices and medical interventions for complex diseases. More powerful methods must be developed to identify G × E. The “adaptive combination of Bayes factors method” (ADABF) has been proposed as a powerful genome-wide polygenic approach to detect G × E. In this work, we evaluate its performance when serving as a gene-based G × E test. We compare ADABF with six tests including the “Set-Based gene-EnviRonment InterAction test” (SBERIA), “gene-environment set association test” (GESAT), etc. With extensive simulations, SBERIA and ADABF are found to be more powerful than other G × E tests. However, SBERIA suffers from a power loss when 50% SNP main effects are in the same direction with the SNP × E interaction effects while 50% are in the opposite direction. We further applied these seven G × E methods to the Taiwan Biobank data to explore gene× alcohol interactions on blood pressure levels. The ADAMTS7P1 gene at chromosome 15q25.2 was detected to interact with alcohol consumption on diastolic blood pressure (p = 9.5 × 10?7, according to the GESAT test). At this gene, the P-values provided by other six tests all reached the suggestive significance level (p &lt; 5 × 10?5). Regarding the computation time required for a genome-wide G × E analysis, SBERIA is the fastest method, followed by ADABF. Considering the validity, power performance, robustness, and computation time, ADABF is recommended for genome-wide G × E analyses. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma: single center experience in an Asian population",2019,"Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTL) is a rare form of cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma. It is believed that SPTL in patients without hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) follows an indolent course; in contrast, SPTL in patients with HPS has been associated with unfavorable survival. To provide more clinical data on SPTL in Asian populations and to identify optimal therapeutic strategies for SPTL, we assessed the clinicopathological features and long-term follow-up data of 10 Taiwanese SPTL patients diagnosed at a single center. Our study demonstrates a group of patients with high incidence of HPS (50%), rather aggressive courses, and early progression. A total of eight patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), including one autologous HSCT and seven allogeneic HSCT. Seven of eight patients receiving HSCT achieved durable remission and maintained in remission for over 30?months (range 30–132?months). There was no difference in 3-year survival of patients with HPS (80%) compared with patients without HPS (80%). Of long-term survivors in the HPS group, three of four received HSCT (autologous HSCT, n = 1; allogeneic HSCT, n = 2). Our study indicated that HSCT is a curative option for eligible SPTL patients with HPS. ? 2018, Japanese Society of Hematology.","alpha interferon; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; doxorubicin; methotrexate; prednisolone; steroid; thymocyte antibody; vincristine; acute graft versus host disease; adolescent; adult; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; Asian; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; cancer chemotherapy; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cancer recurrence; cancer regression; child; chronic graft versus host disease; clinical article; fat necrosis; female; follow up; graft versus host reaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hemophagocytic syndrome; hepatosplenomegaly; histology; human; human tissue; immunosuppressive treatment; long term survival; lymphocytic infiltration; male; matched sibling donor; mismatched unrelated donor; overall survival; prophylaxis; respiratory failure; skin biopsy; skin defect; skin ulcer; splenomegaly; subcutaneous t cell lymphoma; survival rate; survival time; Asian continental ancestry group; complication; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hemophagocytic syndrome; middle aged; mortality; panniculitis; procedures; remission; survival analysis; T cell lymphoma; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic; Lymphoma, T-Cell; Male; Middle Aged; Panniculitis; Remission Induction; Survival Analysis"
"Coaggregation of major psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives of individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A nationwide population-based study",2019,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable mental illness that is easily passed from one generation to the next. Studies have shown that first-degree relatives (FDRs; ie, parents, offspring, and siblings) of individuals with ADHD had a higher risk of also having ADHD. However, the familial coaggregation of ADHD with other major psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM code 295), bipolar disorder (ICD-9-CM cods 296 except codes 296.2, 296.3, 296.9, and 296.82), major depressive disorder (ICD-9-CM codes 296.2 and 296.3), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD; ICD-9-CM code 299), remains unclear. Methods: Among the entire Taiwanese population in 2010, there were 220,966 parents of children with ADHD (ICD-9-CM code 314), 174,460 siblings of children with ADHD, and 5,875 children of parents with ADHD. Matched control individuals who did not have FDRs with ADHD (1:4) were selected based on age, sex, and their relation to family members. Results: FDRs (parents, offspring, siblings, and twins) of ADHD-diagnosed individuals had higher relative risks (95% CI) of major psychiatric disorders than the controls: 1.69 (1.60-1.79) for schizophrenia, 2.21 (2.10-2.32) for bipolar disorder, 2.08 (2.02-2.13) for major depressive disorder, 4.14 (3.90-4.39) for ASD, and 6.87 (6.73-7.01) for ADHD. Discussion: These results show that ADHD coaggregated with other major psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and ASD, within families. The results suggest that public health officials and psychiatrists should closely monitor and follow the mental health of FDRs of ADHD-diagnosed individuals, such as parents and siblings of children with ADHD. ?

"Somatic mutations of PREX2 gene in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Characterized with a high recurrence rate and low detection rate, prevention is the best approach to reduce mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The overexpression of Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate Dependent Rac Exchange Factor 2 (PREX2) is observed in various tumors, including HCC; and the frequent PREX2 mutations in melanoma are associated with invasiveness. We sought to identify somatic mutations and the functional changes in mutational signatures of PREX2. Genomic DNA sequencing was performed in 68 HCC samples with three types of hepatitis viral infection status: HBs Ag-positive, anti-HCV Ab-positive, and negative for any hepatitis B or C markers. Stabilities and interactions of proteins as well as cell proliferation and migration were evaluated. Fourteen non-silent point mutations in PREX2 were detected, with 16 of 68 HCC patients harboring at least one non-silent mutation. All mutant forms of PREX2, except for K400f, had an extended half-life compared with wild-type PREX2. Moreover, only the half-life of S1113R was twice that of the wild-type. PREX2 mutant-S1113R also promoted migration and activated the AKT pathway as well as impaired HectH9-mediated ubiquitination. Our study identified a gain-of-function mutation of PREX2 – S1113R in HCC. Such mutation enhanced PREX2 protein stability, promoted cell proliferation, and was associated with aggressiveness of HCC. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Patterns of parents’ perspectives on protecting young children from secondhand smoke exposure: A Q-methodology study [父母?于保?幼童免受二手?危害的??模式:Q方法?研究]",2019,"Aims: To identify and describe the various patterns of parents’ perspectives on avoiding secondhand smoke exposure. Design: Q methodology was applied to investigate the parental perspectives of 50 parents. Methods: The study was implemented from September–December 2016. Forty-two Q-statements were constructed based on the literature related to parental attitudes and prevention practices regarding preventing young children from experiencing secondhand smoke exposure. A series of Q-sorts was performed by the participants to rank the statements into a Q-sort grid. PQMethod 2.35 software was used to perform principal component analysis to identify different patterns of parents’ perspectives. Results: Five patterns of shared perspectives, which accounted for 62% of the total variance, were derived from the analysis: (a) lack of confidence to confront smokers in non-smoking areas; (b) awareness of health hazards but not ready to take preventive actions; (c) emphasis on parental responsibility and behavioural guidance; (d) awareness of health rights protected by legislation; and (e) strong willingness to take protective actions. Conclusion: Our findings revealed the shared perspectives of five groups of parents. The exploration of clusters of parents could assist healthcare professionals in acknowledging parents’ tendencies related to attitudes and responses towards secondhand smoke exposure. Impact: Using a forced distribution through the Q-sorting technique, the particular perspective patterns of parents’ experiences would be captured. These findings can serve as a useful guide for researchers and practitioners to develop tailored intervention programs for parents with the purpose of reducing secondhand smoke exposure in young children. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","article; awareness; child; health hazard; human; law; nursing care; parental attitude; passive smoking; personality test; physician; principal component analysis; responsibility; scientist; software"
"Persistence and adherence to rivastigmine in patients with dementia: Results from a noninterventional, retrospective study using the National Health Insurance research database of Taiwan",2019,"Introduction: The objective of the study was to assess adherence and persistence of patients treated with rivastigmine versus donepezil. Methods: Persistence was calculated as the time from the first prescription date of rivastigmine/donepezil until discontinuation/medication switch/end of available data, whichever occurred first. Adherence was calculated as proportion of days covered and medication possession ratio. Results: A majority of patients persisted on 4.5 and 6 mg of rivastigmine for 429 and 468 days, respectively, versus 443 and 441 days for patients receiving 5 and 10 mg of donepezil daily, respectively. Patients who initially received 1.5 mg of oral rivastigmine required a shorter time to reach a stable dose compared with those who initiated treatment at a higher dose of rivastigmine. Patients at a stable dose of 4.5 or 6 mg of rivastigmine were observed to persist longer than those at a lower dose of rivastigmine and donepezil. Discussion: Although results indicate significant difference in persistence between rivastigmine and donepezil groups, clinical significance remains undetermined. ? 2018 The Authors","donepezil; rivastigmine; adult; Article; comparative study; controlled study; dementia; drug dose increase; female; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; national health insurance; patient compliance; prescription; priority journal; retrospective study; Taiwan; treatment duration; treatment outcome"
"Physical activity and quality of life in patients with type II diabetes mellitus",2019,"Background: Type II diabetes, a major healthcare issue, is a common chronic disease in Taiwan that affects the quality of life of sufferers. Purpose: To understand the physical activity status and the quality of life of patients with type II diabetes mellitus and to explore the related predictors of quality of life. Methods: This cross-sectional study used convenience sampling to collect relevant data between January to October 2014 from a regional teaching hospital in Taipei. One hundred patients with type II diabetes were included as participants. The seven-day physical activity recall scale and the SF-36 were used to collect data. Result: (1) Forty-two percent of the participants had engaged in no habitual exercise during the prior seven days and had engaged primarily in mildly strenuous activities. (2) The quality of life of the participants was moderate. Patient age (r = ?.231, p <.05) and education level (r =.279, p <.01) were significantly correlated with the physical component of quality of life. A significant difference was found between levels of HbA1c and the physical (t = -2.595, p <.05) and mental (t = -2.522, p <.05) components of quality of life. (3) The number of hospitalizations attributable to diabetes (r = ?.256, p <.05) and diabetes with a comorbidity (t = 3.29, p =.042) were significantly associated with the physical component of quality of life. (4) Physical activity was significantly and negatively correlated with the mental component of quality of life (r = -.205, p <.05), but physical activity was not significantly correlated with the other components of quality of life (p >.05). (5) The number of hospitalizations due to diabetes was a significant predictor of quality of life, explaining 14.5% and 5.5% of the physical and mental components of quality of life, respectively. Conclusion: Good control of blood glucose was shown to promote quality of life in the type II diabetes mellitus patients in this study. The findings may be referenced and applied in clinical practice. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Ginkgolide A Prevents the Amyloid-β-Induced Depolarization of Cortical Neurons",2019,"Utilizing the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist as a strategy, memantine is the only agent available for clinically treating mild to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our aim was to develop novel similar herb-based drugs. Using a screening platform, ginkgolide A (GA), a pure compound extracted from Ginkgo biloba, was found to attenuate amyloid β (Aβ)-induced abnormal depolarization in mouse primary cortical neurons. Using receptor agonists, it was determined that GA inhibits both NMDA receptors and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors. Furthermore, the Aβ-induced increase in c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation in neurons was prevented by GA. Body weight, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, liver histology, and kidney histology were similar when the wild-type/AD animal model mice with and without GA treatment were compared. This pure compound improves the memory of wild-type mice. Our findings indicate that GA has great potential clinically for the treatment of AD because it might target NMDA receptors just like memantine. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","Depolarization; Diagnosis; Glycoproteins; Histology; Mammals; Neurons; Alzheimer's disease; Ginkgolide A; Glutamate receptor; Herbal medicines; Memantine; Neurodegenerative diseases; amyloid beta protein; Ginkgo biloba extract; ginkgolide; ginkgolide A; lactone; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; neuroprotective agent; plant extract; Alzheimer disease; animal; brain cortex; C57BL mouse; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; genetics; Ginkgo biloba; human; male; metabolism; mouse; nerve cell; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Cerebral Cortex; Ginkgo biloba; Ginkgolides; Humans; Lactones; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neurons; Neuroprotective Agents; Plant Extracts; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate"
"Janus kinase-1 and 3 in ankylosing spondylitis",2019,"Background/purpose: To investigate the Janus kinase-1 and 3 (JAK-1 and 3) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods: The levels of JAK-1 and JAK-3 mRNA in PBMCs, CD3 + T cells and CD14 + monocytes were measured by RT-PCR in 52 AS patients and 31 healthy controls (HCs). The demographic features, BASDAI, BASFI, HLA-B27, ESR, CRP and serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) level were recorded and correlated with the JAK-1 &amp; JAK-3 transcripts in patients and HCs as appropriate. Results: JAK-1 and JAK-3 expression in PB CD3 + T cells plus CD14 + monocytes was significantly higher in AS patients than in HCs (p &lt; 0.05). There is a positive correlation between JAK-1 expression in CD3 + T cells plus CD14 + monocytes and ESR, CRP, IgA, HLA-B27, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis and uveitis (all p &lt; 0.05), respectively. JAK-1 transcript was also increased in CD14 + monocytes from patients and correlated well with ESR and CRP as the disease deteriorated. Conversely, JAK-1 was negatively correlated to chest expansion. Area under the curve of standard receiver operating characteristic suggested that JAK-1 transcript in CD3 + T cells plus CD14 + monocytes is better to predict the higher BASDAI (&gt;4) and BASFI (&gt;4) than ESR or CRP in AS patients. Conclusion: In AS, JAK-1 expression in PB cells rather than ESR or CRP might be regarded as a bio-marker for monitoring disease activity and functional index in AS. These findings have also suggested that JAK-1 and JAK-3 expression may play a role in the inflammatory processes in patients with AS. ? 2018","C reactive protein; HLA B27 antigen; immunoglobulin A; Janus kinase 1; Janus kinase 3; biological marker; C reactive protein; JAK1 protein, human; JAK3 protein, human; Janus kinase 1; Janus kinase 3; adult; ankylosing spondylitis; Article; Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index; Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index; CD3+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; disease activity; disease duration; enthesitis; female; gene expression; human; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; male; monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; prediction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; uveitis; ankylosing spondylitis; case control study; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; mononuclear cell; receiver operating characteristic; severity of illness index; Taiwan; Adult; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Janus Kinase 1; Janus Kinase 3; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Male; Middle Aged; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Spondylitis, Ankylosing; Taiwan"
"The perceived neighborhood environment is associated with health-enhancing physical activity among adults: A cross-sectional survey of 13 townships in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Many environmental factors have been associated with physical activity. The environment is considered a key factor in terms of the rate of engagement in physical activity. This study examined the perceived effect of environmental factors on different levels of health-enhancing physical activity among Taiwanese adults. Methods: Data were collected from 549 adults aged at least 18 years from the northern, central, southern and eastern regions of Taiwan. Physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) showcard version, and participants were divided into three categories: those who performed low-, moderate-, or high-levels of physical activity, as suggested by the IPAQ scoring protocol. The perceived neighborhood environment in relation to physical activity was adapted from the Physical Activity Neighborhood Environment Scale. A multinomial logistic regression was conducted to ascertain associations between individual perceptions of the neighborhood environment and different physical activity levels. Results: Respondents who perceived their neighborhood environment as having easy access to services and stores, and higher traffic safety were more likely to be moderate level of physical activity (odds ratio [OR]: 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-3.37; OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.12-2.80). The perception of having easy access to services and stores and seeing many physically active people in the neighborhood were both positively associated with a high level of physical activity (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.01-5.01; OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.11-5.23). Conclusions: Different perceived neighborhood environmental factors were associated with moderate and high levels of physical activity, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of an activity-friendly neighborhood environment to stimulate engagement in physical activity among adults in Taiwan. Therefore, policies and programs should focus on improving friendliness and diversity in neighborhoods to facilitate individuals' transitions from inactive to active lifestyles. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; article; built environment; controlled study; environmental factor; female; human; human experiment; international physical activity questionnaire; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; perception; Taiwanese; traffic safety; adolescent; aged; analysis of variance; cross-sectional study; demography; environmental planning; exercise; middle aged; questionnaire; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environment Design; Exercise; Female; Humans; Life Style; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Residence Characteristics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"
"Efficiency and performance tests of the sorptive building materials that reduce indoor formaldehyde concentrations",2019,"The adsorption of volatile organic compounds by building materials reduces the pollutant concentrations in indoor air. We collected three interior building materials with adsorption potentials—latex paint, micro-carbonized plywood, and moisture-buffering siding—used the sorptive building materials test (SBMT) to determine how much they reduced indoor formaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations, and then assessed the consequent reduction in human cancer risk from HCHO inhalation. Adsorption of HCHO by building materials significantly improved the effective ventilation efficiency. For example, the equivalent ventilation rate for Celite siding—used for humidity control—was 1.44 m 3 /(m 2 h) at 25C, 50% relative humidity (RH); the loading factor (L) was 0.4 m 2 /m 3 , and the HCHO concentration was 0.2 ppm; this effect is equivalent to a higher ventilation rate of approximately 0.6 air changes per hour in a typical Taiwanese dwelling. There was also a substantial reduction of risk in Case MCP-2 (C in,te : 245 μg/m 3 , 30C, 50% RH): males: down 5.73 × 10 ?4 ; females: down 4.84 × 10 ?4 ). The selection of adsorptive building materials for interior surfaces, therefore, significantly reduces human inhalation of HCHO. Our findings should encourage developing and using innovative building materials that help improve indoor air quality and thus provide building occupants with healthier working and living environments. ? 2019 Huang et al.

"Carotid flow velocities and blood pressures are independently associated with cognitive function",2019,"BACKGROUND Few studies simultaneously addressed associations between carotid flow velocities, blood pressure (BP), and cognitive function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subject without dementia (N = 1,684) underwent measurements of BP and biochemical markers. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and comprehensive neuropsychological tests were used to evaluate cognitive function. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) were measured in common and internal carotid artery. Subjects with MMSE score of .24 (25th percentile) was defined as low MMSE. Multivariable linear and logistic regression were used to evaluate the relationship of cognitive function with carotid flow velocities and BP. RESULTS Carotid flow velocities (PSV: Standardized β = 0.067, P = 0.0009; and EDV: Standardized β = 0.067, P = 0.0021) and systolic blood pressure (standardized β = .0.061, P = 0.005) were positively and negatively associated with MMSE, respectively, in the model with adjustments for age, sex, educational attainment, nutritional status, and smoking. Similar trends were noted for the associations between flow velocities and different neuropsychological tests. By multivariable logistic regression, the group with the lowest quartile (<25th percentile) of flow velocities had increased probability of low MMSE (odds ratio: 1.538; 95% confidence intervals: 1.142 to 2.071, P = 0.0046 for PSV; and odds ratio: 1.699; 95% confidence intervals: 1.233 to 2.341; P = 0.0012 for EDV), compared to those with the highest quartile (?75th) flow velocities. CONCLUSION Both low carotid flow velocity and high BP were independently and comparably associated with cognitive dysfunction. ? 2018 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

"Statin reduces the risk of dementia in diabetic patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer",2019,"Background: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been reported to increase the risk of dementia. Statin use decreases the risk of dementia. This study is aimed to investigate the association of statin use and dementia in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients receiving ADT. Methods: Using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, we conducted a population-based nationwide cohort study of T2DM patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) between 1998 and 2013. To test statin effects on dementia in T2DM patients receiving ADT, cox proportional hazards models with 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis were used. We divided the study subjects into a statin group and a statin-naive group. The primary outcome was dementia. Results: Of the 9855 selected T2DM patients newly diagnosed with PCa between 1998 and 2013, 5427 patients received ADT for their PCa. After propensity score matching, 1006 statin users and 1006 non-statin users were included in the study cohort, with a mean follow-up period of 3.5 years for the statin group. Among those patients, 179 (8.7%) were newly diagnosed with dementia. A propensity score-matched analysis (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% confidence interval = 0.52–0.94) demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of subsequent dementia in the statin users with an absolute risk reduction by 1%. A significant decrease in the risk of dementia with increasing statin duration was also demonstrated (P for trend = 0.002). Conclusions: Statin use in T2DM patients receiving ADT for PCa had decreased risk of dementia, with statin adherence and intensity augmenting this benefit. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","buserelin; goserelin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; leuprorelin; triptorelin; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; dementia; drug effect; drug use; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient compliance; priority journal; prostate cancer; risk factor; risk reduction; Taiwan; treatment duration; treatment outcome"
"Outcomes of necrotic immature open-apex central incisors treated by MTA apexification using poly(ε-caprolactone) fiber mesh as an apical barrier",2019,"Background/purpose: Although unset mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has some cytotoxicity, MTA is still a biocompatible material suitable for doing apexification. This study assessed the outcomes for 8 necrotic immature open-apex permanent maxillary central incisors treated by MTA apexification using poly(ε-caprolactone) fiber mesh (PCL-FM) as an apical barrier (so-called PCL-FM/MTA apexification) to prevent extrusion of MTA materials into the periapical tissues of open-apex teeth. Methods: Eight necrotic immature open-apex permanent maxillary central incisors with the open apices measuring 2.5 mm–3.5 mm in diameter in 8 patients (6 boys and 2 girls; age range, 8–10 years) were first cleaned using ultrasonic activated irrigation with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution and then treated by PCL-FM/MTA apexification procedure. Results: All the 8 permanent maxillary central incisors showed successful outcomes after PCL-FM/MTA apexification procedure. The mean duration for apical hard tissue barrier formation of the 8 incisors was 6.8 ± 0.5 weeks (range 6–7 weeks). The mean increased root length was 1.8 ± 0.7 mm (range 1–3 mm) at 7 weeks and 3.1 ± 0.6 mm (range 2–4 mm) at 3 months. The mean increased dentinal wall thickness at the most apical portion of the root was 1.3 ± 0.5 mm (range 1–2 mm) at 7 weeks and 2.4 ± 0.6 mm (range 1.5–3 mm) at 3 months. None of the teeth treated by PCL-FM/MTA apexification showed tooth discoloration after a follow-up period of 3 months. Conclusion: PCL-FM/MTA apexification is an excellent technique for treatment of necrotic immature open-apex permanent maxillary central incisors. ? 2018","hypochlorite sodium; mineral; mineral trioxide aggregate; polycaprolactone; root canal filling material; unclassified drug; aluminum derivative; calcium derivative; mineral trioxide aggregate; oxide; polycaprolactone; polyester; root canal filling material; silicate; apexification; Article; cementoenamel junction; child; clinical article; female; follow up; human; immature open apex permanent maxillary central incisor; male; maxillary central incisor; outcome assessment; periapical tissue; prospective study; school child; Taiwan; tooth discoloration; tooth root canal; drug combination; incisor; procedures; root canal preparation; tooth pulp disease; treatment outcome; Aluminum Compounds; Apexification; Calcium Compounds; Child; Dental Pulp Necrosis; Drug Combinations; Female; Humans; Incisor; Male; Oxides; Polyesters; Root Canal Filling Materials; Root Canal Preparation; Silicates; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"The RNA Processing Factor Y14 Participates in DNA Damage Response and Repair",2019,"Biological Sciences; Molecular Biology; Cell Biology ? 2019 The Author(s)DNA repair deficiency leads to genome instability and hence human disease. Depletion of the RNA processing factor Y14/RBM8A in cultured cells or Rbm8a haplodeficiency in the developing mouse cortex results in the accumulation of DNA damage. Y14 depletion differentially affected the expression of DNA damage response (DDR)factors and induced R-loops, both of which threaten genomic stability. Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry revealed DDR factors as potential Y14-interacting partners. Further results confirmed that Y14 interacts with Ku and several DDR factors in an ATM-dependent manner. Y14 co-fractionated with Ku in chromatin-enriched fractions and further accumulated on chromatin upon DNA damage. Y14 knockdown delayed recruitment of DDR factors to DNA damage sites and formation of γH2AX foci and also led to Ku retention on chromatin. Accordingly, Y14 depletion compromised the efficiency of DNA end joining. Therefore Y14 likely plays a direct role in DNA damage repair via its interaction with DDR factors. ? 2019 The Author(s)",""
"A nanodroplet cell processing platform facilitating drug synergy evaluations for anti-cancer treatments",2019,"Therapeutic drug synergism intervened in cancer treatments has been demonstrated to be more effective than using a single effector. However, it remains inherently challenging, with a limited cell count from tumor samples, to achieve potent personalized drug cocktails. To address the issue above, we herein present a nanodroplet cell processing platform. The platform incorporates an automatic nanodroplet dispenser with cell array ParaStamp chips, which were fabricated by a new wax stamping approach derived from laser direct writing. Such approach enables not only the on-demand de-wetting with hydrophobic wax films on substrates but also the mask-less fabrication of non-planar microstructures (i.e. no photolithography process). The ParaStamp chip was pre-occupied with anti-cancer drugs and their associate mixtures, enabling for the spatially addressable screening of optimal drug combinations simultaneously. Each droplet with a critical volume of 200 nl containing with 100 cells was utilized. Results revealed that the optimal combination reduces approximate 28-folds of conducted doses compared with single drugs. Tumor inhibition with the optimally selected drug combination was further confirmed by using PC-3 tumor-bearing mouse models. Together, the nanodroplet cell processing platform could therefore offer new opportunities to power the personalized cancer medicine at early-stage drug screening and discovery. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

"Incidence of hospitalization for infection among patients with hepatitis B or C virus infection without cirrhosis in Taiwan: A cohort study",2019,"Background: Infection is a major complication in liver cirrhosis and causes major morbidity and mortality. However, the incidence and mortality related to these conditions in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are unclear, as is whether antiviral therapy could change their infection risk. Methods and findings: In this community-based cohort study, a total of 115,336 adults (mean age 52.2 years; 35.6% men) without cirrhosis participating in the New Taipei City Health Screening in 2005-2008 were classified as having noncirrhotic HCV (NC-HCV) (n = 2,839), noncirrhotic hepatitis B virus (NC-HBV) (n = 8,316), or no HBV or HCV infection (NBNC) (n = 104,181). Participants were followed to their first hospitalization for infection or death after data linkage with the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and Death Registry. A Cox proportional hazard regression model, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, education level, diabetes, renal function, systemic steroids, and history of hospitalization, was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall and individual sites of infection and infection-related mortality. The reference group was NBNC participants with normal to mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (<1.5 times upper normal limit [UNL]) levels. To further address the impact of antiviral treatment on infection risk, we conducted analyses of data from the nationwide NHIRD and compared the risks for hospitalization because of infections and infection-related deaths between patients with HCV who received antiviral therapy (n = 20,264) and those who remained untreated (n = 104,360). During a median 8.2-year followup, the incidence of hospitalization for infection was substantially higher in NC-HCV patients. Compared to the reference group, NC-HCV was associated with a significantly higher risk for hospitalization because of overall infections (adjusted HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.12-1.33), but we observed no increased risk for patients in the NC-HBV (adjusted HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88-1.01) or NBNC group with moderate to markedly elevated ALT levels (adjusted HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.93-1.14). For specific sites of infection, the NC-HCV group had increased risks for septicemia and lower respiratory tract, reproductive, and urinary tract infections. We noted no increased risk for infection-related death among patients with NC-HCV. Patients with HCV who received antiviral therapy had significantly reduced infection-related hospitalization and death risks (adjusted HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.73-0.84 for infection-related hospitalization and adjusted HR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04-0.16 for infection-related deaths). Study limitations include the exclusion of patients with cirrhosis from the cohort, the possibility of unmeasured confounding, and the lack of information on direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). Conclusions: In this study, patients with NC-HCV were at increased risk for hospitalization for infection, while no increased risk was observed for NC-HBV-infected patients.

"Establishing liposome-immobilized dexamethasone-releasing PDMS membrane for the cultivation of retinal pigment epithelial cells and suppression of neovascularization",2019,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the eye disease with the highest epidemic incidence, and has great impact on the aged population. Wet-type AMD commonly has the feature of neovascularization, which destroys the normal retinal structure and visual function. So far, effective therapy options for rescuing visual function in advanced AMD patients are highly limited, especially in wet-type AMD, in which the retinal pigmented epithelium and Bruch’s membrane structure (RPE-BM) are destroyed by abnormal angiogenesis. Anti-VEGF treatment is an effective remedy for the latter type of AMD; however, it is not a curative therapy. Therefore, reconstruction of the complex structure of RPE-BM and controlled release of angiogenesis inhibitors are strongly required for sustained therapy. The major purpose of this study was to develop a dual function biomimetic material, which could mimic the RPE-BM structure and ensure slow release of angiogenesis inhibitor as a novel therapeutic strategy for wet AMD. We herein utilized plasma-modified polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheet to create a biomimetic scaffold mimicking subretinal BM. This dual-surface biomimetic scaffold was coated with laminin and dexamethasone-loaded liposomes. The top surface of PDMS was covalently grafted with laminin and used for cultivation of the retinal pigment epithelial cells differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-RPE). To reach the objective of inhibiting angiogenesis required for treatment of wet AMD, the bottom surface of modified PDMS membrane was further loaded with dexamethasone-containing liposomes via biotin-streptavidin linkage. We demonstrated that hiPSC-RPE cells could proliferate, express normal RPE-specific genes and maintain their phenotype on laminin-coated PDMS membrane, including phagocytosis ability, and secretion of anti-angiogenesis factor PEDF. By using in vitro HUVEC angiogenesis assay, we showed that application of our membrane could suppress oxidative stress-induced angiogenesis, which was manifested in decreased secretion of VEGF by RPE cells and suppression of vascularization. In conclusion, we propose modified biomimetic material for dual delivery of RPE cells and liposome-enveloped dexamethasone, which can be potentially applied for AMD therapy. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Membrane protein-regulated networks across human cancers",2019,"Alterations in membrane proteins (MPs) and their regulated pathways have been established as cancer hallmarks and extensively targeted in clinical applications. However, the analysis of MP-interacting proteins and downstream pathways across human malignancies remains challenging. Here, we present a systematically integrated method to generate a resource of cancer membrane protein-regulated networks (CaMPNets), containing 63,746 high-confidence protein–protein interactions (PPIs) for 1962 MPs, using expression profiles from 5922 tumors with overall survival outcomes across 15 human cancers. Comprehensive analysis of CaMPNets links MP partner communities and regulated pathways to provide MP-based gene sets for identifying prognostic biomarkers and druggable targets. For example, we identify CHRNA9 with 12 PPIs (e.g., ERBB2) can be a therapeutic target and find its anti-metastasis agent, bupropion, for treatment in nicotine-induced breast cancer. This resource is a study to systematically integrate MP interactions, genomics, and clinical outcomes for helping illuminate cancer-wide atlas and prognostic landscapes in tumor homo/heterogeneity. ? 2019, The Author(s).","amfebutamone; biological marker; lactic acid; membrane protein; amfebutamone; antineoplastic agent; CHRNA9 protein, human; nicotinic receptor; nicotinic receptor blocking agent; tumor marker; cancer; gene expression; genetic analysis; membrane; protein; signaling; tumor; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bioinformatics; bioluminescence; breast cancer; carcinogenesis; cell cycle regulation; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; electroporation; female; fluorescence microscopy; gene editing; gene expression; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; luciferase assay; lung metastasis; microarray analysis; mouse; neoplasm; nonhuman; overall survival; protein analysis; protein protein interaction; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; scoring system; sequence alignment; squamous cell lung carcinoma; transient transfection; tumor growth; tumor invasion; Western blotting; animal; drug effect; drug screening; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; information processing; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; mortality; neoplasm; procedures; prognosis; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers, Tumor; Bupropion; Cell Line, Tumor; Datasets as Topic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Mice; Neoplasms; Nicotinic Antagonists; Prognosis; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Receptors, Nicotinic; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Prognostic factors related to intratumoral hemorrhage in pediatric intracranial germ cell tumors",2019,"BACKGROUND: Certain types of pediatric intracranial germ cell tumors (PIGCTs) are prone to intratumoral hemorrhaging (TH) and associated with poor survival outcome. However, the impact of TH on the functional prognosis of patients with PIGCTs has not been well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and MR findings in PIGCT patients with TH to identify the factors related to patient survival and functional outcome. METHODS: This study included 17 patients diagnosed with PIGCT and TH between 2002 and 2016 and evaluated TH-associated clinical and MR findings. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) was used to evaluate functional outcome, which was poor when mRS ≧ 3. The volumes of hematomas and tumors were manually tracked within each brain magnetic resonance imaging slice. RESULTS: Among the 17 patients, 6 (35.3%) died and 9 (52.9%) had poor functional outcome. Regarding the functional outcome, the mean hematoma volume to tumor volume ratio (HTVR) was 8.5 ± 3.9% in the favorable outcome group and 42.3 ± 27.8% in the poor outcome group (p = 0.001). For the survival outcome, the mean HTVR was 15.7 ± 16.1% in the living group and 46.0 ± 31.5% in the deceased group (p = 0.016). The cutoff point of the receiver operating characteristics curve for HTVR to predict death and poor functional outcome was 19.27% and 16.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that patients with larger HTVR had significantly worse functional and survival outcomes than those with smaller HTVR. We suggest that early and aggressive treatment for PIGCTs in patients with large HTVR can improve their long-term prognosis.","adolescent; brain hemorrhage; brain tumor; child; complication; diagnostic imaging; female; hematoma; human; male; mortality; neoplasm; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; preschool child; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; tumor volume; young adult; Adolescent; Brain Neoplasms; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hematoma; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Prognosis; ROC Curve; Tumor Burden; Young Adult"
"hnRNPK S379 phosphorylation participates in migration regulation of triple negative MDA-MB-231 cells",2019,"We have previously identified a novel Aurora-A-mediated Serine 379 (S379) phosphorylation of a poly(C)-binding protein, hnRNPK, the overexpression of which is frequently observed in various cancers. It is known that the oncogenic Aurora-A kinase promotes the malignancy of cancer cells. This study aims to investigate the unexplored functions of hnRNPK S379 phosphorylation using MDA-MB-231 cells, a triple negative breast cancer cell that has amplification of the Aurora-A kinase gene. Accordingly, we established two cell lines in which the endogenous hnRNPK was replaced with either S379D or S379A hnRNPK respectively. Notably, we found that a phosphorylation-mimic S379D mutant of hnRNPK suppressed cell migration and, conversely, a phosphorylation-defective S379A mutant promoted migration. Moreover, Twist was downregulated upon hnRNPK S379 phosphorylation, whereas β-catenin and MMP12 were increased when there was loss of hnRNPK S379 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, S379A hnRNPK increases stability of β-catenin in MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that hnRNPK S379 phosphorylation regulates migration via the EMT signaling pathway. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Plasma haptoglobin level can augment NT-proBNP to predict poor outcome in patients with severe acute decompensated heart failure",2019,"To evaluate the use of plasma haptoglobin (Hp) levels and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in predicting survival in patients with severe acute decompensated heart failure (AHF). Management of AHF is challenging. Identifying markers associated with patient prognosis in this disease is clinically important. In this prospective observational study, plasma Hp and NT-proBNP levels were measured. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify cut-offs of Hp and NT-proBNP with the greatest specificity and sensitivity for predicting overall survival and cardiovascular-related survival. The cut-off values were tested in patients with AHF (n=41). The cut-off value with the greatest specificity and sensitivity with respect to overall survival and for cardiovascular-related survival for Hp was 177. 1 ng/mL for both outcomes and for NT-proBNP was 34 246.0 pg/mL and 11 848.5 ng/mL, respectively. Using these cut-off values, this study found that patients with lower baseline Hp levels (<177. 1 ng/mL) or higher baseline NT-proBNP (?34 246 pg/mL) were more likely to have shorter overall survival. Similarly, patients with <177. 1 ng/mL of Hp and ?11 848.5 pg/mL of NT-proBNP had the highest risk of death related to cardiovascular disease. Our findings indicate that Hp and NT-proBNP using specific cut-off values for AHF can be used to determine risk of survival in these patients. ?

We review work done in cooperation with colleagues worldwide to illustrate how a chronobiological approach led to the mapping of spontaneous circadian and other rhythms for the derivation of refined reference values and to the assessment of response rhythms underlying chronotherapy. BIOCOS members work in different fields, spanning from cardiology and nutrition to obesity, diabetes, exercise physiology and rehabilitation, but all strive for “pre-habilitation”. The early recognition of increased risk can prompt the timely institution of prophylactic intervention. As technology continues to improve, studies on groups are complemented by longitudinal self-surveillance for health maintenance. Longitudinal records serve for the investigation of environmental influences on human physiology, the topic of chronomics. As current advances in technology and wireless communication will likely impact the future of healthcare, chronobiological methods and concepts should be an integral part of this seachange. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biochronology; blood; cardiology; detection method; diabatic process; measurement method; nutrition; obesity; physiology; pressure effect; technological development; Article; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure monitoring; chronobiology; chronotherapy; human; nonhuman; reference value; self examination"
"A bibliometric analysis of acupuncture research in Taiwan from 1988 to 2017",2019,"Background: Since Taiwan’s national health insurance system provides residents with easy and affordable access to clinical acupuncture treatment, this study sought to analyze trends in the publication of acupuncture-related research in Taiwan from 1988 to 2017, using a bibliometric method. Methods: Data on the scholarly literature from 1988 to 2017 were retrieved through Web of Science searches for the keywords acupunct*, acupoint*, electroacupunct*, electro-acupunct*, acupre*, auricular acupunc*, and auricular needle* in study titles. Results: A total of 539 acupuncture-related articles published from 1988 to 2017 were identified and analyzed. The articles had an h-index of 38 and were cited in subsequent studies 7250 times, meaning that Taiwan ranked sixth in the production of such publications among countries/regions globally. Among those articles, 99 (18.4%) had no subsequent citations, six (1.1%) were highly cited (over 100 citations), and 141 (26.1%) were cited 4 to 10 times. The highly cited articles discussed the possible pathways of acupuncture stimulation and efficacy, and received 1103 (15.2%) of the citations. Conclusion: The China Medical University in Taichung, Taiwan, was the most active educational institution in Taiwan in terms of acupuncture-related research. Professor Lin Jaung-Geng was the leading acupuncture-related researcher, having the most publications, citations, and the highest h-index value. These results provided a context for analyzing the strengths of the existing research and informing prospective strategies for further studies.

"Smoking, but not alcohol, is associated with risk of psoriasis in a Taiwanese population-based cohort study",2019,"Background: Alcohol consumption and smoking have long been suspected of increasing the risk of developing psoriasis. Most evidence to date has derived from cross-sectional or case-control studies. Objective: We sought to investigate the effects of alcohol and smoking on incident psoriasis. Methods: Alcohol consumption, smoking status, and other covariates were collected from four rounds (2001, 2005, 2009, and 2013) of the Taiwan National Health Interview Survey. Incident psoriasis was identified from the National Health Insurance database. Cox regression model was used for the analysis. Results: Of 60,136 subjects, 242 (0.40%) developed psoriasis. After controlling for demographics and comorbidities, alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with psoriasis risk. Conversely, psoriasis risk was higher for current smokers than never smokers (adjusted hazard ratio 1.47 [95% confidence interval 1.04-2.07]). The risks were higher among subjects who smoked >25 cigarettes per day and for >20 pack-years. In subgroup analysis, current smoking was significantly associated with risk of psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis but not psoriatic arthritis alone. Limitations: Alcohol consumption was not assessed based on the number of drinks consumed. Conclusion: Current smoking increased the risk of psoriasis, particularly augmented for individuals who smoked >25 cigarettes per day and for >20 pack-years, while alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with psoriasis development. ? 2018 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.","adult; age; alcohol consumption; Article; chronic liver disease; cohort analysis; connective tissue disease; ex-smoker; female; human; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; obesity; population research; priority journal; psoriasis; psoriatic arthritis; sex difference; smoking; Taiwan; Taiwanese; aged; cigarette smoking; drinking behavior; health survey; incidence; middle aged; proportional hazards model; psoriasis; psoriatic arthritis; young adult; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Cigarette Smoking; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Psoriasis; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Development of Alzheimer disease in old major depressive patients based upon their health status: A retrospective study in Taiwan",2019,"This study is conducted to investigate the association between major depressive disorder and the subsequent development of Alzheimer disease (AD) in elderly patients with different health statuses using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).A retrospective cohort study was performed on subjects over 65 years old from 2002 to 2006 using a random sampling from the 1 million beneficiaries enrolled in the NHI. Patients who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder were selected as the case group. Subjects in the control group were selected from elderly patients who did not have depression during the study period by matching age, sex, and index date of depression with subjects in the case group using a ratio of 1:4 (case:control). Both groups of patients were checked annually over a period of 7 years to observe whether they subsequently developed AD.A total of 1776 subjects were included in the case group while 7104 subjects were in the control group. After the follow-up period, 59 patients (3.3%) with depression developed AD while 96 patients (1.4%) without depression developed AD. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the incidence rate of AD in both groups varied significantly depending on different health statuses (log-rank P?<?.001). Results of the generalized estimating equation model found that patients with depression (hazard ratio [HR]?=?1.898; 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?1.451-2.438), very severe health status (HR?=?1.630; 95% CI?=?1.220-2.177), or artery diseases (HR?=?1.692; 95% CI?=?1.108-2.584) were at a higher risk of developing AD than other groups.The association between major depressive disorder and the later development of AD varied depending on the health statuses of elderly patients. Clinicians should exercise caution when diagnosing and treating underlying diseases in elderly depressed patients, and then attempt to improve their health status to reduce the incidence rate of subsequent AD development.","age; aged; Alzheimer disease; cardiovascular disease; female; health status; human; incidence; Kaplan Meier method; major depression; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; onset age; public health; retrospective study; risk factor; severity of illness index; sex factor; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; very elderly; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Cardiovascular Diseases; Depressive Disorder, Major; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Health Status; Humans; Incidence; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; National Health Programs; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Taiwan"
"Virtual reality among the elderly: A usefulness and acceptance study from Taiwan",2019,"Background: Virtual reality (VR) has several applications in the medical domain and also generates a secure environment to carry out activities. Evaluation of the effectiveness of VR among older populations revealed positive effects of VR as a tool to reduce risks of falls and also improve the social and emotional well-being of older adults. The decline in physical and mental health, the loss of functional capabilities, and a weakening of social ties represent obstacles towards active aging among older adults and indicate a need for support. Existing research focused on the effects of VR among older populations, and its uses and benefits. Our study investigated the acceptance and use of VR by the elderly. Methods: This pilot study was conducted on 30 older adults who voluntarily participated during March to May 2018. Nine VR applications that promote physical activities, motivate users, and provide entertainment were chosen for this study. Participants were asked to use any one of the applications of their choice for 15 min twice a week for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model and a literature review, to evaluate their acceptance of VR technology. Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis was used to test the internal consistency of the questionnaire items. Pearson's product moment correlation was used to examine the validity of the questionnaire. A linear regression and mediation analysis were utilized to identify relationships among the variables of the questionnaire. Results: In total, six male and 24 female participants aged 60~95 years volunteered to participate in the study. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social norms, and perceived enjoyment were seen to have had significant effects on the intention to use VR. Participants agreed to a large extent regarding the perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and their experience of using VR. Thus, VR was seen to have high acceptance among this elderly population. Conclusions: Older people have positive perceptions towards accepting and using VR to support active aging. They perceived VR to be useful, easy to use, and an enjoyable experience, implying positive attitudes toward adopting this new technology. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; article; clinical article; Cronbach alpha coefficient; female; healthy aging; human; human experiment; internal consistency; linear regression analysis; male; middle aged; perception; physical activity; pilot study; questionnaire; social norm; Taiwan; validity; virtual reality"
"B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is a host restriction factor that can suppress HBV gene expression and modulate immune responses",2019,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes acute and chronic liver inflammation. Recent studies have demonstrated that some viral antigens can suppress host innate and adaptive immunity, and thus lead to HBV liver persistency. However, the cellular factors that can help host cells to clear HBV during acute infection remain largely unknown. Here, we used HBV-cleared and HBV-persistent mouse models to seek for cellular factors that might participate in HBV clearance. HBV replicon DNA was delivered into the mouse liver by hydrodynamic injection. RNA-Seq analysis was conducted to identify immune-related genes that were differentially expressed in HBV-persistent and HBV-cleared mouse models. A cellular factor, B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), was found to be significantly upregulated in the liver of HBV-cleared mice upon HBV clearance. Co-expression of BCL6 and a persistent HBV clone rendered the clone largely cleared, implicating an important role of BCL6 in controlling HBV clearance. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that BCL6 functioned as a repressor, binding to and suppressing the activities of the four HBV promoters. Correspondingly, BCL6 expression significantly reduced the levels of HBV viral RNA, DNA, and proteins. BCL6 expression could be stimulated by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α; the BCL6 in turn synergized TNF-α signaling to produce large amounts of CXCL9 and CXCL10, leading to increased infiltrating immune cells and elevated cytokine levels in the liver. Thus, positive feedback loops on BCL6 expression and immune responses could be produced. Together, our results demonstrate that BCL6 is a novel host restriction factor that exerts both anti-HBV and immunomodulatory activities. Induction of BCL6 in the liver may ultimately assist host immune responses to clear HBV. ? 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Use of lipid-lowering agents is not associated with improved outcomes for tuberculosis patients on standard-course therapy: A population-based cohort study",2019,"Objectives Animal and ex vitro studies suggested lipid-lowering agents (LLAs) may be used as an adjunct to standard anti- tuberculosis (TB) treatment. No human study has been conducted to date. Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), the current population-based cohort study sought to examine the association between use of LLAs and outcomes of patients with pulmonary TB receiving anti-TB treatment. Methods Using a NHIRD from 2003 to 2010, this population-based cohort study retrospectively examined the association between LLAs (statins or fibrates) and the outcomes of patients with pulmonary TB receiving anti-TB treatment. Results A total of 1452 adult patients newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB during the study period were identified and compared with 5808 matched patients. In the LAA cohort, 1258 received statin, and 295 received fibrate. Compared with patients who did not take LLA, patients who took oral LLAs had similar incidence of treatment completion at 9, 12, and 24 months. Conclusions Neither statins nor fibrates provide clinical benefit superior to that achieved with standard anti-tuberculosis treatment. Future clinical trials should investigate the effects of statins and fibrates on short-course standard anti-TB therapy. ? 2019 Chen et al.

"An integrated influenza surveillance framework based on national influenza-like illness incidence and multiple hospital electronic medical records for early prediction of influenza epidemics: Design and evaluation",2019,"Background: Influenza is a leading cause of death worldwide and contributes to heavy economic losses to individuals and communities. Therefore, the early prediction of and interventions against influenza epidemics are crucial to reduce mortality and morbidity because of this disease. Similar to other countries, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (TWCDC) has implemented influenza surveillance and reporting systems, which primarily rely on influenza-like illness (ILI) data reported by health care providers, for the early prediction of influenza epidemics. However, these surveillance and reporting systems show at least a 2-week delay in prediction, indicating the need for improvement. Objective: We aimed to integrate the TWCDC ILI data with electronic medical records (EMRs) of multiple hospitals in Taiwan. Our ultimate goal was to develop a national influenza trend prediction and reporting tool more accurate and efficient than the current influenza surveillance and reporting systems. Methods: First, the influenza expertise team at Taipei Medical University Health Care System (TMUHcS) identified surveillance variables relevant to the prediction of influenza epidemics. Second, we developed a framework for integrating the EMRs of multiple hospitals with the ILI data from the TWCDC website to proactively provide results of influenza epidemic monitoring to hospital infection control practitioners. Third, using the TWCDC ILI data as the gold standard for influenza reporting, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to measure the strength of the linear relationship between TMUHcS EMRs and regional and national TWCDC ILI data for 2 weekly time series datasets. Finally, we used the Moving Epidemic Method analyses to evaluate each surveillance variable for its predictive power for influenza epidemics. Results: Using this framework, we collected the EMRs and TWCDC ILI data of the past 3 influenza seasons (October 2014 to September 2017). On the basis of the EMRs of multiple hospitals, 3 surveillance variables, TMUHcS-ILI, TMUHcS-rapid influenza laboratory tests with positive results (RITP), and TMUHcS-influenza medication use (IMU), which reflected patients with ILI, those with positive results from rapid influenza diagnostic tests, and those treated with antiviral drugs, respectively, showed strong correlations with the TWCDC regional and national ILI data (r=.86-.98). The 2 surveillance variables—TMUHcS-RITP and TMUHcS-IMU—showed predictive power for influenza epidemics 3 to 4 weeks before the increase noted in the TWCDC ILI reports. Conclusions: Our framework periodically integrated and compared surveillance data from multiple hospitals and the TWCDC website to maintain a certain prediction quality and proactively provide monitored results. Our results can be extended to other infectious diseases, mitigating the time and effort required for data collection and analysis. Furthermore, this approach may be developed as a cost-effective electronic surveillance tool for the early and accurate prediction of epidemics of influenza and other infectious diseases in densely populated regions and nations. ?

"Can government-supported preventive fluoride varnish application service reduce pulp-involved primary molars?",2019,"Objectives: Fluoride varnishes are reported to reduce 37–43% of dental caries; however, it remains unclear whether they can prevent severe decay. The study investigated the association between the government-supported preventive fluoride varnish application service (FVAS) and the risk of undergoing treatments of pulp-involved primary molars. Methods: Children who were younger than 6 years and did not receive any dental treatment between the first and last services within 2 years were defined as the “preventive-FVAS group.” After the matching process, 45,296 children were selected for further analysis until the end of 2013. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were employed to estimate the effects of preventive-FVAS on the treatments of pulp-involved primary molars, including pulpectomy and early extraction before the age of 8 years. Results: After adjusting for confounding factors, adjusted hazard ratios for the treatments of pulp-involved primary molars for children who received preventive-FVAS were 0.96 (95% CI = 0.92–1.00) for initiation of pulpectomy, 0.93 (95% CI = 0.86–1.00) for completion of pulpectomy, and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.82–0.92, P < 0.0001) for early extraction, especially for those who received three or more FVAS. Conclusions: Although preventive-FVASs were associated with a 4–13% decreased risk of undergoing treatments of pulp-involved primary molars within a lower risk subset, we suggest the implementation the current Taiwan government-supported FVAS program needs to be modified. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether it would be a better strategy if the program focused only on the high-risk group. ? 2019 American Association of Public Health Dentistry","anticaries agent; fluoride; paint; child; dental caries; government; human; molar tooth; Taiwan; Cariostatic Agents; Child; Dental Caries; Fluorides; Government; Humans; Molar; Paint; Taiwan"
"Comparison of cofilin-1 and Twist-1 protein expression in human non-small cell lung cancer tissues",2019,"Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Actin cytoskeletal reorganization is usually accompanied by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-induced invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. In the present study, expression levels of the actin-associated protein cofilin-1 and of the pivotal EMT molecule Twist-1 were determined in NSCLC tissues. Using lung cancer tissue arrays, the identification of 67.4% of tissue spots that exhibited reciprocal levels of cofilin-1 and Twist-1 was achieved by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. This reciprocal expression pattern was also detected in 21 out of 25 clinicopathological NSCLC tissue sections, and in 10 out of 15 NSCLC cell lines. In addition, high levels of cofilin-1 and low levels of Twist-1 accounted for 80 and 71.5% of the reciprocal expression pattern in tissue arrays and clinicopathological tissue samples, respectively. This pattern was also detected in normal lung tissues, stage I and II lung cancer tissues, and adenocarcinoma subtypes of NSCLC tissues. Although cofilin-1 and Twist-1 were expressed inversely, a positive correlation of these two proteins was present in normal lung tissues and lung tumor tissues. Furthermore, enforced expression of cofilin-1 suppressed the expression level of Twist-1 in NSCLC H1299 cells. An on-line Kaplan-Meier survival analytic tool allowed access to a public microarray dataset with a maximum of 1,926 NSCLC samples. The analysis revealed that high expression levels of both cofilin-1 (CFL1) and Twist-1 (TWIST1) genes were associated with decreased survival of NSCLC patients, notably with regard to the adenocarcinoma subtype. The analysis was conducted using the multivariate Cox regression model. Although the reciprocal association of the expression levels of cofilin-1 and Twist-1 with the survival rate of NSCLC patients requires additional information, it may be a significant indicator of the progression of NSCLC. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Caffeine does not affect susceptibility to cortical spreading depolarization in mice",2019,"Several factors that modulate migraine, a common primary headache disorder, also affect susceptibility to cortical spreading depolarization (CSD). CSD is a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization and thought to underlie the migraine aura and possibly headache. Here, we tested whether caffeine, known to alleviate or trigger headache after acute exposure or chronic use/withdrawal, respectively, modulates CSD. We injected C57BL/6J mice with caffeine (30, 60, or 120 mg/kg; i.p.) once (acute) or twice per day for one or two weeks (chronic). Susceptibility to CSD was evaluated by measuring the electrical CSD threshold and by assessing KCl-induced CSD. Simultaneous laser Doppler flowmetry was used to assess CSD-induced cortical blood flow changes. Recordings were performed 15 min after caffeine/vehicle administration, or 24 h after the last dose of chronic caffeine in the withdrawal group. The latter paradigm was also tested in mice carrying the familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 R192Q missense mutation, considered a valid migraine model. Neither acute/chronic administration nor withdrawal of caffeine affected CSD susceptibility or related cortical blood flow changes, either in WT or R192Q mice. Hence, adverse or beneficial effects of caffeine on headache seem unrelated to CSD pathophysiology, consistent with the non-migrainous clinical presentation of caffeine-related headache. ?

"Malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumor in the female genital tract: Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses",2019,"BACKGROUND: Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) is a rare mesenchymal tumor, located at various anatomic sites, including the female genital tract. This study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with PEComa arising from the female genital tract. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei VGH) between 2008 and 2018. All published English cases based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement were also included in the current review. RESULTS: A total of 114 women from PRISMA and 3 women from Taipei VGH were identified. The uterus was the most commonly involved site (82/114, 71.9%), followed by the cervix (12/114, 10.5%). Immunohistochemical staining showed that nearly all gynecological PEComas were positive for human melanoma black 45?(113/114, 99.1%). More than half of the gynecological PEComas were immunoreactive for desmin (50/85, 58.8%). Multi-modality treatment, including surgery and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors as targeted therapy, provided long-term disease-free survival (cure rate ranging from 50% to 100%, based on the different anatomic sites of the female genital tract). CONCLUSION: Multi-modality treatment, including cytoreductive surgery and mTOR inhibitors with/without chemotherapy and/or radiation, should be considered for the management of women with PEComas in the genital tract.","aged; case report; female; female genital tract tumor; human; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; pathology; perivascular epithelioid cell tumor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Neoplasms"
"Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome Following Acute Epstein-Barr Virus Infection",2019,"Purpose: To investigate the association between multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) and Epstein-Barr (EB) virus infection. Methods: A prospective, consecutive case series study was performed in patients with the characteristic findings of MEWDS. Patients received EB viral-specific antibody serologic tests. Results: Five cases of MEWDS who had prodromal flu-like symptoms were enrolled, comprising 2 women and 3 men with a mean age of 34. Mean diopter of myopia was ?7.5. During acute onset of MEWDS, EB virus infection was confirmed by positive EB virus serology test. One showed positive EB viral capsid antigen (EB-VCA) IgM, and the other four showed highly elevated titer of EB-VCA IgG more than 1:160. Two months later, paired serum virus serology data showed negative EB-VCA IgM, or prior EB-VCA IgG titer decreased four-fold in the recovery stage. Conclusion: MEWDS may be associated with acute systemic EB virus infection. Ocular symptoms might develop due to this infection or represent virus-induced autoimmune inflammatory retinitis. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus capsid antigen; capsid protein; Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen; virus antibody; virus antigen; acute disease; adult; antibody titer; Article; blurred vision; case report; clinical article; common cold; disease association; electroretinogram; Epstein Barr virus infection; female; flu like syndrome; fluorescence angiography; headache; high myopia; human; immunofluorescence test; immunoglobulin blood level; indocyanine green angiography; male; middle aged; multiple evanescent white dot syndrome; ophthalmoscopy; optical coherence tomography; retinitis; scotoma; serology; slit lamp microscopy; complication; diagnostic imaging; electroretinography; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; etiology; eye fundus; follow up; immunology; prospective study; retina; time factor; virology; Adult; Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, Viral; Capsid Proteins; Electroretinography; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Follow-Up Studies; Fundus Oculi; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Retina; Time Factors; Tomography, Optical Coherence; White Dot Syndromes"
"Effects of systemic and neuraxial morphine on the immune system",2019,"In the study, we tried to evaluate the effects of morphine injected through the systemic or neuraxial route on immune cell function and cytokine production in healthy women.In total, 29 paired samples of fresh peripheral blood were collected from healthy women who had been administered morphine for anesthetic analgesia through intravenous (IV), epidural, or spinal route postpartum. Their isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were mitogen-activated and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-interleukin (IL)-2, and anti-interferon (IFN)-γ antibodies for flow cytometry, and the plasma levels of cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-α2, IL-10, IL-8, GM-CSF, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, were measured through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The results demonstrated that regardless of the administration route, morphine delivery slightly reduced IL-2 expression in CD4 cells after activation, and the same effect was not noted for CD8 cells. Intravenous or epidural morphine tended to reduce IFN-γ expression in CD8 cells. Spinal and IV morphine substantially increased IL-6 production, whereas epidural morphine hindered IL-10 and GM-CSF production. IV morphine injection reduced MCP-1 production in plasma. Compared with spinal morphine, IV or epidural morphine may more effectively inhibit the expression of various cytokines and thus affect immune response.All 3 routes of morphine injection tended to decrease IL-2 production by CD4 cells, whereas IV or epidural morphine injection showed lower IFN-γ production by CD8 cells. However, additional large-scale studies with longer follow-up durations are warranted.","biological marker; cytokine; morphine; narcotic analgesic agent; adult; blood; drug effect; female; human; immune system; immunology; metabolism; puerperium; T lymphocyte; Adult; Analgesics, Opioid; Biomarkers; Cytokines; Female; Humans; Immune System; Morphine; Postpartum Period; T-Lymphocytes"
"Assessment of patient experience profiles and satisfaction with expectations of treatment effects by using latent class analysis based on a national patient experience survey in Taiwan",2019,"Objectives Health system responsiveness is a complicated issue that guides researchers wishing to design an efficient methodology for enhancing understanding of perspectives regarding healthcare systems. This study examined the relationship between patient experience profiles and satisfaction with expectations of treatment effects. Design This was a cross-sectional study. We used eight items obtained from latent class analysis to develop patient experience profiles. Setting Primary care users in Taiwan. Participants This study conducted an annual National Health Insurance survey in Taiwan and sampled from those who had experience with the medical service in primary care clinics in 2015. Primary outcome measure Respondents were asked to indicate the extent of their satisfaction with their expectation of treatment effects (or symptom improvement). Results The proportions of participants in groups 1-4 were 34%, 24%, 29% and 12%, respectively. Patients in good health were more satisfied with their expectations of treatment effects (OR 1.639, p=0.007). Furthermore, group 4 (-eAll) were less satisfied with their expectations of treatment effects than those in the other three groups (ORs: group 1 (+eAll): 9.81, group 2 (-CwR): 4.14 and group 3 (-CnR): 4.20). Conclusions The results revealed that experiences of poor accessibility and physician-patient relationships affected the patients' expectations. Therefore, greater accessibility and more positive physician-patient relationships could lead to higher patient satisfaction with their expectations of treatment effects. Furthermore, the findings could assist authorities in targeting specific patients, with the objective of improving their healthcare service experience. They could also serve as a mechanism for improving the quality of healthcare services and increase accountability in healthcare practices. ? ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

"A phase 0 study of the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and dosimetry of 188Re-liposome in patients with metastatic tumors",2019,"Background: Liposomes are drug nano-carriers that are capable of targeting therapeutics to tumor sites because of enhanced permeability retention (EPR). In several preclinical studies with various tumor-bearing mice models, 188Re-liposome that has been developed by the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) demonstrates favorable in vivo tumor targeting, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry. It inhibits the growth of tumors, increased survival, demonstrates good synergistic combination, and was safe to use. This study conducts a phase 0 low-radioactivity clinical trial of nano-targeted radiotherapeutics 188Re-liposome to evaluate the effectiveness with which it targets tumors and the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, dosimetry, and its safety in use. Twelve patients with metastatic cancers are studied in this trial. Serial whole-body scans and SPECT/CT are taken at 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h after intravenous injection of 111 MBq of 188Re-liposome. The effectiveness with which tumors are targeted, the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, dosimetry, and safety are evaluated using the VelocityAI and OLINDA/EXM software. Blood samples are collected at different time points for a pharmacokinetics study and a safety evaluation that involves monitoring changes in liver, renal, and hematological functions. Results: The T?z for 188Re-liposome in blood and plasma are 36.73 ± 14.00 h and 52.02 ± 45.21 h, respectively. The doses of radiation that are absorbed to vital organs such as the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and bone marrow are 0.92 ± 0.35, 1.38 ± 1.81, 0.58 ± 0.28, 0.32 ± 0.09, and 0.06 ± 0.01 mGy/MBq, respectively, which is far less than the reference maximum tolerance dose after injection of 188Re-liposome. 188Re-liposome is absorbed by metastatic tumor lesions and the normal reticuloendothelial (RES) system. Certain patients exhibit a therapeutic response. Conclusion: This phase 0 exploratory IND study shows that nanocarrier 188Re-liposome achieves favorable tumor accumulation and tumor to normal organ uptake ratios for a subset of cancer patients. The clinical pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, and dosimetry results justify a further dose-escalating phase 1 clinical trial.

"The learning curve of robotic nipple sparing mastectomy for breast cancer: An analysis of consecutive 39 procedures with cumulative sum plot",2019,"The learning curve of robotic nipple sparing mastectomy in the management of breast cancer were evaluated with cumulative sum plots, and factors affecting the operation time were discussed. We revealed that time for R-NSM fluctuated with mastectomy weight, and this fluctuation could be reduced after cases experience accumulated. From our preliminary experience, R-NSM and IPBR (or R-NSM alone) is a safe procedure, and could be a promising new technique for breast cancer patients indicated for mastectomy. Current study provides some valuable information for the development and patient selection for robotic surgery in total skin and nipple preserving type mastectomy. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical OncologyBackground: The preliminary experience and learning curve of robotic nipple sparing mastectomy (R-NSM) in the management of breast cancer were analyzed and reported. Methods: The medical records of patients who underwent R-NSM for breast cancer during the period of March 2017 to June 2018 were collected from the same surgeon in a single institute. Data on clinicopathologic characteristics, type of surgery, method of breast reconstruction, and operation time were prospective collected. Learning curve of R-NSM was evaluated and analyzed by the cumulative sum (CUSUM) plot method. Results: A total of 39 consecutive R-NSM procedures from 35 patients were analyzed. The time needed for “docking” “R-NSM” and “R-NSM and immediate prosthesis breast reconstruction (IPBR)” decreased after cases experience accumulated, and in mature phase procedures could finished within 10 min, 100mins, and 240 min, separately. In CUSUM plots analysis of learning curve, the cases needed to decrease operation time for “docking” “R-NSM” and “total time for R-NSM and IPBR” were 13th, 13th, and 12th procedures separately. Mastectomy weight and lymph node metastasis were factors related to operation time. The rate of total nipple areolar complex necrosis for R-NSM was 0%. One (2.9%, 1/35) R-NSM procedure was found to have positive margin involved in the final pathologic check-up. No implant loss, or local recurrence was observed during a mean follow-up of 8.6 ± 4.5 (1.3–16.7) months. Conclusion: From our preliminary experience, R-NSM and IPBR (or R-NSM alone) is a safe procedure, and the operation time needed significantly decrease after cases experience accumulated. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology","adult; aged; Article; blister; breast areola; breast cancer; breast necrosis; breast reconstruction; clinical article; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; cumulative sum plot; female; follow up; graft failure; hematoma; human; ischemia; learning curve; lymph node metastasis; mastectomy; medical record review; middle aged; nipple schemia; operation duration; outcome assessment; patient safety; postoperative complication; priority journal; prospective study; robot assisted surgery; robot nipple sparing mastectomy; seroma; statistical model; surgical technique; wound healing impairment; breast tumor; clinical competence; education; learning curve; mastectomy; nipple; pathology; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; Taiwan; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Clinical Competence; Female; Humans; Learning Curve; Lymphatic Metastasis; Mammaplasty; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Nipples; Operative Time; Prospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"

"Surgical repair of aortic aneurysms and reduced incidence of dementia",2019,"Background: Dementia and aortic aneurysms share clinical risk factors and molecular signaling pathways. However, the association between dementia and aortic aneurysms has not been examined. The potential effects of open surgical repair (OSR) of aortic aneurysms on future dementia events are unknown. Methods: We conducted this nationwide population-based, retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan ese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The cumulative incidence of dementia over a 13-year follow-up period was compared among 1) aortic aneurysms and non-aortic aneurysm patients and 2) aortic aneurysm patients who underwent OSR, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or nonsurgical treatment (NST). Results: This study enrolled 19,921 aortic aneurysms patients and 19,921 matched controls. The aortic aneurysm cohort exhibited a significantly increased incidence of dementia compared with the controls (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 3.559, p < 0.001). Furthermore, 5409 aortic aneurysm patients were treated with surgical intervention, whereas 5409 matched aortic aneurysm patients were not. Aortic aneurysm patients who underwent OSR had a significantly lower incidence of dementia than those who underwent NST (adjusted HR = 0.638, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.411–0.764, p < 0.001). Patients who underwent EVAR did not have a lower incidence of dementia than those who underwent NST. Conclusion: OSR was associated with a reduced incidence of dementia in patients with aortic aneurysms compared to NST. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; aged; aneurysm surgery; aortic aneurysm; Article; cohort analysis; conservative treatment; controlled study; dementia; endovascular aneurysm repair; female; follow up; human; incidence; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; open surgery; priority journal; retrospective study; surgical technique; aortic aneurysm; dementia; incidence; longitudinal study; middle aged; psychology; public health; Taiwan; treatment outcome; trends; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Aneurysm; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"Should clinicians pay more attention to the potential underdiagnosis of osteoporosis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis? A national population-based study in Taiwan",2019,"Objectives There are limited studies describing the association between ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and osteoporosis. We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study to investigate this epidemiologic evidence. Methods Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Of 10,290 participants, 2,058 patients with AS and 8,232 patients without AS were enrolled from the NHIRD between 2000 to 2013. Cumulative incidences of osteoporosis were compared between 2 groups. Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of developing osteoporosis after controlling for demographic and other co-morbid-ities, and subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the risk factors for osteoporosis in AS patients. Results The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of osteoporosis in AS patients was 2.17 times higher than that non-AS group (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83–2.57). The adjusted HRs of osteoporosis for AS patients after controlling for demographic characteristics and comorbid medical disorders was 1.99 (95% CI 1.68–2.36). Among AS group, after adjustment for major comorbidities, old age (65 years, HR 4.32, 95% CI 3.01–6.18), female sex (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.87–3.28), dyslipidemia (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01–2.06) were risk factors associated with osteoporosis. Conclusions This cohort study demonstrated that patients with AS had a higher risk of developing osteoporosis, especially in those aged over 65, female sex and with dyslipidemia in this patient group. ? 2019 Hu et al.

"Clinicopathological and molecular differences in colorectal cancer according to location",2019,"Purpose: The incidence, pathogenesis, molecular pathways, and outcomes of colorectal cancer vary depending on the location of the tumor. This study aimed to compare the difference in tumor characteristics and the outcome between right-sided colon cancer and left-sided colorectal cancer (LCRC). Materials and methods: A total of 1503 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 2000 and 2010 were enrolled in this study. Right-sided colon cancer was defined as cancers in the cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon, while LCRC was defined as cancers in the splenic flexure colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. The endpoint was overall survival. The mutations were detected via polymerase chain reaction and MASS array. The prognostic value was determined using the log-rank test and the Cox regression analysis. Results: A total of 407 and 1096 cases were classified as right-sided colon cancer and LCRC, respectively. Compared to patients with LCRC, those with right-sided colon cancer had more mucinous type cancer (7.4% vs. 3.5%), poorly differentiated tumor (11.5% vs. 3.6%), and advanced tumor-node-metastasis stage. The risk for peritoneal tumor seeding was higher in the right-sided colon cancer group (12.8% vs. 5.7%). Overall survival was better in LCRC than in right-sided colon cancer (P=0.036). Conclusions: In our study, right-sided colon cancer had a more advanced tumor stage, a higher risk of peritoneal metastasis, and a poorer outcome than LCRC. Moreover, right-sided colon cancer had more gene mutations in BRAF, KRAS, SMAD4, TGF-β, PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, and high microsatellite instability. ?

"Simultaneous assessment of cell morphology and adhesion using aluminum nanoslit-based plasmonic biosensing chips",2019,"A variety of physiological and pathological processes rely on cell adhesion, which is most often tracked by changes in cellular morphology. We previously reported a novel gold nanoslit-based biosensor that is capable of real-time and label-free monitoring of cell morphological changes and cell viability. However, the preparation of gold biosensors is inefficient, complicated and costly. Recently, nanostructure-based aluminum (Al) sensors have been introduced for biosensing applications. The Al-based sensor has a longer decay length and is capable of analyzing large-sized mass such as cells. Here, we developed two types of double-layer Al nanoslit-based plasmonic biosensors, which were nanofabricated and used to evaluate the correlation between metastatic potency and adhesion of lung cancer and melanoma cell lines. Cell adhesion was determined by Fano resonance signals that were induced by binding of the cells to the nanoslit. The peak and dip of the Fano resonance spectrum respectively reflected long- and short-range cellular changes, allowing us to simultaneously detect and distinguish between focal adhesion and cell spreading. Also, the Al nanoslit-based biosensor chips were used to evaluate the inhibitory effects of drugs on cancer cell spreading. We are the first to report the use of double layer Al nanoslit-based biosensors for detection of cell behavior, and such devices may become powerful tools for anti-metastasis drug screening in the future. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"RAB27B-activated secretion of stem-like tumor exosomes delivers the biomarker microRNA-146a-5p, which promotes tumorigenesis and associates with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in colorectal cancer",2019,"The dynamic cell–cell communication is essential for tissue homeostasis in normal physiological circumstances and contributes to a diversified tumor microenvironment. Although exosomes are extracellular vesicles that actively participate in cell–cell interaction by shutting cellular components, impacts of tumor exosomes in the context of cancer stemness remain elusive. Here, we expand colorectal cancer stem cells (CRCSCs) as cancer spheroids and demonstrate that the β-catenin/Tcf-4-activated RAB27B expression is required for the secretion of CRCSC exosomes. In an exosomal RNA sequencing analysis, a switch of exosomal RNA species from retrotransposons to microRNAs (miRNAs) is identified upon expanding CRCSCs. miRNA-146a-5p (miR-146a) is the major miRNA in CRCSC exosomes and exosomal miR-146a promotes stem-like properties and tumorigenicity by targeting Numb in recipient CRC cells. Among 53 CRC patients, those with abundant exosomal miR-146a expression in serum exhibits higher miR-146aHigh/NumbLow CRCSC traits, an increased number of tumor-filtrating CD66(+) neutrophils and a decreased number of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells.

"Combination immunosuppressant therapy and lupus nephritis outcome: a hospital-based study",2019,"Lupus nephritis (LN) is the leading cause of mortality in lupus patients. This study aimed to investigate the treatment outcome and renal histological risk factors of LN in a tertiary referral center. Between 2006 and 2017, a retrospective observational study enrolled 148 biopsy-proven LN patients. After propensity score matching, 75 cases were included for further analysis. The classification and scoring of LN were assessed according to the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society. Treatment response was evaluated by daily urine protein and urinalysis at two years after commencing induction treatment and the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In total, 50.7% patients achieved complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), while 49.3% patients were categorized as nonresponders. Therapeutic responses in terms of CR/PR rates were associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores (odds ratio (OR): 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12–1.60, p = 0.001). Moreover, higher baseline creatinine levels (hazard ratio (HR): 2.10, 95% CI: 1.29–3.40, p = 0.003), higher renal activity index (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.07–1.58, p = 0.008) and chronicity index (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.06–1.85, p = 0.017) predicted ESRD. Among pathological scores, cellular crescents (HR: 4.42, 95% CI: 1.01–19.38, p = 0.049) and fibrous crescents (HR: 5.93, 95% CI: 1.41–24.92, p = 0.015) were independent risk factors for ESRD. In conclusion, higher lupus activity was a good prognostic marker for renal remission. Renal histology was predictive of ESRD. Large-scale prospective studies are required to verify the efficacy of mycophenolate in combination with azathioprine or cyclosporine in LN patients. ?

"Feasibility of measuring spleen stiffness with MR elastography and splenic volume to predict hepatic fibrosis stage",2019,"Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between spleen stiffness value, splenic volume and the liver fibrosis stages. Materials and methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of our institute. We enrolled 109 patients that had undergone abdominal MR imaging and histopathological examination. The preoperative MR imaging, MR elastography and laboratory data were reviewed. Liver stiffness and spleen stiffness were determined with MR elastography, and splenic volume was calculated. Liver fibrosis stage was determined using surgical pathology. Results The correlation coefficient between the liver stiffness and the fibrosis stage was r = 0.72 and r = 0.62 when the passive driver was on right chest wall and the left chest wall, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the spleen stiffness and the fibrosis stage was r = 0.63 and r = 0.18 when the passive driver was on the left chest wall and the right chest wall, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the splenic volume and the fibrosis stage was r = 0.31. The diagnostic performance of spleen stiffness was similar to liver stiffness in prediction of advanced liver fibrosis. The combination of spleen stiffness and liver stiffness provided greater sensitivity in prediction of advanced fibrosis than spleen or liver stiffness alone, but no significant difference was found. Conclusion According to our study, the spleen stiffness value was useful in staging liver fibrosis. The combination of spleen stiffness and liver stiffness could provide higher diagnostic sensitivity than liver stiffness alone in prediction of advanced fibrosis. ? 2019 Cheng et al.","adult; Article; controlled study; disease severity; feasibility study; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; image analysis; liver fibrosis; liver stiffness; lymphatic parameters; magnetic resonance elastography; major clinical study; male; prediction; preoperative evaluation; retrospective study; sensitivity analysis; spleen stiffness; splenic volume"
"Antibody-drug conjugates with HER2-targeting antibodies from synthetic antibody libraries are highly potent against HER2-positive human gastric tumor in xenograft models",2019,"HER2-ECD (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–extracellular domain) is a prominent therapeutic target validated for treating HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer, but HER2-specific therapeutic options for treating advanced gastric cancer remain limited. We have developed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), comprising IgG1 linked via valine-citrulline to monomethyl auristatin E, with potential to treat HER2-positive gastric cancer in humans. The antibodies optimally selected from the ADC discovery platform, which was developed to discover antibody candidates suitable for immunoconjugates from synthetic antibody libraries designed using antibody-antigen interaction principles, were demonstrated to be superior immunoconjugate targeting modules in terms of efficacy and off-target toxicity. In comparison with the two control humanized antibodies (trastuzumab and H32) derived from murine antibody repertoires, the antibodies derived from the synthetic antibody libraries had enhanced receptor-mediated internalization rate, which could result in ADCs with optimal efficacies. Along with the ADCs, two other forms of immunoconjugates (scFv-PE38KDEL and IgG1-AL1-PE38KDEL) were used to test the antibodies for delivering cytotoxic payloads to xenograft tumor models in vivo and to cultured cells in vitro. The in vivo experiments with the three forms of immunoconjugates revealed minimal off-target toxicities of the selected antibodies from the synthetic antibody libraries; the off-target toxicities of the control antibodies could have resulted from the antibodies’ propensity to target the liver in the animal models. Our ADC discovery platform and the knowledge gained from our in vivo tests on xenograft models with the three forms of immunoconjugates could be useful to anyone developing optimal ADC cancer therapeutics. ? 2018, ? 2018 The Author(s).

"Correlational study of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed by ultrasonography with lipid profile and body mass index in adult nepalese population",2019,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to categorize patients into different grades of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by ultrasonography and to compare the findings with their serum lipid profile. Materials and Methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional study design was used. One hundred and nine patients without a history of alcohol consumption of age more than 16 years attending general health checkup were selected at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Maharajganj, Kathmandu, as per the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Ultrasound scanning of the patients was done and their liver size, as well as grading of fatty liver, was done. Data were collected in predesigned pro forma and were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 16.0, IBM (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results: In this study, the mean age of fatty liver in males was found to be 44.3 years and in females was found to be 51.9 years. 22.9% of patients with NAFLD had increased liver size. Significant association with increasing grades of fatty liver was found with increasing levels of cholesterol (P = 0.028), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P = 0.017), liver size (P = 0.001), and body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.045) in patients diagnosed with NAFLD. No significant association with increasing grades of fatty liver was found with increasing levels of triglyceride (P = 0.32) and high-density lipoprotein (P = 0.25). Conclusion: Ultrasound is a safe and first-line modality for the evaluation of fatty liver and its grading. Increasing grades of fatty liver had significant association with increasing levels of cholesterol LDL, increasing liver size, and BMI of patients. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Ultrasound.","cholesterol; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; adolescent; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; body mass; child; comparative study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; echography; female; General Health Questionnaire; groups by age; human; lipid analysis; liver size; major clinical study; male; Nepalese; nonalcoholic fatty liver; patient coding; sociology; university hospital"
"Inhibition of macrophage inflammatory protein-1β improves endothelial progenitor cell function and ischemia-induced angiogenesis in diabetes",2019,"Systemic inflammation might contribute to the impairment of neovasculogenesis and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function in clinical diabetes mellitus (DM). Macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β) is an inflammatory chemokine that may be up-regulated in clinical DM. Its role in diabetic vasculopathy was not clarified. This study aimed to investigate the role of MIP-1β in human EPCs and in neovasculogenesis in different diabetic animal models with hindlimb ischemia. EPCs chamber assay and in vitro tube formation assay were used to estimate the degree of EPC migration and tube formation abilities. Lepr db /JNarl mice, C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet, and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were used as different diabetic animal models. Laser Doppler imaging and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the degree of neovasculogenesis and the circulating levels of EPCs, respectively. MIP-1β impaired human EPC function for angiogenesis in vitro. Plasma MIP-1β levels were up-regulated in type 2 DM patients. MIP-1β inhibition enhanced the function and the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 expression of EPCs from type 2 diabetic patients, and improved EPC homing for ischemia-induced neovasculogenesis in different types of diabetic animals. MIP-1β directly impaired human EPC function. Inhibition of MIP-1β improved in vitro EPC function, and enhanced in vivo EPC homing and ischemia-induced neovasculogenesis, suggesting the critical role of MIP-1β for vasculopathy in the presence of DM. ? 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","chemokine receptor CXCR4; macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta; macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody; unclassified drug; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; cell function; cell migration; clinical article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diabetic angiopathy; endothelial progenitor cell; flow cytometry; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; laser Doppler flowmetry; male; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; protein function; protein targeting; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; upregulation"
"Association of virological breakthrough and clinical outcomes in entecavir-treated HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B",2019,"Background & aims To evaluate virological breakthrough (VBT) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving entecavir (ETV) treatment. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary referral hospital and a total of 228 HBeAg-positive CHB patients treated with ETV for more than 48 weeks were enrolled. Clinical outcome measures included HBeAg seroclearance, maintained virological response and the development of HCC. Results During a median follow-up period of 197 weeks, VBT developed in 26 (11.4%) patients (VBT group), and the other 202 patients without VBT (non-VBT group). The overall cumulative rate of HBeAg seroclearance in the VBT group and non-VBT group were 23.1% and 23.8%, 27.1% and 37.9%, 27.1% and 55.1%, 27.1% and 74.1%, 27.1% and 76.7% from week 48 to 240, respectively(p = 0.013). The cumulative probability of maintained virological responses from week 48 to 240 were 7.69% and 21.78%, 7.69% in the VBT groups and 36.85%, 7.69% and 51.68%, 7.69% and 64.97%, 7.69% and 72.1% in the non-VBT groups, respectively (p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, age (p<0.001) and virological response at week 24 (p = 0.005) were independently associated with VBT. Cox regression analysis showed that cirrhosis had carried the highest risk for HCC (HR = 4.99, CI = 1.14–21.81, p = 0.033). Subgroup survival analysis by Kaplan–Meier method showed that patients with VBT had higher incidence of developing HCC than without VBT in cirrhotic patients (50% (95%CI = 1–99%) vs 9% (95% CI = 1–9%); p = 0.048). Conclusions VBT was associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including a low probability of HBeAg seroclearance, failure to achieve maintained virological responses, and a risk of developing HCC. Patients, particularly with cirrhosis, who had experienced VBT during ETV treatment, more likely developed HCC. ? 2019 Huang et al.

Method: A cohort from the Taiwan Youth Project was evaluated. The adolescents (n = 2571) were in the 7th grade (mean age = 14.3 years) when the study was initiated and resided in 40 districts in three cities and counties in northern Taiwan. We examined the effects of the concentration level of air pollution, including PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, at the district level on adolescents' happiness and their change in happiness over time (7th to 9th grade). Due to the high correlations of the three pollutants, we examined each separately with similar covariates. The analyses were based on both multilevel modeling and latent growth curve modeling. Results: Higher concentration levels of each of the three air pollutants measured were associated with adolescent happiness such that a higher level of concentration was related to lower levels of adolescents' happiness. These results were observed after controlling for important individual- and district-level covariates. However, further analyses did not reveal that the concentration level of air pollution was associated with the change in happiness in the study period (after 3 years). Some sensitivity checks (e.g., adjusting district size) did not change the substantive results. Conclusion: Many previous studies have shown the influence of air pollution on physical health and negative emotions, but only a few using adult samples have shown that air pollution is inversely related to positive wellbeing. This study may be the first to examine the effects of air pollution on adolescents' positive affect. Our results echo recent research on the consequent health burden of air pollution. Given that positive affect has been linked to future adult health, the results of the current study provide empirical grounds for early intervention concerning environmental factors. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; cohort analysis; female; happiness; human; male; Taiwan; Adolescent; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cohort Studies; Female; Happiness; Humans; Male; Taiwan"
"Bleeding and New-Onset Cancers in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Receiving Nonvitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants",2019,"Whether bleeding should be considered a sufficient sign to justify thorough cancer surveillance in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients receiving nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) remains unclear. We investigated the relationships between bleeding events and new-onset cancers in AF patients receiving NOACs in a prospective cohort (n = 395, mean follow-up duration of 2.8 years). There were 18 patients who were diagnosed with new-onset cancers 584 ± 372 days after the initiation of NOACs. The patients with new-onset cancers had higher HAS-BLED scores (no, preexisting and new-onset cancer: 1.51 ± 0.81, 1.69 ± 0.87, and 2.11 ± 0.96, respectively; p = 0.006) and a higher incidence of bleeding events (22%, 33%, 67%, respectively; p<0.001) than did patients without new-onset cancers. Bleeding events that preceded the diagnosis of new-onset cancers were independently correlated with new-onset cancers (odds ratio: 7.89, p = 0.001) in the multivariate logistic regression. More than half of the patients (61%) with new-onset cancers had either a significant period of drug interruption for at least 2 months or discontinued NOACs. In conclusions, bleeding in AF patients receiving NOACs could be an alerting sign of new-onset cancers and should prompt the initiation of thorough surveillance to detect early cancers. ? 2018","anticoagulant agent; apixaban; dabigatran etexilate; edoxaban; rivaroxaban; anticoagulant agent; vitamin K group; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; cardiovascular disease assessment; CHA2DS2-VASc score; clinical article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; drug withdrawal; early cancer diagnosis; female; follow up; HAS BLED score; human; incidence; male; malignant neoplasm; priority journal; prospective study; treatment duration; treatment interruption; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; complication; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; neoplasm; oral drug administration; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; Taiwan; time factor; very elderly; Administration, Oral; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anticoagulants; Atrial Fibrillation; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; Incidence; Male; Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke; Taiwan; Time Factors; Vitamin K"
"Garcinia multiflora inhibits FPR1-Mediated neutrophil activation and protects against acute lung injury",2019,"Background/Aims: Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) recognize different endogenous and exogenous molecular stimuli and mediate neutrophil activation. Dysregulation of excessive neutrophil activation and the resulting immune responses can induce acute lung injury (ALI) in the host. Accordingly, one promising approach to the treatment of neutrophil-dominated inflammatory diseases involves therapeutic FPR1 inhibition. Methods: We extracted a potent FPR1 antagonist from Garcinia multiflora Champ. (GMC). The inhibitory effects of GMC on superoxide anion release and elastase degranulation from activated human neutrophils were determined with spectrophotometric analysis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the FPR1 binding ability of neutrophils were assayed by flow cytometry. Signaling transduction mediated by GMC in response to chemoattractants was assessed with a calcium influx assay and western blotting. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mouse model was used to determine the therapeutic effects of GMC in vivo. Results: GMC significantly reduced superoxide anion release, the reactive oxidants derived therefrom, and elastase degranulation mediated through selective, competitive FPR1 blocking in N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLF)-stimulated human neutrophils. In cell-free systems, GMC was unable to scavenge superoxide anions or suppress elastase activity. GMC produced a right shift in fMLF-activated concentration-response curves and was confirmed to be a competitive FPR1 antagonist. GMC binds to FPR1 not only in neutrophils, but also FPR1 in neutrophil-like THP-1 and hFPR1-transfected HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the mobilization of calcium and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, which are involved in FPR1-mediated downstream signaling, was competitively blocked by GMC. In an in vivo study, GMC significantly reduced pulmonary edema, neutrophil infiltration, and alveolar damage in LPS-induced ALI mice. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that GMC is a natural competitive FPR1 inhibitor, which makes it a possible anti-inflammatory treatment option for patients critically inflicted with FPR1-mediated neutrophilic lung damage. ? 2018 The Author(s).

"Risk of dementia in patients with leptospirosis: A nationwide cohort analysis",2019,"Background: Studies have linked some bacterial infections with an increased likelihood for development of dementia. However, there is a paucity of data on the relationship between dementia and leptospirosis. In view of this, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine whether leptospirosis is a risk factor for dementia. Methods: Data were collected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Databases (2000–2010) to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for dementia in patients with leptospirosis. Patients with leptospirosis who did not have a history of dementia were enrolled in the study. For each leptospirosis patient, four controls were randomly selected after frequency matching of age, sex, and index date. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used for the analyses of dementia risk. Results: A greater risk of dementia was observed in the leptospirosis cohort than in the non-leptospirosis cohort both in patients without any comorbidity (adjusted HR (aHR) = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.06–1.43) and with a comorbidity (aHR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.7–2.5). Compared with the non-leptospirosis cohort without these comorbidities, the leptospirosis cohort with ?2 comorbidities exhibited a significantly increased risk of dementia (aHR = 6.11, 95% CI = 3.15–11.9), followed by those with any one comorbidity (adjusted HR = 3.62, 95% CI = 1.76–7.46). Conclusions: Patients with leptospirosis were at a 1.89-fold greater risk of subsequent dementia, but potential genetic susceptibility bias in the study group is a major confound. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Risk factors for developing depression in women with cervical cancer: A nationwide population-based study in Taiwan",2019,"Introduction: Depression might affect women with cervical cancer and can deteriorate their quality of life or even their compliance with cancer treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of depression and risk factors for developing depression among women with cervical cancer in Taiwan. Patients and methods: This study enrolled patients with newly diagnosed cervical cancer from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. From a population of 21,400,826 residents, each cervical cancer patient was matched with one subject without cervical cancer according to sex, age, and comorbidities with the same diagnostic index. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 180.9 was used to identify patients with cervical cancer, and 296.0X-296.1X, 296.4X-296.8X, 296.2X-296.3X, 300.4, and 311.X codes were used to identify those with depressive disorders. Results: In total, 19,316 newly diagnosed cervical cancer patients were enrolled from January 2000 to December 2005, and the median follow-up period was 5.23 years (1.75-8.48 years). The prevalence of depressive disorder was 4.21% (813 of 19,316) in the cervical cancer cohort, and it was 3.85% (744 of 19,316) in the control cohort. The incidence risk ratio of depressive disorders was 1.35 (95% CI =1.22-1.49, P<0.001) among these cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer, as an independent risk factor, was associated with developing subsequent depressive disorder. In addition, being older (?65 years old) and the comorbidities of diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease were also risk factors for predicting depressive disorder in cervical cancer patients. Discussion: Cervical cancer is a prominent risk factor for the development of depression in women with cervical cancer in Taiwan. The patients with comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, have higher risks of developing depression. However, there were no significant differences among the cervical cancer treatment modalities. In conclusion, these patients require early psychological support and intervention. ? 2019 Shyu et al.","adult; age; aged; Article; cancer classification; cancer diagnosis; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cancer therapy; cerebrovascular disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease course; female; follow up; human; ICD-9; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; national health insurance; predictive value; prevalence; psychologic assessment; risk assessment; risk factor; Taiwan; uterine cervix cancer"
"Improving the anticancer effect of afatinib and microRNA by using lipid polymeric nanoparticles conjugated with dual pH-responsive and targeting peptides",2019,"Background: The emergence of resistance to chemotherapy or target therapy, tumor metastasis, and systemic toxicity caused by available anticancer drugs hamper the successful colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. The rise in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; human epidermal growth factor receptor 1; HER1) expression and enhanced phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3 are associated with tumor resistance, metastasis and invasion, thus resulting in poor outcome of anti-CRC therapy. The use of afatinib, a pan-HER inhibitor, is a potential therapeutic approach for resistant CRC. Additionally, miR-139 has been reported to be negatively correlated with chemoresistance, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC. Hence, we develop a nanoparticle formulation consisting of a polymer core to carry afatinib or miR-139, which is surrounded by lipids modified with a targeting ligand and a pH-sensitive penetrating peptide to improve the anticancer effect of cargos against CRC cells. Results: Our findings show that this formulation displays a spherical shape with core/shell structure, homogeneous particle size distribution and negative zeta potential. The prepared formulations demonstrate a pH-sensitive release profile and an enhanced uptake of cargos into human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells in response to the acidic pH. This nanoparticle formulation incorporating afatinib and miR-139 exhibits low toxicity to normal cells but shows a better inhibitory effect on Caco-2 cells than other formulations. Moreover, the encapsulation of afatinib and miR-139 in peptide-modified nanoparticles remarkably induces apoptosis and inhibits migration and resistance of Caco-2 cells via suppression of pan-HER tyrosine kinase/multidrug resistance/metastasis pathways. Conclusion: This study proposes a multifunctional nanoparticle formulation for targeted modulation of apoptosis/EGFR/HER/EMT/resistance/progression pathways to increase the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to afatinib. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Amino acids; Cell death; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Pathology; Peptides; pH effects; pH sensors; RNA; Toxicity; Tumors; Afatinib; Cell-penetrating peptide; Colorectal cancer; Epidermal growth factor receptors; Targeting deliveries; Targeted drug delivery; afatinib; cell penetrating peptide; drug carrier; epidermal growth factor receptor; microRNA; nanoparticle; nanoshell; polymer; protein miR 139; unclassified drug; animal cell; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; Caco-2 cell line; cancer inhibition; cell pH; colorectal carcinoma; drug conjugation; drug formulation; drug release; drug targeting; drug uptake; human; human cell; metastasis inhibition; migration inhibition; multidrug resistance; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; particle size; protein synthesis inhibition; rat; zeta potential"
"Association between surrounding greenness and schizophrenia: A taiwanese cohort study",2019,"This study aims to investigate the association between surrounding greenness and schizophrenia incidence in Taiwan. Data of 869,484 individuals without a history of schizophrenia were included from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database from 2000 through 2010 for analysis. The diagnoses of schizophrenia were based on ICD-9 codes. Greenness exposure was assessed using the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index, assuming individuals lived near the hospital they most often visited for common cold during the study period. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to assess the association between greenness exposure and schizophrenia incidence after adjustments were made for the potential confounders. A total of 5,069 schizophrenia cases were newly diagnosed during the study period. A negative significant (P < 0.05) association found using 2,000-m buffer distances (distance of a moderately paced 20-min walk) in the whole Taiwan island, cities, and metropolitan areas. The results of the stratified analysis based on sex and health insurance rate suggested surrounding greenness has approximately equal effects of reducing the risk of schizophrenia, regardless of sex or financial status. In conclusion, our findings suggest that more surrounding greenness may reduce the risk of schizophrenia. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Identifying occult maternal malignancies from 1.93 million pregnant women undergoing noninvasive prenatal screening tests",2019,"Purpose: Multiple chromosomal aneuploidies may be associated with maternal malignancies and can cause failure of noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) tests. However, multiple chromosomal aneuploidies show poor specificity and selectivity for diagnosing maternal malignancies. Methods: This multicenter retrospective analysis evaluated 639 pregnant women who tested positive for multiple chromosomal aneuploidies on initial NIPS test between January 2016 and December 2017. Women were assessed using genome profiling of copy-number variations, which was translated to cancer risk using a novel bioinformatics algorithm called the cancer detection pipeline (CDP). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of diagnosing maternal malignancies were compared for multiple chromosomal aneuploidies, the CDP model, and the combination of CDP and plasma tumor markers. Results: Of the 639 subjects, 41 maternal malignant cancer cases were diagnosed. Multiple chromosomal aneuploidies predicted maternal malignancies with a PPV of 7.6%. Application of the CDP algorithm to women with multiple chromosomal aneuploidies allowed 34 of the 41 (83%) cancer cases to be identified, while excluding 422 of 501 (84.2%) of the false positive cases. Combining the CDP with plasma tumor marker testing gave PPV of 75.0%. Conclusion: The CDP algorithm can diagnose occult maternal malignancies with a reasonable PPV in multiple chromosomal aneuploidies–positive pregnant women in NIPS tests. This performance can be further improved by incorporating findings for plasma tumor markers. ? 2019, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.","tumor marker; adult; aneuploidy; Article; bioinformatics; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; controlled study; copy number variation; diagnostic test accuracy study; dysgerminoma; female; gene expression profiling; human; leiomyoma; leiomyosarcoma; liver cancer; lung cancer; lymphoma; major clinical study; maternal blood; nasopharynx carcinoma; non invasive procedure; occult cancer; ovary cyst; prediction; predictive value; pregnant woman; prenatal screening; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; stomach cancer; teratoma; uterine cervix cancer"
"Does postoperative morphine consumption for acute surgical pain impact oncologic outcomes after colorectal cancer resection?: A retrospective cohort study",2019,"Whether morphine used in human cancer surgery would exert tumor-promoting effects is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of morphine dose on cancer prognosis after colorectal cancer (CRC) resection.In a retrospective study, 1248 patients with stage I through IV CRC undergoing primary tumor resections and using intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for acute surgical pain at a tertiary center between October 2005 and December 2014 were evaluated through August 2016. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using proportional hazards regression models.Multivariable analysis demonstrated no dose-dependent association between the amount of morphine dose and PFS (adjusted hazard ratio, HR=1.31, 95% confidence interval, CI=0.85-2.03) or OS (adjusted HR=0.86, 95% CI=0.47-1.55). Patients were further classified into the high-dose and low-dose groups by the median of morphine consumption (49.7mg), and the morphine doses were mean 75.5 ± standard deviation 28.8mg and 30.1±12.4mg in high-dose and low-dose groups, respectively. Multivariable models showed no significant difference in PFS or OS between groups, either (adjusted HR=1.24, 95% CI=0.97-1.58 for PFS; adjusted HR=1.01, 95% CI=0.71-1.43 for OS).Our results did not support a definite association between postoperative morphine consumption and cancer progression or all-cause mortality in patients following CRC resection. ? 2019 the Author(s).

"Improved diagnostic accuracy of thallium-201 myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography with CT attenuation correction",2019,"Background: The benefits of attenuation correction (AC) in technetium-99m myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) have been well established. However, the value of thallium (Tl-201) AC and routine computed tomography AC (CTAC) were less well established. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic performance of thallium (Tl-201) MPI with additional CTAC and to determine which participants would benefit most. Methods and Results: A total of 108 consecutive patients who underwent Tl-201 MPI and received coronary angiography within 3?months were enrolled. Diagnostic performance was determined by sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed using gender and obesity. CTAC improved the area under the curve (0.84 vs. 0.77, P?=?0.037 at patient level), primarily due to a significant improvement in specificity (0.78 vs. 0.57, P?=?0.013) and no significant difference in sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.82, P?=?0.75). In subgroup analysis, CTAC was most helpful in obese subjects, men, and especially right coronary artery lesions. Conclusions: CTAC significantly improved diagnostic performance primarily by increasing the specificity, and the improvements were significantly greater in obese patients and male patients. These findings suggest that CTAC should be applied to Tl-201 MPI as routine clinical practice. ? 2018, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.","dipyridamole; dobutamine; thallium 201; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; electrocardiography; exercise test; female; gated single photon emission computed tomography; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; image quality; image reconstruction; major clinical study; male; medical record review; myocardial perfusion imaging; obese patient; obesity; predictive value; priority journal; radiation attenuation; radiodiagnosis; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; right coronary artery; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography"
"Optimizing Anticoagulation in Older Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation",2019,"Purpose of Review: We sought to review the current issues on optimization of anticoagulation in elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Recent Findings: Advanced age is a risk factor for stroke and as one advances in age, the risk of stroke also increases. One of the many challenges of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in the elderly patients with NVAF is the underutilization of anticoagulants. Commonly cited reasons for hesitation by physician in prescribing oral anticoagulants are advanced age, increase risk of bleeding, and the difficulty in maintaining an adequate time in therapeutic range and the need for frequent monitoring for those who are given warfarin. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have been shown to have similar or superior efficacy, and a better safety profile compared with warfarin due to its wider therapeutic window, low interaction with food, and less frequent monitoring of anticoagulation levels. It is also important to note that renal dysfunction is becoming increasingly common in elderly patients with AF. This poses a therapeutic challenge for physicians due to a higher bleeding risk; thus, renal function should be taken into consideration when prescribing NOACs. Warfarin, on the other hand, remains to be a viable therapeutic option in certain clinical scenarios. Summary: In elderly patients, the choice of oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in NVAF should be individualized and should include considerations for the best estimate of absolute benefit weighed against bleeding risks in order to optimize anticoagulation. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","apixaban; dabigatran; edoxaban; rivaroxaban; warfarin; aged; anticoagulation; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular accident; CHADS2 score; chronic kidney failure; decision making; embolism; end stage renal disease; health care system; hemodialysis; human; hypertension; liver function; mortality; physician; Review"
"The risk of hospitalization for motor vehicle accident injury in narcolepsy and the benefits of stimulant use: A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan",2019,"Study Objectives: To examine the risk of hospitalization for motor vehicle accident injury (MVAI) in patients with narcolepsy and the effects of stimulant use on MVAI occurrence in patients with narcolepsy. Methods: This is a population-based, retrospective cohort study using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2013. We included patients with narcolepsy based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, 347. The case and matched control participants were selected in a ratio of 1:3, and the traffic accident (ICD-9-CM codes: E810–E819) plus injury codes (ICD-9-CM codes: 800.xx–999.xx) due to MVAI following hospitalization were used for the study outcome. The type of injury, causes, intentionality, and the effects of stimulant use on patients with narcolepsy were also assessed. Results: A total of 1,316 participants were enrolled, including 329 participants with narcolepsy and 987 participants without narcolepsy. During a 14-year follow-up period, a total of 104 participants had MVAI, of whom 47 (1,559.54 per 100,000 person-years) belonged to the narcolepsy cohort and 57 (556.21 per 100,000 person-years) to the non-narcolepsy cohort. After adjusting for covariates, the risk of hospitalization for MVAI among participants with narcolepsy was still significantly higher than those without narcolepsy (adjusted hazard ratio = 6.725; 95% confidence interval = 4.421–10.231; P < .001). The use of modafinil or methylphenidate, as monotherapy or combined treatment, was associated with a lower risk of MVAI in the narcolepsy cohort. Conclusions: Patients with narcolepsy may have a higher risk of hospitalization for MVAI and stimulant use could mitigate such risk. ? 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

"Reconfirmation of newly discovered risk factors of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes: A case-control study",2019,"Aims The aim of the present study was to investigate the major determinants of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), considering the traditional and newly discovered risk factors, including hypoglycaemia and glycemic variability. Methods This retrospective case-control study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan. A total of 2,837 patients with T2D were recruited, medical history and biochemical data were obtained, and patients were screened for DPN using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). DPN was defined as an MNSI exam score > 2. A stepwise selection of variables was used based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz Criterion (SC). Multivariate analysis was performed using the identified variables obtained from the stepwise selection. Results Among the recruited patients, 604 (21.3%) were found to have DPN. 275 patients with DPN were selected because of longer follow up period before enrollment and complete data of glycemic parameters, and paired with 351 patients with T2D without DPN and matched for age, gender, and diabetes duration. The results of the stepwise selection showed that the presence of moderately and severely increased albuminuria yielded the lowest values of AIC and SC, which indicate the best predictive performance. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that moderately and severely increased albuminuria and greater long-term glycemic variability significantly increased the risk of DPN, with a corresponding odds ratio of 1.85 and 1.61 (95%confidence intervals of 1.25-2.73and1.02-2.55, respectively), after adjusted for hypoglycaemia and types of diabetes treatment. Conclusions Albuminuria is a potent predictor of DPN, and greater long-term glycemic variabilityis clearly associated with DPN in adults with T2D. These findings indicate that, in addition to achieve average blood glucose control, screening for albuminuria and reducing blood glucose fluctuations might be useful for improving diabetic microvascular complications. ? 2019 Pai et al.","glucose; adult; age distribution; aged; Akaike Information Criterion; albuminuria; Article; case control study; cohort analysis; confidence interval; controlled study; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic patient; disease duration; female; follow up; glucose blood level; glycemic variability; human; hypoglycemia; information processing; major clinical study; male; medical history; Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument; multivariate analysis; neurologic disease assessment; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutritional parameters; odds ratio; retrospective study; risk factor; Schwarz Criterion; sex difference; statistical analysis; Taiwan; tertiary care center"
"Rural-urban disparities in family physician practice patterns: A nationwide survey in Taiwan",2019,"Introduction: In a world with increasing urbanization, rural-urban disparities in health care utilization have been a long-term concern. However, the details regarding the practice patterns of family physicians in Taiwan have not received sufficient attention thus far. Methods: The National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan offered 0.2% of the total ambulatory visit records for Taiwan in 2013. Records from community clinics of family medicine were collected, with the clinics categorized as rural, suburban, or urban area clinics according to their locations. Results: Among 100?334 visits to family medicine clinics, the median patient age was 50?years for urban clinics, 51 for suburban clinics, and 58 for rural clinics. The distributions of patient ages differed in the three areas (P?<?0.001). Four types of chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers) accounted for 10.8%, 11.3%, and 13.6%, of the visits to urban, suburban, and rural clinics, respectively. The most common procedure was wound treatment, and the pattern of the top 10 procedures was similar in the three areas. Conclusion: Although rural patients in Taiwan were older and had more chronic diseases than urban and suburban patients, the pattern of procedures undertaken by rural family physicians did not differ from those of urban and suburban family physicians. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; aged; clinical practice; factual database; female; general practitioner; health service; human; male; middle aged; questionnaire; rural health care; Taiwan; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physicians, Family; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Rural Health Services; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Urban Health Services"
"Resistin facilitates VEGF-A-dependent angiogenesis by inhibiting miR-16-5p in human chondrosarcoma cells",2019,"Resistin is an adipokine that is associated with obesity, inflammation, and various cancers. Chondrosarcomas are primary malignant bone tumors that have a poor prognosis. VEGF-A is a critical angiogenic factor that is known to promote angiogenesis and metastasis in chondrosarcoma. It is unknown as to whether resistin affects human chondrosarcoma angiogenesis. In this study, we show how resistin promotes VEGF-A expression and subsequently induces angiogenesis of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Resistin treatment activated the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt signaling pathways, while PI3K and Akt inhibitors or siRNA diminished resistin-induced VEGF-A expression. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed the downregulation of micro RNA (miR)-16-5p in resistin-induced VEGF-A expression and EPCs angiogenesis. We also found a positive correlation between resistin and VEGF-A expression, and a negative correlation between resistin and VEGF-A with miR-16-5p in chondrosarcoma patients. These findings reveal that resistin facilitates VEGF-A expression and angiogenesis through the inhibition of miR-16-5p expression via PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Resistin may be a promising target in chondrosarcoma angiogenesis. ? 2019, The Author(s).","2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; microRNA; microRNA 16 5p; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein kinase B inhibitor; resistin; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; vasculotropin A; wortmannin; Akt signaling; angiogenesis; animal experiment; Article; cancer patient; chondrosarcoma; controlled study; endothelial progenitor cell; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; JJ012 cell line; male; mouse; nonhuman; Pi3K/Akt signaling; priority journal; protein expression; SW1353 cell line; tumor microenvironment"
"Targeting optimal time for hyperbaric oxygen therapy following carbon monoxide poisoning for prevention of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae: A retrospective study",2019,"Objectives: Delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) are serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning; neuropsychiatric disorders can occur within a few days of recovery from acute poisoning. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been the main treatment of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and was recommended as the treatment choice for CO poisoning by the American Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society and the Tenth European Consensus Conference on Hyperbaric Medicine of the European Underwater and Baromedical Society. However, the optimal timing for commencing HBOT in patients with CO poisoning remains unknown. We therefore conducted a retrospective study in an attempt to target the optimal time of HBOT for DNS prevention. Methods: A retrospective review of patient files/medical records was conducted on all patients with CO poisoning admitted to the Emergency Department of Linkou Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2015. A total of 279 patients who received HBOT were eligible for further DNS detection. DNS was defined as the presence of one of the following neurological, cognitive, or psychological sequelae that were documented in the medical record during hospital stay or outpatient clinic follow-up for at least 6 months. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify potential determinants of DNS after receiving HBOT for CO poisoning. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyse the influence of duration from CO exposure to HBOT on DNS development. Results: A Glasgow coma score of <9 (odds ratio [OR], 3.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19–8.60) and a longer duration from CO exposure to HBOT (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03–1.09) were associated with a higher risk of DNS. By contrast, the presence of multiple victims from the same incident was associated with a lower risk of DNS. The ROC curve for the duration between CO exposure and HBOT in predicting DNS development demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.638 (95% CI, 0.575–0.698). The optimal cut-off point according to the Youden index was 22.5 h, with a sensitivity of 41.7% and a specificity of 85.9%. We also stratified the duration from CO exposure to HBOT into 5 intervals (< 6 h, 6–11 h, 12–23 h, 24–47 h and ? 48 h) and revealed a trend of increasing DNS risk with time. Conclusions: We identified several potential predictors of DNS in patients with CO poisoning who received HBOT. Multivariable logistic regressions further revealed that longer duration from CO exposure to HBOT, loss of consciousness, and the presence of multiple victims were independent predictors of DNS development. HBOT should be performed as early as possible and preferably within 22.5 h after CO poisoning. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","carbon monoxide; adult; amnesia; anxiety; apraxia; Article; ataxia; bradykinesia; carbon monoxide intoxication; cerebral blindness; chorea; cognitive defect; consciousness; delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae; dementia; depression; dysphasia; EEG abnormality; emergency ward; epilepsy; feces incontinence; female; follow up; gait disorder; Glasgow coma scale; headache; hearing impairment; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; insomnia; intention tremor; major clinical study; male; mania; medical record review; mental disease; mental instability; motor dysfunction; myoclonus; outpatient department; parkinsonism; peripheral neuropathy; personality disorder; postural instability; priority journal; psychosis; retrospective study; Taiwan; tinnitus; tremor; urine incontinence; vertigo; Youden index; blood gas analysis; brain; carbon monoxide intoxication; complication; computed tomography scanner; diagnostic imaging; Glasgow outcome scale; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; mental disease; middle aged; procedures; psychological rating scale; receiver operating characteristic; treatment outcome; Adult; Blood Gas Analysis; Brain; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Female; Glasgow Outcome Scale; Humans; Hyperbaric Oxygenation; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome"
"Risk factors of second surgery for adjacent segment disease following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion: A 16-year cohort study",2019,"Background: Although the incidence of second surgery for adjacent segment disease (ASD) after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been reported, its risk factors remain elusive. Few studies have had a sufficiently large number of patients, long follow-up time, and high follow-up rate for investigation. To identify non-surgical risk factors of second surgery for ASD following ACDF, the study used a national cohort with comprehensive follow-up. Materials and methods: All second ACDF surgery after one year from the first ACDF were identified as a consequence of ASD that required another surgery. A multivariate competing risk survival model, Kaplan-Meier survivorship, and average time to events were calculated. Results: Among 38,149 patients who had the first ACDF, 1,092 (2.9%) later (mean 4.66 years) received a second ACDF surgery, during the nearly-perfect follow-up of 16 years. Young age and psychiatric disorders were independent risk factors. Patients who were aged under 40, 50, 60 and 70 years were, respectively, 4.56, 4.09, 3.09 and 2.17 times more likely than those older than 70 years. Also, patients with depression or psychoses were, respectively, 1.42 and 1.45 times more likely to have second surgery for ASD. (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: Young age and psychiatric disorders are independent risk factors of second ACDF surgery for ASD. Personalized strategies to ameliorate or postpone the development of ASD are therefore warranted for patients who need ACDF surgery. ? 2019 IJS Publishing Group Ltd","adjacent segment disease; adult; aged; anterior spine fusion; Article; cohort analysis; depression; discectomy; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; postoperative complication; priority journal; risk factor; surgical risk; surgical technique; adverse event; age; cervical vertebra; complication; discectomy; incidence; mental disease; postoperative complication; reoperation; retrospective study; spine disease; spine fusion; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Cervical Vertebrae; Cohort Studies; Diskectomy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Spinal Diseases; Spinal Fusion"
"Social interaction skills and depressive symptoms in people diagnosed with schizophrenia: The mediating role of auditory hallucinations",2019,"Past studies have presented evidence that depressive symptoms are affected in different ways by social interaction skills and auditory hallucinatory symptoms in people with schizophrenia. However, few studies have focused on examining the relationship among auditory hallucinatory severity, social interaction skills, and depressive symptoms. This study aimed to explore the mediating effect of auditory hallucinatory severity on social interaction skills and depressive symptoms in people with long-term schizophrenia. We propose that auditory hallucination severity functions as a mechanism through which impaired social interaction skills increase depressive symptoms. In this study, a convenience sample of 186 people with schizophrenia was obtained from hospital-based rehabilitation wards. Four instruments were used: A demographic data questionnaire, the Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills-Chinese version, the Characteristics of Auditory Hallucinations Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory II. To investigate the mediating effect of auditory hallucinatory severity after controlling for six covariates, we tested an indirect effect in a simple mediation model using the SPSS macro PROCESS, which is a regression-based approach. The indirect effect and the results of Sobel’s test were significant (Z?=??2.824, P?=?0.005), which confirms that auditory hallucination severity mediates social interaction skills and depressive symptoms. This finding suggests that psychiatric nurses must teach people with schizophrenia to use auditory hallucination management strategies to prevent them from becoming immersed in auditory hallucinations and reducing their social interaction with the real world, so that depressive symptoms can be improved. ? 2019 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.",""
"Inadequate prenatal care utilization among women with and without methadone-treated opioid use disorders in Taiwan",2019,"Aims: The present study aims to investigate the utilization pattern of prenatal care and correlates for women with opioid use disorders (OUD) in Taiwan. Method: Using the data linkage between the Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) register with national health insurance, national birth notification system, and birth registration system, we identified 1712 pregnancies with 20 or more gestational weeks from women enrolled in the MMT (heroin-exposed: receiving no methadone treatment during pregnancy, n = 1053 by 882 women; methadone-treated: receiving methadone for at least one day during pregnancy, n = 659 by 574 women) and their 1:10 matched pregnancies from 17,060 women without substance use disorder in the period of 2004-2013. The generalized linear mixed models with negative binomial and logit distributions were performed to evaluate the relationship between individual sociodemographic, health, and addiction treatment characteristics with the number of prenatal visits and receiving prenatal care in the first trimester (i.e., early entry). Findings: Eighteen percent of pregnancies by women with OUD received no prenatal services and 21% had started prenatal care in the first trimester as compared with 1% and 46% in pregnancies by women without substance use disorders. For pregnancies by women with OUD, methadone treatment was not linked associated with prenatal care visits (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.02; 95% = 0.92, 1.12). For methadone-treated pregnancies, treatment enrollment before pregnancy and spousal methadone treatment elevated prenatal visits by 8% and 18% (0.48 and 1.08 visits, respectively). Additionally, HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.10, 0.83) and prior delivery (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.19) significantly reduced the odds of early entry into prenatal care. Conclusion: Integrating addiction treatment programs with prenatal care is urgently needed to increase adequate prenatal care for pregnant women with OUD, especially the multiparous ones. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","methadone; adult; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlational study; female; first trimester pregnancy; health care utilization; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; marriage; maternal age; obstetric delivery; opiate addiction; outpatient; prenatal care; priority journal; retrospective study; risk; Taiwan; unemployment; urban area"
"Official websites of local health centers in Taiwan: A nationwide study",2019,"Local health centers (LHCs) play a key role in public health. Because it has now become popular to seek health information on the Internet, an effective website is indispensable to an LHC. Our study aimed to survey the official websites of LHCs in Taiwan with an evaluation framework. All 369 LHCs in Taiwan were surveyed in March 2018. The evaluation indicators included health information, online interactive services, technical features, institutional information, links to external resources, website management, the last updated time, and number of visitors. The indicators were stratified by the urbanization levels of the LHCs. In total, 98.0% (n = 360) of the LHCs had official websites. The majority (n = 241) of the websites were updated within the past 30 days, and most of the websites (n = 353) provided health information. However, the information provided varied considerably. Few LHCs (n = 31) provided online interactive services in terms of an online appointment function. In terms of providing online consultation services, rural LHCs outperformed suburban and urban LHCs (16.4% versus 14.5% and 6.0%, respectively). Most LHCs in Taiwan do not seem to take full advantage of the Internet, with their websites typically serving as static bulletin boards instead of new channels of communication. Further studies could focus on the effectiveness of these websites. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Effects of National Health Insurance on household out-of-pocket expenditure structure",2019,"Achieving universal health insurance coverage is a major objective for many countries. Taiwan implemented its National Health Insurance (NHI) program with universal coverage in 1995. This study investigates whether the NHI program affects the level and structures of out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures. We used data from the Taiwan Survey of Family Income and Expenditure released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. We identified a case and a control group and then employed coarsened exact matching to match the two groups using several available variables. We then conducted a difference-in-difference analysis and determined that there was a statistically significant negative effect on OOP expenditure that was attributable to NHI (a reduction of 2.11 percentage points in total household expenditure). The largest reductions were found in health care services (?1.63%) and pharmaceuticals (?0.45%). We found a statistically significant positive effect on purchases of private insurance related to health care, which was attributable to NHI (an increase of 0.96 percentage points in household budget share). In addition, we discovered that the NHI program had a greater impact on households of a lower socioeconomic status compared with higher socioeconomic status households. The structure of OOP payments in the post-NHI period remained similar to that of the pre-NHI period in the full sample but varied slightly depending on the educational level of the head of the household. ? 2018","health care; health expenditure; health insurance; health services; household expenditure; income distribution; socioeconomic status; article; budget; controlled study; family income; head; health care cost; household; human; national health insurance; social status; statistics; Taiwan; Taiwan"
"Relationship between the extent of aortic replacement and stent graft for acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection and outcomes: Results from a medical center in Taiwan",2019,"Background Total arch replacement (TAR) and/or stent graft implantation has been proposed as the primary surgical treatment for acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection. However, the suggestion was based on excellent outcomes of high-volume or aortic centers. How about the real results in most places around the world? The purpose of this study was intended to compared in-hospital mortality, major complications, and aortic remodeling between TAR and/or stent graft implantation in a medical center of northern Taiwan. Methods Between January 2008 and August 2017, 156 patients with acute type I aortic dissection underwent surgery at our institution, including proximal aortic replacement only (Group I, n = 72), concomitant TAR (Group II, n = 23), concomitant TAR extended with stent grafting (Group III, n = 45), and proximal aortic replacement with descending aortic stent grafting (Group IV, n = 16). Results No significant differences were found in underlying disease and preoperative presentations, including operative risk among four groups. Overall in-hospital mortality was 22.4% (13 patients in Group I, 9 in Group II, 12 in Group III, and 1 in Group IV). New-onset stroke occurred in 15 patients postoperatively (3 patients [5.2%] in Group I, 3 [21.4%] in Group II, and 9 [26.5%] in Group III after excluding 36 patients with documented preoperative cerebrovascular accident or cerebral malperfusion). Root reconstruction and TAR were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. TAR was significantly associated with surgery-related stroke. Compared to those in Group I, true lumen expansion and false lumen shrinkage during 1-year aortic remodeling were significantly higher in Groups III and IV. Both TAR and descending aorta stent grafting were significantly associated with decreased risk of patent false lumen. Conclusions Proximal aortic replacement remains the preferred surgical strategy for acute type I aortic dissection, with lower mortality and neurological complications. Proximal descending aorta stent grafting may benefit aortic remodeling, even without TAR. ? 2019 Hsu et al.

"Micro-PET imaging of fluoroacetate combined with FDG to differentiate chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection from an acute bacterial infection in a mouse model: A preliminary study",2019,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide and is responsible for 1.7 million deaths per year. The increase in multidrug-resistant TB poses formidable challenges to the global control of tuberculosis. TB infection could easily yield false-positive results in fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging for cancer detection because of its high FDG uptake. We describe the combined FDG PET with fluorine-18-fluoroacetate (FAC), a promising analog of carbon-11-acetate, for targeting glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis, respectively, to determine the metabolic differences between chronic TB infection and acute infection.Materials and methodsSix-month-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with Mycobacterium bovis to induce chronic TB infection, and Escherichia coli as well as Staphylococcus aureus to induce acute infection for an in-vivo imaging study. Eighteen days after inoculation for chronic TB infection and 5 days for acute infection, both FDG and FAC micro-PET were performed on the infected mice. Analysis of variance and the Tukey honest ad-hoc test were carried out to determine differences among treatment with different bacterial infections.ResultsTB infection showed much lower FAC accumulation than acute infection. However, both TB infection and acute infection exhibited high FAC accumulation.ConclusionThe marked metabolic differences in de novo lipogenesis and glycolysis in FDG and FAC uptakes in micro-PET imaging, respectively, help to differentiate chronic TB infection from acute infection. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Microbial etiology of pneumonia in patients with decreased renal function",2019,"Background Patients with renal impairment have altered immunity, which might cause vulnerability to specific pathogens and worsen pneumonia-related outcomes. Nonetheless, the microbiological features of pneumonia in patients with decreased renal function remain unknown. Methods Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study enrolling adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia to assess this knowledge gap. The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and first sputum microbiology during hospitalization were used for statistical analyses. Results Overall, 1554 patients hospitalized with pneumonia (mean age, 76.1 ± 16.7) were included, and 162 patients had died at the end of hospitalization. The cutoff eGFR value predicting mortality was &lt;55 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , which defined decreased renal function in this study. Patients with decreased renal function demonstrated a significantly higher risk of fungi and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. On the other hand, this group of patients showed significantly higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which associated with higher mortality. Additionally, patients with S. aureus had a significantly lower eGFR, lymphocyte count and a higher NLR. Conclusions These findings suggested the altered immunity and vulnerability to S. aureus infection in patients with decreased renal function, which may be the underlying cause of worse outcomes of pneumonia in this group of patients. ? 2019 Chen et al.

"Reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with tenofovir - A propensity score-matched study",2019,"Background The effect of newer oral anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) medication, tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), on liver-related outcomes among Asians is limited. We examined the effect of TDF on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an Asian population with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of 6914 adults with chronic HBV monoinfection and no history of transplantation who were recruited from 6 US referral, community medical centers and a community based Taiwan cohort for a total of 774 patients who received TDF and 6140 who were not treated. Propensity score matching (PSM) for age, sex, HBV e antigen status, HBV DNA level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, baseline cirrhosis status, and follow-up time was performed to balance the groups, resulting in 591 treated individuals and 591 untreated individuals. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the cumulative risk of HCC. Cox proportional hazards models were run to estimate the HCC risk between groups. Results The 8-year cumulative HCC incidence was significantly higher in the PSM untreated group (20.13% vs 4.69%; P <.0001). Cirrhosis was a significant predictor for HCC (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 5.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.73-10.51; P <.001). On multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, HBV DNA level, ALT level, and study site, TDF was associated with a 77% reduction in the risk of HCC (aHR, 0.23; 95% CI,.56-.92) in patients with cirrhosis and a 73% reduction (aHR, 0.27; 95% CI,.07-.98) in patients without cirrhosis. Conclusions Among cirrhotic and noncirrhotic Asian patients with CHB, TDF therapy was significantly associated with a reduction in the 8-year HCC cumulative incidence rate. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Risk factors for upper gastrointestinal bleeding among aspirin users: An old issue with new findings from a population-based cohort study",2019,"Background/purpose: We aimed to identify the risk factors of first-time occurrence of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) among aspirin users after adjusting for confounding factors like age, gender, underlying co-morbidities, and medications. Methods: Using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan and matching age, gender, underlying co-morbidities and enrollment time by propensity score, 11105 aspirin users and 11105 controls were identified for comparison from a cohort dataset of 1,000,000 randomly sampled subjects. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify independent risk factors for first-time occurrence of non-variceal UGIB in the study cohort and in the aspirin users after adjusting for age, gender, underlying co-morbidities, and medications (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitors, steroids, thienopyridines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, warfarin, and dipyridamole). Results: By Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, aspirin use increased the risk of first-time occurrence of UGIB (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28–1.72). Age, male gender, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)infection, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cirrhosis, history of uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and use of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, steroids, and thienopyridines were independent risk factors for UGIB among aspirin users. Conclusion: In addition to age, male gender, H. pylori infection, and concomitant use of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, steroids, and thienopyridines, underlying co-morbidities including diabetes, CKD, cirrhosis, history of PUD are also important risk factors for first-time occurrence of non-variceal UGIB in aspirin users. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","acetylsalicylic acid; clopidogrel; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor; dipyridamole; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; serotonin uptake inhibitor; steroid; ticlopidine; warfarin; acetylsalicylic acid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; pyridine derivative; steroid; thienopyridine derivative; adult; age; Article; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; Helicobacter infection; human; liver cirrhosis; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; middle aged; morbidity; national health insurance; peptic ulcer; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; Taiwan; upper gastrointestinal bleeding; aged; complication; factual database; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; Kaplan Meier method; proportional hazards model; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Aspirin; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors; Databases, Factual; Female; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Pyridines; Risk Factors; Steroids; Taiwan"
"Presence of Gold Nanoparticles in Cells Associated with the Cell-Killing Effect of Modulated Electro-Hyperthermia",2019,"The efficacy of gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-assisted radiofrequency (RF)-induced hyperthermia employing the Kanzius device remains controversial. Different from the Kanzius device, modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) utilizes the capacitive-impedance coupled 13.56 MHz radiofrequency (RF) current and has been approved for clinical cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the heating characteristics of spherical-, urchin-, and rod-like AuNPs of a similar 50 nm size upon exposure to a 13.56 MHz radiofrequency using the LabEHY-105CL, an in vivo mEHT device. We found that, regardless of the AuNPs' sphere-, urchin- or rod-like shape, purified gold nanoparticle solution would not promote heat generation. The temperature elevation during radiofrequency irradiation was solely attributed to the ionic background of the solution. The AuNPs present in the medium (?25 ppm) showed no effect on selective cell killing of malignant cells, whereas the AuNPs incorporated in the cells diminished the cell selectivity as well as cell death and acted as protectors in mEHT cancer treatment.

Here we present a comprehensive overview of the safety data from these studies. Methods: Adults aged ?50 (ZOE-50) and ?70 (ZOE-70) years were randomly vaccinated with RZV or placebo. Safety analyses were performed on the pooled total vaccinated cohort, consisting of participants receiving at least one dose of RZV or placebo. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected for 7 and 30 days after each vaccination, respectively. Serious AEs (SAEs) were collected from the first vaccination until 12 months post-last dose. Fatal AEs, vaccination-related SAEs, and potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were collected during the entire study period. Results: Safety was evaluated in 14,645 RZV and 14,660 placebo recipients. More RZV than placebo recipients reported unsolicited AEs (50.5% versus 32.0%); the difference was driven by transient injection site and solicited systemic reactions that were generally seen in the first week post-vaccination. The occurrence of overall SAEs (RZV: 10.1%; Placebo: 10.4%), fatal AEs (RZV: 4.3%; Placebo: 4.6%), and pIMDs (RZV: 1.2%; Placebo: 1.4%) was balanced between groups. The occurrence of possible exacerbations of pIMDs was rare and similar between groups. Overall, except for the expected local and systemic symptoms, the safety results were comparable between the RZV and Placebo groups irrespective of participant age, gender, or race. Conclusions: No safety concerns arose, supporting the favorable benefit-risk profile of RZV. ? 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA","placebo; varicella zoster vaccine; acute kidney failure; adult; age distribution; aged; alopecia areata; aortic stenosis; arthralgia; Article; atrial fibrillation; autoimmune pancreatitis; autoimmune thyroiditis; backache; brain infarction; cardiogenic shock; cardiopulmonary insufficiency; celiac disease; cerebrovascular accident; chill; chronic gastritis; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; coughing; Crohn disease; disease course; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; erythema nodosum; facial nerve paralysis; fatigue; female; fever; fibrosing alveolitis; follow up; glomerulonephritis; Graves disease; Guillain Barre syndrome; headache; heart atrium flutter; heart failure; heart infarction; herpes zoster; human; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; information processing; injection site erythema; injection site pain; injection site pruritus; injection site swelling; injection site warmth; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lichen planus; lung fibrosis; lung tumor; major clinical study; malaise; male; mixed connective tissue disease; multiple organ failure; multiple sclerosis; myalgia; neuritis; oropharynx pain; pancreas carcinoma; paraneoplastic neuropathy; pemphigus; phase 3 clinical trial; pneumonia; polyradiculoneuropathy; population research; priority journal; psoriasis; psoriatic arthritis; race; radiculitis; randomized controlled trial; Raynaud phenomenon; respiratory failure; retina detachment; rheumatic polymyalgia; rheumatoid arthritis; rhinopharyngitis; sepsis; septic shock; sex ratio; single blind procedure; spondyloarthropathy; supraventricular tachycardia; syndrome CREST; systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; tachycardia; temporal arteritis; trigeminal nerve disease; trigeminus neuralgia; ulcerative colitis; upper respiratory tract infection; uveitis; vaccination; vitiligo"
"Early stage mechanical remodeling of collagen surrounding head and neck squamous cell carcinoma spheroids correlates strongly with their invasion capability",2019,"Mechanical remodeling of stromal collagen, such as reorientation and deformation of collagen matrix, generated by invading cancer cells, plays an important role in the progression of cancer invasion and metastasis. In this study, we applied time-lapse microscopy in conjunction with particle displacement mapping to analyze time-dependent contraction and expansion deformations of collagen surrounding individual spheroids of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells (HNSCC), OECM-1 & SAS, as the cancer cells detached from the spheroid and invaded into the surrounding 3D collagen matrix. Our results revealed that highly-invasive HNSCC spheroids, stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), generated a strong contraction deformation of the surrounding collagen in the very early stage, and aligned the collagen fibers radially with respect to the center of the spheroid. This initial collagen contraction deformation generated by the HNSCC spheroid bears a strong positive correlation with the overall extent of subsequent cancer cells invasion; hence, it may serve as an early indicator of the invasion capability of the HNSCC spheroids. Statement of Significance: Mechanical remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) generated by cancer cells plays an important role in the progression of cancer invasion and metastasis. We observed that the extent of initial contraction deformation of collagen surrounding a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell (HNSCC) spheroid played an indispensable role in early stage to promote cancer cells invasion into the surrounding ECM. Our results revealed that more invasive HNSCC spheroids generated a larger extent of initial collagen contraction to align the surrounding collagen and to promote cancer cells invasion. This initial collagen contraction deformation generated by the HNSCC spheroids bears a strong positive correlation with the overall extent of cancer cells invasion; hence, it may serve as an early indicator of the invasion capability of the HNSCC spheroids. ? 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.","4 amino 6 [2 [[4 (diethylamino) 1 methylbutyl]amino] 6 methyl 4 pyrimidinyl] 2 methylquinoline; collagen; epidermal growth factor; Article; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; collagen fiber; collagen fibril; controlled study; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; human cell; OECM-1 cell line; priority journal; SAS cell line; time-lapse microscopy; tumor invasion; tumor spheroid"
"Striatal functional connectivity in chronic ketamine users: a pilot study",2020,"Background: The striatum supports motivated behavior and impulse control. Altered striatal activation and connectivity has been observed in link with impulse control dysfunction in individuals with drug addiction. Objectives: We examined how resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the striatum is altered as a result of chronic ketamine misuse. Methods: Thirty-six ketamine users (10 women) and 20 healthy controls (9 women) completed an assessment with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and magnetic resonance imaging. In SPM we examined voxel-wise connectivities of the caudate, pallidum, putamen, and ventral striatum in ketamine users (versus healthy controls) and in association with BIS-11 score and duration of use, all at a corrected threshold. Results: Compared to controls, ketamine users showed higher connectivity between caudate and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and between pallidum and bilateral cerebellum. In ketamine users, putamen showed higher connectivity with the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in association with both BIS-11 score and months of ketamine use. Mediation analyses suggest that the connectivity z score mediated the relationship between impulsivity and duration of use. Conclusions: These preliminary findings highlighted altered striatal connectivity in chronic ketamine users, and the potential role of putamen OFC connectivity in supporting the correlation between impulsivity and duration of ketamine use. If replicated in a larger sample, these findings may represent neural markers of ketamine misuse. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",""
"Association of Daily Aspirin Therapy with Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B",2019,"Importance: Antiviral therapy cannot erase hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and it is not indicated for most hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. Another effective way of reducing HCC risk needs to be developed. Aspirin may prevent cancer development, but clinical evidence in patients with HBV-related HCC remains limited. Objective: To investigate the association of daily aspirin therapy with HBV-related HCC risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this Taiwan nationwide cohort study, we screened 204507 patients with chronic hepatitis B for the period January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2012. After excluding patients with confounding conditions, 2123 patients who continuously received daily aspirin for 90 or more days (treated group) were randomly matched 1:4 with 8492 patients who had never received antiplatelet therapy (untreated group) by means of propensity scores, consisting of the follow-up index date, baseline characteristics, and potentially chemopreventive drug use during follow-up. Data were analyzed from August 1 to November 30, 2018. Exposures: Daily aspirin therapy during the study period. Main Outcomes and Measures: Both cumulative incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for HCC development were analyzed after adjusting patient mortality as a competing risk event. Results: Of the 10 615 patients included in the analysis, 7690 (72.4%) were men; mean (SD) age was 58.8 (11.8) years. The cumulative incidence of HCC in the treated group was significantly lower than that in the untreated group in 5 years (5.20%; 95% CI, 4.11%-6.29% vs 7.87%; 95% CI, 7.15%-8.60%; P <.001). In the multivariable regression analysis, aspirin therapy was independently associated with a reduced HCC risk (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.86; P <.001). Sensitivity subgroup analyses also verified this association (all HRs <1.0). In addition, older age (HR, 1.01 per year; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02), male sex (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.43-2.14), and cirrhosis (HR, 2.89; 95% CI, 2.45-3.40) were independently associated with an increased HCC risk, but nucleos(t)ide analogue (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41-0.71) or statin (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.90) use was correlated with a decreased HCC risk. Conclusions and Relevance: Daily aspirin therapy may be associated with a reduced risk of HBV-related HCC. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Differences between national and international guidelines for the management of diabetic foot disease",2019,"Aim: No studies have investigated if national guidelines to manage diabetic foot disease differ from international guidelines. This study aimed to compare guidelines of Western Pacific nations with the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) guidance documents. Methods: The 77 recommendations in five chapters of the 2015 IWGDF guidance documents were used as the international gold standard reference. The IWGDF national representative(s) from 12 Western Pacific nations were invited to submit their nation's diabetic foot guideline(s). Four investigators rated information in the national guidelines as “similar,” “partially similar,” “not similar,” or “different” when compared with IWGDF recommendations. National representative(s) reviewed findings. Disagreements in ratings were discussed until consensus agreement achieved. Results: Eight of 12 nations (67%) responded: Australia, China, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Thailand provided national guidelines; Singapore provided the Association of Southeast Asian Nations guidelines; and Hong Kong and the Philippines advised no formal national diabetic foot guidelines existed. The six national guidelines included were 39% similar/partially similar, 58% not similar, and 2% different compared with the IWGDF recommendations. Within individual IWGDF chapters, the six national guidelines were similar/partially similar with 53% of recommendations for the IWGDF prevention chapter, 42% for wound healing, 40% for infection, 40% for peripheral artery disease, and 20% for offloading. Conclusions: National diabetic foot disease guidelines from a large and diverse region of the world showed limited similarity to recommendations made by international guidelines. Differences between recommendations may contribute to differences in national diabetic foot disease outcomes and burdens. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article; Australia; China; consensus; diabetic foot; evidence based medicine; global disease burden; Hong Kong; human; infection; New Zealand; peripheral occlusive artery disease; Philippines; practice guideline; priority journal; Singapore; South Korea; Taiwan; Thailand; wound healing; adult; comparative study; diabetic foot; disease management; evidence based medicine; female; international cooperation; male; practice guideline; public health; standards; Adult; Diabetic Foot; Disease Management; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Humans; International Agencies; Male; National Health Programs; Practice Guidelines as Topic"
"Specific activation of pro-infliximab enhances selectivity and safety of rheumatoid arthritis therapy",2019,"During rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, long-term injection of antitumor necrosis factor α antibodies (anti-TNFα Abs) may induce on-target toxicities, including severe infections (tuberculosis [TB] or septic arthritis) and malignancy. Here, we used an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) hinge as an Ab lock to cover the TNFα-binding site of Infliximab by linking it with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 substrate to generate pro-Infliximab that can be specifically activated in the RA region to enhance the selectivity and safety of treatment. The Ab lock significantly inhibits the TNFα binding and reduces the anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) Ab binding to pro-Infliximab by 395-fold, 108-fold compared with Infliximab, respectively, and MMP-2/9 can completely restore the TNFα neutralizing ability of pro-Infliximab to block TNFα downstream signaling. Pro-Infliximab was only selectively activated in the disease site (mouse paws) and presented similar pharmacokinetics (PKs) and bio-distribution to Infliximab. Furthermore, pro-Infliximab not only provided equivalent therapeutic efficacy to Infliximab but also maintained mouse immunity against Listeria infection in the RA mouse model, leading to a significantly higher survival rate (71%) than that of the Infliximab treatment group (0%). The high-selectivity pro-Infliximab maintains host immunity and keeps the original therapeutic efficiency, providing a novel strategy for RA therapy. ? 2019 Lu et al.","gelatinase A; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin G1; infliximab; pro infliximab; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; comparative study; controlled study; drug binding site; drug distribution; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug safety; drug selectivity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; histopathology; human; immunity; in vivo study; listeriosis; mouse; nonhuman; rheumatoid arthritis; signal transduction; survival rate; Western blotting"
"Current status of dialysis and vascular access in Taiwan",2019,"Due to the implementation of the National Health Insurance system in 1995, the number of patients receiving maintenance dialysis has increased rapidly. This contributed to Taiwan to be in an unfortunate position of possessing the highest prevalence of end-stage renal disease globally. Although the age-standardized incidence of end-stage renal disease gradually decreased to ?1.1% in 2014, the huge economic burden that comes with dialysis is detrimental to the quality of dialysis treatment. To achieve a balance between economy and quality of care requires multidisciplinary cooperation. Through a variety of chronic kidney disease–related care projects, we have gradually reversed this situation and achieved good results. Further promotion of kidney transplantation and hospice care for terminal patients will improve the situation. With respect to vascular access, the “fistula first” policy is carried out and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is the mainstay of treatment to resolve vascular access dysfunction. The medical expenses for dialysis and vascular access management are both fully paid for by the National Health Insurance, and patients do not have to worry about the medical expenses. However, the statistics and vascular access monitoring are relatively insufficient in the past. The comprehensive integration of vascular access management into public policy related to kidney disease will complete the missing piece of the puzzle of overall care. ?

"Less barium enema, more colonoscopy: A 12-year nationwide population-based study in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common and third most fatal cancer in Taiwan. To reduce incidence and mortality rates from cancer, including CRC, the Health Promotion Administration in Taiwan initiated the National Program on Cancer Prevention in 2005. For patients who have a positive fecal occult blood test, colonoscopy is recommended, and double-contrast barium enema (BE) is reserved as an alternative for those who cannot receive colonoscopy. In addition, single-contrast BE is sometimes used in pediatrics to evaluate colonic condition. This study evaluated the usage trends of BE and colonoscopy in Taiwan. Methods: Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database from 2001 to 2013 were used in this study. Patients who received BE and colonoscopy were identified using the procedure codes of the National Health Insurance program. Age-standardized, yearly rates of BE and colonoscopy procedures were calculated. Results: According to the data, the total number of colonoscopies increased 3.7-fold from 2001 to 2013. The compound annual growth rates for BE and colonoscopy were ?5.36% and 10.47%, respectively, during the same period. The compound annual growth rates for BE and colonoscopy were ?3.89% and 11.64% from 2005 to 2009, and ?11.36% and 9.82% from 2010 to 2013, respectively. BE was conducted significantly more frequently than colonoscopy in patients who were aged <12 years and in female patients. Conclusion: Professional association guidelines, national cancer prevention programs, patient and physician preferences, and increasing awareness and knowledge of CRC may all contribute to the increasing use of colonoscopy and the dramatic decline in the use of BE in Taiwan.

"Concomitant Genetic Alterations are Associated with Worse Clinical Outcome in EGFR Mutant NSCLC Patients Treated with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors",2019,"Epidermal growth factor receptor- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) are recommended first-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitizing EGFR mutations. It is of clinical interest to identify concurrent genetic mutations in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations in the hopes of discovering predictive biomarkers towards EGFR-TKI treatment. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC who underwent treatment with first generation TKIs at our hospital by a multi-gene panel via next generation sequencing. A total of 33 patients with mutant EGFR were enrolled. Up to 26 (78.8%) patients had at least one concomitant genetic alteration coexisting with mutant EGFR. Among the concomitant genetic alterations discovered, TP53 mutation was most common (n = 10,30.3%), followed by CDK4 (n = 8, 24.2%) and CDKN2A (n = 7, 21.2%)copy number variation (CNV). Progression-free survival was shorter in patients with concomitant FGFR3 mutation (1.6 vs. 12.6 months, P = .003) and CDKN2A CNV loss (6.5 vs. 13.4months, P = .019). Patients with any concomitant genetic alterations also had significant worse overall survival (24.1 vs. 40.8 months, P = .029). In summary, our study revealed an unfavorable association between concomitant genetic mutations and treatment response towards EGFR-TKI. FGFR3 mutation and CDKN2A CNV loss may be potential predictive markers for treatment outcome and warrant further investigation. ? 2019 The Authors","anaplastic lymphoma kinase; CD135 antigen; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; epidermal growth factor receptor; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; fibroblast growth factor receptor 3; genomic DNA; Janus kinase 2; protein p53; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; adult; aged; ALK gene; amplicon; Article; CCND1 gene; CDK4 gene; clinical article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; copy number variation; CTNNB1 gene; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; exon; female; FGFR1 gene; FGFR3 gene; FLT3 gene; gene amplification; gene frequency; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic profile; genetic variation; human; JAK2 gene; life expectancy; male; middle aged; mutator gene; next generation sequencing; non small cell lung cancer; oncogene; overall survival; PIK3CA gene; progression free survival; retrospective study; TP53 gene; treatment outcome; treatment response; very elderly"
"Clinical benefits from endoscopy screening of esophageal second primary tumor for head and neck cancer patients: Analysis of a hospital-based registry",2019,"Objectives: Esophageal second primary tumors (SPTs) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients is not uncommon. The impact of image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) screening for esophageal SPT on the outcome of HNC patients has not been well clarified. Methods and methods: Patients with malignancies of the head and neck region and esophagus were recruited from a hospital-based cancer registry between July 2000–December 2016. IEE screening included magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging and chromoendoscopy with Lugol's solution. Biopsied specimens with revised Vienna classification categories 1 and 2 were defined as group I, and those with categories 3 to 5 were defined as group II. The Kaplan-Meier estimate and Cox regression model were used for survival analysis. Results: Totally 1577 HNC and 501 esophageal cancer patients were enrolled. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of stage I/II HNC, stage III/IV HNC and esophageal cancer patients were 58%, 29%, and 8%, respectively (p < 0.01). The 5-year OS rate of HNC patients with negative IEE results was higher than that of HNC patients without IEE screening, followed by IEE screening groups I, II and esophageal cancer patients (44% vs. 39% vs. 35% vs. 11% vs. 8%, respectively, p for trend <0.01). Among advanced HNC patients, those who received IEE screening had a trend of better prognosis than those without screening (5-year OS rate of 31% vs. 28%, p = 0.17). Conclusions: IEE screening for esophageal SPTs is helpful in risk stratification and prognosis prediction for HNC patients. Routine IEE screening is recommended in HNC patients. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","lugol; adult; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cancer staging; chromoendoscopy; controlled study; endoscopy; esophagus cancer; female; head and neck cancer; human; human tissue; magnifying endoscopy; major clinical study; male; narrow band imaging; overall survival; priority journal; second cancer; survival analysis"
"Impact of perineural invasion as a histopathological prognostic factor in ypStage II/III oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"OBJECTIVES: The 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumour-Nodes-Metastasis (TNM) staging system distinguishes between the clinical (c), pathological (p) and post-neoadjuvant pathological (yp) stage groups. However, the ability to discriminate between ypStage II and ypStage III is poor. We aim to identify prognostic factors in patients with ypStage II/III oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: The data of 150 patients with ypStage II/III oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma from 2 medical centres were retrospectively reviewed. The neoadjuvant treatments included chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, administered concurrently with external beam radiation. The determination of perineural invasion (PNI) was based on pathological reports. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test, and multivariable survival analysis was performed with a Cox regression model. RESULTS: The 3-year/5-year overall survival rate/median survival in ypStages II, IIIa and IIIb were 35.3%/26.9%/21.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 14.9-28.8] months, 33.8%/22.5%/22.4 (95% CI 20.1-24.7) months and 21.7%/14.0%/14.4 (95% CI 11.1-17.7) months, respectively (P = 0.07). The 3-year/5-year overall survival rate/median survival was 36.7%/26.4%/22.8 (95% CI 19.2-26.5) months in the absence of PNI and 6.9%/3.4%/9.1 (95% CI 8.9-9.4) months in the presence of PNI (P < 0.001). In the multivariable survival analysis, tumour location in the upper third of the thoracic oesophagus [hazard ratio (HR) 1.692, 95% CI 1.087-2.635; P = 0.020] and positive PNI (HR 3.316, 95% CI 2.005-4.905; P < 0.001) remained as independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The existence of PNI after neoadjuvant treatment is closely associated with poor prognosis and could be incorporated into the TNM staging system for better discrimination between patients with ypStage II/III oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. ? 2018 The Author(s).

"Assessment of Quantitative Magnetoencephalography using Cross-frequency Phase-phase Coupling",2019,"Cross-frequency phase-phase coupling (n:m CFC) within a cortical region has been proposed as a potential mechanism to regulate neural communication between different temporal scales. This study investigated n:m CFC values between high and low frequencies in resting-state networks using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Simulation experiments with different frequency pairs were first conducted to evaluate the effect of SNR on the estimation of phase and CFC. The values of n:m CFC between each pair of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies were estimated from eye-open resting-state MEG data. The topographic maps of CFC values between alpha and other frequencies were illustrated. The results of simulation data showed the increased accuracy of phase and n:m CFC estimation for balanced power of two targeted frequencies. Results of MEG data exhibited that CFC maps of low-alpha activity presented broadly distributed coupling with high frequencies (including beta and gamma) in the frontal regions of salient-ventral attention and frontoparietal control networks, whereas high-alpha activity coupling with the gamma band in the posterior part of frontoparietal control network. Our study demonstrates the versatile of n:m CFC values at rest in human brain. Caution should be considered when n:mCFC values would be used as an index of dysfunction at resting state in diseased brains. ? 2018 IEEE.","Brain mapping; Frequency estimation; Magnetoencephalography; Maps; Cortical regions; Crossfrequency couplings (CFC); Different frequency; High frequency HF; Neural communication; Phase synchronization; Potential mechanism; Resting state; Digital signal processing"
"The association between the sedative loads and clinical severity indicators in the first-onset major depressive disorder",2019,"Background: High sedative use in a major depressive episode may imply specific clinical features. This study aims to examine the correlation between sedative use and clinical severity indicators in the initial treatment phase of first-onset major depressive disorder. Methods: A study cohort in the first episode of major depressive disorder was used to conduct pharmacological dissection. All participants had at least a 2-year follow-up period with a complete treatment record. The defined daily dose of antidepressants and augmentation agents were calculated as the antidepressant load and augmentation load, respectively. Sedative use, which was calculated as the equivalent dosage of lorazepam, were defined as the sedative load. These psychotropic loads were measured monthly and the averaged psychotropic loads for each day were obtained. Results: A total of 106 individuals (75.5% female) were included. The mean duration of disease course in participants was 5.5 ± 3.5 years. In the multiple regression analysis, after controlling for other classes of psychotropics and comorbid anxiety disorders, the sedative load independently correlated with higher number of antidepressants used, higher number of antidepressant used with an adequate dose and duration, more psychiatric emergency and outpatient visits within 2 years of disease onset. Conclusion: High loading of sedatives correlated with several indicators of clinical severity in major depressive disorder. The sedative load may be used as a specifier to identify subgroups in patients with major depressive disorder.

"A 12-week rescue therapy by PrOD-based regimen for advanced fibrotic genotype-1 CHC patients who failed to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin",2019,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) evolved rapidly due to the invention of interferon-free direct antiviral agents. Previous clinical trials showed combination therapy with paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir (PrOD) with or without ribavirin (RBV) can cure over 95% of genotype 1 CHC patients, regardless with cirrhosis or not. However, real-world data regarding the efficacy and safety of PrOD-based therapy in Asian HCV genotype 1 CHC patients are limited, especially for advanced-fibrotic patients who failed previous therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus RBV. METHODS: Between January and October 2017, 60 advanced fibrotic (?F3) genotype 1 CHC patients who failed previous therapy with PEG-IFN and received PrOD-based therapy for 12 weeks were retrospectively enrolled. Weight-based RBV 800 to 1200?mg/d was added for genotype 1b patients with cirrhosis and all genotype 1a patients. Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined by undetectable HCV RNA at the end and 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. RESULTS: The mean age was 63.2 ± 9.3 years, 26 (43.3%) of them were males and 20 (33.3%) were diagnosed to have liver cirrhosis. The mean baseline HCV RNA level was 6.19 ± 0.88 log10 IU/mL and 86.7% (52/60) of patients were infected by HCV genotype 1b. After PrOD-based therapy, the rates undetectable HCV RNA (<15 IU/mL) at week 2, 4, and 12 were 61.7%, 90.0%, and 100%, respectively; 69.6% (16/23) of patients with detectable HCV RNA at week 2 were < 100 IU/mL. Pruritus, fatigue, headache, insomnia, and dizziness were the most common patient-reported adverse events. Grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia were found in 21.6% (13/60) of patients during study period and all belonged to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. After posttherapy follow up, all 60 patients (100%) achieved SVR. CONCLUSION: Our real-world data in Taiwan revealed that PrOD-based rescue therapy is well-tolerated and highly effective for genotype 1 CHC patients with advanced fibrosis failing previous therapy with PEG-IFN plus RBV.",""
"Multi-objective learning based speech enhancement method to increase speech quality and intelligibility for hearing aid device users",2019,"Background noise is a critical issue for hearing aid device users; a common solution to address this problem is speech enhancement (SE). In recent times, a novel SE approach based on deep learning technology, called deep denoising autoencoder (DDAE), has been proposed. Previous studies show that the DDAE SE approach provides superior noise suppression capabilities and produces less distortion than any of the classical SE approaches in the case of processed speech. Motivated by the improved results using DDAE shown in previous studies, we propose the multi-objective learning-based DDAE (M-DDAE) SE approach in this study; in addition, we evaluated its speech quality and intelligibility improvements using seven typical hearing loss audiograms. The experimental results of our objective evaluations show that our M-DDAE approach achieved significantly better results than the DDAE approach in most test conditions. Considering this, the proposed M-DDAE SE approach can be potentially used to further improve the listening performance of hearing aid devices in noisy conditions. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Hearing aids; Quality control; Speech enhancement; Speech intelligibility; Background noise; Denoising Autoencoder; Intelligibility improvements; Learning technology; Multi-objective learning; Noise suppression; Objective evaluation; Speech enhancement methods; Audition; Article; audiography; evaluation study; hearing impairment; learning; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; noise; priority journal; speech; speech intelligibility"
"Increased risk of ankylosing spondylitis after Mycoplasma pneumonia: A Nationwide population-based study",2019,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) infection and new development of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).Using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we included a total of 116,084 patients with newly diagnosed MP between 2000 and 2012. The control cohort consisted of patients who did not have MP, matched 1:4 by age, sex, and index year. The follow-up period was defined as the time from the initial diagnosis of MP to the date of diagnosis of AS, censoring, or 31 December 2013. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyze the risk of autoimmune diseases by sex, age, and comorbidities, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).The eligible study participants included 116,084 patients in the MP group and 464,336 patients in the comparison group. The incidence rates of AS in the MP group and comparison groups were 1.49 and 0.74 per 1,000,000-person years, respectively. The adjusted HR of AS for the MP group was 2.45 (95% CI?=?1.02-5.90) compared to the control group after adjustment for age, sex, and all covariates.MP remained an independent risk factor for developing AS in terms of sex, age, and comorbidities.","adult; aged; ankylosing spondylitis; case control study; comorbidity; factual database; female; human; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; Mycoplasma pneumonia; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Mycoplasma; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Spondylitis, Ankylosing; Taiwan; Young Adult"

"Safety and effectiveness of tocilizumab in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis – A three-year study in Taiwan",2019,"Objective: To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a real-world clinical setting in Taiwan. Method: All refractory RA patients who initiated intravenous TCZ between August 2012 and March 2015 were enrolled. Data on patient characteristics, drug safety and effectiveness were collected. Results: A total of 114 RA patients were recruited. Despite the majority of them (93%) had previous biologic failure, 43.75% of the patients were able to reach ACR50 after one year. Serious adverse events commonly found were bacterial pneumonia (4.24/100 patient-years) followed by cellulitis (2.12/100 patient-years). Twenty-three patients had old or latent TB infections, 11 patients had chronic hepatitis B. During the 3 years follow-up, none of them had reactivation of TB, or hepatitis B with concomitant use of isoniazid prophylaxis or pre-emptive antiviral treatment. Conclusion: In this 3-year real-world study on RA patients of Taiwan, we found a good long-term effectiveness and similar safety profiles for the TCZ treatment. With prophylactic strategy for latent TB and pre-emptive antiviral treatment for HBV carriers, the risk of reactivation of latent TB and HBV may be reassured. ? 2017","alanine aminotransferase; cholesterol; gamma interferon; hepatitis B core antibody; hepatitis B surface antibody; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; isoniazid; leflunomide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; methotrexate; prednisolone; rituximab; terbium; tocilizumab; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; antirheumatic agent; monoclonal antibody; tocilizumab; abscess; acute gastroenteritis; acute respiratory failure; acute sinusitis; adolescent; adult; adverse drug reaction; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; anus fistula; Article; bacterial infection; bacterial pneumonia; basal cell carcinoma; cardiovascular disease; cellulitis; child; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; controlled study; digestive system perforation; disease activity; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; eczema; female; follow up; functional disease; gingivitis; herpes zoster; human; hyponatremia; infection prevention; intraductal carcinoma; iron deficiency anemia; latent tuberculosis; long term care; major clinical study; male; mucosa inflammation; myalgia; otitis media; ovary cancer; Pneumocystis pneumonia; pneumonia; prevalence; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; rhinopharyngitis; Taiwan; thrombocytopenia; transient ischemic attack; treatment duration; treatment failure; treatment indication; treatment response; urinary tract infection; vasculitis; aged; drug resistance; evaluation study; intravenous drug administration; middle aged; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; severity of illness index; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Administration, Intravenous; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Child; Drug Resistance; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Morphologic change of flow-related aneurysms in brain arteriovenous malformations after stereotactic radiosurgery",2019,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The natural history of flow-related aneurysms after obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformations is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the angioarchitecture and morphologic change in flow-related aneurysms after gamma knife surgery of brain arteriovenous malformations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 12-year period, 823 patients with brain arteriovenous malformations underwent gamma knife surgery at our institution with complete peritherapeutic angiographic evaluation. From this population, a series of 72 patients (8.8%) with 111 flow-related aneurysms were enrolled (1.5 aneurysms per patient). There were 43 men and 29 women; ages ranged from 18 to 72 years (mean, 43 years). The morphologic change of flow-related aneurysms was longitudinally evaluated before and after obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformations. After gamma knife surgery, angiographic follow-up varied from 26 to 130 months (mean, 58 months). RESULTS: All flow-related aneurysms were small (mean, 4.1 mm; range, 2–9 mm). There were 72 proximal flow-related aneurysms (mean size, 4.3 mm) and 39 distal flow-related aneurysms (mean size, 3.7 mm). Spontaneous thrombosis occurred more frequently in distal flow-related aneurysms than in proximal flow-related aneurysms (P .001). Smaller flow-related aneurysms (5 mm) tended to spontaneously occlude after obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformations (P .036). Two patients had ruptures of proximal flow-related aneurysms at 27- and 54-month follow-ups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous thrombosis occurred more frequently in distal flow-related aneurysms due to occlusion or normalization of distal feeders. Smaller flow-related aneurysms also tended to spontaneously thrombose after obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformations. The rate of flow-related aneurysm rupture in our series was similar to that of natural intradural aneurysms. ? 2019 American Society of Neuroradiology.

"IFIT1 and IFIT3 promote oral squamous cell carcinoma metastasis and contribute to the anti-tumor effect of gefitinib via enhancing p-EGFR recycling",2019,"IFIT1 and IFIT3 are abundant products of interferon-stimulating genes. While the importance of IFIT1 and IFIT3 in the prognosis of cancer has been reported, the molecular basis of IFIT1 and IFIT3 in cancer progression remains unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the modes of action and the clinical significance of IFIT1 and IFIT3 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Ectopic expression of IFIT1 or IFIT3 induced OSCC cell invasion by promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, whereas IFIT1 or IFIT3 knockdown exhibited opposite effects. Overexpression of IFIT1 or IFIT3 promoted tumor growth, regional and distant metastasis in xenograft and orthotopic nude mice models. Most importantly, IFIT1 or IFIT3 overexpression increased the levels of p-EGFR Y1068 and p-AKT S473 in OSCC cells and also enhanced tumor inhibitory effect of gefitinib. By immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS analysis, we found that IFIT1 and IFIT3 interacted with ANXA2 that enhanced p-EGFR Y1068 endosomal recycling. Depletion of ANXA2 using siRNA therefore abolished p-EGFR Y1068 and p-AKT S473 expression in IFIT1- or IFIT3-overexpressed cells. Furthermore, a significant positive association of increased IFIT1 and IFIT3 expression with advanced T-stage, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, extranodal extension, and poor overall survival rate was confirmed in OSCC patients. We also found a statistically positive correlation of p-EGFR Y1068 expression with IFIT1 and IFIT3 in OSCC tumors and poor clinical outcome in patients. Collectively, we demonstrated a novel role of IFIT1 and IFIT3 in driving OSCC progression and metastasis by interacting with ANXA2 and hence enhancing p-EGFR recycling and its downstream signaling. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; lipocortin 2; protein kinase B; small interfering RNA; antineoplastic agent; carrier protein; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; IFIT1 protein, human; IFIT3 protein, human; signal peptide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer growth; cancer staging; cancer survival; controlled study; distant metastasis; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene; gene overexpression; gene silencing; human; human tissue; IFIT1 gene; IFIT3 gene; immunoprecipitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lymph node metastasis; mouse; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nonhuman; overall survival; priority journal; protein interaction; regional metastasis; tumor growth; tumor invasion; animal; cell motion; cell proliferation; drug effect; lymph node metastasis; metabolism; mouth tumor; nude mouse; pathology; procedures; prognosis; signal transduction; squamous cell carcinoma; survival rate; tumor cell line; xenograft; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; ErbB Receptors; Gefitinib; Heterografts; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lymphatic Metastasis; Mice, Nude; Mouth Neoplasms; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Signal Transduction; Survival Rate"
"The application of 595-nm pulsed dye laser for vascular anomalies in a Chinese population: a 10-year experience",2019,"Background: The 595-nm pulsed dye laser (PDL) has been used to treat vascular anomalies for about 30?years; however, there are insufficient data in Chinese patients concerning therapeutic efficacy, optimized parameters, and procedure techniques. Objective: To study the efficacy and relevant factors in PDL therapy for vascular anomalies in Chinese patients. Method: We enrolled 431 patients with 8 different vascular anomalies and no previous treatment in this retrospective study. A detailed classification of vascular anomalies and various parameters and techniques of PDL were studied. The clinical outcomes were analysed using the Investigator Global Assessment. Results: Improvements were significantly correlated with infantile haemangioma (IH) subtypes (p?<?0.05). A significant correlation between efficacy and lesion colour, anatomical sites, and hypertrophic-type port-wine stain (PWS) was found (p?<?0.05). There was no significant correlation between efficacy and age or sex (p?>?0.05). Conclusion: PDL is an effective and safe therapeutic modality for managing vascular anomalies in Chinese patients. We determined that differentiating and identifying IH subtypes prior to treatment could be a useful parameter for predicting therapeutic results.? Lesion colour, sites, and hypertrophic changes in PWS are relevant therapeutic factors. PDL parameters and techniques differ according to the various vascular anomalies to achieve optimal results. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","fusidic acid; lidocaine; local anesthetic agent; mometasone furoate; prilocaine; adolescent; adult; age distribution; angioma; Article; capillary hemangioma; child; Chinese; clinical outcome; congenital blood vessel malformation; cream; excision; female; hemangiokeratoma; human; hyperpigmentation; hypertrophic skin disease; infant; major clinical study; male; medical record review; nevus; nevus flammeus; priority journal; retrospective study; spider nevus; telangiectasia; adverse event; capillary hemangioma; chi square distribution; China; drug therapy; dye laser; evaluation study; low level laser therapy; middle aged; nevus flammeus; newborn; photography; preschool child; procedures; skin tumor; telangiectasia; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Chi-Square Distribution; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Female; Hemangioma, Capillary; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lasers, Dye; Low-Level Light Therapy; Male; Middle Aged; Photography; Port-Wine Stain; Retrospective Studies; Skin Neoplasms; Telangiectasis; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Association between rooming-in policy and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia",2019,"Background: The practices promoted by the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative have become a part of current mainstream postpartum infant care. Rooming-in to facilitate skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding is a major component of this initiative. However, whether rooming-in is associated with admission for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia has seldom been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between rooming-in and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Term neonates were consecutively enrolled from the nursery of a medical center from January 2011 to December 2013. During the study period, rooming-in care was strongly encouraged according to the World Health Organization guidelines, if the parents agreed. The endpoint was defined as admission for phototherapy. Risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in rooming-in neonates was calculated. Potential confounding factors, including exclusive breastfeeding, potential ABO incompatibility, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and body weight loss (BWL), were adjusted by multiple logistic regression models. Results: Totally, 3341 infants were enrolled in this study after excluding 40 infants admitted for other reasons. The rooming-in rate increased yearly during the study period. However, the rate of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia also increased simultaneously. The odds ratio (OR) of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the rooming-in group was 7.04 (95% CI, 4.41?11.24). The rooming-in group demonstrated a higher percentage of exclusive breastfeeding and BWL >10% at 3 days of age. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, rooming-in was still a significant risk factor for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (OR: 8.48; 95% CI: 5.04?14.25). Conclusions: The practice of rooming-in is now part of the mainstream postpartum newborn care. However, the increased incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is a potential side effect of which healthcare providers should be aware. Further research is needed to confirm the role of rooming-in in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. ? 2018","Article; blood group ABO incompatibility; body weight loss; breast feeding; cohort analysis; female; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; human; incidence; infant; infant care; major clinical study; male; neonatal hyperbilirubinemia; newborn; newborn care; phototherapy; policy; retrospective study; rooming in; neonatal hyperbilirubinemia; newborn care; phototherapy; Breast Feeding; Female; Humans; Hyperbilirubinemia, Neonatal; Infant, Newborn; Male; Phototherapy; Retrospective Studies; Rooming-in Care"
"Ampelopsins A and C Induce Apoptosis and Metastasis through Downregulating AxL, TYRO3, and FYN Expressions in MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells",2019,"Ampelopsins A and C are resveratrol oligostilbenes whose role in cancer development remains unknown. This study evaluated the antimetastatic and apoptosis-inducing properties of ampelopsins A and C in MDA-MB-231 cells. The IC 50 values of ampelopsins A and C against MDA-MB-231 cells at 72 h were 38.75 ± 4.61 and 2.71 ± 0.21 μM, respectively. However, at 24 h, ampelopsins A and C decreased cell metastasis significantly. Among the 71 proteins present on the human phosphoreceptor tyrosin kinase array, ampelopsin C decreased the phosphorylated protein level of AXL, Dtk (TYRO3), EphA2, EphA6, Fyn, Hck, and SRMS. Additionally, antiproliferation effects of ampelopsin C were enhanced when combined with luteolin and chrysin compared to either two or a single agent in MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall, ampelopsins A and C extracted from Vitis thunbergii are both novel antimetastatic agents and potential therapeutic targets in patients with breast cancer. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell death; Flavonoids; Pathology; Proteins; ampelopsin A; Antiproliferation; Breast cancer cells; Cancer development; MDA-MB-231; Mda-mb-231 cells; Phosphorylated proteins; Therapeutic targets; Diseases; ampelopsin; antineoplastic agent; axl receptor tyrosine kinase; flavonoid; FYN protein, human; oncoprotein; protein kinase Fyn; protein tyrosine kinase; TYRO3 protein, human; apoptosis; breast tumor; cell proliferation; down regulation; drug effect; female; genetics; human; metabolism; metastasis; pathophysiology; phosphorylation; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Female; Flavonoids; Humans; Neoplasm Metastasis; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases"
"Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in oldest old patients",2019,"Background: For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver resection is a classical curative modality, despite its technical complexity. The incidence of HCC in the oldest old people (aged ? 85 years) is rising along with the global increase in life expectancy. Currently, no report has addressed liver resection for HCC in this aged population. Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 1889 patients receiving curative liver resection for newly diagnosed HCC from 1992 to 2016. At the time of operation, 1858 of them were aged < 85 years (group A), and 31 were aged ? 85 years (group B). Another 18 oldest old patients, whose HCC was considered resectable but were not operated on due to the patient's refusal, served as the control group (group C). The clinicopathological characteristics and early and long-term outcomes were compared between groups A and B. All associated co-morbidities of the patients were well-treated before liver resection. The overall survival (OS) rates were also compared between groups B and C. Result: Group B had a significantly higher incidence of associated co-morbidities and hepatitis C infection. Postoperative complication rates and 90-day mortality rates after liver resection did not differ between groups A and B (p = 0.834 and p = 1.000, respectively), though group B had a longer postoperative stay (p = 0.001). In groups A and B, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 29.7% and 22.6% (p = 0.163), respectively, and their overall survival rates were 43.5% and 35.5% (p = 0.086). The overall survival rate of group B was significantly different from group C (35.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Despite a longer postoperative recovery period, liver resection for HCC in the oldest old patients may be justified if co-morbidities are well controlled. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; Article; clinical feature; clinical outcome; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; disease control; female; geriatric patient; hepatitis C; human; length of stay; life expectancy; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; major clinical study; male; median survival time; mortality rate; overall survival; postoperative complication; postoperative period; retrospective study; surgical mortality; survival rate; very elderly; age; case control study; disease free survival; hepatitis C; incidence; liver; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; middle aged; mortality; pathology; prognosis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Case-Control Studies; Comorbidity; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Hepatectomy; Hepatitis C; Humans; Incidence; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Period; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Exposure to second-generation antipsychotics and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adolescents and young adults: A nationwide study in Taiwan",2019,"Background: The association between second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been well investigated in adults. However, T2DM risk has been less examined among adolescents with SGA exposure, and the risk remains uncertain in this population. Methods: A total of 91,185 adolescents and young adults within the Taiwan National Health Insurance system who were exposed to SGAs were enrolled into this study between 2000 and 2011. The patients were divided into 4 subgroups on the basis of cumulative defined daily doses (cDDDs) of SGAs taken by them in the study period: < 30 cDDDs, 30-179 cDDDs, 180-364 cDDDs, and ? 365 cDDDs. Those who developed T2DM (ICD-9CM) during follow-up, which was the period from enrollment to the end of 2011, were identified. Results: Compared with those in the < 30 cDDD group, adolescents and young adults in the 30-179, 180-364, and ? 365 cDDD groups exhibited a high risk of T2DM in later life that increased dose dependently (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.15, 95% CI, 0.98-1.34; HR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.28-1.84; HR = 1.91, 95% CI, 1.67-2.18, respectively) after adjustment for demographic data, medical comorbidities, and psychiatric disorders. Discussion: Our study results showed a significant relationship between SGA exposure and T2DM risk among adolescents and young adults. These results raise further concern about the use of SGAs in pediatric populations, and on the basis of these results, clinicians should monitor the metabolic condition of their patients. ?

"A dengue virus type 2 (Denv-2) ns4b-interacting host factor, serp1, reduces denv-2 production by suppressing viral RNA replication",2019,"Host cells infected with dengue virus (DENV) often trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key process that allows viral reproduction, without killing the host cells until the late stage of the virus life-cycle. However, little is known regarding which DENV viral proteins interact with the ER machinery to support viral replication. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel host factor, stress-associated ER protein 1 (SERP1), which interacts with the DENV type 2 (DENV-2) NS4B protein by several assays, for example, yeast two-hybrid, subcellular localization, NanoBiT complementation, and co-immunoprecipitation. A drastic increase (34.5-fold) in the SERP1 gene expression was observed in the DENV-2-infected or replicon-transfected Huh7.5 cells. The SERP1 overexpression inhibited viral yields (37-fold) in the DENV-2-infected Huh7.5 cells. In contrast, shRNAi-knockdown and the knockout of SERP1 increased the viral yields (3.4-and 16-fold, respectively) in DENV-2-infected HEK-293 and Huh7.5 cells, respectively. DENV-2 viral RNA replication was severely reduced in stable SERP1-expressing Huh7.5 cells transfected with DENV-2 replicon plasmids. The overexpression of DENV-2 NS4B alleviated the inhibitory effect of SERP1 on DENV-2 RNA replication. Taking these results together, we hypothesized that SERP1 may serve as an antiviral player during ER stress to restrict DENV-2 infection. Our studies revealed novel anti-DENV drug targets that may facilitate anti-DENV drug discovery. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Proton Pump Inhibitors and Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B or C",2019,"Researchers have hypothesized that the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can increase the risk of developing cancer. However, the association between PPI use and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk is unclear. Using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for the period between 2003 and 2013, we identified 35,356 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. One-to-one propensity score matching by gender, age, cohort entry year, comorbidity, and medication resulted in the inclusion of 7,492 pairs of patients (PPI users and non-PPI users) for analyses. We performed multivariate and stratified analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models in order to estimate the association between PPI use and the risk of developing HCC. In the HBV cohort, 237 patients developed HCC during a median follow-up of 53 months. However, PPI use was not associated with an increased risk of developing HCC (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.73; P = 0.18). In the HCV cohort, 211 patients developed HCC; but again, PPI use was not associated with an increase in the risk of developing HCC (aHR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.88-1.61; P = 0.25). We observed no relationship between a dose-dependent effect of PPI use and HCC risk. Subgroup analysis also confirmed that PPI use was not correlated to an increased HCC risk. Conclusion: Based on a retrospective population-based cohort study throughout Taiwan, where the prescription of PPI is tightly regulated, PPI use is not associated with the risk of developing HCC among patients with chronic HBV or HCV infections. ? 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases","acetylsalicylic acid; adefovir; dexlansoprazole; entecavir; esomeprazole; fibric acid derivative; histamine H2 receptor antagonist; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; interferon; lamivudine; lansoprazole; metformin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; omeprazole; pantoprazole; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; proton pump inhibitor; rabeprazole; ribavirin; telbivudine; tenofovir; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cancer risk; child; chronic hepatitis B; chronic hepatitis C; cohort analysis; comorbidity; decompensated liver cirrhosis; disease association; drug use; female; follow up; human; infant; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; peptic ulcer; prescription; priority journal; propensity score; reflux esophagitis; retrospective study; risk assessment; very elderly"
"Differential risk group of developing stroke among older women with gouty arthritis: A latent transition analysis",2019,"Objective: Gout-related comorbidities are intricate and its clinical features may demonstrate sex difference; however, few studies have evaluated the links between comorbidities and gout in a female population. The objectives of this study were to compare the aggregation and transitive trajectories of comorbidities of gout, and their consequences in female and male gout populations. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A female and male gout population were followed up from 2000 to 2009 to identify the comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease. The cumulative incidence of stroke from 2000 to 2010 was examined. A latent trajectory analysis was used to determine the transitive trajectories of the comorbidities of gout. Results: Both female and male patients with gout had five risk cluster transition (CT) phenotypes of comorbidities within 10-year follow-up: CT1 and CT2, with various persistent comorbidities; CT3, with few persistent comorbidities; and CT4 and CT5, with transfer to cluster 1 from other clusters. The female participants in CT2 predominantly experienced DM and were associated with significantly increased risk of developing stroke. Conclusion: Diabetes is a notable risk factor for the development of stroke in female patients with gout. Early assessment and management for the comorbidities of gout, particularly in DM, would effectively reduce future stroke risk in female gout population. ? 2019 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation","adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; chronic kidney failure; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; comorbidity assessment; diabetes mellitus; female; gout; high risk population; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; prospective study; sex difference; aged; cerebrovascular accident; complication; gout; prevalence; risk factor; sex ratio; Taiwan; Aged; Arthritis, Gouty; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Stroke; Taiwan"
"Targeting SET to restore PP2A activity disrupts an oncogenic CIP2A-feedforward loop and impairs triple negative breast cancer progression",2019,"Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains difficult to be targeted. SET and cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) are intrinsic protein-interacting inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and frequently overexpressed in cancers, whereas reactivating PP2A activity has been postulated as an anti-cancer strategy. Here we explored this strategy in TNBC. Methods: Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed. TNBC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Cell viability was examined by MTT assay. The apoptotic cells were examined by flow cytometry and Western blot. A SET-PP2A protein-protein interaction antagonist TD19 was used to disrupt signal transduction. In vivo efficacy of TD19 was tested in MDA-MB-468-xenografted animal model. Findings: TCGA data revealed upregulation of SET and CIP2A and positive correlation of these two gene expressions in TNBC tumors. Ectopic SET or CIP2A increased cell viability, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells. Notably ERK inhibition increased PP2A activity. ERK activation is known crucial for Elk-1 activity, a transcriptional factor regulating CIP2A expression, we hypothesized an oncogenic feedforward loop consisting of pERK/pElk-1/CIP2A/PP2A. This loop was validated by knockdown of PP2A and ectopic expression of Elk-1, showing reciprocal changes in loop members. In addition, ectopic expression of SET increased pAkt, pERK, pElk-1 and CIP2A expressions, suggesting a positive linkage between SET and CIP2A signaling. Moreover, TD19 disrupted this CIP2A-feedforward loop by restoring PP2A activity, demonstrating in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activity. Mechanistically, TD19 downregulated CIP2A mRNA via inhibiting pERK-mediated Elk-1 nuclear translocation thereby decreased Elk-1 binding to the CIP2A promoter. Interpretation: These findings suggested that a novel oncogenic CIP2A-feedforward loop contributes to TNBC progression and targeting SET to disrupt this oncogenic CIP2A loop showed therapeutic potential in TNBC. ? 2019","cisplatin; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A; phosphoprotein phosphatase inhibitor; TD19; transcription factor Elk 1; unclassified drug; autoantigen; chaperone; cisplatin; erlotinib; KIAA1524 protein, human; membrane protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2; protein kinase B; protein kinase inhibitor; SET protein, human; transcription factor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; apoptosis assay; apoptosis rate; Article; breast cancer; BT-20 cell line; cancer growth; cell invasion; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell viability; cell viability assay; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; drug targeting; ectopic expression; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; gene expression; genetic transfection; HCC1937 cell line; human; human cell; luciferase assay; MCF-10A cell line; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; MDA-MB-453 cell line; MDA-MB-468 cell line; MTT assay; nonhuman; overall survival; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; pseudoinclusion; signal transduction; triple negative breast cancer; tumor growth; upregulation; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; biological model; disease model; drug effect; drug screening; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; mortality; mouse; pathology; promoter region; triple negative breast cancer; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Autoantigens; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Cisplatin; Disease Models, Animal; Erlotinib Hydrochloride; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histone Chaperones; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Models, Biological; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Protein Phosphatase 2; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Evaluation of the biological behavior of a gold nanocore-encapsulated human serum albumin nanoparticle (Au@HSANP) in a CT-26 tumor/ascites mouse model after intravenous/intraperitoneal administration",2019,"Colorectal cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related death in Taiwan and worldwide. Patients with peritoneal metastasis from colorectal cancer have reduced overall survival and poor prognosis. Hybrid protein-inorganic nanoparticle systems have displayed multifunctional applications in solid cancer theranostics. In this study, a gold nanocore-encapsulated human serum albumin nanoparticle (Au@HSANP), which is a hybrid protein-inorganic nanoparticle, and its radioactive surrogate111In-labeled Au@HSANP (111In-Au@HSANP), were developed and their biological behaviors were investigated in a tumor/ascites mouse model.111In-Au@HSANP was injected either intravenously (iv) or intraperitoneally (ip) in CT-26 tumor/ascites-bearing mice. After ip injection, a remarkable and sustained radioactivity retention in the abdomen was noticed, based on microSPECT images. After iv injection, however, most of the radioactivity was accumulated in the mononuclear phagocyte system. The results of biodistribution indicated that ip administration was significantly more effective in increasing intraperitoneal concentration and tumor accumulation than iv administration. The ratios of area under the curve (AUC) of the ascites and tumors in the ip-injected group to those in the iv-injected group was 93 and 20, respectively. This study demonstrated that the ip injection route would be a better approach than iv injections for applying gold-albumin nanoparticle in peritoneal metastasis treatment. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The Associations between Near Visual Activity and Incident Myopia in Children: A Nationwide 4-Year Follow-up Study",2019,"Objective: This nationwide population-based study aimed to examine the prospective association between near visual activities and incident myopia in Taiwanese children 7 to 12 years old over a 4-year follow-up period. Design: Prospective cohort design. Participants: There were 1958 children aged 7 to 12 years from the Taiwan 2009 National Health Interview Survey who were linked to the 2009 through 2013 claims data from the National Health Insurance system. Methods: Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the associations between 3 types of near visual activities in sedentary posture, namely reading (< 0.5, 0.5-0.9, ?1.0 hours per day [h/d]), use of computer, Internet, and games (<0.5, 0.5-0.9, ?1.0 h/d), and “cram school” attendance (<0.5, 0.5-1.9, ?2.0 h/d), and incident myopia. Main Outcome Measures: Prevalent myopia was defined as those who had ?2 ambulatory care claims (International Classification of Diseases code 367.1) in 2008-2009. Incident myopia was defined by those who had at least 2 ambulatory care claims (International Classification of Diseases code 367.1) during the 4-year follow-up period (2010-2013) after excluding prevalent cases. Results: Overall, 26.8% of children had myopia at baseline, and 27.7% of those without myopia at baseline developed incident myopia between 2010 and 2013. On average, they spent 0.68±0.86 h/d on computer/Internet use, 0.63±0.67 h/d on reading, and 2.78±3.53 h/d on cram school. The results showed that children attending cram schools ?2 h/d (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.68) had a higher risk of incident myopia. The effects of these activities remained similar in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Cram school attendance for ?2 h/d may increase the risk of children's incident myopia. This effect may be due to increased near visual activity or reduced time outdoors. ? 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology","ambulatory care; Article; child; cohort analysis; exposure variable; female; follow up; game; groups by age; health survey; human; incidence; incident myopia; Internet; major clinical study; male; myopia; national health insurance; near visual activity; outcome assessment; prevalence; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prospective study; reading; risk factor; school attendance; sedentary time; Taiwanese; vision; Asian continental ancestry group; leisure; myopia; pathophysiology; physiology; questionnaire; Taiwan; visual acuity; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Child; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Leisure Activities; Male; Myopia; Prevalence; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Visual Acuity"
"Depressive symptoms and nutritional status in the frail older adults",2019,"Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms and nutritional status in the frail older adults. Methods: This study uses a cross-sectional, descriptive, and correlational design. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic data, and the Taiwan International Physical Activity Questionnaire Form Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form Charlson Comorbidity Index, and Mini-Nutritional Assessment Short-Form were used to measure depression and nutritional status, respectively. Data were analyzed by independent-t tests, chi-square tests, spearman correlations, and multiple linear regressions. Results: Of the total of 94 frail older adults, 17 (18.09%) had depressive symptoms (GDS > 5). The average MNA-SF score was 11.38 (SD = 2.45), 31 (32.98%) participants had a risk of malnutrition and 12 (12.77%) were malnourished. Participants’ reports of dissatisfaction with their lives (72.1%) and feeling terrible about their lives (58.14%) were associated with a risk of malnutrition. Elderly age, multiple comorbidities, and high level of depressive symptoms were at increased risk of malnutrition. Conclusion: When clinicians are faced with a high-risk group, such as elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and depressive symptoms, they should perform an immediate assessment of nutritional status. If a risk of malnutrition is found, adequate nutrition and health care should be provided. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","aged; Article; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chi square test; comorbidity; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; depression; descriptive research; female; frailty; Geriatric Depression Scale; health care utilization; human; international physical activity questionnaire; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; physical activity; priority journal; regression analysis"
"Outcomes of enteral metallic stent in patients with pancreatic carcinoma and gastric outlet obstruction: A single center experience",2020,"Background: Duodenal obstruction is uncommon in patients with pancreatic cancer. However, the obstruction rate is increasing as a result of advancements in chemotherapy and target therapy. This study aimed to investigate the effect of self-expandable metal stent placement on outcomes of patients with duodenal obstruction secondary to pancreatic carcinoma. Methods: Twenty-nine consecutive inoperable patients with pancreatic cancer and gastric outlet obstruction who received metallic stent placement in our hospital between September 2009 and October 2017 were enrolled for analysis. Results: Fifteen male patients and 14 female patients receiving stent placement with a median age of 68 years (range, 50–85 years) were included. The technical and clinical success rates of the procedure were 100% and 89.7%, respectively. The Gastric Outlet Obstruction Scoring System scores were significantly improved at day 1 (1.14 ± 0.51) and days 7 (2.21 ± 0.9) after the implantation compared to those prior to the procedure (0.38 ± 0.49) (p < 0.001). Aspiration pneumonia and bleeding developed in 1 patient (3.4%) after the procedure. Stent dysfunction developed in 6 of 29 patients (20.6%). The median stent patency time was 109 days (range, 10–314 days). The median survival time was 114 days (range, 15–323 days). Post-stent chemotherapy predicted better survival (hazard ratio: 0.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.08–0.51, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Metallic stent placement is an effective treatment for patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer leading to gastric outlet obstruction. Chemotherapy may be considered following stent placement. ? 2019","antibiotic agent; antineoplastic agent; abdominal pain; adult; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; aspiration pneumonia; bleeding; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer survival; clinical article; clinical outcome; duodenum obstruction; female; gastrojejunostomy; human; in-stent restenosis; male; median survival time; nausea; nausea and vomiting; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pylorus stenosis; retrospective study; scoring system; sepsis; stent fracture; survival prediction; vomiting"
"Outcome of drug-eluting balloon angioplasty versus endarterectomy in common femoral artery occlusive disease",2019,"Objective: Common femoral artery (CFA) occlusive disease remains a debatable site for endovascular therapy, and the outcome of drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty in treating CFA occlusive disease is largely unknown. This study compared the efficacy, safety, and short-term patency rate of DEB angioplasty and femoral endarterectomy for treatment of CFA occlusive disease. Methods: From March 2013 to June 2016, there were 100 patients with symptomatic CFA occlusive disease who were retrospectively reviewed. Forty patients were treated with DEB angioplasty and 60 were treated with femoral endarterectomy. Each patient received regular follow-up. Patency rate, ankle-brachial index, target lesion revascularization, and adverse events were assessed. Results: Technical success was 100% in all patients. The DEB group had a lower 1-year primary patency rate (75.0% vs 96.7%; P =.003), but the secondary patency rate was similar between the two groups (97.5% vs 98.3%; P = 1.000). At 2-year follow-up, the primary patency was lower in the DEB group (57.1%) than in the endarterectomy group (94.1%; P =.001), whereas the secondary patency rate had no significant difference (90.5% vs 97.1%; P = 1.000). Both groups had significant improvement in ankle-brachial index. Freedom from target lesion revascularization was lower in the DEB group both at 1 year (75.0% vs 96.7%; P =.003) and at 2 years (57.1% vs 94.1%; P =.001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications and adverse events. Conclusions: Femoral endarterectomy has a better primary patency rate compared with DEB angioplasty in treating CFA occlusive disease without significant increase in complications. In patients not suitable for endarterectomy, DEB angioplasty provides a similar secondary patency rate and could be considered an alternative treatment. ? 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery","adverse outcome; aged; ankle brachial index; Article; blood vessel parameters; common femoral artery occlusive disease; comparative effectiveness; distal emboli; embolism; endarterectomy; female; follow up; hematoma; human; intermethod comparison; lymph leak; major clinical study; male; medical device complication; outcome assessment; patency rate; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; peripheral occlusive artery disease; postoperative complication; priority journal; puncture site hematoma; retrospective study; target lesion revascularization; wound dehiscence; comparative study; devices; diagnostic imaging; equipment design; femoral artery; middle aged; pathophysiology; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; peripheral occlusive artery disease; postoperative complication; risk factor; surgery; time factor; treatment outcome; vascular access device; vascular patency; very elderly; biocompatible coated material; cardiovascular agent; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angioplasty, Balloon; Ankle Brachial Index; Cardiovascular Agents; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Endarterectomy; Equipment Design; Female; Femoral Artery; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Access Devices; Vascular Patency"
"Echinocandins as alternative treatment for HIV-infected patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia",2019,"Objectives:Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is often associated with adverse effects. Echinocandins, by inhibiting the cyst form of Pneumocystis jirovecii, may be an alternative therapy for PCP. However, clinical experience with echinocandins in the treatment of PCP remains limited among HIV-infected patients.Methods:From August 2013 to April 2018, data of HIV-infected patients with confirmed PCP who received echinocandins as alternative treatment because of intolerance or unresponsiveness to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were retrospectively reviewed to assess the effectiveness and safety of echinocandins alone or in combination with other agents.Results:In total, 34 patients were included, with a median CD4+ count of 27cells/μl [interquartile range (IQR), 20-93). Twenty-four patients (70.6%) presented with moderate-To-severe PCP. The most common adverse effects leading to withdrawal of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were hepatotoxicity (29.4%), gastrointestinal upset (23.5%), and rash (17.6%). Nine patients (26.5%) were switched to echinocandins after failure of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The median interval before switch from trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to echinocandins was 9.0 days (IQR 5.0-14.0). The all-cause and PCP-related in-hospital mortality rate of patients receiving echinocandins as alternative therapy was 20.6% (7/34) and 14.7% (5/34), respectively. The all-cause in-hospital mortality was 0% in mild PCP cases and 29% (7/24) in moderate-To-severe PCP cases. Patients who had failed to respond to first-line trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment tended to have a higher in-hospital mortality rate than those without first-line trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole failure (44.4% versus 12.0%, P=0.06).Conclusion:Echinocandin therapy might serve as an alternative option for HIV-infected patients with PCP who are intolerable to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Can short-term effectiveness of anti-pronation taping predict the long-term outcomes of customized foot orthoses: Developing predictors to identify characteristics of patients with plantar heel pain likely to benefit from customized foot orthoses",2019,"Background: Foot orthoses are widely used to manage plantar heel pain (PHP). However, the evidence concerning the effect of foot orthoses on PHP is not conclusive. The study aims to identify the characteristics of patients with PHP likely to achieve a positive outcome after customized foot orthoses and to verify the concept that patients who respond positively to anti-pronation taping would achieve a positive prognosis after wearing foot orthoses for six months. Methods: This is a prospective observational cohort study. Seventy-four patients with PHP underwent a baseline examination and received anti-pronation taping to their painful feet. The taping effects on pain and function were assessed at the 7-day follow-up visit. Then, all patients received an intervention for their PHP with customized foot orthoses for six months. Outcome was assessed with a numeric pain rating scale, the patient-specific functional scale, the foot function index, and the global rating of perceived change. Significant reduction of pain, increase of function, and perception of a meaningful improvement were considered a positive response. Results: Of 74 patients, 49 had a positive response to the customized foot orthosis treatment. Five predictors were identified: (1) the average pain intensity decreased by over 1.5 points with taping, (2) the range of ankle plantarflexion > 54 degrees, (3) the strength of ankle plantarflexors on the symptomatic side was equal to or stronger than that on the other side, (4) the range of hip internal rotation < 39 degrees, and (5) the range of hip external rotation > 45 degrees. The presence of three or more predictors increased the rate of achieving positive outcome from 66 to 89%. Conclusions: The predictors of customized foot orthosis outcome in patients with PHP are related to several physical measures of a lower extremity. Findings of the study can be used to screen and select patients with PHP for foot orthosis intervention. Moreover, patients who respond positively to anti-pronation taping would also benefit from the customized foot orthoses. However, since there was no control group in the current study, it is inappropriate to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the foot orthoses treatment.

"Associations between environmental heavy metal exposure and childhood asthma: A population-based study",2019,"Background/purpose: The health risks of environmental heavy metals have been of concern are well known. The greater likelihood of heavy metal contamination in the physical environment increases the risk of asthma, especially in children. This cross-sectional, population-based study sought to investigate associations between heavy metal exposure and childhood asthma or wheezing. Methods: Data from 5866 subjects, stratified into age groups of 2–5, 6–11, and 12–15 years, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2012 conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were analyzed retrospectively. The primary outcome was active asthma. Variables included demographics, anthropometric, and clinical data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify associations between blood heavy metal concentrations and adjusted odds (aORs) of active asthma. Results: Higher concentration of blood lead was associated with higher adjusted odds of having asthma (aOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00–1.16), but no significant effect was shown for current wheezing or whistling. Age-stratified analysis showed that higher blood lead concentration was associated with higher risk for active asthma (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08–1.42) and current wheezing or whistling (aOR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.04–1.38) in the 6–11 years age group, while higher blood mercury concentration was associated with lower risk of current wheezing or whistling (aOR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.90–0.99). The medium concentration of blood lead was associated with decreased risks of current wheezing or whistling (aOR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.30–0.96) in the 2–5 years age group. Conclusion: Higher concentrations of blood lead are associated with higher odds of asthma in children aged 2–15 years. ? 2018","cadmium; lead; mercury; heavy metal; adolescent; age; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; child; disease association; environmental exposure; female; heavy metal blood level; human; lead blood level; major clinical study; male; preschool child; retrospective study; United States; wheezing; abnormal respiratory sound; asthma; blood; cross-sectional study; demography; drug effect; environmental exposure; nutrition; pollution; risk factor; socioeconomics; Adolescent; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollution; Female; Humans; Male; Metals, Heavy; Nutrition Surveys; Respiratory Sounds; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; United States"
"Characteristics of non-emergent visits in emergency departments: Profiles and longitudinal pattern changes in Taiwan, 2000-2010",2019,"An increasing number of emergency department (ED) visits have posed a challenge to health systems in many countries, but an understanding of non-emergent ED visits has remained limited and contentious. This retrospective study analyzed ED visits using three representative cohorts from routine data to explore the profiles and longitudinal pattern changes of non-emergent ED visits in Taiwan. Systematic-, personal-, and ED visit-level data were analyzed using a logistic regression model. Average marginal effects were calculated to compare the effects of each factor. The annual ED visit rate increased up to 261.3 per 1000 population in 2010, and a significant one-third of visits were considered as non-emergent. The rapidly growing utilization of ED visits underwent a watershed change after cost-sharing payments between patients and medical institutions were increased in 2005. In addition to cohort effects resulting from cost-sharing payment changes, all factors were significantly associated with non-emergent ED visits with different levels of impact. We concluded that non-emergent ED visits were associated with multifaceted factors, but the change to cost-sharing payment, being female, younger age, and geographical residence were the most predictive factors. This information would enhance the implementation of evidence-based strategies to optimize ED use. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Age threshold for the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation: Insights into the optimal assessment of age and incident comorbidities",2019,"Aims The stroke risk of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not static, since AF patients get older and accumulate more comorbidities after AF is diagnosed. Therefore, the stroke risk of AF patients given certain comorbidities in different age strata should ideally be analysed using an assessment which considers incident comorbidities and the actual age when ischaemic stroke occurred. The goal of the present study is to report the age treatment thresholds for the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for AF patients without or with only one comorbidity of the CHA2DS2-VASc score, based on an ‘ideal method’ of stroke risk assessments. Methods The study cohort included 31 039 and 39 020 AF patients who did not have any or had only one risk factor and results comorbidity of the CHA2DS2-VASc score except for age and sex. The risks of ischaemic stroke in each age strata for each comorbidities were analysed in three ways, as follows: (i) the conventional way (based on baseline risk factors and age), (ii) dynamic method (patients were censored when new comorbidities occurred), and (iii) an ideal method (patients were censored when new comorbidities occurred and the stroke risk was related to the actual age when stroke happened). The tipping point for the use of NOACs was set at a stroke risk of 0.9%/year. The overall risk of ischaemic stroke using the conventional way was overestimated compared to the dynamic or ideal assessment with the incidence rate ratio of 1.24 for patients with hypertension, 1.20 for heart failure, 1.37 for diabetes mellitus, and 1.38 for vascular diseases; all P-values &lt;0.01. The risk of ischaemic stroke for each age strata was generally higher with the conventional or dynamic methods compared with the ideal assessment. With heart failure, the tipping point (age 35 years) of NOACs was similar, irrespective of methods used for stroke risk assessment. According to the results of ideal assessment, the age thresholds for the use of NOACs for patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and vascular diseases were 50 years, 50 years, and 55 years, respectively. Conclusion Ischaemic stroke risk in AF is heterogeneous, depending on different risk factors with age being as an important driver of stroke risk. Age thresholds for the use of NOACs were different for AF patients having different single risk factors beyond sex despite the same CHA2DS2-VASc score point (1 for males and 2 for females); that is, 35 years for heart failure, 50 years for hypertension or diabetes, and 55 years for vascular diseases.

"Relationship between body mass index, antidiabetic agents, and midterm mortality in patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome",2019,"Background-The aim of this study was to determine the influence of various antidiabetic therapies on the relationship between body mass index and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome. Methods and Results-This was a prospective, observational study comprising 1193 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome. The patients were stratified into 4 body mass index categories, and their mortality rates were compared using time-dependent Cox regression analysis using normal weight (body mass index, 18.5-23.9) as the reference. Subsequently, the influence of antidiabetic therapies on the association between BMI and mortality were analyzed. Seventy-four patients (6.2%) died over 2 years of follow-up. The mortality rate was lowest in the class I obese group (3.35%) and highest in the normal-weight group (9.67%). After adjusting for covariates, class I obesity paradoxically remained significantly protective against mortality compared with normal weight (hazard ratio, 0.141; P=0.049); interaction term analysis showed that insulin therapy influenced this “obesity paradox” (P=0.045). When the patients were stratified by insulin use, the protective effect of obesity disappeared in the insulin-treated patients but persisted in the non-insulin-treated patients. Conclusions-In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome, the relationship between body mass index and mortality rate is U-shaped, with class I obesity representing the nadir and normal weight the peak. The protective effect of obesity disappeared in patients treated with insulin. ? 2019 The Authors.","angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; insulin sensitizing agent; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; sulfonylurea; acute coronary syndrome; adult; adverse outcome; aged; all cause mortality; Article; body mass; body weight; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; drug use; female; follow up; human; insulin treatment; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; treatment response"
"Suborgan breast dosimetry for breast nuclear medicine imaging using anthropomorphic software breast phantoms",2020,"Breast nuclear medicine imaging has gradually become a supplemental method for detection of mammographically occult cancer in dense breasts. However, mammary glands and ducts are highly sensitive to radiation; the absorbed dose to glandular tissue may increase the risk of secondary breast cancer. Therefore, accurate suborgan breast dosimetry for breast nuclear medicine imaging represents an important issue. In this study, a series of anthropomorphic software breast phantoms (ASBPs) with various volumes and glandularities were built. The realism of the ASBPs was assessed by using the two-dimensional projection and fractal dimension (FD) analysis. Breast self S values and suborgan S values for 18F and 99mTc were simulated using the Monte Carlo technique. The projected images of the ASBPs were similar to clinical mammograms in tissue distribution and image contrast. The mean FD value for the ASBPs was 2.23. The maximum differences between the breast self S values of ASBPs and OLINDA/EXM for 18F and 99mTc were ?14.4% and ?16.7%, respectively. For the breast suborgan S values, the maximum ratios between the S value from gland to gland S(g←g) and the S value from breast to breast S(b←b) were 4.84 for 18F and 3.60 for 99mTc. The mean ratios between the S value from gland to duct S(d←g) and that from gland to gland S(g←g) were 0.296 for 18F and 0.356 for 99mTc. The suborgan breast dosimetry based on the ASBPs can be used for internal dose evaluation and carcinogenic risk assessment of mammary glands and ducts in breast nuclear medicine imaging. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diseases; Dosimetry; Ducts; Finite difference method; Fractal dimension; Monte Carlo methods; Nuclear medicine; Phantoms; Risk assessment; Tissue; Carcinogenic risk assessments; Monte Carlo techniques; Nuclear medicine imaging; S values; Secondary breast cancer; Software breast phantoms; Tissue distributions; Two-dimensional projection; Medical imaging"
"Antisuicidal effect, BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, and low-dose ketamine infusion: Reanalysis of adjunctive ketamine study of Taiwanese patients with treatment-resistant depression (AKSTP-TRD)",2019,"Background: Growing evidence suggests a rapid antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine infusion in Caucasian patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the antisuicidal effects of ketamine on Taiwanese patients with TRD remains unknown. Methods: Seventy-one patients with TRD were randomly classified into three treatment groups: 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline (placebo) infusion. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Montgomery-?sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were applied prior to initiation of test infusions, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 14 after ketamine or placebo infusion. Item 3 (suicide) of the HAMD and item 10 (suicidal thoughts) of the MADRS were extracted for generalized estimating equation (GEE) model analyses to investigate the antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism was genotyped. Results: The GEE model revealed significant group (p = 0.007) and time (p = 0.004) effects on suicidal symptoms over times (prior to infusion to day 14 postinfusion). The group that received 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited a significantly lower score in item 3 of the HAMD and item 10 of the MADRS compared with the groups that received 0.2 mg/kg ketamine or placebo infusion. Among those carrying any Val allele of BDNF, both 0.5 and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusions were effective in reducing suicidal thoughts; however, among those with Met/Met of BDNF, only 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion was effective in reducing suicidal thoughts. Discussion: A single low-dose ketamine infusion was effective in reducing suicidal ideation among Taiwanese patients with TRD. BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may play a crucial role in the antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","antidepressant agent; brain derived neurotrophic factor; genomic DNA; ketamine; methionine; valine; antidepressant agent; BDNF protein, human; brain derived neurotrophic factor; ketamine; adult; allele; Article; comparative study; controlled study; drug dose comparison; female; genetic polymorphism; genotype; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; infusion; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; mental patient; middle aged; Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; priority journal; psychopharmacotherapy; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; suicidal ideation; Taiwanese; treatment resistant depression; treatment response; Asian continental ancestry group; genetic polymorphism; genetics; intravenous drug administration; psychological rating scale; psychology; suicide; Taiwan; treatment outcome; treatment resistant depression; Adult; Antidepressive Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant; Female; Genotype; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Ketamine; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Genetic; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"Environmental factors affecting self-management of chronic hepatitis B from the patients’ perspective",2019,"Aims and objectives: To explore factors affecting self-management experiences of patients with chronic hepatitis B within their social and cultural environments. Background: Many cases of hepatitis B are not detected until they are in end-stage liver disease. Despite an increasing trend of indicating a lack of health awareness as the reason, studies have rarely referred to the personal, social and cultural environmental constraints from patients' perspectives. Design: A descriptive qualitative study. Methods: Forty-seven adults diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B were interviewed in a private area of a hospital clinic in Taiwan in 2018. Four open-ended questions relating to care self-management included the following: disease detection; disease control; preventive care; and perceptions of screening and follow-ups. Data were examined using content analysis. This study also adhered to the consolidated COREQ guidelines. Results: Five main themes emerged: personal experiences, awareness of occupational health, the availability of conventional treatment, cultural beliefs about health care and family roles. Findings of note were that some participants became aware that they had never known the difference between follow-up for hepatitis B and regular adult/labourer health checks due to a lack of information within their living environment. Many participants added alternative treatments to their self-management strategies and others frequently ignored follow-up appointments because of different cultural health beliefs. Conclusions: Patients’ disease self-management perceptions are driven by dynamic influences suggesting that development of policies integrating personal, family, social and cultural environmental factors could enhance individual screening and subsequent health behaviours of patients with chronic hepatitis B. Relevance to practice: Adding person-centred case management of hepatitis B could enhance patients’ adherence to follow-up. Attention should be given to increasing provider awareness of the influence of their own attitude and communication on patients’ participation in self-management. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; attitude to health; chronic hepatitis B; female; human; male; middle aged; psychology; qualitative research; self care; Taiwan; Adult; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Self-Management; Taiwan"
"Real-world effectiveness and safety of rituximab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: A single-center experience in Taiwan",2019,"Aim: To assess the real-world effectiveness and safety of rituximab (RTX) at 24?months in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to identify predictors of low disease activity/remission and a good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response. Methods: Seventy RTX-treated RA patients were enrolled. Predictors for low disease activity/remission and a good EULAR response at 24?months were identified by multivariate analyses. Results: At 24?months, the mean Disease Activity Score of 28 joints—erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) decreased from 6.88?±?0.85 at baseline to 3.47?±?0.85. Twenty-nine patients (41.4%) reached low disease activity/remission, while all patients had a moderate/good EULAR response. After adjustment by multivariate analyses, we found concomitant methotrexate at a dosage >10?mg/week (odds ratio [OR] 5.17; 95% CI 1.34-19.93; P?=?0.017) predicted low disease activity/remission, and baseline DAS28 ?6.5 (OR 4.97; 95% CI 1.22-20.30; P?=?0.026) predicted good EULAR response at 24?months. The most common adverse events were infusion-related (5.7%), and there was no incidence of malignancy or mortality during the treatment. Conclusions: RTX was effective and safe in real-life management of RA patients with high disease activity. Patients taking concomitant methotrexate and with lower baseline DAS28-ESR were more likely to benefit from RTX. ? 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","methotrexate; rituximab; antirheumatic agent; rituximab; adult; Article; cellulitis; chronic hepatitis B; DAS28; disease activity; drug efficacy; drug safety; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; human; infusion related reaction; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; osteomyelitis; prediction; priority journal; remission; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; Taiwan; treatment response; combination drug therapy; immunology; rheumatoid arthritis; risk assessment; risk factor; severity of illness index; time factor; treatment outcome; Adult; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Male; Methotrexate; Middle Aged; Remission Induction; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Rituximab; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Health-promotion interventions enhance and maintain self-efficacy for adults at cardiometabolic risk: A randomized controlled trial",2019,"Objectives: To investigate whether a community-based intervention program, based on self-efficacy theory, might improve older adults’ self-care behaviors as well as health outcomes related to hypertension and dyslipidemia. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Taipei, Taiwan, From October 16, 2011 to July 31, 2014. Residents identified during community screening for the over 50 s were invited to participate if their blood pressure was 120–139/80–89 mmHg, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was <40 mg/dL (men) or <50 mg/dL (women), or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 130–159 mg/dL. The intervention group participated in a special health promotion program; the control group received conventional health education. Participants’ demographic and anthropometric data were recorded, and each completed semi-structured questionnaires about hypertension and cholesterol management, and gave blood samples for biochemical analyses before the intervention and 6 months after it ended. Results: From 90/98 eligible subjects who enrolled, 84 completed the study: 41/43 and 43/47 respectively in intervention and control groups. Body mass index, blood pressure, hyperglycemia, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the intervention group improved significantly from baseline. The Self-Efficacy Scale (P = 0.020), Self-Care Activities Questionnaire (P = 0.014) and Perceived Therapeutic Efficacy Scale (P = 0.023) scores improved significantly. Conclusion: This health promotion intervention program enhanced self-efficacy among older adults, with sustained effect through 6-months’ follow-up. These findings are consistent with studies that evaluated the effect of a diabetes education program on self-efficacy. The beneficial effect on a population at high-risk for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, may serve as a model for developing and implementing such interventions. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; blood pressure measurement; blood sampling; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; community assessment; controlled study; demography; dyslipidemia; female; follow up; geriatric patient; health education; health program; health promotion; high risk population; human; hypercholesterolemia; hyperglycemia; hypertension; major clinical study; male; Perceived Therapeutic Efficacy Scale; priority journal; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; Self Care Activities Questionnaire; self concept; Self Efficacy Scale; Taiwan"
"In Vivo Real-Time Discrimination Among Glioma, Infiltration Zone, and Normal Brain Tissue via Autofluorescence Technology",2019,"Background: Surgery is the first-line therapy for glioblastoma. There is evidence that extent of resection is significantly associated with patient survival. Unfortunately, optimal surgical resection is usually limited because of the difficulty in discriminating tumor-infiltrated region and normal brain tissue. This study aimed to develop a tool to distinguish between infiltration zone and normal tissue in real time during glioma surgery. Methods: In an in vivo study, C6 glioma cells were implanted into the left cerebral hemispheres of 6 rats to mimic tumorigenesis. A newly designed optical fiber-embedded needle probe was used to measure the autofluorescence of both cerebral hemispheres at various depths 5 days after the implantation. These rats were then sacrificed, and both cerebral hemispheres were removed for histopathologic analysis. Results: Comparative analyses of corresponding areas by histopathology and autofluorescence revealed highly significant (P < 0.001) differences among the normal tissue, infiltration zone, tumors, and the contralateral cerebral hemispheres. The area of the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.978, and the sensitivity and specificity of tumor delineation were 93.9% and 94.4%, respectively. Conclusions: The newly designed in vivo fiber-optic probe can distinguish tumor-infiltration zones from normal brain tissue in this in vivo study. Therefore, it may help neurosurgeons to increase extent of resection without damaging normal brain tissue and thus potentially improve the patients’ survival and quality of life. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; tryptophan; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autofluorescence; brain tissue; cancer infiltration; cancer patient; cancer surgery; cancer survival; comparative study; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; female; fiber optics; glioblastoma; glioma; glioma cell; histopathology; human; in vivo study; left hemisphere; neuroimaging; neurosurgeon; nonhuman; optical spectroscopy; quality of life; rat; sensitivity and specificity; spectrofluorometry; surgical margin; survival factor; animal; brain; brain tumor; computer system; diagnostic imaging; fluorescence imaging; glioma; pathology; procedures; Sprague Dawley rat; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Animals; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Computer Systems; Female; Fiber Optic Technology; Glioma; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Optical Imaging; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley"
"Overexpression of Aiolos promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell-like properties in lung cancer cells",2019,"Aiolos/Ikaros family zinc finger 3 (IKZF3), a member of the Ikaros family of lymphocyte maturation-driving transcription factors, is highly expressed in hematopoietic malignancies. However, its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties in lung cancer remains unknown. Human lung cancer cell lines H1299 with overexpressing Aiolos (H1299-Aiolos) and A549 with overexpressing Aiolos (A549-Aiolos) were generated by stable transfection. Cell migration and invasion assays were done to demonstrate their invasion and migration ability. Sphere formation assay was used to determine their tumor-initiating capability. Aiolos overexpression induced EMT and increased migration/invasiveness in H1299 and A549 cells. Aiolos overexpression also increased metastatic ability in vivo. Aiolos overexpression upregulated the expression of Twist and matrix metalloproteinase 16 (MMP16). By using knockdown of Twist or an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, EMT, migration/invasiveness ability, and MMP16 expression were reversed in H1299-Aiolos and A549-Aiolos cells. Overexpression of Aiolos upregulated the CSC-like properties in lung cancer cells, and were also reversed by an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase. For lung cancer cells, Aiolos overexpression promotes EMT and CSC-like properties through upregulating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. The information is helpful for developing therapeutic strategies targeting Aiolos expression for lung cancer treatment. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

"Association of apolipoprotein A1 and A5 polymorphisms with stroke subtypes in Han Chinese people in Taiwan",2019,"Background and purposes: Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious disability worldwide. Now, evidences indicate that dyslipidemia may play an important role in stroke. APOA1 and APOA5 involve in lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the association of APOA1 rs670 and APOA5 rs662799 with different stroke subtypes in the Han Chinese population of Taiwan. Methods: A total of 1751 participants, including 459 control subjects, 606 large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), 339 small vessel occlusion (SVO), and 347 hypertensive intracranial hemorrhage (HICH), were enrolled. The presence of rs670 and rs662799 was analyzed through polymerase chain react ion and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight–mass spectrometry. Results: Notably, the frequency of the rs662799 C allele was significantly lower in the SVO patients than in the controls (24.36% vs. 29.74%, P = 0.024). The frequencies of heterozygote TC [odd ratio (OR) = 0.732, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.544–0.984, P = 0.038] and TC + CC (OR = 0.719, 95% CI = 0.542–0.953, P = 0.022) genotypes were significantly lower in the SVO patients than in the controls. In addition, triglyceride levels in individuals carrying the rs662799 TC + CC genotype were significantly higher than in those carrying the TT genotype, especially in older age, female, and body mass index (BMI) ? 25 groups. On the contrary, the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly lower in rs662799 TC + CC genotype than TT genotype. The BMI was significantly lower in subjects with rs662799 TC + CC genotype than those with TT genotype, especially in older age and female. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were higher in individuals carrying the rs670 GG genotype than in those carrying the AG + AA genotype, especially in BMI < 25 group. Logistic regression analysis showed that the rs662799 C allele (TC + CC) was an independent protective factor for SVO after adjustment for conventional risk factors (OR = 0.709, 95% CI = 0.526–0.956; P = 0.024). Conclusion: GG genotype of rs670 is correlated with high serum HDL-C levels, whereas TC + CC genotype of rs662799 is associated with high serum triglyceride and low LDL and BMI levels. In addition, the rs662799 C allele (TC + CC) is an independent protective factor for SVO in the Han Chinese population in Taiwan. ? 2018","apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein A5; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; APOA5 protein, human; apolipoprotein A; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein A5; adult; allele; APOA1 gene; APOA5 gene; Article; atherosclerosis; body mass; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular accident; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; disease association; female; gene frequency; genotype; Han Chinese; heterozygote; human; large artery atherosclerosis; major clinical study; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; priority journal; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; small vessel occlusion; Taiwan; triacylglycerol blood level; vascular disease; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; case control study; cerebrovascular accident; classification; ethnic group; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; male; metabolism; middle aged; physiology; single nucleotide polymorphism; Aged; Alleles; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoprotein A-V; Apolipoproteins A; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Case-Control Studies; Ethnic Groups; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Stroke; Taiwan"
"Cerebrovascular disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: incidence, risk, and clinical outcome",2019,"Cerebrovascular complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) cause serious morbidity and often contribute to mortality. The incidence, risk factors, and outcome of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) after allogeneic HSCT remain poorly defined. We retrospectively evaluated 459 adult patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT at a tertiary medical center between January 2003 and December 2015. A total of 20 patients (4.4%) developed post-transplant CVD. All cerebrovascular accidents occurred in the first two years post-transplant. The two-year incidences of post-transplant CVD, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebrovascular infarction were 6.1%, 3.2%, and 3.2%, respectively. The incidence rate of CVD within two years after HSCT was 34.7 (95% CI 22.3 to ? 53.7) per 1000 person-years, which was about tenfold higher than the general Taiwanese population. The only significant risk factor associated with post-transplant CVD is prior exposure to three or more courses of high-dose cytarabine. Post-transplant CVD is associated with dismal outcome and early mortality. The median overall survival of patients with post-transplant CVD was markedly reduced compared with those without CVD (8.0 vs. 60.6?months). Most patients with post-transplant CVD died within two months after the CVD events. Our study demonstrates that CVD remains a devastating complication after allogeneic HSCT in the modern era. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Hematology.","adult; allograft; cerebrovascular disease; clinical trial; epidemiology; female; follow up; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; incidence; male; mortality; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; Adult; Allografts; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Incidence; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"The importance of extrapulmonary vein triggers and atypical atrial flutter in atrial fibrillation recurrence after cryoablation: Insights from repeat ablation procedures",2019,"Introduction: It has not been previously investigated whether the recurrence mechanism after cryoballoon ablation (CBA) of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) is similar to that of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). We aimed to evaluate the differences of recurrence characteristics between RFCA and CBA after the index procedure. Methods: A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study, and 69 patients underwent pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using a 28-mm second-generation CBA. The control group comprising 140 patients underwent PV isolation using an open-irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter. A total of 69 patients in the CBA group and 69 patients in the RFCA group were investigated after propensity score matching. Recurrence patterns of AF were studied in the repeated procedure. Results: During the index procedure, there was no difference in PV or non-PV triggers between the two groups. Nineteen (27.5%) patients in the CBA group and 19 (27.5%) patients in the RFCA group had recurrence after a follow-up of 11.3 ± 7 months. The Kaplan-Meier curve did not reveal significant difference in recurrence (log-rank, P = 0.364) between the two groups. In the second procedure, the CBA group had more non-PV triggers (63.6%, P = 0.009) and left atrial (LA) flutters (54.5%, P = 0.027) compared with the RFCA group (12.5% and 12.5%, respectively). The PV reconnection rates were similar between both groups. Conclusions: There was no difference in AF recurrence after catheter ablation between CBA and RFCA, but significant increases of non-PV triggers and LA flutter during the second procedure suggest the importance of the atrial substrate in maintaining AF during the second procedure after previous CBA. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; Article; controlled study; cryoablation; extrapulmonary vein; female; follow up; heart atrium flutter; human; intermethod comparison; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; male; paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; priority journal; propensity score; pulmonary vein; pulmonary vein isolation; radiofrequency catheter ablation; recurrent disease; retrospective study"
"Hypersensitivity and Cardiovascular Risks Related to Allopurinol and Febuxostat Therapy in Asians: A Population-Based Cohort Study and Meta-Analysis",2019,"The safety of newer xanthine oxidase inhibitor febuxostat compared to allopurinol remains unclear. To compare the risks of allopurinol hypersensitivity and febuxostat hypersensitivity and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in Asians, we conducted a population-based cohort study enrolling patients receiving allopurinol or febuxostat from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Health System across Taiwan during 2012–2016 and further performed a meta-analysis incorporating two recent studies. Among the 61,539 users, a corresponding 12,007 and 5,680 patients were identified as new users. The overall incidence of febuxostat hypersensitivity was significantly lower than allopurinol hypersensitivity (0.2 vs. 2.7 per 1,000 new users; P?<?0.001). There were 33 allopurinol-hypersensitivity reactions (including 18 severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions), and only one patient developed febuxostat-maculopapular exanthema. Moreover, febuxostat did not statistically increase the risk of CVD (hazard ratio (HR), 1.16; P?=?0.152) and related death (HR, 1.49; P?=?0.496) compared to allopurinol. The result of the meta-analysis also showed a consistent result. In conclusion, the incidence and severity of febuxostat-hypersensitivity are lower than with allopurinol.

"Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and radioimmunotherapy of 188Re-cetuximab in NCI-H292 human lung tumor-bearing nude mice",2019,"Background Cetuximab is a fully humanized IgG1 subclass monoclonal that binds specifically to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Although EGFR is expressed in normal cells, the overexpression of EGFR is detected in many human cancers, such as colon, rectum and lung tumors. In this study, cetuximab with a combination of radiotherapy nuclear 188Re achieved better therapeutic effect on lung cancer. Methods188Re-cetuximab administered by the i.v. route in human NCI-H292 lung tumor-bearing mice was investigated. NanoSPECT/CT images were taken to evaluate the distribution and tumor targeting of 188Re-cetuximab in mice. The anti-tumor effect of 188Re-cetuximab was assessed by the tumor growth inhibition, survival ratio. Results For nanoSPECT/CT imaging, a significant uptake in tumor was observed at 24 and 48?h following the injection of 188Re-cetuximab. The anti-tumor effect of 188Re-cetuximab was assessed by tumor growth inhibition and the survival ratio. The tumor-bearing mice treated with 188Re-cetuximab showed a better mean tumor growth inhibition rate (MGI = 0.049) and longer median survival time and lifespan (62.50 d; 70.07%) than those treated with 188Re-perrhenate and cetuximab only by single injection. A synergistic effect of tumor growth inhibition was observed with the combination index exceeding one for 188Re-cetuximab (CI = 6.135 and 9.276). Conclusion The tumor targeting and localization of 188Re-cetuximab were confirmed in this study. Synergistic therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated for the radioimmunotherapy of 188Re-cetuximab. The results of this study reveal the potential advantage and benefit obtained from 188Re-cetuximab for diagnosis and therapy of oncology applications in the future. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","cetuximab; rhenium 188; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer immunotherapy; cancer survival; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; drug absorption; drug distribution; drug half life; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; immunoreactivity; isotope labeling; lung cancer; male; maximum concentration; maximum tolerated dose; mouse; NCI-H292 cell line; nonhuman; pharmacokinetic parameters; priority journal; radioimmunotherapy; randomized controlled trial; single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography; survival rate; thin layer chromatography"
"Semiparametric regression analysis for left-truncated and interval-censored data without or with a cure fraction",2019,"Interval censoring and truncation arise often in cohort studies, longitudinal and sociological research. In this article, we formulate the effects of covariates on left-truncated and mixed case interval-censored (LTIC) data without or with a cure fraction through a general class of semiparametric transformation models. We propose the conditional likelihood approach for statistical inference. For data without a cure fraction, we propose a computationally efficient EM algorithm, facilitated by a novel data augmentation method, to obtain the conditional maximum likelihood estimator (cMLE). For data with a cure fraction, we consider a semiparametric mixture cure model, which combines a logistic regression formula for the uncured probability with the class of transformation models for the failure time of uncured individuals. To overcome the computational complexity due to the presence of a cure fraction, by reparameterization of cure rate in the conditional likelihood function, we propose a computationally stable EM algorithm for obtaining the cMLE. We show that the cMLEs for the regression parameters are consistent and asymptotically normal. Based on the profile likelihood, we apply an EM-aided numerical differentiation method to compute the asymptotic variance estimates. We demonstrate the performance of our procedures through intensive simulation studies and application to the datasets from the Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Two-Township Study. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Curing; Data reduction; Differentiation (calculus); Metadata; Mixtures; Numerical methods; Regression analysis; Censored data; Conditional likelihood; EM algorithms; Left truncation; Mixture cure model; Maximum likelihood estimation"
"The effectiveness of telemedicine on body mass index: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Object: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of telemedicine on changes in body mass index for overweight and obese people as well as for diabetes and hypertension patients. Methods: A systematic review of articles published before 31 August 2014, was conducted using searches of Medline, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus. The inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials that compared telemedicine interventions with usual care or standard treatment in adults and reported a change in body mass index. A meta-analysis was conducted for eligible studies, and the primary outcome was a change in body mass index. Subgroup analysis was performed for the type of telemedicine, main purpose of intervention, and length of intervention. Results: Twenty-five randomised controlled trials comprising 6253 people were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. The length of intervention ranged from nine weeks to two years. The meta-analysis revealed significant differences in body mass index changes (pooled difference in means = –0.49, 95% confidence interval –0.63 to –0.34, p < 0.001) between the telemedicine and control groups. The subgroup analyses found that either Internet-based or telephone-based intervention was associated with greater changes in body mass index than in controls. Telemedicine intervention was effective in improving body mass index whether it was used for diabetes control, hypertension control, weight loss, or increasing physical activity and was also effective for people with and without diabetes or hypertension. However, only interventions with a duration ? 6 months significantly decreased body mass index compared to controls. Conclusion: Both patients with chronic disease and overweight/obese people could benefit from telemedicine interventions. We suggest that an effective telemedicine approach should be longer than six months and emphasise the importance of post-interventional follow-ups. ?

"Improving the prediction of the trabecular bone microarchitectural parameters using dental cone-beam computed tomography",2019,"Background: In this study, we explored how various preprocessing approaches can be employed to enhance the capability of dental CBCT to accurately estimate trabecular bone microarchitectural parameters. Methods: In total, 30 bovine vertebrae cancellous bone specimens were used for in study. Voxel resolution 18-μm micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and 100-μm dental CBCT were used to scan each specimen. Micro-CT images were used to calculate trabecular bone microarchitectural parameters; the results were set as the gold standard. Subsequently, before the dental CBCT images were converted into binary images to calculate trabecular bone microarchitectural parameters, three preprocessing approaches were used to process the dental CBCT images. For Group 1, no preprocessing approach was applied. For Group 2, images were sharpened and despeckable noises were removed. For Group 3, the function of local thresholding was added to Group 2 to form Group 3. For Group 4, the air pixels was removed from Group 3 to form Group 4. Subsequently, all images were imported into a software package to estimate trabecular bone microarchitectural parameters (bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (TbTh), trabecular number (TbN), and trabecular separation (TbSp)). Finally, a paired t-test and a Pearson correlation test were performed to compare the capability of micro-CT with the capability of dental CBCT for estimating trabecular bone microarchitectural parameters. Results: Regardless of whether dental CBCT images underwent image preprocessing (Groups 1 to 4), the four trabecular bone microarchitectural parameters measured using dental CBCT images were significantly different from those measured using micro-CT images. However, after three image preprocessing approaches were applied to the dental CBCT images (Group 4), the BV/TV obtained using dental CBCT was highly positively correlated with that obtained using micro-CT (r = 0.87, p < 0.001); the correlation coefficient was greater than that of Group 1 (r = -0.15, p = 0.412), Group 2 (r = 0.16, p = 0.386), and Group 3 (r = 0.47, p = 0.006). After dental CBCT images underwent image preprocessing, the efficacy of using dental CBCT for estimating TbN and TbSp was enhanced. Conclusions: Image preprocessing approaches can be used to enhance the efficacy of using dental CBCT for predicting trabecular bone microarchitectural parameters. ? 2019 The Author(s).","article; bone microarchitecture; bovine; cone beam computed tomography; controlled study; correlation coefficient; gold standard; human tissue; micro-computed tomography; noise; nonhuman; prediction; software; thickness; trabecular bone; vertebra; animal; cone beam computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; image processing; jaw; micro-computed tomography; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; trabecular bone; veterinary medicine; Animals; Cancellous Bone; Cattle; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Jaw; Sensitivity and Specificity; X-Ray Microtomography"
"Association between aortic aneurysm and ulcerative colitis: A nationwide taiwanese retrospective cohort study",2019,"Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease that is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Several inflammatory mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of UC are involved in the initiation and progression of aortic aneurysms (AAs). We aimed to evaluate whether patients with UC have an increased risk of AA. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data extracted from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. All medical conditions for each case and control subject were categorized using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between UC and AA were estimated using the Cox regression adjusted for comorbidities. Results: Our analyses included 7256 UC patients and propensity score-matched controls. Compared to the controls, UC patients exhibited a significantly increased risk of developing an AA (adjusted odds ratio = 3.154, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: UC patients have an increased risk of developing an AA, and healthcare professionals should be aware of this risk when treating UC patients. Aortic surveillance may be required for UC patients. ? 2018 Journal of Medical Sciences.","adult; aged; aortic aneurysm; Article; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; female; health care personnel; health insurance; health service; heart failure; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; International Classification of Diseases; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; morbidity; propensity score; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; risk; systemic lupus erythematosus; Taiwan; ulcerative colitis"
"Predictors of weight loss during and after radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer: A longitudinal study",2019,"Purpose: Weight loss is a multifactorial condition that commonly affects patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. The aims of this study were to 1) describe body weight changes over time in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancers and 2) explore the influence of pretreatment weight loss, body mass index (BMI) category, symptom burden, mucositis, and nutritional support on body weight changes over time. Methods: Using a longitudinal design, this study investigated a consecutive cohort of head and neck cancer patients who were treated with radiotherapy between January 2015 to January 2016 in a Taiwan medical center (n = 128). Data regarding symptom burden, mucositis severity, and body weight were collected before radiotherapy (T1), one month after the initial radiotherapy (T2), at the completion of radiotherapy (T3), and one month after the completion of radiotherapy (T4). Results: On average, the participants’ body weight decreased by 3.09 kg (SD = 2.79) from T1 to T2, 1.72 kg (SD = 2.06) from T2 to T3, and continued to decrease by 1.04 kg (SD = 2.87) from T3 to T4. The results of a generalized estimating equation showed that BMI category, symptom burden, mucositis, and nutritional support were directly and independently related to body weight changes over time in patients with head and neck cancers. Conclusions: Head and neck cancer patients experience significant weight loss during and after radiotherapy. The study findings are relevant for assessing nutritional status and providing necessary support measures at critical moments for patients treated with radiotherapy. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; aged; body mass; body weight loss; female; head and neck tumor; human; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; Taiwan; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Radiotherapy; Taiwan; Weight Loss"
"Anti-RNA polymerase III antibody in lupus patients with proteinuria",2019,"Background: To investigate the relationship between serum anti-ribonucleic acid polymerase III (anti-RNAP3) autoantibodies (Abs) and proteinuria severity in lupus patients. Methods: Serum antibodies reacting with anti-RNAP3 were measured in 49 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (29 cases of SLE with proteinuria and 20 cases of SLE without proteinuria) and 10 healthy controls (HCs). For the patients, we recorded demographic data, daily urinary protein loss, serum anti-double strand deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-ds-DNA) antibodies, serum creatinine (Cr), estimated glomerular filtrating rate (eGFR), complement 3 (C3), and C4. Results: Fewer anti-RNAP3 antibodies were found in the SLE patients than in the HCs (p = 0.061). In the SLE with proteinuria group, positive correlations were observed among anti-RNAP3 antibodies and daily urinary protein loss, serum C3, C4, and eGFR, and negative correlations were observed between anti-RNAP3-Abs and anti-ds-DNA-Abs and serum Cr levels. However, these correlations were nonsignificant (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the possible role of anti-RNAP3 antibodies in SLE patients with proteinuria, as evidenced by their positive and negative relationships with daily urinary protein loss, eGFR, C3, C4, serum Cr, and anti-ds-DNA-Abs. Although these correlations were nonsignificant, our study builds a foundation for future tailored studies, and more in-depth studies with larger samples are warranted to provide more information.

"Controlled randomized trial of walking exercise with positive education on cardiovascular fitness and happiness in retired older adults",2019,"Aim: Regular walking exercise (RWE) is associated with increased cardiovascular fitness and might elevate subjective psychological well-being. Positive education links positive psychology concepts with self-efficacy through the curriculum, which helps foster well-being. This study examines if regular walking exercise with positive education has better effects on cardiovascular fitness and happiness than RWE alone in retired older adults. Methods: Three arms of experimental design were used: pedometer walking exercise training (PWET); positive education and pedometer walking exercise training (PEPWET); and pedometer walking exercise (PWE). Trained walking exercise was provided to the PWET and PEPWET groups by a walking exercise coach three times per week, for 45 min per session for 12 weeks. Positive education was designed and led by a licensed PhD psychologist every other week. Of 150 participants, 60, 60 and 30 were randomly assigned to PWET, PEPWET and PWE, respectively. Demographic information, Chinese Happiness Inventory, RWE, and 6-min walking distance were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: The percentage of participants who practiced RWE after 12 weeks was significantly higher in the PEPWET group (96.7%), followed by the PWET (75%) and PWE groups (40%). Cardiovascular fitness in the PWET and PEPWET groups was significantly better than in the PWE group. Chinese Happiness Inventory scores in the PWET and PEPWET groups were significantly higher than in the PWE group, and the PEPWET group also showed significantly higher Chinese Happiness Inventory scores than the PWET group. Conclusions: In addition to RWE, the study findings show that positive education can be beneficial to promote older adults’ RWE, cardiovascular fitness and happiness.

"Traumatic ventricular septal defect in a 1-year-old boy after accidental chest compression by an adult",2019,"We report a 1-year-old boy with a delayed diagnosis of traumatic ventricular septal defect (VSD) related to chest compression. His cardiac function was stable after adequate medical treatment. Spontaneous closure of traumatic VSD occurred to this patient at the age of 4 years. This is a rare case of traumatic VSD associated with accidental chest compression, which is similar to rupture of the ventricular septum after blunt chest trauma. It should be kept in mind that traumatic VSD and concomitant thoracic injuries can develop during chest compression. The clinician should pay attention to the potential risk of traumatic VSD in patients experiencing chest compression. Echocardiography is a convenient and effective tool for serial follow-up examination and avoiding the delayed diagnosis. Troponin I level can be a useful screening test. Conservative management of traumatic VSD with hemodynamic stability is recommended because of possible spontaneous closure. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"The Effect of Acupuncture in Breast Cancer–Related Lymphoedema (BCRL): A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2019,"Background: Breast cancer–related lymphedema (BCRL) is hard to control. Management may include lymphatic drainage, skin care, bandaging, or even surgery. Since acupuncture has been proven to affect the neurophysiology and neuroendocrine systems, it has the potential to control BCRL. Aim: To evaluate the effect of acupuncture in BCRL in randomized controlled trials. Design: A literature search was performed, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and without language restrictions. Data Sources: Five databases were searched from inception tthrough September 2018. Only studies that fulfilled the eligibility criteria of evaluating the effect of acupuncture on lymphedema in breast cancer were included. The methodological quality of these trials was assessed using the Cochrane criteria, and meta-analysis software (RevMan 5.3) was used for analysis. Results: We examined 178 breast cancer patients from 6 trials. All included randomized controlled trials had medium to high quality, based on the modified Jadad scale. The systematic review showed that acupuncture is safe and has a trend to improve symptoms, but trials did not consistently measure outcomes. The meta-analysis showed that acupuncture produced no significant improvement in the extent of lymphedema as compared with the control intervention (?1.90; 95% confidence interval = ?5.39 to 1.59, P =.29). None of the studies reported severe adverse events. Conclusions: Acupuncture is safe and has a trend to improve the lymphedema related to breast cancer, yet it did not significantly change arm circumference in BCRL. Future studies should include both subjective and objective measurements and large-scale studies are warranted. ?

"Comparison of phase mapping and electrogram-based driver mapping for catheter ablation in atrial fibrillation",2019,"Introduction: Adjunctive driver-guided ablation in addition to pulmonary vein isolation has been proposed as a strategy to improve procedural success and outcomes for various populations with atrial fibrillation (AF). First, this study aimed to evaluate the different mapping techniques for driver/rotor identification and second to evaluate the benefits of driver/rotor-guided ablation in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF (PerAF). Methods: We searched the electronic database in PubMed using the keywords “atrial fibrillation,” “rotor,” “rotational driver,” “atrial fibrillation source,” and “drivers” for both randomized controlled trials and observational controlled trials. Clinical studies reporting efficacy or safety outcomes of driver-guided ablation for paroxysmal AF or (PerAF) were identified. We performed subgroup analyses comparing different driver mapping methods in patients with PerAF. The odds ratios (ORs) with random effects were analyzed. Results: Out of 175 published articles, seven met the inclusion criteria, of which two were randomized controlled trials, one was quasiexperimental study, and four observational studies (three case-controlled studies and one cross-sectional study). Overall, adjunctive driver-guided ablation was associated with higher rates of acute AF termination (OR: 4.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.12-10.08; P?<?0.001), lower recurrence of any atrial arrhythmia (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.30-0.065; P?<?0.001), and comparable complication incidence. Conclusions: Adjunctive driver-guided catheter ablation suggested an increased freedom from AF/AT relative to conventional strategies, irrespective of the mapping techniques. Furthermore, phase mapping appears to be superior to electrogram-based driver mapping in PerAF ablation. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article; atrial fibrillation; catheter ablation; clinical effectiveness; electrography; heart atrium arrhythmia; human; intermethod comparison; patient safety; postoperative complication; pulmonary vein isolation; quasi experimental study; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; surgical technique; treatment outcome; atrial fibrillation; catheter ablation; comparative study; heart function test; observational study; pathophysiology; procedures; Atrial Fibrillation; Catheter Ablation; Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"
"Engineering a Nanoscale Al-MOF-Armored Antigen Carried by a “Trojan Horse”-Like Platform for Oral Vaccination to Induce Potent and Long-Lasting Immunity",2019,"Vaccination via the oral administration of an antigen faces many challenges, including gastrointestinal (GI) proteolysis and mucosal barriers. To limit GI proteolysis, a biomimetically mineralized aluminum-based metal–organic framework (Al-MOF) system that is resistant to ambient temperature and pH and can act synergistically as a delivery vehicle and an adjuvant is synthesized over a model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to act as armor. To overcome mucosal barriers, a yeast-derived capsule is used to carry the Al-MOF-armored OVA as a “Trojan Horse”-like transport platform. In vitro experiments reveal that the mineralization of Al-MOFs forms an armor on OVA that protects against highly acidic and degradative GI conditions. However, the mineralized Al-MOFs can gradually disintegrate in a phosphate ion-containing simulated intracellular fluid, slowly releasing their encapsulated OVA. In vivo studies reveal that the “Trojan Horse”-like transport platform specifically targets intestinal M cells, favoring the transepithelial transport of the Al-MOF-armored OVA, followed by subsequent endocytosis in local macrophages, ultimately accumulating in mesenteric lymph nodes, yielding long-lasting, high-levels of mucosal S-IgA and serum IgG antibodies. Such an engineered delivery platform may represent a promising strategy for the oral administration of prophylactic or therapeutic antigens for vaccination. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Off-resonance SERS nanoprobe-targeted screen of biomarkers for antigens recognition of bladder normal and aggressive cancer cells",2019,"The discovery of different binding receptors to allow rapid and high-sensitivity detection via a noninvasive urine test has become the goal for urothelial carcinoma (UC) diagnosis and surveillance. In this study, we developed a new screening membrane receptor platform for bladder cancer cells by integrating surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP)-modified AuAg nanohollows upon NIR laser excitation. AuAg nanohollows have an absorption band at ?630 nm, and slightly off-resonance 785 nm laser excitation is used for minimal photothermal effect. Using the same carbodiimide cross-linker chemistry to conjugate anti-EGFR, transferrin (TF), 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid (CPBA), folic acid (FA), and hyaluronic acid (HA) molecules, by screening the 4-ATP SERS signals intensity, we demonstrated that the targeting efficiency with the cost-effective CPBA molecule is comparable with the conjugation of anti-EGFR antibody to aggressive T24 cancer cells (high-grade), while weak intensity 4-ATP SERS responses to targets were obtained by grade-I RT4 bladder cancer cells, NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells, and SV-HUC1 bladder normal cells. This SERS nanoprobe platform makes primary bladder carcinoma screening from in vitro to ex vivo more straightforward. Our demonstration offers exciting potential for SERS screening of specific receptors on cancer cells of different grades and facilitates new opportunities ranging from surface engineering of SERS material tags to SERS imaging-guided and targeted phototherapy of cancer cells by controlling the laser powers. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell culture; Cell engineering; Cost effectiveness; Diseases; Gold alloys; Hyaluronic acid; Laser excitation; Molecules; Nanoprobes; Organic acids; Raman spectroscopy; Silver alloys; Binding receptors; Bladder cancer cells; High-sensitivity detection; Membrane receptors; Photothermal effects; Surface engineering; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Urothelial carcinoma; Cells"
"Loss of Gut Microbiota Alters Immune System Composition and Cripples Postinfarction Cardiac Repair",2019,"Background: The impact of gut microbiota on the regulation of host physiology has recently garnered considerable attention, particularly in key areas such as the immune system and metabolism. These areas are also crucial for the pathophysiology of and repair after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the role of the gut microbiota in the context of MI remains to be fully elucidated. Methods: To investigate the effects of gut microbiota on cardiac repair after MI, C57BL/6J mice were treated with antibiotics 7 days before MI to deplete mouse gut microbiota. Flow cytometry was applied to examine the changes in immune cell composition in the heart. 16S rDNA sequencing was conducted as a readout for changes in gut microbial composition. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) species altered after antibiotic treatment were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fecal reconstitution, transplantation of monocytes, or dietary SCFA or Lactobacillus probiotic supplementation was conducted to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of microbiota on the mice after MI. Results: Antibiotic-treated mice displayed drastic, dose-dependent mortality after MI. We observed an association between the gut microbiota depletion and significant reductions in the proportion of myeloid cells and SCFAs, more specifically acetate, butyrate, and propionate. Infiltration of CX3CR1+ monocytes to the peri-infarct zone after MI was also reduced, suggesting impairment of repair after MI. Accordingly, the physiological status and survival of mice were significantly improved after fecal reconstitution, transplantation of monocytes, or dietary SCFA supplementation. MI was associated with a reorganization of the gut microbial community such as a reduction in Lactobacillus. Supplementing antibiotic-treated mice with a Lactobacillus probiotic before MI restored myeloid cell proportions, yielded cardioprotective effects, and shifted the balance of SCFAs toward propionate. Conclusions: Gut microbiota-derived SCFAs play an important role in maintaining host immune composition and repair capacity after MI. This suggests that manipulation of these elements may provide opportunities to modulate pathological outcome after MI and indeed human health and disease as a whole. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.","acetic acid; ampicillin; butyric acid; DNA 16S; metronidazole; neomycin; probiotic agent; propionic acid; short chain fatty acid; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; fatty acid; probiotic agent; animal experiment; animal tissue; antibiotic therapy; Article; Clostridium; controlled study; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; dose response; Dressler syndrome; echocardiography; fecal microbiota transplantation; flow cytometry; heart protection; heart rupture; heart weight; high performance liquid chromatography; immune response; immune system; immunomodulation; intestine flora; Lactobacillus; left anterior descending coronary artery; male; metabolic syndrome X; metabolite; microbial community; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; pathophysiology; Prevotella; priority journal; regeneration; survival; animal; bacterium; C57BL mouse; cardiac muscle; disease model; drug effect; dysbiosis; female; heart infarction; host pathogen interaction; immunology; intestine flora; metabolism; microbiology; monocyte; pathology; RAW 264.7 cell line; transgenic mouse; transplantation; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Disease Models, Animal; Dysbiosis; Fatty Acids; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Lactobacillus; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Monocytes; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardium; Probiotics; RAW 264.7 Cells"
"Antiviral effect of saikosaponin B2 in combination with daclatasvir on NS5A resistance-associated substitutions of hepatitis C virus",2019,"Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major causative agent of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The rapid progress in the development of direct-acting antivirals1 has greatly elevated the cure rate to ?95% in recent years. However, the high cost of treatment is not affordable to patients in some countries, necessitating the development of less expensive treatment. Methods: We adopted a cell culture-derived HCV system to screen a library of the pure compounds extracted from herbs deposited in the chemical bank of the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Taiwan. Results: We found that saikosaponin B2 inhibited viral entry, replication, and translation. Saikosaponin B2 is a plant glycoside and a component of xiao-chai-hu-tang, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine extracted from the roots of Bupleurum falcatum. It also inhibited daclatasvir-resistant mutant strains of HCV, especially in combination with daclatasvir. Conclusion: Our results may aid the development of a new combination therapy useful for patients with HCV who are intolerant or refractory to the currently available medications, including pegylated interferon and direct-acting antiviral agents.

"Cognitive impairment in patients with end-stage renal disease: Accelerated brain aging?",2019,"Background: Chronic kidney disease exhibits a prominent premature aging phenotype in many different organ systems, including the brain. Nevertheless, a comprehensive characterization of brain aging in non-demented patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is lacking and it remains unclear if the collective changes of cognitive functions and brain structures in ESRD is compatible with aging. Methods: We compared 56 non-demented, independently living dialysis patients (mean age 59.4 ± 11.0 years; mean dialysis vintage of 5.9 years) and 60 non-dialysis controls on a battery of neuropsychological tests, brain MRI T1 imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Participants with diagnosis of dementia, Mini-Mental State Examination <24, medical history of stroke, or recent hospitalization within 1 month were excluded. Results: Dialysis patients showed significantly worse performance in attention/information processing speed and executive function adjusted for age, sex, education, diabetes and depression. Reduced total brain volume and subcortical volume including hippocampus were found in dialysis patients. Vertex-wise analysis showed cortical thinning in middle frontal, lateral occipital and precuneus region. Furthermore, decreased white matter integrity was found primarily in bilateral anterior thalamic tract, fronto-occipital fasciculus, forceps minor and uncinate tract after correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: Overall, differences in cognitive functions, cortical volumes/thickness and white matter integrity associated with dialysis are also cognitive domains and brain structure changes associated with normal aging. In other words, non-demented, independently living dialysis patients present an accelerated brain aging phenotype even after taking into account effects of age, diabetes and depression. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","adult; aged; aging; amygdala; Article; attention; brain size; capsula interna; caudate nucleus; cognitive defect; controlled study; corona radiata (brain); cortical thickness (brain); depression; diabetes mellitus; diffusion tensor imaging; end stage renal disease; executive function; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; Geriatric Depression Scale; globus pallidus; gray matter; hemodialysis; hemodialysis patient; hippocampus; human; hypertension; independent living; inferior longitudinal fasciculus; information processing; major clinical study; male; medial frontal cortex; mental performance; middle frontal gyrus; Mini Mental State Examination; neuropsychological test; nucleus accumbens; occipital gyrus; occipitofrontal fasciculus; peritoneal dialysis; postcentral gyrus; precuneus; processing speed; putamen; pyramidal tract; Stroop test; subcortex; thalamus; thalamus anterior nucleus; trail making test; uncinate fasciculus; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; Wechsler memory scale; white matter; adverse event; aging; brain; brain mapping; chronic kidney failure; cognition; cognitive defect; complication; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; Taiwan; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Renal Dialysis; Taiwan"
"Analgesic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on modified 2010 criteria-diagnosed fibromyalgia: Pilot study",2019,"Aim: Fibromyalgia is often comorbid with depression, and less than half those patients achieve satisfactory improvement after adequate pharmacological intervention. The investigation of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for modified-2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD) is still in its infancy. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, sham-control study, subjects diagnosed with ACR-2010 fibromyalgia and DSM-IV-TR MDD were recruited and received either active or sham interventions for 2 weeks. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the 10-cm visual analogue pain scale were evaluated at baseline, week 1, and week 2. Multivariable generalized estimating equations analysis was performed for the association between depression and pain scores at each checkpoint. Results: Twenty subjects were recruited. There was a significant difference over the 2 weeks between the rTMS and sham stimulation groups (P = 0.029), but subgroup analyses were further performed due to significant interaction of group and HDRS on pain outcomes (P = 0.020). The active group had significant improvement in pain at week 2 compared with week 1 (P = 0.021), but the control group did not have any improvement in pain (P = 0.585). Of the mild–moderate depression patients, the pain score in the active group was significantly lower than in the sham group at week 1 (P = 0.001) and at week 2 (P < 0.001). For the severe depression group, there was significantly lower pain over the 2 weeks in the active group (P = 0.045) but the sham group had significantly relapsing pain at week 2 (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Left prefrontal rTMS has an analgesic effect in modified-ACR 2010-defined fibromyalgia and MDD patients. Further investigation is required, however, in order to determine how to regulate the different rTMS treatment protocols according to individual baseline depression severity in patients with MDD and fibromyalgia. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Association Between Orthostatic Hypotension and Frailty in Hospitalized Older Patients: A Geriatric Syndrome More Than a Cardiovascular Condition",2019,"Objectives: To explore the association between orthostatic hypotension (OH) and frailty for hospitalized older patients and their vulnerable subgroups. Design: A prospective, observational cross-sectional study. Participants: 693 older patients admitted to a geriatric evaluation and management unit. Measurements: Barthel Index, Lawton’s instrumental activities of daily living, clinical frailty scale, mini-mental state examination, geriatric depression scale, mini-nutritional assessment, and polypharmacy. Results: Overall, the prevalence of OH and frailty was 26% and 36%, respectively. Subjects with OH were older, thinner, more commonly to have weakness, slowness, poorer physical function and higher levels of frailty. The prevalence of OH was substantially increased as higher levels of CFS (p for trend <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed significant association between OH and frailty (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.7), but the association attenuated after adjustment for physical function. (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.7-2.6). Nevertheless, associations between OH and frailty remained significant among vulnerable subgroups like women, subjects having weakness, slowness, poor cognitive function, polypharmacy or any IADL limitation. Conclusions: OH in hospitalized older patients was associated with frailty and multiple complex care needs, especially in the vulnerable subgroups. Further study is needed to clarify the roles of OH in clinical practice. ? 2019, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.","aged; Article; Barthel index; clinical evaluation; clinical practice; cognition; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; female; frailty; Geriatric Depression Scale; health care need; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; ICIQ (incontinence); Lawton instrumental activities of daily living scale; major clinical study; male; managed care; Mini Mental State Examination; muscle weakness; nutritional assessment; observational study; orthostatic hypotension; physical activity; polypharmacy; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; slowness; walking speed"
"OCT4B mediates hypoxia-induced cancer dissemination",2019,"Hypoxia, the reduction of oxygen levels in cells or tissues, elicits a set of genes to adjust physiological and pathological demands during normal development and cancer progression. OCT4, a homeobox transcription factor, is essential for self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, but little is known about the role of OCT4 in non-germ-cell tumorigenesis. Here, we report that hypoxia stimulates a short isoform of OCT4, called OCT4B, via a HIF2α-dependent pathway to induce the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and facilitate cancer dissemination. OCT4B overexpression decreased epithelial barrier properties, which led to an increase in cell migration and invasion in lung cancer cells. OCT4B knockdown attenuated HIF2α-induced EMT and inhibited cancer dissemination in cell-line and animal models. We observed that OCT4B bound the SLUG promoter and enhanced its expression, and SLUG silencing inhibited OCT4B-mediated EMT, accompanied with decreased cell migration and invasion. Correlation analysis revealed that OCT4B expression was significantly associated with the SLUG level in lung tumors. These results provide novel insights into OCT4B-mediated oncogenesis in cancer dissemination. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","hypoxia inducible factor 2alpha; octamer transcription factor 4; octamer transcription factor 4B; transcription factor Slug; unclassified drug; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1; octamer transcription factor 4; POU5F1 protein, human; Pou5f1 protein, mouse; tumor protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; gene silencing; HIF2 alpha gene; human; human tissue; lung cancer cell line; lung tumor; male; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; OCT4B gene; oncogene; priority journal; promoter region; signal transduction; SLUG gene; tumor hypoxia; A-549 cell line; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell transformation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genetics; hypoxia; lung tumor; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; A549 Cells; Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Humans; Hypoxia; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Proteins; Octamer Transcription Factor-3"
"Validation of a nomogram to predict the risk of cancer in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and main duct dilatation of 10 mm or less",2019,"Background: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is premalignant pancreatic lesion. International guidelines offer limited predictors of individual risk. A nomogram to predict individual IPMN malignancy risk was released, with good diagnostic performance based on a large cohort of Asian patients with IPMN. The present study validated a nomogram to predict malignancy risk and invasiveness of IPMN using both Eastern and Western cohorts. Methods: Clinicopathological and radiological data from patients who underwent pancreatic resection for IPMN at four centres each in Eastern and Western countries were collected. After excluding patients with missing data for at least one malignancy predictor in the nomogram (main pancreatic duct diameter, cyst size, presence of mural nodule, serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 levels, and age). Results: In total, data from 393 patients who fit the criteria were analysed, of whom 265 were from Eastern and 128 from Western institutions. Although mean age, sex, log value of serum CA19-9 level, tumour location, main duct diameter, cyst size and presence of mural nodule differed between the Korean/Japanese, Eastern and Western cohorts, rates of malignancy and invasive cancer did not differ significantly. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve values for the nomogram predicting malignancy were 0·745 for Eastern, 0·856 for Western and 0·776 for combined cohorts; respective values for the nomogram predicting invasiveness were 0·736, 0·891 and 0·788. Conclusions: External validation of the nomogram showed good performance in predicting cancer in both Eastern and Western patients with IPMN lesions. ? 2019 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CA 19-9 antigen; carcinoembryonic antigen; adult; Article; bile duct dilatation; cancer risk; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; cyst size; diagnostic value; digestive tract parameters; endoscopic ultrasonography; female; human; intraductal papillary mucinous tumor; major clinical study; male; medical parameters; middle aged; nomogram; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pancreatic duct diameter; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; tumor invasion; tumor localization"
"Efficacy of azatyrosine-phenylbutyric hydroxamides, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal mucositis",2019,"Gastrointestinal mucositis is a serious side effect of chemotherapy. Currently, no effective treatment exists for chemotherapy-induced mucositis, prompting the need to develop an anti-mucositis agent for use in clinics. The present study investigated whether azatyrosine-PBHA (AzP), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has a therapeutic effect on intestinal mucosa. The results indicated that AzP did not affect the proliferation and viability of cancer cells, outcomes that are achieved by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). However, AzP could decrease production of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In vivo histopathological assessment showed that AzP reduced cisplatin-induced injury to the jejunum villi and triggered weight loss in the C57BL/6 mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results demonstrated that mice treated with AzP also recovered from cisplatin-induced injury to the intestinal mucosa. Mechanistic in vitro study using DAVID/KEGG enrichment analysis of microarray data and confirmation by a Western blot indicated the influence of AzP on the MEK/ERK and AKT-dependent pathway. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that AzP might regulate the MEK/ERK MAPK signaling pathway to attenuate MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 production and provide opportunities for the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs targeting mucositis. ? 2019 by the authors.

"In vivo selection reveals autophagy promotes adaptation of metastatic ovarian cancer cells to abdominal microenvironment",2019,"Peritoneal dissemination is the most frequent metastatic route of ovarian cancer. However, due to the high heterogeneity in ovarian cancer, most conventional studies lack parental tumor controls relevant to metastases and, thus, it is difficult to trace the molecular changes of cancer cells along with the selection by the abdominal microenvironment. Here, we established an in vivo mouse peritoneal dissemination scheme that allowed us to select more aggressive sublines from parental ovarian cancer cells, including A2780 and SKOV-3. Microarray and gene profiling analyses indicated that autophagy-related genes were enriched in selected malignant sublines. Detection of LC3-II, p62 and autophagic puncta demonstrated that these malignant variants were more sensitive to autophagic induction when exposed to diverse stress conditions, such as high cell density, starvation and drug treatment. As compared with parental A2780, the selected variant acquired the ability to grow better under high-density stress; however, this effect was reversed by addition of autophagic inhibitors or knockdown of ATG5. When analyzing the clinical profiles of autophagy-related genes identified to be enriched in malignant A2780 variant, 73% of them had prognostic significance for the survival of ovarian cancer patients. Taken together, our findings indicate that an increase in autophagic potency among ovarian cancer cells is crucial for selection of metastatic colonies in the abdominal microenvironment. In addition, the derived autophagic gene profile can not only predict prognosis well but can also be potentially applied to precision medicine for identifying those ovarian cancer patients suitable for taking anti–autophagy cancer drugs. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Decoy Receptor 3 Expression Is Associated With Wild-Type EGFR Status, Poor Differentiation of Tumor, and Unfavorable Patient Outcome",2019,"OBJECTIVES: The role of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) in lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma, has not been well studied. In this study, we aim to investigate the expression profile and the clinicopathologic implications of DcR3 expression in lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to examine DcR3 expression in 461 lung adenocarcinomas. The differences in DcR3 expression among the various histopathologic patterns were analyzed. The relationship between DcR3 expression and clinicopathologic parameters, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, was also investigated. RESULTS: DcR3 expression was more frequently expressed in solid, micropapillary, and acinar patterns (P < .0001) and in tumors with wild-type EGFR status (P = .018). In addition, DcR3 expression portends a less favorable disease-free survival in stage I patients (P = .012). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of DcR3 might be involved in the differentiation and progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, DcR3 may be applied clinically for prediction of tumor progression in stage I lung adenocarcinoma. ? American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019. All rights reserved.

"Ultrasound-Guided Prolotherapy for Acromial Enthesopathy and Acromioclavicular Joint Arthropathy: A Single-Arm Prospective Study",2019,"Objectives: Prolotherapy is an injection-based complementary treatment for various musculoskeletal diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ultrasound-guided prolotherapy in the treatment of acromial enthesopathy and acromioclavicular joint arthropathy. Methods: Thirty-one patients with chronic moderate-to-severe shoulder pain were recruited from September 2015 to September 2017. Ultrasound-guided prolotherapy was performed by injecting 10 mL of a 15% dextrose solution into the acromial enthesis of the deltoid or acromioclavicular joint capsule aseptically. Prolotherapy was given in 2 sessions separated by a 1-month interval. The pretreatment-to-posttreatment change in the pain visual analog scale (VAS) score was recorded as the primary outcome. The mean follow-up duration was 61.8 days. A paired t test was used to assess the difference in pretreatment and posttreatment VAS scores. A univariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the demographic variables associated with substantial pain reduction after the intervention. Substantial pain reduction was defined as a posttreatment VAS score of 3 or less. Results: Twenty of the 31 patients reported substantial pain reduction without adverse effects after the intervention. The mean VAS score reduction ± SD was 4.3 ± 2.6 (pretreatment, 6.8 ± 1.5; posttreatment, 2.5 ± 2.1; P <.01). Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided prolotherapy with a 15% dextrose solution is an effective and safe therapeutic option for moderate-to-severe acromial enthesopathy and acromioclavicular joint arthropathy. ? 2018 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine","Dextrose; Musculoskeletal system; Regression analysis; Ultrasonics; acromial enthesopathy; acromioclavicular joint arthropathy; musculoskeletal; prolotherapy; Ultrasound guided; Patient treatment; glucose; acromioclavicular joint; acromion; adult; aged; analgesia; arthropathy; diagnostic imaging; enthesopathy; female; human; interventional ultrasonography; intraarticular drug administration; male; middle aged; pain; pathophysiology; procedures; prolotherapy; prospective study; treatment outcome; Acromioclavicular Joint; Acromion; Adult; Aged; Enthesopathy; Female; Glucose; Humans; Injections, Intra-Articular; Joint Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Pain Management; Prolotherapy; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography, Interventional"

"Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3α Promotes Fatty Acid Uptake and Lipotoxic Cardiomyopathy",2019,"Obesity induces lipotoxic cardiomyopathy, a condition in which lipid accumulation in cardiomyocytes causes cardiac dysfunction. Here, we show that glycogen synthase kinase-3α (GSK-3α) mediates lipid accumulation in the heart. Fatty acids (FAs) upregulate GSK-3α, which phosphorylates PPARα at Ser280 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). This modification ligand independently enhances transcription of a subset of PPARα targets, selectively stimulating FA uptake and storage, but not oxidation, thereby promoting lipid accumulation. Constitutively active GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, was sufficient to drive PPARα signaling, while cardiac-specific knockdown of GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, or replacement of PPARα Ser280 with Ala conferred resistance to lipotoxicity in the heart. Fibrates, PPARα ligands, inhibited phosphorylation of PPARα at Ser280 by inhibiting the interaction of GSK-3α with the LBD of PPARα, thereby reversing lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. These results suggest that GSK-3α promotes lipid anabolism through PPARα-Ser280 phosphorylation, which underlies the development of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy in the context of obesity. Nakamura et al. investigate the mechanisms underlying the development of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. Fatty-acid-induced upregulation of GSK-3α acts as a central regulator of cardiac fatty acid metabolism by stimulating a biased PPARα transcriptional response via Ser280 phosphorylation, favoring fatty acid uptake. A reversal of Ser280 phosphorylation attenuates lipotoxicity. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","acad1 protein; alanine; CD36 antigen; fatty acid; fibric acid derivative; glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; retinoid X receptor; serine; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cardiomyopathy; controlled study; enzyme phosphorylation; fatty acid transport; gene expression; H9c2(2-1) cell line; haploinsufficiency; heart; ligand binding; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; promoter region; upregulation"
"Synergistic effects of cAMP–dependent protein kinase A and AMP-activated protein kinase on lipolysis in kinsenoside-treated C3H10T1/2 adipocytes",2019,"Background: We previously showed that 3-O?β?D?glucopyranosyl?(3R)?hydroxybutanolide (kinsenoside), a major compound of Anoectochilus formosanus, increased lipolysis through an AMP–activated protein kinase (AMPK)–dependent pathway. Purpose: To extend our previous finding, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of kinsenoside on lipolysis and the involvement of cyclic AMP (cAMP)–dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and AMPK in kinsenoside-mediated lipolysis. Study design/methods: Mice were fed a high-fat diet for six weeks to induce lipid deposition and then treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg kinsenoside for two weeks. The coordination of PKA and AMPK activation in lipolysis in C3H10T1/2 adipocytes was evaluated in vitro by using PKA and AMPK's corresponding inhibitors, oil-red O staining, a glycerol production assay, and Western blot analysis. Results: Kinsenoside reduced body weight, fat pad mass, and hepatic lipid accumulation in obese mice, and concurrently increased the induction and activation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), perilipin, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1). Kinsenoside concentration-dependently increased PKA activation by increasing the phosphorylation of Ser/Thr-PKA substrates in vitro. These increases were accompanied by a reduction in fat accumulation. Using H89 and Rp-8-Br-cAMPs to inhibit PKA reduced the release of glycerol but did not alter the activation of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor alpha or the expression of CPT1 or ATGL. By contrast, compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, inhibited CPT1 and ATGL expression in kinsenoside-treated C3H10T1/2 adipocytes. In addition, H89 caused the reactivation of AMPK downstream targets by increasing the levels of the active form of pAMPK-Thr172, suggesting that PKA negatively modulates AMPK activity. Conclusion: Kinsenoside increased HSL activation through PKA-mediated phosphorylation at Ser660/563 and concomitantly increased perilipin activation in lipolysis. These lipolytic effects of kinsenoside were validated using 6-Bnz-cAMPs, a PKA agonist. In this study, we demonstrated that in addition to AMPK, PKA also plays a crucial role in kinsenoside-mediated lipolysis. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH","adipose triglyceride lipase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; glycerol; herbaceous agent; hormone sensitive lipase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; isoprenaline; kinsenoside; perilipin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; serine; threonine; triacylglycerol lipase; unclassified drug; 3-glucopyranosyloxybutanolide; cholesterol esterase; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; gamma butyrolactone; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; monosaccharide; plant extract; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; body weight; C3H/10T1/2 clone 8 cell line; concentration response; controlled study; embryo; enzyme reactivation; fat mass; fat pad; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid diet; lipid liver level; lipid storage; lipolysis; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; optimal drug dose; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; study design; Western blotting; adipocyte; analogs and derivatives; animal; chemistry; drug effect; lipolysis; metabolism; Orchidaceae; 4-Butyrolactone; Adipocytes; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Lipolysis; Male; Mice; Monosaccharides; Orchidaceae; Plant Extracts; Sterol Esterase"

"Redefining MDR-TB: Comparison of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Russia and Taiwan",2019,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis are global challenges due to the limited number of effective drugs for treatment. Treatment with less than 4–5 effective drugs might lead to the further emergence of drug resistance and poor clinical outcomes. For better prediction of treatment outcomes, we compared drug-resistance profiles of consecutive clinical MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from high- and low-burden settings. This was a retrospective cohort study. We analysed 225 and 229 MDR isolates from Moscow (Russia) and Taiwan, respectively, obtained between 2014 and 2015. Drug susceptibility testing was performed by the Bactec MGIT 960 automated system and the agar proportion method. Detection of resistance-associated mutations in the M. tuberculosis genome was carried out by an array and/or sequencing of selected loci. The principal differences between resistance profiles of MDR isolates in the two countries were the percentages of pre-XDR (40.9% vs. 14.8%) and XDR (34.7% vs. 1.7%) isolates, both of which were significantly higher in Moscow isolates. Forty-eight (33%) of 147 MDR and pre-XDR Russian isolates fall into a group with less than four effective drugs, which accounts for 40% (N = 120) of these isolates. The other 60% in this group were XDR strains (N = 72). Consequently, the average number of effective anti-tuberculosis drugs for MDR-TB treatment was lower for Russian isolates (3 vs. 7). Furthermore, a notable percentage (9%) of isolates resistant to kanamycin harboured mutations in the whiB7 locus, which was not detected by molecular tests targeting common mutations in the rrs and eis loci. We found that 98.2% and 45.9% of MDR isolates from Moscow and Taiwan, respectively, were resistant to streptomycin. Molecular tests for detecting resistance to drugs other than rifampicin, isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, and second-line injectable drugs are needed for individualized therapy. The conventional MDR treatment schemes most probably fail in these cases due to the limited number of effective drugs. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","ethambutol; kanamycin; pyrazinamide; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; rifampicin; streptomycin; agar diffusion; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; automation; bacterial gene; bacterium isolate; cohort analysis; controlled study; DNA microarray; eis gene; extensively drug resistant tuberculosis; gene locus; gene mutation; gene sequence; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; priority journal; retrospective study; rrs gene; Russian Federation; Taiwan; whiB7 gene"
"Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade-based nomogram to predict tumor recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Background: Tumor recurrence after curative resection is common in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but large-scale long-term prediction on an individual basis has seldom been reported. We aimed to construct an albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade-based nomogram to predict tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing surgical resection. Methods: A total 1038 patients with newly diagnosed HCC undergoing curative resection between 2002 and 2016 were enrolled. Baseline characteristics, tumor status and severity of liver functional reserve were collected. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to predict tumor recurrence and construct the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the discrimination and calibration tests. Results: After a mean follow up time of 30 months, 510 (49%) patients developed tumor recurrence. The cumulative recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 79%, 51%, 38% and 26%, respectively. In the Cox multivariate model, ALBI grade 2–3, multiple tumors, tumor size equal or large than 2 cm, serum ?-fetoprotein level equal or greater than 20 ng/ml and total tumor volume equal or larger than 227 cm 3 were independent risk factors associated with tumor recurrence. A nomogram was constructed based on these five variables. Internal validation with 10,380 bootstrapped sample sets had a good concordance of 0.607 (95% of confidence interval: 0.587–0.627). The calibration plots for 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival well matched the idealized 45-degree line. Conclusions: ALBI is a feasible marker for tumor recurrence. This easy-to-use ALBI grade-based nomogram may predict tumor recurrence for individual HCC patient undergoing surgical resection. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology","albumin; alpha fetoprotein; bilirubin; sorafenib; bilirubin; serum albumin; tumor marker; adult; alpha fetoprotein blood level; Article; association; cancer patient; cancer survival; disease severity; female; follow up; hepatitis B; hospital patient; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score; multiple cancer; nomogram; priority journal; proportional hazards model; recurrence free survival; risk factor; surgical oncology; tumor recurrence; tumor volume; cancer grading; liver cell carcinoma; liver function test; liver tumor; metabolism; middle aged; nomogram; pathology; predictive value; retrospective study; survival rate; tumor recurrence; Bilirubin; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Humans; Liver Function Tests; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Nomograms; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Serum Albumin; Survival Rate"
"The Relationship Between Air Pollution and Lung Cancer in Nonsmokers in Taiwan",2019,"Introduction: For never-smokers (smoked &lt;100 lifetime cigarettes), lung cancer (LC) has emerged as an important issue. We aimed to investigate the effects of prevalence changes in tobacco smoking and particulate matter (PM) 2.5 (PM 2.5 ) levels on LC in Taiwan, in relation to contrasting PM 2.5 levels, between Northern Taiwan (NT) and Southern Taiwan (ST). Methods: We reviewed 371,084 patients with LC to assess smoking prevalence and correlations between the incidence of adenocarcinoma lung cancer (AdLC) and non-AdLC. Two subsets were selected to assess different AdLC stage trends and the effect of PM 2.5 on survival of patients with AdLC. Results: From 1995 to 2015, the proportion of male adult ever-smokers decreased from 59.4% to 29.9% whereas the female smoking rate remained low (3.2% to 5.3%). AdLC incidence in males and females increased from 9.06 to 23.25 and 7.05 to 24.22 per 100,000 population, respectively. Since 1993, atmospheric visibility in NT improved (from 7.6 to 11.5 km), but deteriorated in ST (from 16.3 to 4.2 km). The annual percent change in AdLC stages IB to IV was 0.3% since 2009 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.9%–2.6%) in NT, and 4.6% since 2007 (95% CI: 3.3%–5.8%) in ST; 53% patients with LC had never smoked. Five-year survival rates for never-smokers, those with EGFR wild-type genes, and female patients with AdLC were 12.6% in NT and 4.5% in ST (hazard ratio: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70–0.90). Conclusions: In Taiwan, greater than 50% of patients with LC had never smoked. PM 2.5 level changes can affect AdLC incidence and patient survival. ? 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","adult; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; geographic distribution; human; human tissue; incidence; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; population research; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; sex difference; smoking; survival rate; Taiwan"

This guideline was prepared by the 2017 Guidelines Recommendations for Evidence-based Antimicrobial agents use in Taiwan (GREAT) working group, formed under the auspices of the Infectious Diseases Society of Taiwan (IDST). A consensus meeting was held jointly by the IDST, Taiwan Society of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (TSPCCM), the Medical Foundation in Memory of Dr. Deh-Lin Cheng, the Foundation of Professor Wei-Chuan Hsieh for Infectious Diseases Research and Education and CY Lee's Research Foundation for Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Vaccines. The final guideline was endorsed by the IDST and TSPCCM. The major differences between this guideline and the 2007 version include the following: the use of GRADE methodology for the evaluation of available evidence whenever applicable, the specific inclusion of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a category due to the unique medical system in Taiwan and inclusion of recommendations for treatment of pediatric pneumonia. This guideline includes the epidemiology and recommendations of antimicrobial treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia in adults and pediatric pneumonia. ? 2019","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter; adult; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; Burkholderia pseudomallei; carbapenem resistance; child; child hospitalization; Chlamydia pneumoniae; chlamydial pneumonia; community acquired pneumonia; comorbidity; disease severity; drug dose escalation; Enterobacteriaceae; epidemiological data; Haemophilus influenzae; health care associated pneumonia; hemodialysis associated pneumonia; hemodynamic parameters; hospital acquired pneumonia; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; infection risk; intensive care unit; Legionella; Letter; medical history; Moraxella catarrhalis; mortality risk; multidrug resistance; Mycoplasma pneumonia; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; nonhuman; nursing home associated pneumonia; outpatient care; pediatric patient; pneumonia; practice guideline; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas pneumonia; risk factor; staphylococcal pneumonia; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pneumonia; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Taiwan; time out (healthcare); ventilator associated pneumonia; epidemiology; evidence based medicine; intensive care; organization and management; pneumonia; practice guideline; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Child; Critical Care; Evidence-Based Medicine; GRADE Approach; Humans; Pneumonia; Taiwan"
"Fluoroscopic angiography quantifies delay in cerebral circulation time and requires less radiation in carotid stenosis patients: A pilot study",2019,"Background: Quantitative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) facilitates in-room assessment of flow changes in various cerebrovascular diseases and improves patient safety. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative fluoroscopic angiography (FA) and DSA. Methods: Twenty-two patients with >70% carotid stenosis according to NASCET criteria were prospectively included in the study. All patients received DSA and FA (ArtisZee, Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) before and after carotid stenting in the same angiosuite. The regions of interest (ROIs) included the extracranial internal carotid artery (eICA), first segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA1), and sigmoid sinus in the anterior–posterior view; cavernous portion of the ICA (cICA), parietal vein, and jugular vein in the lateral views. The time-to-peak (TTP) for all ROIs and cerebral circulation time (CCT) were measured from FA and DSA scans. TTP, CCT, and radiation doses from DSA were compared with those from FA. Results: The mean age of the patients were 69 ± 9.5 years old. The average stenosis was 89.7% ± 7.8% before stenting and 31% ± 3.6% after stenting. No patient suffered from periprocedural stroke. The intermethod correlation for TTP for all ROIs except the eICA and cICA ranged from 0.46 to 0.65 before stenting and 0.57 to 0.73 after stenting, and that for CCT was 0.65 before stenting and 0.57 after stenting. The radiation doses were significantly lower for FA than for DSA regardless of views or periprocedural timing (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Stenosis facilitated the creation of a bolus by manual injection and therefore increased the accuracy of cerebral flow quantification in FA. Cerebral hemodynamic assessment by FA is quicker and associated with less radiation.

"Ethacridine induces apoptosis and differentiation in thyroid cancer cells in vitro",2019,"Background/Aim: Ethacridine is used as a topical antiseptic as well as for second-trimester abortion. Recent studies showed that ethacridine is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) and an activator of the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). This study examined the effects of ethacridine on thyroid cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Thyroid cancer cell lines (FTC133 and SW1736) and thyroid follicular epithelial cells (Nthy-ori 3-1) were treated with ethacridine. Viability, clonogenicity, cell-cycle distribution, and apoptosis were evaluated. The expression of thyroid differentiation markers (TTF-1, PAX8, and NIS) was determined by real-time PCR. Results: Ethacridine suppressed cell growth and clonogenic ability of thyroid cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (p<0.001). No cell-cycle arrest was found, but ethacridine dose-dependently induced apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells (p<0.001). The PAX8 and NIS expressions were significantly increased in SW1736 (3.41-fold and 1.53-fold, respectively) and Nthy-ori 3-1 cells (2.73-fold and 4.12-fold, respectively). Conclusion: Ethacridine elicits apoptotic cell death in thyroid cancer cells and promotes differentiation in a subset of thyroid follicular cells. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Higher risk of dementia in primary Sjogren's syndrome",2019,"Objective: We studied the risk of dementia in patients with primary Sj?gren's syndrome (pSS) using a nationwide, population-based cohort in Taiwan. Methods: Our study analyzed the medical data of the Taiwanese population from 2000 to 2014. We identified 17,072 patients with pSS and 68,270 controls. Dementia risk was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model stratified by sex, age, and comorbidities. Results: A higher incidence of dementia development in the pSS group during the observation period (P?=?0.0001). In multivariate analysis adjusted by age groups, gender, and the comorbidities, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of developing dementia was 1.246 (95% CI 1.123–1.384) times greater in the pSS group than in the non-pSS group. When stratified by sex, age, and comorbidities, the patients with pSS less than 60?years (aHR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16–2.41), and without any comorbidity (aHR 2.27, 95% CI 1.76–2.93) were particularly associated with a higher risk of dementia. Furthermore, the patients with pSS combined with any other comorbidity had an additionally higher risk of dementia (aHR: 3.978, 95% CI 3.309–4.782), also suggesting that pSS was an independent risk factor for the development of dementia. Interpretation: Primary Sjogren's syndrome is associated with increased dementia risk and further study is needed to understand why and what the specific dementia phenotypes are. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Hypertension and chronic kidney disease: Updated principles of treatment",2019,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major noncommunicable disease, which leads to higher risks of end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular morbidity, and death. CKD related hypertension is mainly due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, therefore the first line antihypertesives are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Calcium channel blockers or diuretics can be added if the blood pressure has not achieved the optimal target in the patient. In nondiabetic CKD patients without proteinuria, the blood pressure target is 140/90 mmHg or lower; while CKD patients with proteinuria should keep their blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg. Renal artery stenosis can lead to secondary hypertension, and the first line therapy is the antihypertensive treatment with ACEI or ARB; percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty or surgery can be considered if resistant hypertension under medical treatment. Hypertension and CKD are closely interrelated, and optimal blood pressure control is able to decrease the rissk of decline in renal function and cardiovascular mortality. ? 2019 Society of Internal Medicine of Taiwan.

"Ensemble Feature Learning to Identify Risk Factors for Predicting Secondary Cancer",2019,"Background: In recent years, the development and diagnosis of secondary cancer have become the primary concern of cancer survivors. A number of studies have been developing strategies to extract knowledge from the clinical data, aiming to identify important risk factors that can be used to prevent the recurrence of diseases. However, these studies do not focus on secondary cancer. Secondary cancer is lack of the strategies for clinical treatment as well as risk factor identification to prevent the occurrence. Methods: We propose an effective ensemble feature learning method to identify the risk factors for predicting secondary cancer by considering class imbalance and patient heterogeneity. We first divide the patients into some heterogeneous groups based on spectral clustering. In each group, we apply the oversampling method to balance the number of samples in each class and use them as training data for ensemble feature learning. The purpose of ensemble feature learning is to identify the risk factors and construct a diagnosis model for each group. The importance of risk factors is measured based on the properties of patients in each group separately. We predict secondary cancer by assigning the patient to a corresponding group and based on the diagnosis model in this corresponding group. Results: Analysis of the results shows that the decision tree obtains the best results for predicting secondary cancer in the three classifiers. The best results of the decision tree are 0.72 in terms of AUC when dividing the patients into 15 groups, 0.38 in terms of F1 score when dividing the patients into 20 groups. In terms of AUC, decision tree achieves 67.4% improvement compared to using all 20 predictor variables and 28.6% improvement compared to no group division. In terms of F1 score, decision tree achieves 216.7% improvement compared to using all 20 predictor variables and 80.9% improvement compared to no group division. Different groups provide different ranking results for the predictor variables. Conclusion: The accuracies of predicting secondary cancer using k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine indeed increased after using the selected important risk factors as predictors. Group division on patients to predict secondary cancer on the separated models can further improve the prediction accuracies. The information discovered in the experiments can provide important references to the personality and clinical symptom representations on all phases of guide interventions, with the complexities of multiple symptoms associated with secondary cancer in all phases of the recurrent trajectory. ? 2019 Ivyspring International Publisher.

"Dual Delivery of HNF4α and Cisplatin by Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles Inhibits Cancer Pluripotency and Tumorigenicity in Hepatoma-Derived CD133-Expressing Stem Cells",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly malignancies characterized by high rate of recurrence. Tumor recurrence is often attributed to the presence of a subpopulation of cells with stem cell properties, referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Traditionally, cancer therapies target the entire bulk of tumor cells; however, they are poorly effective against CSCs, characterized by higher drug resistance. Therefore, approaches targeting CSCs may be required in addition to conventional chemotherapy to prevent tumor recurrence. In this study, we investigated an approach to target HCC by combining the conventional chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin, to target the bulk of tumor cells, and differentiation therapy by delivering the gene encoding HNF4α, an important regulator of hepatocyte differentiation, to target CSCs. We used the Huh7 cell line as an in vitro model of HCC, which is characterized by a high proportion of CD133-expressing CSCs. By using flow cytometry, we separated CD133+ and CD133- Huh7 cell subpopulations and have shown that the former has highly pronounced in vivo tumorigenic capacity in contrast to the latter, which could not generate tumors in vivo. For the dual delivery of HNF4α-encoding plasmid and cisplatin, we used polyethyleneimine-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PMSNs) as the nanocarriers. Here, we show that the treatment of CD133-expressing Huh7 cells with HNF4α-loaded PMSNs can suppress their proliferation rate, decrease the proportion of CSCs, downregulate stemness-associated genes, and increase the expression of mature hepatocyte-associated genes. At the same time, the treatment of Huh7 with PMSNs loaded with both HNF4α-encoding plasmid and cisplatin could block them in the S-phase of the cell cycle and cause apoptosis. In addition, dually loaded PMSNs were the most efficient formulation in suppressing tumor growth in vivo. To summarize, in this study, we tested the nanoparticle-based delivery system as both chemotherapy and gene-based therapy agents, which has great potential for development of effective treatment of HCC. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell culture; Cell death; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; DNA; Encoding (symbols); Gene encoding; Gene expression; Gene therapy; Gene transfer; Mesoporous materials; Nanoparticles; Signal encoding; Silica; Silica nanoparticles; Stem cells; Tumors; CD133; Gene Delivery; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Huh7; Mesoporous silica nanoparticles; Targeted drug delivery; CD133 antigen; cisplatin; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; HNF4A protein, human; nanoparticle; silicon dioxide; animal; cell cycle; chemistry; drug effect; flow cytometry; genetics; human; liver cell carcinoma; metabolism; mouse; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SCID mouse; stem cell; tumor cell line; TUNEL assay; Western blotting; AC133 Antigen; Animals; Blotting, Western; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; Flow Cytometry; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4; Humans; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Mice; Mice, SCID; Nanoparticles; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Silicon Dioxide; Stem Cells"

"Identification of lysosomal and extralysosomal globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulations before the occurrence of typical pathological changes in the endomyocardial biopsies of Fabry disease patients",2019,"Purpose: Evaluation standards and treatment initiation timing have been debated for a long time, particularly for late-onset Fabry disease (FD), because of its slow progression. However, early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD could be effective in stabilizing the disease progression and potentially preventing irreversible organ damage. We aimed to examine globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) deposits in patients’ endomyocardial biopsies to understand the early pathogenesis of FD cardiomyopathy. Methods: Immunofluorescent (IF) staining of Gb3 and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) was performed on endomyocardial biopsies of patients suspected of Fabry cardiomyopathy who had negative or only slight Gb3 accumulation determined by toluidine blue staining and electron microscopic examination. Results: The IF staining results revealed that all patients examined had abundant Gb3 accumulation in their cardiomyocytes, including the ones who are negative for inclusion bodies. Furthermore, we found that early Gb3 deposits were mostly confined within lysosomes, while they appeared extralysosomally at a later stage. Conclusion: A significant amount of lysosomal Gb3 deposits could be detected by IF staining in cardiac tissue before the formation of inclusion bodies, suggesting the cardiomyocytes might have been experiencing cellular stress and damage early on, before the appearance of typical pathological changes of FD during the disease progression. ? 2018, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.","alpha galactosidase; globotriaosylceramide; lysosome associated membrane protein 1; tolonium chloride; ceramide trihexoside; globoside; globotrihexosylceramide; LAMP1 protein, human; lysosome associated membrane protein; adult; Article; brain atrophy; brain disease; brain infarction; cardiac muscle cell; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cell damage; cell inclusion; cell stress; cerebrovascular accident; chest tightness; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; disease duration; disease severity; dolichoectasia; echocardiography; electrocardiography; electron microscopy; enzyme activity; Fabry disease; family history; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart muscle biopsy; heart palpitation; heart right bundle branch block; human; human cell; human tissue; immunofluorescence test; lacunar stroke; lipid blood level; lipid storage; lysosome; male; middle aged; protein blood level; protein localization; thorax pain; biopsy; cardiac muscle; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; enzyme replacement; Fabry disease; fluorescent antibody technique; genetics; metabolism; pathology; Adult; Biopsy; Disease Progression; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Fabry Disease; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Globosides; Humans; Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins; Lysosomes; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Trihexosylceramides"
"Association between blood pressure and postoperative hematomas in the patients undergoing head and neck cancer reconstruction",2019,"Background: Postoperative hematoma is one of the most common complications of free flap reconstruction and compromises the perfusion of pedicles and perforators. Therefore, we reviewed our patients to analyze the associated risk factors. Method: This study involved a retrospective chart review from 2014 to 2016. We identified the patients undergoing free flap reconstructions for head and neck cancer. Patients with postoperative hematoma requiring surgical intervention were included. Result: We enlisted 289 patients undergoing head and neck reconstructions. Eighteen patients (6.2%) had postoperative hematomas of which 12 hematomas occurred within the first 3 days and 9 in the first 24 hours. Elevated systolic blood pressure increased the risk of hematoma formation, but hematoma was not associated with higher failure rate. Tachycardia was observed in the patients with hematoma. Conclusions: Transient elevated blood pressure increased the risk of hematoma. We suggest controlling systolic blood pressure below 150 mm Hg for prevention of hematoma. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; anterolateral thigh flap; Article; blood pressure; blood pressure regulation; cancer patient; elevated blood pressure; female; fibula graft; free tissue graft; graft failure; head and neck cancer; head and neck surgery; heart rate; hematoma; human; ischemia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; osteocutaneous flap; postoperative complication; predictive value; priority journal; radial forearm flap; retrospective study; risk factor; smoking; surgical risk; systolic blood pressure; tachycardia; treatment failure"
"Professional Driver's Job Stress and 8-year Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: The Taiwan Bus Driver Cohort Study",2019,"BACKGROUND: Two main job stress models-the Demand-Control-Support (DC) model and the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) model have been used to assess the impact of psychosocial work-related factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Limited evidence elaborates the independent and combined effects on CVD events, especially for professional drivers. This study assesses the independent and combined effects of DC and ERI models on an 8-year risk of CVD among professional drivers. METHODS: The Taiwan Bus Driver Cohort Study recruited 1650 professional drivers from a large bus company in 2005. The subjects were interviewed in person and completed the two job stress questionnaires. Researchers found 94 new cases of CVD (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM]: 390-459) from 2006 to 2012. A Cox proportional hazards model was performed to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for CVD events. RESULTS: Occupational drivers with high overcommitment scores (thresholds of 15) had an elevated risk for CVD (HR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.04, 2.82). Regarding target disease, overcommitment had an increased risk for CVD (not including hypertensive disease) (HR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.54) and ischemic heart disease (HR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.05-1.65). CONCLUSION: Overcommitment, which is associated with job stress, appears to be associated with CVD risk in professional drivers.",""
"The interaction effects of burnout and job support on peptic ulcer disease (PUD) among firefighters and policemen",2019,"Policemen and firefighters encounter numerous emergency events that frequently lead to high burnout and low job support, resulting in adverse health effects. A number of studies reported the correlation between job characteristics and the risk of peptic ulcer diseases (PUD) across various industries. However, there is very little research on evaluating the interaction effects of burnout and job support on the prevalence of PUD among firefighters and policemen. The objective of this study was to assess the interactional effects between burnout and job support on the prevalence of PUD among firefighters and policemen. This was a cross-sectional quantitative study. Registered, full-time police officers and firefighters in Taiwan were anonymously interviewed by a mail-delivered questionnaire. All female workers were excluded due to different job characteristics and a limited sample size. A total of 9328 firefighters and 42,798 policemen completed the questionnaire, with a response rate of 78.7%. Overall, prevalence rates of self-reported and self-reports of physician-diagnosed PUD were 8.3% and 6.5% for policemen and 7.1% and 5.5% for firefighters, respectively. There was a 22% reduced odds ratio of PUD as diagnosed by physicians for the group with low burnout and high job support, but an increased odds ratio of 53% for the group with high burnout and low job support, after adjusting for lifestyle and demographic variables. There must be an increase of job support and reduction of burnout through the modification of work structure and setting up of counseling services to reduce workplace stress and the prevalence of PUD among policemen and firefighters. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Infertility-related knowledge in childbearing-age women with breast cancer after chemotherapy",2019,"Aim: The purposes of this study were to describe the degree of knowledge and explore the factors associated with knowledge of infertility among women of childbearing age with breast cancer. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited women of childbearing age with a diagnosis of breast cancer who had completed chemotherapy at a hospital in Taipei from 2015 through 2016. Face-to-face interviews were completed with 201 (62%) of 324 eligible women, asking about sociodemographic variables, disease and treatment characteristics, fertility intention, and infertility-related knowledge. Results: The result showed one in 10 women had thought about becoming pregnant after completion of breast cancer chemotherapy. The mean score of infertility knowledge among participants was low, especially for general knowledge. Women with higher levels of education had better knowledge scores. Fertility intention score, especially for the domain of the pregnant risk, was negatively associated with infertility knowledge score. Conclusion: Women with breast cancer lacked knowledge about infertility and underestimated the possibility of infertility. We suggest future patient education on infertility after cancer treatment and about reproductive technology in oncologic practice before treatment begins. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",""
"Establishment of vestibular function multimodality platform",2019,"Background: The technology of using inertial measurement units (IMUs) to detect motions in different body segments has drawn enormous attention to research and industry. In our previous research, we have applied IMUs in evaluating and treating patients with vestibular hypofunction. Furthermore, according to the research, when a person’s head rotates over 60?on either side in the horizontal plane, and desires to focus vision on any targets, then the function of gaze shift comes in to operation. Herein, we aimed to use IMUs to build up a system to evaluate vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) during gaze shifting maneuver. Methods: In this study, we developed a platform, which combines the features of gaze shift and computerized dynamic visual acuity (cDVA), called the gaze shift DVA (gsDVA) platform. The gsDVA platform measures the orientations of the subject’s head by IMU, and executed the evaluation according to the algorithm that was developed by us. Finally, we used the VICON system to validate the performance of gsDVA platform. Results: The performance of the accuracy was 2.41?± 1.08?, the maximal sensor error was within 4.25?, and highly correlated between our platform and VICON (p < 0.05, R = 0.99). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of between-day and within-day was 0.984 and 0.999, respectively. Furthermore, the platform not only executed the evaluation automatically but also recorded other information besides the head orientation, such as rotation speed, rotation time, reaction time, and visual acuity. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated the utility of vestibular evaluation, and this platform can help to clarify the relationship between gaze shift and VOR. This methodology is useful and can be applied efficiently to different disease groups for interactive evaluation and rehabilitation programs. Copyright ? 2019, the Chinese Medical Association.

"Endoscopic-assisted surgery in the management of breast cancer: 20 years review of trend, techniques and outcomes",2019,"To review current literature on the outcomes, techniques and trend of endoscopic-assisted breast surgery (EABS) in the management of breast cancer over a 20 years period Materials and Methods: Literature search was performed using PubMed/Medline database from 1st January 1998 to 31st December 2018 using the terms “endoscopy”, “endoscopy-assisted”, “breast cancer”, “mastectomy” and “breast conserving surgery”. Additional studies were also identified by reviewing references of relevant articles. Only case series and cohort studies were included in this review. Oncological and surgical outcome measures as well as detailed technical aspects were discussed. Results: EABS was comparable in terms of oncological, surgical as well as aesthetic outcomes if compared to conventional techniques. Patient selection and important adjuncts are essential to ensure successful and safe conduct of EABS. Conclusions: Standardization of techniques, practice guidelines and objective outcome assessments methods might pave the way for better conduct of EABS and place EABS as one of the standards of care for breast cancer care. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","breast cancer; breast reconstruction; breast surgery; burn; cancer recurrence; dissection; distant metastasis; endoscopic assisted breast conserving surgery; endoscopic assisted nipple sparing mastectomy; endoscopic surgery; five item assessment; five item by 4 step method; four point scoring system; graft necrosis; human; Japanese Breast Cancer Society; operation duration; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; overall survival; patient satisfaction; patient self assessment satisfactory index; priority journal; retraction assisted method; Review; skin flap; skin incision; subjective assessment; surgical drainage; surgical infection; surgical margin; surgical technique; systematic review; treatment indication; wound infection"
"Eculizumab in aquaporin-4-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder",2019,"BACKGROUND Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a relapsing, autoimmune, inflammatory disorder that typically affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. At least two thirds of cases are associated with aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG) and complement-mediated damage to the central nervous system. In a previous small, open-label study involving patients with AQP4-IgG-positive disease, eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor, was shown to reduce the frequency of relapse. METHODS In this randomized, double-blind, time-to-event trial, 143 adults were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either intravenous eculizumab (at a dose of 900 mg weekly for the first four doses starting on day 1, followed by 1200 mg every 2 weeks starting at week 4) or matched placebo. The continued use of stable-dose immunosuppressive therapy was permitted. The primary end point was the first adjudicated relapse. Secondary outcomes included the adjudicated annualized relapse rate, quality-of-life measures, and the score on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which ranges from 0 (no disability) to 10 (death). RESULTS The trial was stopped after 23 of the 24 prespecified adjudicated relapses, given the uncertainty in estimating when the final event would occur. The mean (±SD) annualized relapse rate in the 24 months before enrollment was 1.99±0.94; 76% of the patients continued to receive their previous immunosuppressive therapy during the trial. Adjudicated relapses occurred in 3 of 96 patients (3%) in the eculizumab group and 20 of 47 (43%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02 to 0.20; P<0.001). The adjudicated annualized relapse rate was 0.02 in the eculizumab group and 0.35 in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.15; P<0.001). The mean change in the EDSS score was-0.18 in the eculizumab group and 0.12 in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference,-0.29; 95% CI,-0.59 to 0.01). Upper respiratory tract infections and headaches were more common in the eculizumab group. There was one death from pulmonary empyema in the eculizumab group.

"mTOR inhibitors in advanced biliary tract cancers",2019,"Patients with advanced biliary tract cancers (BTCs), including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), have poor prognosis so novel treatment is warranted for advanced BTC. In current review, we discuss the limitations of current treatment in BTC, the importance of mTOR signalling in BTC, and the possible role of mTOR inhibitors as a future treatment in BTC. Chemotherapy with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is still the standard of care and no targeted therapy has been established in advanced BTC. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway linking to several other pathways and networks regulates cancer proliferation and progression. Emerging evidences reveal mTOR activation is associated with tumorigenesis and drug-resistance in BTC. Rapalogs, such as sirolimus and everolimus, partially inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and exhibit anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo in BTC. Rapalogs in clinical trials demonstrate some activity in patients with advanced BTC. New-generation mTOR inhibitors against ATP-binding pocket inhibit both TORC1 and TORC2 and demonstrate more potent anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo, however, prospective clinical trials are warranted to prove its efficacy in patients with advanced BTC. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Resilience among older cardiovascular disease patients with probable sarcopenia",2020,"Aim and objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors associated with resilience among probable sarcopenia older adults with cardiovascular disease. Introduction: Resilience has been reported to be positively correlated with the mental health and physical functioning of older adults. Previous research has found that the development of resilience constitutes a form of compensation for loss of physical health. It is important for older adults, especially those with other underlying conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and sarcopenia, to have the ability to overcome adversity during the aging process. Thus, resilience becomes a critical characteristic in achieving a better life. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. A demographic questionnaire and the Chinese version of the Resilience Scale (CRS) were used to collect data. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictors of low resilience. Results: A total of 267 participants were recruited, including 126 females and 141 males. Of the participants, 56% of their scores indicated low resilience. Income, education level, exercise time, primary caregiver, and having hypertension were the predictors of resilience. Conclusion: The population with sarcopenia is increasing worldwide. Understanding resilience levels among older adults with probable sarcopenia is essential for promoting their mental health. Clinicians can use the results of this study to identify populations at high risk for low resilience and design specific interventions to promote better health outcomes. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","aged; Article; body mass; body weight; cardiovascular disease; caregiver; controlled study; cross-sectional study; educational status; exercise time; female; high risk patient; human; hypertension; income; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; patient attitude; predictor variable; priority journal; psychological resilience; sarcopenia; sex difference; time; very elderly"
"Glutamatergic dysfunction and glutamatergic compounds for major psychiatric disorders: Evidence from clinical neuroimaging studies",2019,"Excessive glutamate release has been linked to stress and many neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence indicates abnormalities of glutamatergic neurotransmission or glutamatergic dysfunction as playing an important role in the development of many major psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder). Recently, ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist, has been demonstrated to have promisingly rapid antidepressant efficacy for treatment-resistant depression. Many compounds that target the glutamate system have also become available that possess potential in the treatment of major psychiatric disorders. In this review, we update evidence from recent human studies that directly or indirectly measured glutamatergic neurotransmission and function in major psychiatric disorders using modalities such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography/single-photon emission computed tomography, and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. The newer generation of antidepressants that target the glutamatergic system developed in human clinical studies is also reviewed. Copyright ? 2019 Li, Yang and Lin.

"Effects of Tai Chi Exercise on Reducing Falls and Improving Balance Performance in Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis",2019,"Introduction. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that may increase the risk of falls, functional limitation, and balance deficits. Tai Chi was used as an option for improving balance in people with PD. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of Tai Chi on falls, balance, and functional mobility in individuals with PD. Method. The literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PEDro, Medline, Embase, sportDISCUS, Trip, and the National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) analyzing the effects of Tai Chi, compared to no intervention or to other physical training, on falls, functional mobility, and balance in PD patients were selected. The outcome measurements included fall rates, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Functional Reach (FR) test, and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality and extracted data from the studies using the PEDro scale. Results. Five RCTs that included a total of 355 PD patients were included in this review. The quality of evidence in these studies was rated as moderate to high. Compared to no intervention or other physical training, Tai Chi significantly decreased fall rates (odds ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.74, and p=0.001) and significantly improved balance and functional mobility (BBS mean difference (MD) = 3.47, 95% CI 2.11 to 4.80, and p<0.001; FR MD = 3.55 cm, 95% CI 1.88 to 5.23, and p<0.001; TUG MD = -1.06 s, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.51, and p<0.001) in people with PD. Conclusion. This meta-analysis provides moderate- to high-quality evidence from five RCTs that Tai Chi could be a good physical training strategy for preventing falls and improving balance and functional mobility in people with PD. ? 2019 Hsin-Hsuan Liu et al.","Berg Balance Scale; body equilibrium; comparative study; evaluation study; evidence based medicine; exercise; falling; functional assessment; human; meta analysis; outcome assessment; Parkinson disease; prevention study; Review; systematic review; Tai Chi; therapy effect"
"Impacts of the New 2017 ACC/AHA Hypertension Guideline on the Prevalence of Brachial Hypertension and Its Concordance with Central Hypertension",2019,"OBJECTIVES The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline lowers the blood pressure (BP) thresholds for defining brachial hypertension. We therefore aimed to investigate how the new guideline influences the prevalence of brachial hypertension and whether it improves the identification of central hypertension in an Asian national representative population. METHODS A total of 2,742 adults older than 19 years participated in the 2013-2016 National Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan. Central and brachial BPs were simultaneously measured twice and averaged using a cuff-based stand-alone central BP monitor purporting to measure invasive central BP (type II device). Brachial hypertension was defined by brachial systolic/diastolic BP ? 130 or 80 mm Hg or using antihypertensive medication, and central hypertension was defined by central systolic/diastolic BP ? 130 or 90 mm Hg or using antihypertensive medication. RESULTS The national weighted prevalence rates of brachial hypertension according to the 2017 AHA/ACC guideline were 48.7% in men and 30.7% in women. The prevalence of brachial hypertension increased by 18.8% in men and 9.4% in women, when compared with the prevalence defined by the conventional thresholds of brachial systolic/diastolic BP ? 140 or 90 mm Hg. In comparison with the conventional criteria, the new hypertension criteria had a higher sensitivity (93.0% vs. 77.4%) and a lower specificity (86.7% vs. 99.6%) for detecting central hypertension. CONCLUSIONS Adoption of the 2017 AHA/ACC BP thresholds substantially increases the prevalence of brachial hypertension, especially in men, and identifies over 90% of those with central hypertension at the expense of lesser specificity. ? 2019 The Author(s).","antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; Article; body mass; brachial hypertension; cardiovascular risk; central hypertension; cholesterol blood level; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; dyslipidemia; fasting; female; glucose blood level; glucose level; groups by age; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; human cell; hypertension; international physical activity questionnaire; ischemic heart disease; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; major clinical study; male; middle aged; physical inactivity; practice guideline; prevalence; priority journal; sex; smoking; systolic blood pressure; systolic hypertension; Taiwan; triacylglycerol blood level; urine sampling; waist circumference"
"The relationship between androgen deprivation therapy and depression symptoms in patients with prostate cancer",2019,"Aim: In this study, we administered a questionnaire to consecutive prostate cancer patients who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for understanding the prevalence of depression symptoms. Materials and methods: We retrospectively identified patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who received ADT between January 2015 and February 2018 at Mackay Memorial Hospital. The patients were then asked to complete the Chinese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during an interview. The patients were divided into two groups according to PHQ-9 score: those with depression symptoms (PHQ-9 ? 6, depression group), and those without depression symptoms (PHQ-9 < 6, non-depression group). Two groups were compared using t-tests and correlation coefficients, as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p <.05. Results: There were no significant correlations between PHQ-9 scores and any of the parameters in the patients overall. In subgroup analysis, a positive correlation was found between the duration of ADT and PHQ-9 score in the patients with depression symptoms (p =.03). In addition, univariate analysis showed a positive association between the duration of ADT and PHQ-9 score, and a longer duration of ADT was further independently associated with increased PHQ-9 score in multivariate analysis in the patients with depression symptoms. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that in patients with prostate cancer and depression symptoms, the severity of the depression symptoms was positively correlated with the duration of ADT. In contrast, this association was not found in patients without depression symptoms. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Concurrent osteosarcoma theranostic strategy using contrast-enhanced ultrasound and drug-loaded bubbles",2019,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone tumor in children and teenagers. The multidrug resistant property of OS produces a major obstacle to chemotherapy, since the effective drug dose cannot be achieved via conventional drug delivery routes without serious systemic cytotoxicity. Microbubbles in conjunction with ultrasound (US) has recently been shown to spatially and temporally permeabilize the cellular membrane, promoting drug penetration into tumors. Here, we investigated whether drug (doxorubicin, DOX)-loaded bubbles (DOX-bubbles) can serve as drug-loaded carriers in combination with US in order to facilitate tumor drug delivery. The proposed bubbles have a high payload capacity (efficiency of 69.4 ± 9.1%, payload of 1.4 mg/mL) for DOX. In vitro data revealed that when used in combination with US (1-MHz), these DOX-bubbles facilitate DOX entering into tumor cells. In tumor-bearing animals, DOX-bubbles + US could provide 3.7-fold suppression of tumor growth compared with the group without insonation (1.8 ± 0.9 cm3 vs. 8.5 ± 2.2 cm3) because of the acceleration of DOX-induced tumor necrosis. In the meantime, the tumor perfusion and volume can be monitored by DOX-bubbles with contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. Our data provide useful information in support of translating the use of theranostic US-responsive bubbles for regulated tumor drug delivery into clinical use. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Mesenchymal stem cells prolong survival and prevent lethal complications in a porcine model of fulminant liver failure",2019,"Background: Fulminant liver failure (FLF) is a life-threatening disease. Methods: Lethal FLF was induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury in mini-pigs, and MSCs were infused via splenic vein after reperfusion. Results: Accumulated survival within 28?days was significantly improved by MSCs (P?=?0.0348). Notably, MSCs maintained blood-gas homeostasis in the first 24?hours and prevented FLF-induced elevation of prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and creatinine and ammonia levels in the first 3?days. With MSCs, serum levels of liver enzymes gradually decreased after 3?days, and platelet count was back to normal at 1?week of FLF. MSCs promoted liver regeneration within 2?weeks and differentiated into functional hepatocytes at 2-4?weeks after transplantation, evidenced by increase in Ki67-positive cells, detectable human hepatocyte growth factor, human vascular endothelial growth factor, human hepatocyte-specific antigen, and human albumin-expressing cells in the liver at different time points. Reactive oxidative species (ROS) were accumulated after FLF and eliminated at 4?weeks after MSC transplantation. Conclusions: Together, MSCs prolong the survival and prevent lethal sequelae of I-R injury-induced FLF by maintenance of liver-function homeostasis and rescue of ROS in the acute stage and by homing and differentiation into hepatocytes in the subacute stage. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Factors associated with isoniazid resistant tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus positive patients in Swaziland: A case-control study",2019,"Background: Isoniazid resistant tuberculosis is the most prevalent type of resistance in Swaziland and over two-thirds of the isoniazid resistant tuberculosis patients are tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus co-infected. The study aimed to determine risk factors associated with isoniazid resistant tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus positive patients in Swaziland. Methods: This was a case-control study conducted in nine healthcare facilities across Swaziland. Cases were patients with isoniazid resistant tuberculosis (including 78 patients with isoniazid mono-resistant tuberculosis, 42 with polydrug-resistant tuberculosis, and 77 with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis). Controls were presumed drug-susceptible tuberculosis patients (n = 203). Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine related factors. Results: The median time lag from diagnosis to tuberculosis treatment initiation was 50 days for isoniazid mono or poly drug-resistant tuberculosis, 17 days for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis compared to 1 day for drug-susceptible tuberculosis patients. History of previous tuberculosis treatment was positively associated with either isoniazid mono or poly drug-resistant tuberculosis (OR = 7.91, 95% CI: 4.14-15.11) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (OR = 12.20, 95% CI: 6.07-24.54). Isoniazid mono or poly resistant tuberculosis patients were more likely to be from rural areas (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.23-3.32) and current heavy alcohol drinkers compared to the drug-susceptible tuberculosis group. Multi drug-resistant tuberculosis patients were more likely to be non-adherent to tuberculosis treatment compared to drug-susceptible tuberculosis group (OR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.56-5.82). Conclusion: To prevent and control isoniazid resistant tuberculosis among HIV-positive patients in Swaziland, the tuberculosis program should strengthen the use of rapid diagnostic tests, detect resistance early, promptly initiate supervised tuberculosis treatment and decentralize quality tuberculosis services to the rural areas. Adherence to tuberculosis treatment should be improved. ? 2019 The Author(s).","isoniazid; isoniazid; rifampicin; tuberculostatic agent; adult; antibiotic resistance; Article; binge drinking; case control study; clinical feature; controlled study; demography; disease association; disease classification; drug resistant tuberculosis; female; health care facility; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; risk factor; rural area; Swaziland; time to treatment; treatment refusal; AIDS related complex; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; middle aged; risk factor; socioeconomics; tuberculosis; Adult; AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections; Antitubercular Agents; Case-Control Studies; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Isoniazid; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Rifampin; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Swaziland; Tuberculosis; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant"

"The association between heat stroke and subsequent cardiovascular diseases",2019,"Background: Recent studies have indicated that several critical illnesses are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Nonetheless, studies of the association between heat-related illnesses (HRIs) and subsequent CVDs are still limited. We sought to evaluate whether heat stroke (HS) was associated with an increased CVD incidence. Methods: The data from the nationwide, population-based, retrospective, cohort study described herein were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The outcome evaluated in this study was the cumulative incidence of CVDs, which was compared between patients with HS, patients with other HRIs and a control group during a 14-year follow-up period. Results: Our analyses included 150 HS cases, 150 patients with other HRIs and 150 patients without HRIs. The HS patients had a significantly higher incidence of developing CVDs than the other HRI and control patients (32.67% vs. 23.33% vs. 16.67%, p = 0.005). Patients with HS had an increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared with that of the controls (6% vs. 2.67%, p = 0.042) and an increased incidence of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) compared with those of the other HRI and control patients (12% vs. 6% vs. 4.67%, p = 0.038). An increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was also found in the patients with HS and other HRIs compared to that in the controls (17.33% vs. 14.67% vs. 6.67%, p = 0.016). Conclusion: Prior HS was associated with an increased incidence of CVDs, particularly AMI and AIS, and an increased incidence of CKD. ? 2019 Wang et al.

"Pulmonary tuberculous cavities in diabetic patients: Glycemic control is still the dominant factor despite the emerging role of metformin",2019,"Background: Previous studies have reported an increased risk of cavities in diabetic patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), which may be associated with poor glycemic control. Cavities have a negative impact on PTB treatment outcomes; however, the possible interaction of other potentially confounding diabetes-related variables regarding pulmonary cavities have not been fully evaluated. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of diabetic patients with culture-proven PTB. The patients’ chest X-rays (CXRs) and computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed to assess the effects of clinical factors, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and antidiabetic agents on cavitary lesions. Results: Among 128 diabetic PTB patients, those with pulmonary cavities on CXRs and CT scans presented younger ages, lack of metformin treatment, and significantly higher HbA1c levels than those without cavities. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed significantly higher HbA1c levels in patients with cavities than in those without cavities on CXRs (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.61) and CT scans (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.64). Patients with multiple cavities had significantly higher HbA1c levels than those with a single cavity on CT scans (p = 0.002). No significant differences in other variables, including metformin treatment, were noted between the groups. Conclusion: This study suggests that despite multiple potential confounding variables, including metformin use, poor glycemic control is still the dominant risk factor for cavitary lesions in diabetic patients with PTB. Efforts to improve glycemic control in diabetic PTB patients may be of considerable value in facilitating antimycobacterial treatment.

"Effects of epidural analgesia on cancer recurrence and long-term mortality in patients after non-small-cell lung cancer resection: A propensity score-matched study",2019,"Objectives: Previous studies showed reductions in recurrence and mortality rate of several cancer types in patients receiving perioperative epidural analgesia. This study aimed to investigate the effects of thoracic epidural analgesia on oncological outcomes after resection for lung cancer. Design: Retrospective study using propensity score matching methodology. Setting: Single medical centre in Taiwan. Participants: Patients with stages I-III non-small-cell lung cancer undergoing primary tumour resection between January 2005 and December 2015 and had either epidural analgesia, placed preoperatively and used intra- and postoperatively, or intravenous analgesia were evaluated through May 2017. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary endpoint was postoperative recurrence-free survival and secondary endpoint was overall survival. Results: The 3-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates were 69.8% (95% CI 67.4% to 72.2%) and 92.4% (95% CI 91% to 93.8%) in the epidural group and 67.4% (95% CI 62.3% to 72.5%) and 89.6% (95% CI 86.3% to 92.9%) in the non-epidural group, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression analysis before matching demonstrated no significant difference in recurrence or mortality between groups (adjusted HR: 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.14 for recurrence; 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.13 for mortality), similar to the results after matching (HR: 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.31; 0.94, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.54). Independent risk factors for both recurrence and mortality were male, higher pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, advanced cancer stage, poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, microscopic necrosis and postoperative radiotherapy. Conclusions: Thoracic epidural analgesia was not associated with better recurrence-free or overall survival in patients receiving surgical resection for stages I-III non-small-cell lung cancer. ? 2019 Author(s).","antineoplastic agent; bupivacaine; carcinoembryonic antigen; fentanyl; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; paracetamol; adult; anesthesia induction; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; controlled study; epidural analgesia; female; follow up; human; lymph vessel metastasis; lymphocytic infiltration; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; patient controlled analgesia; propensity score; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; Taiwan; treatment outcome; tumor differentiation; tumor necrosis"
"Effect of a community-based participatory health literacy program on health behaviors and health empowerment among community-dwelling older adults: A quasi-experimental study",2019,"This study evaluated the effect of a community-based participatory health literacy program aimed at improving the health behaviors and health empowerment for older adults. A two-group pretest and posttest quasi-experimental design with surveys conducted at baseline (T1), immediately after the intervention (T2), and 6 months after the intervention (T3). The intervention group (n = 94) attended a 12-week health literacy program; while the comparison group (n = 78) did not. The results demonstrated that intervention group had significantly better health behavior practices for weight control (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.59–8.64), regular exercise (OR = 15.26, 95% CI = 1.92–121.13), and health information navigation (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.16–5.84). Health empowerment was significantly higher in the intervention group than the comparison group (p &lt; 0.01).This study suggests that integrating community-based participatory design is effective in improving some health behaviors and health empowerment in older adults over a short period. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","aged; article; body weight control; community dwelling person; controlled study; empowerment; exercise; experimental design; female; health behavior; health literacy; human; major clinical study; male; medical information; pretest posttest design; quasi experimental study"
"Enhanced Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter 1 underlies motor dysfunction in huntington's disease",2019,"Background: Altered γ-aminobutyric acid signaling is believed to disrupt the excitation/inhibition balance in the striatum, which may account for the motor symptoms of Huntington's disease. Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 is a key molecule that controls γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic signaling. However, the role of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 and efficacy of γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic transmission remain unknown in Huntington's disease. Methods: We determined the levels of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 in brain tissue from Huntington's disease mice and patients by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunocytochemistry. Gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings were used to measure the Eγ-aminobutyric acid in striatal brain slices. To inhibit Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 activity, R6/2 mice were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of bumetanide or adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 short-hairpin RNA into the striatum. Motor behavior assays were employed. Results: Expression of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 was elevated in the striatum of R6/2 and Hdh150Q/7Q mouse models. An increase in Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 transcripts was also found in the caudate nucleus of Huntington's disease patients. Accordingly, a depolarizing shift of Eγ-aminobutyric acid was detected in the striatum of R6/2 mice. Expression of the mutant huntingtin in astrocytes and neuroinflammation were necessary for enhanced expression of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 in HD mice. Notably, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 rescued the motor deficits of R6/2 mice. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that aberrant γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic signaling and enhanced Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease and identify a new therapeutic target for the potential rescue of motor dysfunction in patients with Huntington's disease. ? 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. ? 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society","4 aminobutyric acid; adeno associated virus vector; bumetanide; huntingtin; short hairpin RNA; sodium potassium chloride cotransporter 1; 4 aminobutyric acid brain level; animal experiment; animal model; Article; brain tissue; caudate nucleus; controlled study; corpus striatum; GABAergic transmission; gene repression; human; human tissue; Huntington chorea; immunocytochemistry; immunohistochemistry; motor dysfunction; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system inflammation; neuropathology; nonhuman; perforated patch clamp; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; viral gene delivery system; Western blotting"
"Short- and Long-term Risks of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment with Incident Opportunistic Infections among People Living with HIV/AIDS",2019,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) causes a rapid increase of CD4 + T cells counts during the first 3–6 months of treatment and may enhance the development of opportunistic infections (OIs). However, the short- and long-term effects of HAART exposure on the development of incident OIs has not been extensively studied. This nationwide longitudinal study followed up a total of 26,258 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to ascertain the short- and long-term effects of HAART on incident OIs. During 150,196 person-years of follow-up, 6,413 (24.4%) PLWHA had new onset of OIs. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and AIDS status, PLWHA who received HAART were more likely to develop OIs than those who did not receive HAART. Considering the short- and long-term effects of HAART on the development of OIs, HAART was found to be a risk factor for developing OIs during the first 90 days of treatment, but a protective factor against OIs after 180 days of HAART use. The risk for the development of active OIs significantly decreased as the duration of HAART increased (P < 0.001). Our study suggests that HAART is a risk factor for developing OIs in the short term, but is a protective factor in the long term. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The prevalence and risk factors of atopic dermatitis in 6–8 year-old first graders in Taipei",2019,"Background: Despite the advance in the understanding of etiology, pathophysiology and diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (AD), its prevalence has increased annually in Taiwan. Purposes: The purpose of this study is to explore the prevalence, and personal and environmental risk factors of AD. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted via health centers of elementary schools in Taipei city. We used the Chinese version of ISAAC questionnaire to examine possible personal and environmental risk factors of AD. Questionnaires were completed by parents or guardians of first graders (6–8 year-old) who agreed to participate in this study. Logistic regression was conducted to examine possible personal and environmental factors related to AD (in early life and currently). Results: The 12-month prevalence of AD (in the past 12 months) was 10.7% (2683/24,999) among 6- to 8-year-old first graders in Taipei. Forty-five percent of first graders with AD had their first episode of AD symptoms before the age of two. Children with asthma history were 1.65 times (95% CI: 1.51–1.79, p < 0.001) and children with rhinitis were 2.57 times (95% CI: 2.34–2.84, p < 0.001) more likely to have AD than those without the conditions. Compare to their counterarts, children who used antibiotics during their first year of life (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.22–1.53, p < 0.001) and who had bronchiolitis before the age of two (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.33–1.63, p < 0.001) had a higher chance to have AD during the last 12 months of the study. However, receiving breastfeeding for less than 4 months (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.67–0.83, p < 0.001) and having older siblings (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.76–0.92, p < 0.001) had 25% and 17% reduced risks for AD in the 12 months before this study, respectively. Conclusion: Our study verified personal and environmental risk factors of AD in children in Taiwan. Based on the results, we propose that avoiding bronchiolitis before the age of two, using antibiotics properly in babies, and providing diet counseling for breastfeeding mothers may be good prevention strategies of AD. ? 2018","antibiotic agent; allergic rhinitis; antibiotic therapy; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; breast feeding; bronchiolitis; child; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; environmental factor; farm animal; female; human; International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood Questionnaire Chinese version; major clinical study; male; medical history; preschool child; prevalence; primary school; respiratory tract disease assessment; risk factor; school child; sibling; atopic dermatitis; statistical model; Taiwan; Breast Feeding; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"The Cancer Editome Atlas: A resource for exploratory analysis of the adenosine-to-inosine RNA editome in cancer",2019,"Increasing evidence has suggested a role for adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in carcinogenesis. However, the clinical utility of RNA editing remains limited because functions of the vast majority of editing events remain largely unexplored. To help the cancer research community investigate functional consequences of individual editing events, we have developed a user-friendly bioinformatic resource, The Cancer Editome Atlas (TCEA; http://tcea.tmu.edu.tw). TCEA characterizes >192 million editing events at >4.6 million editing sites from approximately 11,000 samples across 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Clinical information, miRNA expression, and alteration in miRNA targeting modulated through RNA editing are also integrated into TCEA. TCEA supports several modules to search, analyze, and visualize the cancer editome, providing a solid basis for investigating the oncogenic mechanisms of RNA editing and expediting the identification of therapeutic targets in cancer. Significance: This user-friendly bioinformatic resource reduces the barrier to analyzing the huge and complex cancer RNA editome that cancer researchers face and facilitates the identification of novel therapeutic targets in cancer. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","microRNA; X linked inhibitor of apoptosis; 3' untranslated region; adenosine to inosine conversion; Article; bioinformatics; breast cancer; cancer prognosis; carcinogenesis; gene editing; glioblastoma; human; lung cancer; overall survival; priority journal; proto oncogene; RNA editing; RNA sequence; single nucleotide polymorphism; somatic mutation"
"FHL2 mediates podocyte Rac1 activation and foot process effacement in hypertensive nephropathy",2019,"RAAS inhibition has been the standard treatment for CKD for years because it can reduce proteinuria and hence retard renal function decline, but the proteinuria reduction effect is still insufficient in many patients. Podocyte foot process and slit diaphragm are the final barrier to prevent serum proteins leak into urine, and podocyte foot process effacement is the common pathway of all proteinruic diseases. Cell structure are regulated by three evolutionarily conserved Rho GTPases, notably, Rac1 activation is sufficient and necessary for podocyte foot process effacement, however, Rac1 inhibition is not an option for kidney disease treatment because of its systemic side effects. Four-and-a-half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) is highly expressed in podocytes and has been implicated in regulating diverse biological functions. Here, we used micro-dissected human kidney samples, in vitro podocyte culture experiments, and a hypertension animal model to determine the possible role of FHL2 in hypertensive nephropathy. FHL2 was abundantly upregulated in hypertensive human glomeruli and animal kidney samples. Genetic deletion of the FHL2 did not alter normal renal structure or function but mitigated hypertension-induced podocyte foot process effacement and albuminuria. Mechanistically, angiotensin II-induced podocyte cytoskeleton reorganization via FAK-Rac1 axis, FHL2 binds with FAK and is an important mediator of Ang II induced Rac1 activation, thus, FHL2 inhibition can selectively block FAK-Rac1 axis in podocyte and prevent proteinuria. These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of podocyte foot process effacement and points out a promising strategy to treat kidney disease. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Osimertinib Plus Durvalumab versus Osimertinib Monotherapy in EGFR T790M–Positive NSCLC following Previous EGFR TKI Therapy: CAURAL Brief Report",2019,"Introduction: Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Durvalumab is an anti–programmed death ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. The phase III open-label CAURAL trial (NCT02454933) investigated osimertinib plus durvalumab versus osimertinib monotherapy in patients with EGFR-TKI sensitizing and EGFR T790M mutation–positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression after EGFR-TKI therapy. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally administered osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with or without durvalumab (10 mg/kg administered intravenously every 2 weeks) until progression. Treatment could continue beyond progression, providing clinical benefit continued (judged by the investigator). The amended primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib plus durvalumab; efficacy was an exploratory objective. Results: CAURAL recruitment was terminated early because of increased incidence of interstitial lung disease–like events in the osimertinib plus durvalumab arm from the separate phase Ib TATTON trial (NCT02143466). At termination of CAURAL recruitment, 15 patients had been randomly assigned to treatment with osimertinib and 14 to treatment with osimertinib plus durvalumab. The most common AEs were diarrhea (53% [grade ?3 in 6% of patients]) in the osimertinib arm and rash (67% [grade ?3 in 0 patients]) in the combination arm. One patient who had been randomized to the combination arm reported grade 2 interstitial lung disease while receiving osimertinib monotherapy (after discontinuing durvalumab therapy after one dose). The objective response rates were 80% in the osimertinib arm and 64% in the combination arm. Conclusion: Limited patient numbers preclude formal safety and efficacy comparisons between the two treatment arms. The combination of programmed cell death 1/programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors and EGFR-TKIs as therapy for NSCLC is not well understood, but it requires a careful approach if considered in the future. ? 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","aspartate aminotransferase; durvalumab; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; osimertinib; adult; aged; arthralgia; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; backache; clinical article; constipation; controlled study; coughing; decreased appetite; diarrhea; disease control; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; dry skin; dyspnea; female; human; hypesthesia; interstitial lung disease; male; monotherapy; nausea; neutropenia; neutrophil count; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; paronychia; phase 3 clinical trial; pneumonia; priority journal; productive cough; progression free survival; pruritus; rash; rhinorrhea; side effect; stomatitis; survival rate; treatment response; upper respiratory tract infection; viral upper respiratory tract infection"
"Covered stent versus bare-metal stents for chronic total occluded long complicated femoropopliteal lesions: A 2-year single center review",2019,"BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy, safety, and results of Viabahn versus bare-metal stents (BMS) in chronic total occluded (CTO) long femoropopliteal lesions. METHODS: From April 2009 to August 2014, a total 97 patients (71.2 ± 9.7, 45-90 years old, 70 males) with occluded femo-ropopliteal lesions underwent Viabahn (55 patients) or BMS (42 patients) implantation. The clinical findings, procedural factors, and overall outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The average lesion length was 22.1 ± 4.8?cm in the Viabahn group and 17.8 ± 3.3?cm in the BMS group. Both groups had a 100% technical success rate. Although there was no difference between the groups in complication, mortality, and major amputation rates, the Viabahn group had a significantly better average post-operative ankle brachial index (ABI) at 1-year and 2-year follow-ups. The Viabahn group also had significantly less in-stent restenosis (ISR) and target lesion revascularization (TLR) compared with the BMS group. Nevertheless, the two groups shared similar 2-year primary patency rates (63.6% vs. 50.0%, p = .178) and 2-year secondary patency rates (85.5% vs. 81.0%, p = .554). CONCLUSION: Both Viabahn and BMS were efficient treatments for long femoropopliteal CTO lesions. However, the Viabahn group had significantly improved results compared with the BMS group in TLR and ISR, but the difference was not sufficient enough to result in different primary and secondary patency rates.","metal; aged; chronic disease; complication; female; femoral artery; human; male; middle aged; mortality; pathology; peripheral occlusive artery disease; popliteal artery; stent; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arterial Occlusive Diseases; Chronic Disease; Female; Femoral Artery; Humans; Male; Metals; Middle Aged; Popliteal Artery; Stents"
"Effects of exercise and nutritional intervention on body composition, metabolic health, and physical performance in adults with sarcopenic obesity: A meta-analysis",2019,"People with sarcopenic obesity (SO) are characterized by both low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and high body fat (obesity); they have greater risks of metabolic diseases and physical disability than people with sarcopenia or obesity alone. Exercise and nutrition have been reported to be effective for both obesity and sarcopenia management. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of exercise and nutrition on body composition, metabolic health, and physical performance in individuals with SO. Studies investigating the effects of exercise and nutrition on body composition, metabolic health, and physical performance in SO individuals were searched from electronic databases up to April 2019. Fifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Aerobic exercise decreased body weight and fat mass (FM). Resistance exercise (RE) decreased FM and improved grip strength. The combination of aerobic exercise and RE decreased FM and improved walking speed. Nutritional intervention, especially low-calorie high-protein (LCHP) diet, decreased FM but did not affect muscle mass and grip strength. In addition to exercise training, nutrition did not provide extra benefits in outcome. Exercise, especially RE, is essential to improve body composition and physical performance in individuals with SO. Nutritional intervention with LCHP decreases FM but does not improve physical performance. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Oncofertility to Evidence-Based Practice: Changes in Fertility Intention and Symptom Burden in Reproductive-Age Women With Breast Cancer",2019,"Background: Infertility is negatively related to the quality of life in reproductive-age women with breast cancer. The nurses who care for these patients lack a comprehensive understanding of the changes in fertility intention that patients undergo from the time of cancer diagnosis, throughout treatment, and after treatment. A fertility intention assessment is the first step in discerning the patient's ideas toward future pregnancy. Aims: This study examined the changes in fertility intention and symptom burden in reproductive-age women with breast cancer before, during, and after treatment. We also explored predictors of fertility intention among the women. Methods: The study was guided by the theory of planned behavior. A longitudinal and observational study was conducted with 151 women with breast cancer who were treated at a teaching hospital in Taipei. The participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire before, during, and after chemotherapy from July 2016 to March 2018. Fertility intention was assessed using the Fertility Intention Scale. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Taiwanese version was used to measure the symptom burden. The generalized linear mixed model was used for multivariate analysis. Results: Patients had significantly lower scores for fertility intention after treatment than before treatment. The study patients had substantially worse symptom burden during treatment than before or after treatment. Symptom burden scores, especially for symptom interference, correlated significantly with fertility intention. A higher Fertility Intention Scale score was significantly associated with younger age. Linking Evidence to Action: Fertility intention decreased over time in women with breast cancer. Understanding fertility intention and controlling symptom burden throughout the course of treatment and beyond might help nurses provide better care for preserving fertility and maintaining fertility options for these women with breast cancer. ? 2019 Sigma Theta Tau International",""
"Evaluation of user satisfaction and usability of a mobile app for smoking cessation",2019,"Background: Mobile apps have a great potential to support patients in healthcare, and to encourage healthy behavioral changes such as smoking cessation. Nevertheless, the user rejection levels are still high. A set of factors that has impact on the app effectiveness is related to the quality of those features that lead to positive user experiences when using the app. This work aims to evaluate the user experience, and more specifically the usability and the user satisfaction with a mobile application for smoking cessation. This will also provide a basis for future improvements. Methods: We provided a smoking cessation mobile Android app to two different user cohorts, the smokers as valid users and the experts, for three weeks. The app featured usual functionalities to help quit smoking, including an achieved benefits section, mini-games to distract during cravings, and supportive motivational messages. We collected information about user experience, through game playability and message satisfaction questionnaires, and the experts’ opinions. We also considered usage of app sections, the duration of the mini-game sessions, and the user ratings for motivational messages. Results: We included 45 valid users and 25 experts in this study. The questionnaire indicated 80% satisfaction rate for the motivational messages. According to game questionnaires, over 69% of the participants agreed that the games have good usability features, however, for questions related to mobility and gameplay heuristics, agreements were below 67%. The most accessed app sections were achieved benefits and the one with motivational messages. The experts described issues that could help to improve the application. Conclusions: The combination of questionnaires with expert reports allowed to identify several problems and possible corrections. Our study showed that motivational messages have a good satisfaction rate, although it is necessary to consider technical features of some mobile devices that may hinder message reception. Games have good usability and it's expected that the addition of difficulty levels and a better accessibility to the game menu could make them more attractive and increase its usage. Future development of mHealth apps based on gamification and motivational messages need to consider these factors for better user satisfaction and usability. ? 2019 The Authors","mHealth; Smoke; Surveys; Usability engineering; Evaluation of users; Future improvements; Game heuristics; Game questionnaires; Mobile applications; Motivational messages; Smoking cessations; User experience; Serious games; adult; article; case report; clinical article; craving; female; heuristics; human; human experiment; male; mobile application; questionnaire; satisfaction; smoking cessation"
"The association of genotype polymorphisms with vascular access patency in hemodialysis patients",2019,"Some hemodialysis patients suffer from repeat dysfunction of dialysis vascular access and need procedures of angioplasty, thrombectomy, and even temporary catheter use. Why these patients are vulnerable to vascular access dysfunction and how to improve its patency are imperative to be discovered. Traditional risk factors for vascular access function had been widely investigated but could not fully explain this question. Several genotype polymorphisms were demonstrated to increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease and might also be linked to higher risk of vascular access dysfunction. As the major causes of arteriovenous access thrombosis are hypercoagulable status and arteriovenous access stenosis, the investigated genes mainly focus on the mediators of the coagulation cascade, inflammatory process, and endothelial dysfunction. The reported polymorphisms of genes significantly associated with arteriovenous access dysfunction included genes encoding methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, coagulation factors, heme oxygenase-1, matrix metalloproteinase, transforming growth factor-β1, tumor necrosis factor-α, vascular endothelial growth factor-A, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and protein methyl transferase. However, further prospective study is indispensable to elucidate the association between the genotype polymorphisms and the outcome of vascular access. More and more therapeutic options that focus on genotype polymorphisms may generate a great benefit to the patency of vascular access of uremic patients. ?

"Systemic proinflammation after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was correlated to the gut microbiome in HIV-uninfected humans",2019,"Background: The dysbiosis of gut microbiome and interaction with host immunity after Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection are under investigation. We had found fatigue symptom concurrent with dysbiosis by decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio) in active tuberculosis (TB). The study aims to assess the inflammatory biomarkers and their interaction with gut microbiome in active TB and latent TB infection before starting anti-TB regimens. Materials and method: Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1B), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) releasing assay (IGRA) were measured in 25 active TB patients, 32 LTBI subjects and 23 healthy controls (HC). Gut microbiome profiles were obtained using 16S rRNA MiSeq sequencing method. Results: The leucocytosis (7032?±?387 cell/cum, P?&lt;?0.05), increase in IL-6 (229.7?±?104??g/dL, P?&lt;?0.05), and decrease in IL-4 (0.27??g/dL?±?0.1, P?&lt;?0.05) were presented in active TB. The proportion of polymorphic neutrophil (PMN) in peripheral blood was positively related to the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in LTBI and active TB (R 2 ?=?0.23, P?&lt;?0.05). The F/B ratio was positively related to the detectable IL-1B in TB (R 2 ?=?0.97, P?&lt;?0.01) and to the IL-4 in LTBI (R 2 ?=?0.27, P?&lt;?0.05). In LTBI, the relative abundances of Coriobacteriaceae were positively related to the secretion of IFN-gamma against MTB-antigens more likely associated with of CD4+ T cell (R 2 ?=?0.42, P?&lt;?0.05). Conclusion: In active TB, dysbiosis with higher relative abundances of Bacteroidetes in stool and low F/B ratio was related to systemic proinflammation. In LTBI, dose-response relationship between peripheral PMN and relative abundances of Bacteroidetes was remained but not leads to systemic inflammation. ? 2019 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation","CD3 antigen; CD4 antigen; DNA; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; isoniazid; RNA 16S; cytokine; adult; aged; Article; Bacteroidetes; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; Coriobacteriaceae; cytokine release; female; genetic analysis; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; intestine flora; leukocytosis; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; priority journal; prospective study; tuberculosis; very elderly; Actinobacteria; Bacteroidaceae; case control study; CD4+ T lymphocyte; feces; immunology; inflammation; intestine flora; latent tuberculosis; leukocyte count; lung tuberculosis; metabolism; microbiology; middle aged; physiology; young adult; Actinobacteria; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bacteroidaceae; Case-Control Studies; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cytokines; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Inflammation; Latent Tuberculosis; Leukocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Young Adult"

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Yuanshan Township, Yilan County, Taiwan. Data of 731 community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older were evaluated. Demographic characteristics, anthropometry, medical history, biochemistry results, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry results were collected for analysis. Results: Males had a higher rate of sarcopenia than did females and had lower values for body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, percentage of body fat, and lean body mass. Poor nutritional status as determined by the Mini Nutritional Assessment correlated positively with markers for sarcopenia. Levels of vitamin D and folic acid correlated positively with some sarcopenia markers. Conclusions: Gender differences and nutritional factors may influence the development of sarcopenia.

"Bio-Inspired NanoVilli Chips for Enhanced Capture of Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: Toward Non-Invasive Detection of Gene Alterations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer",2019,"Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in bodily fluids are emerging liquid biopsy markers for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Because the majority of EVs in circulation are not of tumor origin, it is critical to develop new platforms capable of enriching tumor-derived EVs from the blood. Herein, we introduce a biostructure-inspired NanoVilli Chip, capable of highly efficient and reproducible immunoaffinity capture of tumor-derived EVs from blood plasma samples. Anti-EpCAM-grafted silicon nanowire arrays were engineered to mimic the distinctive structures of intestinal microvilli, dramatically increasing surface area and enhancing tumor-derived EV capture. RNA in the captured EVs can be recovered for downstream molecular analyses by reverse transcription Droplet Digital PCR. We demonstrate that this assay can be applied to monitor the dynamic changes of ROS1 rearrangements and epidermal growth factor receptor T790M mutations that predict treatment responses and disease progression in non-small cell lung cancer patients. ?

"MicroRNA in ovarian cancer: Biology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic opportunities",2019,"Ovarian cancer comprises one of the three major malignant tumor types in the female reproductive system. The mortality rate of this cancer is the highest among all gynecological tumors, with ovarian cancer metastasis constituting an important cause of death. Therefore, markers for disease prediction and prognosis are highly desirable for early diagnosis as well as for helping optimize and personalize treatment. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), which consist of short-sequence RNAs that do not encode a protein, have emerged as new biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. By pairing with bases specific to the target messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNAs cause degradation of the target mRNA or inhibit its translation, thereby regulating various cellular processes including cell proliferation and adhesion. Increasing numbers of studies have shown that miRNA expression abnormality plays an important role in the development of ovarian cancer. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of miRNA action, current research regarding their role in the suppression or promotion of ovarian cancer, and their use as markers for diagnosis of prognosis or as therapeutic targets for this disease. Finally, we present future perspectives regarding the clinical management of ovarian cancer and the role for miRNAs therein. ? 2019 by the authors.

"MAOA-VNTR Genotype Effects on Ventral Striatum-Hippocampus Network in Alzheimer’s Disease: Analysis Using Structural Covariance Network and Correlation with Neurobehavior Performance",2019,"Functional polymorphisms in the promoter region of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene are associated with brain MAOA activity and transcriptional efficiency in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study investigated structural covariance networks mediated by MAOA-variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) genotypes in patients with AD, and assessed whether this effect was associated with sex. A total of 193 patients with AD were classified into four genotype groups based on MAOA transcriptional efficiency (female low [L], low-high + high activity groups [LH + H]; male L, male H groups). Structural covariance networks were constructed focusing on triple-network and striatal networks. Covariance strength was analyzed in the four groups, and the genotype and sex main effects and their interactions were analyzed. Significant peak cluster volumes were correlated with neurobehavioral scores to establish the clinical significance. MAOA genotypes mediated the structural covariance strength on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC)-caudate axis in both sexes, but a higher covariance strength was shown in the female L group and male H group. The independent effect of male sex was related to higher covariance strength in the frontal medial superior region in the dLPFC, dorsal caudate (DC), and ventral superior striatum (VSs) seeds. In contrast, female sex had higher covariance strength in the frontal opercular areas anchored by the dLPFC, DC, and VSs seeds. Topographies showing higher covariance strength with sex interactions were found in the male H group and female L group in the dLPFC supplementary motor axis, DC-SMA, and DC-precentral axis. In our patients with AD, MAOA-VNTR polymorphisms and sex had independent and interactive effects on structural covariance networks, of which the dLPFC-, VSs-, and DC-anchored networks represented major endophenotypes that determined cognitive outcomes. The sex-genotype interaction model suggested that male high activity and female low activity may modulate brain morphometric connectivity and determine cognitive scores. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","biological marker; amine oxidase (flavin containing); Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; caudate nucleus; cognition; controlled study; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; female; gene interaction; genetic polymorphism; genetic transcription; genotype; hippocampus; human; major clinical study; male; MAOA gene; mental performance; neuroimaging; pars opercularis; sex difference; topography; variable number of tandem repeat; ventral striatum; aged; Alzheimer disease; behavior; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; hippocampus; pathology; pathophysiology; variable number of tandem repeat; ventral striatum; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Behavior; Cognition; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Hippocampus; Humans; Male; Minisatellite Repeats; Monoamine Oxidase; Ventral Striatum"
"Antitumor, inhibition of metastasis and radiosensitizing effects of total nutrition formula on lewis tumor-bearing mice",2019,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) causes high mortality. Radiotherapy is an induction regimen generally applied to patients with NSCLC. In view of therapeutic efficacy, the outcome is not appealing in addition to bringing about unwanted side effects. Total nutrition is a new trend in cancer therapy, which benefits cancer patients under radiotherapy. Male C57BL/6JNarl mice were experimentally divided into five groups: one control group, one T group (borne with Lewis lung carcinoma but no treatment), and three Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing groups administrated with a total nutrition formula (T + TNuF group), a local radiotherapy plus daily 3 Gy in three fractions (T + R group), or a combination TNuF and radiotherapy (T + R + TNuF group). These mice were assessed for their mean tumor volumes, cachectic symptoms and tumor metastasis. TNuF administration significantly suppressed tumor growth and activated apoptotic cell death in NSCLC-bearing mice under radiation. The body-weight gain was increased, while the radiation-induced cachexia was alleviated. Analysis of mechanisms suggests that TNuF downregulates EGFR and VEGF signaling pathways, inhibiting angiogenesis and metastasis. In light of radiation-induced tumor cell death, mitigation of radiation-induced cachexia and inhibition of tumor cell distant metastasis, the combination of TNuF and radiotherapy synergistically downregulates EGFR and VEGF signaling in NSCLC-bearing mice. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Quality of care in six sub-Saharan Africa countries: A provider-based study on adherence to WHO's antenatal care guideline",2019,"Objective: Quality of care may help explain the high burden of disease in maternal, newborn and child health in low- and middle-income countries even as access to care is improved. We explored the determinants of quality of antenatal care (ANC) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Design: Cross-sectional study. Multilevel Generalized Linear Latent Mixed-Effect models with logit link function were employed to obtain the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Setting: We used Service Provision Assessment data from six countries in SSA, including Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Participants: Seven thousand, five hundred and seventy seven observed antenatal clients across the six countries. Main Outcome Measures: Quality of ANC services, measured using indexes of quality of clinical care and quality of information provided. Results: Providers in facilities that had ANC guideline (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08-1.48), were wellequipped (AOR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.41-1.92), were classified as upper level facility (AOR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05-1.66), had central electricity supply (AOR = 2.19; 95% CI, 1.81-2.65), and piped water (AOR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09-1.55) were more likely to provide optimal quality of clinical care. Moreover, those having ANC guideline (AOR = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.43-2.28) and central electricity supply (AOR = 2.67; 95% CI, 2.01-3.44) were more likely to provide optimal information as well. Provider's qualification and experience were also important in information provision and clinical care independently. Conclusion: The lack of some very basic facility equipment and amenities compromised quality of care in sub-Saharan countries. Policy actions and investment on facility and providers will enable provision of quality services necessary to improve maternal, newborn and child health in SSA. ? 2018 The Author(s).","anemia; Article; blood pressure measurement; blurred vision; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dyspnea; electricity; fatigue; female; fever; headache; health care facility; health care personnel; health care quality; hematological procedure; human; Kenya; logistic regression analysis; Malawi; Namibia; nurse; practice guideline; prenatal care; primary medical care; priority journal; protocol compliance; Rwanda; swelling; Tanzania; Uganda; urinalysis; vagina bleeding; water supply; work experience; World Health Organization; Africa south of the Sahara; developing country; devices; health care quality; maternal health service; organization and management; pregnancy; prenatal care; protocol compliance; standards; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; Africa South of the Sahara; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Equipment and Supplies; Female; Guideline Adherence; Health Facilities; Humans; Maternal Health Services; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Quality of Health Care"
"Spreading depression as a preclinical model of migraine",2019,"Spreading depression (SD) is a slowly propagating wave of near-complete depolarization of neurons and glial cells across the cortex. SD is thought to contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of migraine aura, and possibly also an intrinsic brain activity causing migraine headache. Experimental models of SD have recapitulated multiple migraine-related phenomena and are considered highly translational. In this review, we summarize conventional and novel methods to trigger SD, with specific focus on optogenetic methods. We outline physiological triggers that might affect SD susceptibility, review a multitude of physiological, biochemical, and behavioral consequences of SD, and elaborate their relevance to migraine pathophysiology. The possibility of constructing a recurrent episodic or chronic migraine model using SD is also discussed. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor; potassium chloride; blood brain barrier; blood flow; brain metabolism; cell structure; dendritic spine; disease predisposition; electrophysiology; electrostimulation; episodic migraine; glymphatic system; headache; human; hypoglycemia; in vitro study; mechanical stimulation; meningitis; meninx; migraine; migraine aura; nonhuman; optogenetics; oxygenation; pain receptor; phenomenology; priority journal; recurrent disease; Review; sleep deprivation; spreading cortical depression; stress; transformed migraine; transgenic animal; trigeminal nerve; wild type; animal; brain cortex; disease model; metabolism; migraine; migraine with aura; nerve cell; pathophysiology; physiology; spreading cortical depression; Animals; Cerebral Cortex; Cortical Spreading Depression; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Migraine with Aura; Neurons"
"Maintenance of antidepressant and antisuicidal effects by D-cycloserine among patients with treatment-resistant depression who responded to low-dose ketamine infusion: a double-blind randomized placebo–control study",2019,"Increasing evidence supports a rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effect of a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Maintaining the initial clinical response after ketamine infusion in TRD is a crucial next-step challenge. D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist of the glycine co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, is potentially effective as a depression augmentation treatment. However, whether DCS maintains the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion remains unknown. In all, 32 patients with TRD (17 with major depression and 15 with bipolar depression) who responded to ketamine infusion with an average 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score of 9.47 ± 4.11 at baseline were randomly divided to 6-week DCS treatment (250 mg for 2 days, 500 mg for 2 days, 750 mg for 3 days, and 1000 mg for 5 weeks) and placebo groups. Depression symptoms were rated at timepoints of dose titration and weekly. During the 6-week treatment, the total scores of HAMD did not differ between the DCS and placebo groups. The results remained consistent when stratified by disorder. A mixed model analysis indicated that the DCS group exhibited lower scores of HAMD item 3 (suicide) compared with the placebo group throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.01). A superior maintenance of the antisuicidal effect of ketamine was observed in the DCS group than in the placebo group. DCS may be therapeutically beneficial for patients with TRD who responded to ketamine infusion but have a residual suicidal risk. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.","cycloserine; ketamine; placebo; add on therapy; adult; antidepressant activity; Article; bipolar depression; clinical article; controlled study; dizziness; double blind procedure; drug dose titration; female; follow up; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; hand tremor; human; low drug dose; maintenance therapy; male; open study; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; pruritus; psychopharmacotherapy; randomized controlled trial; sedation; side effect; suicide; treatment duration; treatment resistant depression"
"Is intravesical prostatic protrusion a risk factor for hydronephrosis and renal insufficiency in benign prostate hyperplasia patients?",2019,"Background: Some patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms hesitate to undergo surgical treatment until acute urinary retention (AUR) occurs. Some of these patients have been found to have hydronephrosis or even renal insufficiency. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors for hydronephrosis in patients with AUR who needed to receive transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 91 patients from January 2014 to June 2015, who had BPH and received TURP for AUR. Patients with urolithiasis, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, gross hematuria, previous bladder radiation therapy, or urinary tract surgery were excluded. Parameters of intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP), serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA), total prostate volume (PV), age, body mass index (BMI), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and serum creatinine (Cr) were compared between the hydronephrosis and non-hydronephrosis groups. Results: There were significant differences in IPP (p < 0.001) and Serum Cr (p < 0.001) between the hydronephrosis and non-hydronephrosis groups. For IPP, the cut-off values of the highest risk of hydronephrosis was 1.95cm. There were no significant differences in age, BMI, DM, HTN, CAD, total PV, and PSA between the two groups. IPP was not correlated with total PV (p = 0.423). Most of the patients with hydronephrosis had renal function improvement after TURP. Conclusion: IPP was a significant risk factor for hydronephrosis in BPH patients. If the patients’ IPP exceeded 1.95cm, they had a higher risk of having hydronephrosis when AUR occurred. Hydronephrosis is a risk factor for renal insufficiency, and Serum Cr levels decreased significantly in the patients of our study.

"A proposal for a self-rated frailty index and status for patient-oriented research",2019,"Objective: Frailty indices are important predictors of major health outcomes, but mostly designed by and for researchers and specialists. Three of the most commonly used theory-based indices are composite measures that are subject to arbitrary assumptions and biases introduced due to data processing. A complicated index can be simplified with fewer items. The theory-based frailty indices are not optimal and neglect patients' perspectives. This study aims to compare different definitions of frailty and propose a self-rated measure of frailty index and status. Results: Frailty was defined differently by laypeople and researchers/clinicians. Patients' and laypeople's perspectives seemed neglected. Existing frailty indices had shortcomings related to the use of composite measures, assumptions of frailty theories, and the lack of novel information. To avoid these shortcomings, we suggested asking individuals ""on a scale of 0 to 10, how frail do you think you are?"" and ""by answering yes or no, do you consider yourself to be frail?"" to determine frailty on continuous and dichotomous scales respectively. However, there will be other issues emerging with these new measures, such as the need for feasibility and validity studies, as well as acceptability by researchers. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aged; aging; devices; frailty; human; patient care; psychometry; self evaluation; severity of illness index; Aged; Aging; Diagnostic Self Evaluation; Frailty; Humans; Patient-Centered Care; Psychometrics; Severity of Illness Index"
"MiR-338-5p promotes metastasis of colorectal cancer by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic subunit type 3-mediated autophagy pathway",2019,"Background: In our preliminary screening, expression of miR-338-5p was found to be higher in primary colorectal cancer (CRC)with metastasis. The autophagy related gene- phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3)appeared to be targeted by miR-338-5p. Here, we provide solid evidence in support of PIK3C3 involved in miR-338-5p related metastasis of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Methods: The potential clinical relevance of miR-338-5p and its target gene was analysed on benign colorectal polyps and primary CRCs by QPCR. Mouse spleen xenograft experiment was performed to examine the importance of miR-338-5p for metastasis. Findings: PIK3C3 was one of target genes of miR-338-5p. In primary CRCs, expression of miR-338-5p is positively related to tumour staging, distant metastasis and poor patient survival. Patients with higher ratios of miR-338-5p/PIK3C3 also had significantly poor overall survival, supporting their significance in the progression of CRC. Over-expression of miR-338-5p promotes CRC metastasis to the liver and lung in vivo, in which PIK3C3 was down-regulated in the metastatic tumours. In contrast, overexpression of PIK3C3 in miR-338-5p stable cells inhibited the growth of metastatic tumours. Both migration and invasion of CRC in vitro induced by miR-338-5p are mediated by suppression of PIK3C3. Using forward and reverse approaches, autophagy was proved to involve in CRC migration and invasion induced by miR-338-5p. Interpretation: MiR-338-5p induces migration, invasion and metastasis of CRC in part through PIK3C3-related autophagy pathway. The miR-338-5p/PIK3C3 ratio may become a prognostic biomarker for CRC patients.

"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting as a rectovaginal septal mass: A case report and review of literature",2019,"INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) arising from the gynecological tract are extremely rare. A case of GIST with an unusual presentation as a vaginal mass is presented with comprehensive literature review, aiming to gain a better understanding of the diagnostic and treatment strategy of the disease. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 78-year-old woman presented with persistent vaginal bleeding and difficulty in micturition. Although the tumor mass was diagnosed, the results of preoperative evaluations are uncertain. DIAGNOSIS: Preoperative evaluation included the computed tomography examination (a 6.3×5.3?cm cervical mass lesion with rectal and vaginal invasion), colonoscopy (an external compression with an intact mucosa), tumor markers, and biopsy (spindle cell tumor). Postoperative histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of GIST. INTERVENTIONS: Posterior exenteration with complete resection was performed. The patient received postoperative adjuvant imatinib therapy. OUTCOMES: The patient has survived without the disease for more than 3 years. CONCLUSION: It is still a challenge to diagnose GISTs in women with rectovaginal mass preoperatively. Efforts should be made, including a high suspicion and an assistance of immunohistochemistry. A precise diagnosis may offer a better surgical and treatment plan, especially on the preservation of reproductive organs and accessibility of targeted therapy.","aged; case report; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; female; gastrointestinal stromal tumor; gastrointestinal tumor; human; multimodality cancer therapy; pathology; Aged; Combined Modality Therapy; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors; Humans"
"Sleep and the risk of chronic kidney disease: A cohort study",2019,"Study Objectives: Little information is available regarding the effect of sleep on the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This large-cohort study aimed to investigate the association between sleep and the incidence of CKD. Methods: We recruited 194,039 participants without CKD aged 20 years or older between 1996 and 2014. Incident CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Information about sleep duration and quality was obtained from a questionnaire and used to generate a score reflecting the sleep profile. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for CKD associations with sleep duration, quality, and score categories. Results: Regarding sleep duration, participants who slept for fewer than 4 hours (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.22–1.71), 4 to 6 hours (1.07, 1.02–1.14), or more than 8 hours (1.12, 1.04–1.21) had an increased risk of incident CKD, compared to those who slept 6 to 8 hours. Regarding sleep quality, participants who fell asleep but awoke easily (1.13, 1.07–1.19), had difficulty falling asleep (1.14, 1.06–1.22), or used sleeping pills or sedatives (1.14, 1.20–1.66) had a higher risk of incident CKD, compared to those who slept well. Furthermore, participants with sleep scores of 4 to 6 (1.07, 1.02–1.13) and less than 4 (1.61, 1.37–1.89) had an increased risk of incident CKD, compared to those with a sleep score higher than 6. Conclusions: A poor sleep profile is associated with increased risk of CKD development. Therefore, sleep duration and quality should be considered when developing strategies to improve sleep and thus prevent CKD.

"Lymphovascular Invasion as the Major Prognostic Factor in Node-Negative Esophageal Cancer After Primary Esophagectomy",2019,"Background: Studies addressing both lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and perineural invasion (PNI) in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with or without neoadjuvant therapy are limited. We aimed to analyze the incidence and prognostic significance of LVI and PNI in patients with thoracic ESCC. Methods: This retrospective study included 520 patients with ESCC: 174 patients after neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery and 346 after primary esophagectomy, from two medical centers. The relationships between LVI, PNI, and other histological factors were evaluated. The Cox regression model was used for survival analysis. Results: Positive LVI and PNI were noted in 35.6% and 22.4% of patients with residual primary tumor after neoadjuvant treatment and in 39.6% and 24.0% of patients who underwent primary esophagectomy, respectively. In patients with neoadjuvant treatments, the 5-year overall survival rates were 12.7% and 28.3% in patients with positive LVI and negative LVI, respectively (p = 0.001). The 5-year overall survival rates were 6.4% and 29.9% in patients with positive PNI and negative PNI, respectively (p < 0.001). In patients who did not receive neoadjuvant treatment, the 5-year overall survival rates were 28.2% and 61.1% in patients with positive LVI and negative LVI, respectively (p < 0.001). The 5-year overall survival rates were 30.2% and 52.5% in patients with positive PNI and negative PNI (p < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the presence of PNI was an independent prognostic factor in patients with neoadjuvant treatments, whereas the presence of LVI had more significant prognostic impact in patients with node-negative ESCC after primary esophagectomy. Conclusions: Both LVI and PNI statuses are significant prognostic factors for patients with ESCC. However, the prognostic impact of LVI was majorly in the subgroup of node-negative patients who received primary esophagectomy. ? 2019, The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.",""
"Cisplatin contributes to programmed death-ligand 1 expression in bladder cancer through ERK1/2-AP-1 signaling pathway",2019,"Bladder cancer (BC) is the second most common urologic malignancy and the ninth most common malignancy worldwide. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for patients with early-stage disease, whereas therapeutic options are limited for patients with advanced-stage or residual BC. Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is an important target for immunotherapy. It is known that PD-L1 is overexpressed in BC; a clinical trial involving PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced BC is ongoing. In the present study, we used Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to define the expression level of PD-L1 after cisplatin treatment in BC-derived cell lines. The signal activation was also evaluated by Western blot in BC-derived cell lines. We found that chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin can induce PD-L1 but not PD-L2 expression in BC-derived cell lines. Furthermore, the expression level of PD-L1 was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner after cisplatin treatment. The cisplatin-induced PD-L1 expression is mainly mediated by ERK1/2 but not Akt/mTOR signal pathway. Moreover, we found that cisplatin activates transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) to regulate PD-L1 expression. The chemotherapy drug such as cisplatin may trigger resistance of BC through PD-L1 up-regulation. The present study suggests that PD-L1 antibody should be used concomitantly with chemotherapy in the setting of advanced and metastatic BC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cisplatin; mammalian target of rapamycin; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 ligand 2; protein kinase B; transcription factor AP 1; 5637 cell line; antineoplastic activity; Article; bladder cancer; concentration response; controlled study; drug resistance; human; human cell; protein expression; signal transduction; T24 cell line; transcription initiation; upregulation"

"Pay-for-performance for shared care of diabetes in Taiwan",2019,"Background/Purpose: Comprehensive and continuous care is crucial for patients with diabetes. The diabetes pay-for-performance (P4P) program launched by the National Health Insurance (NHI) administration in Taiwan provides a financial incentive to facilitate this goal. In this study, we explored the characteristics of patients in the P4P program between 2005 and 2014. Methods: Data of patients with diabetes enrolled in the NHI program between 2005 and 2014 were extracted from the NHI research database. Patients were classed as having diabetes if they had three or more outpatient visits within 365 calendar days with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code of 250 or hospitalization one or more times with such a diagnosis. The trends of participating in the P4P program were analyzed. Results: Participation rate of the P4P program increased from 12.1% to 19% between 2005 and 2014. Participants were younger and more likely to be female than those not participating in the program. Lower risks of cancer-related mortality, annual mortality and heart failure were seen in patients participating in the P4P program than in those not participating. Conclusion: Older, male patients with a high disease severity may be less likely to enroll in the P4P program. Although participation rate is increasing, a broad enrollment is expected. ? 2019","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; metformin; sulfonylurea derivative; adult; all cause mortality; Article; cancer patient; comorbidity; diabetes education; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; female; health program; heart failure; hospitalization; human; hypertension; ICD-9-CM; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient care; prevalence; retinopathy; Taiwan"
"Influence of Climate on the Incidence of RCVS – A Retrospective Study?From Taiwan",2019,"Background: Cold weather is reportedly a precipitator of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) in a few cases. We systematically investigated whether meteorological factors correlate with the occurrence of RCVS. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients diagnosed with RCVS or probable RCVS, based on International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition (ICHD-3) criteria, in a hospital-based headache center from March 2005 to February 2014. Monthly averages of local weather data measured in Taipei were obtained from the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan. Primary weather variables were compared with the number of monthly new-onset cases of RCVS. Results: We recruited 226 patients with established RCVS and 72 patients with probable RCVS during a 108-month study period. Incidence of RCVS was higher in winter than summer months (3.3 persons/month [SD: 2.0] vs 2.1 persons/month [SD: 1.5], P?=.013). The monthly incidence of RCVS correlated negatively with mean daily temperature (r?=??0.231, P?=.016) and average precipitation (r?=??0.269, P?=.005), but positively with barometric pressure (r?=?0.274, P?=.004). These 3 correlated meteorological factors together explained about 10% of the variance in RCVS monthly incidence (R 2 ?=?0.095, P?=.015). Conclusion: RCVS was found to be more common in winter months and to be associated with weather variables in Taiwan. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of these associations. ? 2019 American Headache Society","adult; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; climate; coughing; defecation; disease association; emotion; environmental temperature; female; hormonal therapy; human; humidity; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; meteorological phenomena; migraine; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; precipitation; priority journal; retrospective study; reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome; sexual behavior; subarachnoid hemorrhage; summer; Taiwan; thunderclap headache; winter"
"Arecoline-regulated ataxia telangiectasia mutated expression level in oral cancer progression",2019,"Background: Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) regulates DNA repair and cell cycle. The present study analyzed arecoline-induced ATM expression during oral cancer progression. Methods: In vitro studies were performed using oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines treated with arecoline to analyze cell response and ATM regulation. in vivo studies were performed using immunohistochemistry to detect ATM expression in normal, oral potentially malignant disorder (OPMD), and OSCC tissues. Results: Low-dose arecoline induced cell proliferation, ATM promoter activity, and DNA repair. High-dose arecoline induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage. ATM was overexpressed in OPMD tissues but was downregulated in OSCC tissues. ATM expression level was associated with the risk of developing dysplasia, buccal-OSCC, and with OSCC survival rate. Conclusion: High ATM expression helps DNA repair mechanisms to maintain the cells in the OPMD stage, but low ATM expression causes DNA damage accumulation to increase cell malignancy. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","arecoline; ATM protein; cycline; cyclophilin A; protein bcl 2; adult; alcohol consumption; apoptosis; Article; betel quid; buccal mucosa; cancer growth; cancer staging; cancer survival; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell viability; cigarette smoking; controlled study; cytotoxicity; distant metastasis; DNA damage; DNA repair; down regulation; drug megadose; female; fluorescence microscopy; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; IC50; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; OECM-1 cell line; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein expression level; protein localization; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; S phase cell cycle checkpoint; SAS cell line; survival rate; ultraviolet radiation"
"Comparison Between Esophagectomy and Definitive Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Esophageal Cancer",2019,"Background: This study compared survival between definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and esophagectomy alone among patients with locoregional esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods: Data were obtained from the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 2008 and 2014. Included were 5,487 patients with clinical I, II, or III esophageal SCC who received definitive CRT or esophagectomy alone. Patients were stratified according to clinical stage.

Propensity-matched analysis along with univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Results: Treatment was with definitive CRT in 4,251 patients (77.50%) and esophagectomy alone in 1,236 (22.50%). Propensity score matching produced 1,020 patients for comparison. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 60.92%, 34.96%, and 26.14%, respectively, for propensity-matched patients treated with definitive CRT and were 71.15%, 56.50%, and 46.17%, respectively, for propensity-matched patients treated with esophagectomy alone (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed treatment strategy was an independent prognostic factor. Esophagectomy alone was associated with significantly better overall survival than definitive CRT for patients with clinical stage I/II disease. There was no survival risk difference between definitive CRT and esophagectomy only for patients with clinical stage III disease. Conclusions: Esophagectomy alone could provide better survival than definitive CRT for patients with clinical stage I/II esophageal SCC. However, definitive CRT and esophagectomy yield similar overall survival rates in clinical stage III patients. ? 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","antineoplastic agent; adult; Article; attributable risk; cancer grading; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer surgery; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chemoradiotherapy; comparative effectiveness; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus resection; female; human; locoregional esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; oncological parameters; overall survival; priority journal; propensity score; retrospective study; survival rate; survival time; treatment outcome; tumor length; aged; chemoradiotherapy; cohort analysis; comparative study; disease free survival; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus resection; esophagus tumor; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; pathology; procedures; prognosis; register; risk assessment; survival analysis; Taiwan; tumor invasion; Aged; Chemoradiotherapy; Cohort Studies; Disease-Free Survival; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Esophagectomy; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Propensity Score; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"Autoantibodies in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: Clinical associations and laboratory evaluation by mono- and multispecific immunoassays",2019,"Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a group of diseases characterized by immune-mediated muscular lesions that may be associated with extra-muscular manifestations involving skin, lungs, heart or joints. Four main groups of IIM can be distinguished: dermatomyositis (DM), overlap myositis including mainly anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS), immune mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). Myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSA) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for diagnosis, classification and prognosis of IIM. For example, ASS is associated with anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase antibodies (anti-Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12, …), IMNM with anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR; IBM with anti-cytosolic 5'nucleotidase 1A (cN1A), and DM with anti-Mi-2, anti-MDA-5, anti-TIF-1γ, anti-NXP-2 and anti-SAE. Moreover, anti-MDA-5 is associated with amyopathic myositis and interstitial lung disease and anti-TIF-1γ and anti-NXP-2 with juvenile DM as well as malignancy in patients >40 years. Most MSA have initially been discovered by immunoprecipitation. In routine laboratories, however, MSA are screened for by indirect immunofluorescence and identified by (automated) monospecific immunoassays or by multispecific immunoassays (mainly line/dot immunoassays). Validation of these (multispecific) assays is a challenge as the antibodies are rare and the assays diverse. In this review, we give an overview of the (clinical) performance characteristics of monospecific assays as well as of multispecific assays for detection of MSA. Although most assays are clinically useful, there are differences between techniques and between manufacturers. We discuss that efforts are needed to harmonize and standardize detection of MSA. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","amino acid transfer RNA ligase; antinuclear antibody; autoantibody; autoantibody; antibody detection; antisynthetase syndrome; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; dermatomyositis; disease classification; human; immune mediated necrotizing myopathy; immunoassay; inclusion body myositis; laboratory test; monospecific immunoassay; multispecific immunoassay; myositis; Review; immunoassay; immunology; myositis; Autoantibodies; Humans; Immunoassay; Myositis"
"Influenza vaccination and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease among Taiwanese elders—A propensity score-matched follow-up study",2019,"The present study aimed to evaluate the association between influenza vaccination and the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among elderly persons. This retrospective cohort study used the Geriatric Dataset of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (2000–2013). Patients aged 65 years who had been hospitalized for the first episodes of myocardial infarction were eligible. The vaccinated cohort comprised patients who received one dose of influenza vaccine within 180 days after discharge. The unvaccinated cohort included those who did not receive influenza vaccination and was propensity score–matched (1:1) for known CVD risk factors. All-cause death, acute myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure were assessed 1 year after the 181st day after hospital discharge. Compared with the matched cohort (n = 4,350), the vaccinated cohort (n = 4,350) had significantly lower incidences of all-cause death (hazard ratios [HR] 0.82, 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.73–0.92), myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96), and hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74–0.92). The association between influenza vaccination and reduction of CVDs was similar across different subgroups. Cumulative incidence curves of the CVDs of interest for the two cohorts separated within the initial 3 months of follow-up (P &lt; 0.05). Influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of CVD in the elderly population with previous myocardial infarction. ? 2019 Wu et al.

"Precision medicine for frontotemporal dementia",2019,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common young-onset dementia presenting with heterogeneous and distinct syndromes. It is characterized by progressive deficits in behavior, language, and executive function. The disease may exhibit similar characteristics to many psychiatric disorders owing to its prominent behavioral features. The concept of precision medicine has recently emerged, and it involves neurodegenerative disease treatment that is personalized to match an individual's specific pattern of neuroimaging, neuropathology, and genetic variability. In this paper, the pathophysiology underlying FTD, which is characterized by the selective degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices, is reviewed. We also discuss recent advancements in FTD research from the perspectives of clinical, imaging, molecular characterizations, and treatment. This review focuses on the approach of precision medicine to manage the clinical and biological complexities of FTD. Copyright ? 2019 Liu, Lau and Lin.

"Multinational comparison of new antidepressant use in older adults: A cohort study",2019,"Objectives We used an international pharmacosurveillance network to estimate the rate and characteristics of antidepressant use in older adults in countries with more conservative (UK) and liberal depression guidelines (Canada, USA). Setting Electronic health records and population-based administrative data from six jurisdictions in four countries (UK, Taiwan, USA and Canada). Participants A historical cohort of older adults (?65 years) who had a new episode of antidepressant use between 2009 and 2014. Outcome measures The age and sex-standardised cumulative incidence of new episodes of antidepressant use in older adults was measured. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the proportion of new users by the antidepressant prescribed, therapeutic class, potential treatment indication and country, as well as the characteristics of the first treatment episode (standardised daily doses, duration and changes). Results The incidence of antidepressant use between 2009 and 2014 varied from 4.7% (Montreal and Quebec City) to 18.6% (Taiwan). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were the most commonly used class in the UK (48.8%) and Taiwan (52.4%) compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in North American jurisdictions (42.3%-53.3%). Chronic pain was the most common potential treatment indication (41.2%-68.2%). Among users with chronic pain, TCAs were used most frequently in the UK and Taiwan (55.2%-60.4%), whereas SSRIs were used most frequently in North America (33.5%-46.4%). Treatment was longer (252-525 vs 169-437 days), standardised doses were higher (0.7-1.3 vs 0.5-1.0) and treatment was more likely to be changed (31%-46% vs 21%-34%) among patients with depression (9.1%-43%) than those with chronic pain. Conclusion Antidepressant use in older adults varied 24-fold by country, with the UK, which has the most conservative treatment guidelines, being among the lowest. Chronic pain was the most common potential treatment indication. Evaluation of real-world risks of TCAs is a priority for future research, given high rates of use and the potential for increased toxicity in older adults because of potent anticholinergic effects. ?

"Noninfectious uveitis in the Asia–Pacific region",2019,"Uveitis is a sight-threatening disease. Up to 35% of patients may have impaired vision. Inflammation of the uvea tissue has more than 60 etiologies. Previous reports have shown that 20–40% of uveitis cases were noninfectious. Some of them may be associated with systemic rheumatological and autoimmune diseases but some may affect the eyes only. The epidemiology and clinical situations of some specific uveitis entities vary worldwide because they are influenced by genetic, ethnic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. The Asia–Pacific region comprises more than 30 countries. Epidemiology and patterns of uveitis vary greatly in this region. However, some uveitis entities, such as Behcet’s disease, sarcoidosis, and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease, are more common in this region. Many studies on the epidemiology, risk factors, and immune pathogenesis of this disease have been conducted. In this article, we review the epidemiology of noninfectious uveitis and special situations of these three uveitis entities in the Asia–Pacific region. ? 2018, The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.","adalimumab; azathioprine; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; dexamethasone; methotrexate; mycophenolic acid; tacrolimus; triamcinolone; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; ankylosing spondylitis; Asia; Australia; Behcet disease; China; immunopathogenesis; incidence; India; Japan; ocular sarcoidosis; prevalence; Review; sarcoidosis; South Korea; systemic therapy; Taiwan; uveitis; Vogt Koyanagi syndrome; human; Pacific islands; uveitis; visual system examination; Asia; Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological; Humans; Incidence; Pacific Islands; Uveitis"
"Robot-assisted microvascular anastomosis in head and neck free flap reconstruction: Preliminary experiences and results",2019,"Background: The da Vinci Surgical System has facilitated considerable advancements in surgery. The process and results of robot-assisted microvascular anastomosis in real clinical situations have rarely been reported. This study presents our experience of performing robot-assisted microvascular anastomosis in free flap reconstruction in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. Patients and methods: This was a retrospective study of reconstructive operations using a free radial forearm flap for oropharyngeal defects after tumor extirpation in 15 consecutive adult patients (12 men and 3 women). In total, 17 robot-assisted microvascular vessel anastomoses (2 arteries and 15 veins) were performed; moreover, 13 arteries and 13 veins were anastomosed using the standard operating microscope and hand-sewing technique. Results: The recipient and donor vessel diameters were 2.5 ± 0.7 and 2.1 ± 0.8 mm, respectively. The donor blood vessel diameter selected for anastomosis using da Vinci Surgical System was significantly smaller (2.1 ± 0.8 vs. 2.5 ± 0.6 mm) than that for a standard operating microscope and hand-sewing technique (p =.021), the operating time spent (38.4 ± 10.4 vs. 28.0 ± 7.7 min) was significantly longer (p <.001). The vascular patency rate was 100%, and all flaps survived without requiring additional operation for revision. Conclusion: Robotic surgical systems can facilitate vascular microanastomosis and provide a blood vessel patency rate comparable to that of a standard operating microscope and hand-sewing technique. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; aged; Article; blood vessel shunt; clinical article; female; free tissue graft; head and neck surgery; human; male; operation duration; oropharynx cancer; priority journal; radial forearm flap; retrospective study; robot assisted surgery; surgical technique; treatment outcome; vascular patency"
"Specific adverse events predict survival rates in a Chinese population diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma and treated with sorafenib",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a poor prognosis and a low chemotherapeutic efficiency except for when sorafenib is administered. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of sorafenib therapy in a Chinese population diagnosed with HCC. Method: Data for the subjects with HCC receiving sorafenib at Taichung Veterans General Hospital from June 2012 to October 2016 were evaluated. All enrolled cases belonged to the HCC Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification stage C. The AEs were defined as appearances of hand–foot syndrome reaction (HFSR), hypertension (HTN), or diarrhea. The exclusion criteria included a poor performance status, lack of compliance to drugs, and loss of follow-up within the following day. Results: Of a total of 116 subjects enrolled, there were 43 (37.1%), 13 (11.2%), and 15 (12.9%) cases experiencing HFSR, HTN, and diarrhea, respectively. The cases with AE had both a longer time to progression (TTP) (HFSR 5.16 vs. 3.33 months, P = 0.003; HTN 6.62 vs. 3.68 months, P = 0.001; diarrhea 6.67 vs. 3.61 months, P = 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (HFSR 8.12 vs. 4.75 months, P = 0.001; HTN 9.08 vs. 5.61 months, P = 0.008; diarrhea 8.20 vs. 5.67 months, P = 0.042) than those without. More AEs were correlated with a longer TTP and OS. Conclusion: The appearance of sorafenib AEs, including HFSR, HTN, and diarrhea, can predict a positive therapy efficacy to HCC. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Amentoflavone Effectively Blocked the Tumor Progression of Glioblastoma via Suppression of ERK/NF- κ B Signaling Pathway",2019,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system, with an annual incidence of 5.26 per 100000 people. The clinical outcome of standard therapy and the survival rate remain poor; therefore, there is an unmet need for a new strategy to treat this lethal disease. Although amentoflavone was known to have anticancer potential in various types of cancers, its antiglioblastoma ability and mechanism remain unrecognized. We demonstrated that amentoflavone may suppress glioblastoma invasion and migration by transwell assay. Moreover, we established NF-κB reporter gene system and used that for verifying NF-κB inhibition efficacy of amentoflavone on in vitro and in vivo studies. Here, we indicated that amentoflavone not only diminished NF-κB activation, but also reduced NF-κB-mediated downstream oncogenes expression, such as MMP-2, MMP-9, XIAP, cyclinD1 and VEGF, which was elucidated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tumor growth inhibition and NF-κB reduction was found in the amentoflavone treatment group, which was revealed by the glioblastoma-bearing animal model. In this study, we also used ERK inhibitor and NF-κB inhibitor (QNZ) to confirm whether the beneficial result of amentoflavone on glioblastoma was mainly regulated by blockage of ERK/NF-κB signaling. In summary, ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway has a role in the inhibition of tumor growth by amentoflavone in glioblastoma. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","amentoflavone; cyclin D1; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; vasculotropin; X linked inhibitor of apoptosis; amentoflavone; antineoplastic agent; biflavonoid; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; GBM8401 cell line; gene expression; glioblastoma; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; migration inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; reporter gene; signal transduction; treatment duration; tumor invasion; animal; Bagg albino mouse; disease exacerbation; drug effect; genetics; glioblastoma; human; male; MAPK signaling; metabolism; pathology; physiology; phytotherapy; tumor cell culture; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Biflavonoids; Disease Progression; Glioblastoma; Humans; Male; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice, Inbred BALB C; NF-kappa B; Oncogenes; Phytotherapy; Tumor Cells, Cultured"
"Thoracic aortic calcification across the clinical dysglycemic continuum in a large Asian population free of cardiovascular symptoms",2019,"Thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) is tightly linked to pathological atherosclerosis and associated with certain cardiovascular diseases. While diabetes mellitus (DM) is known as a coronary heart disease equivalent, we examined the presence of TAC across the dysglycemic spectrum of diabetes mellitus (DM). We consecutively studied 3003 asymptomatic ethnic Asians underwent annual cardiovacular health survey, and further categorized them into: 1) 1760 normo-glycemic, 2) 968 pre-diabetic, and 3) 274 overt DM based on dysglycemic indices and medical histories. Several TAC parameters were assessed using non-contrast multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), and related to dysglycemic indices or diabetes mellitus status. A remarkably graded increases of adjusted total TAC calcium burden, volume and density were seen across Non-diabetes, Pre-diabetes, and diabetes mellitus categories and positively correlated with all dysglycemic profiles (all p<0.001). Multi-variate logistic and linear regression models demonstrated independent associations between greater TAC density and all dysglycemic indices (Coef: 2.5, 1.4, 6.8 for fasting, postprandial sugar and HbA1c) and diabetes mellitus status (all p<0.05). Furthermore, Receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) showed fasting sugar and postprandial sugar set at 103mg/ dL and 111mg/dL, separately, with HbA1c set at 5.8% all predict the presence of aortic calcification. Dysglycemic status, even without overt diabetes mellitus, were tighly linked to sub-clinical, pathological thoracic aortic calcification. ? 2019 Tsai et al.

"Dual use of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes among adolescents in Taiwan, 2014-2016",2019,"Introduction: We investigated the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) with traditional cigarettes among adolescents during 2014 to 2016 to identify risk factors for using e-cigarettes only, traditional cigarettes only, or both products. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from the Taiwan Global Youth Tobacco Survey, (conducted over a 3-year period by the Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan), which is representative of tobacco use among adolescents aged 12-18 years.The outcome variable was smoking behavior. Dependent variables included gender, grade, monthly income/ allowance, parents' educational level, parents' smoking status, close friends' smoking status, use of other tobacco products, contact with cigarette/e-cigarette advertisements, and access to free cigarettes/e-cigarettes. Multinomial regression identify factors influencing the smoking behaviors of adolescents, as manifested in the use of traditional cigarettes only, e-cigarettes only, e-cigarettes with traditional cigarettes, and nonsmoking. Results: When weighted to the population, the sample included 1 723 150 adolescents in 2014, 1 691 568 adolescents in 2015, and 1 627 216 adolescents in 2016. The rates averaged over three years were as follows: nonsmoking (91.6%), traditional cigarettes only (5.4%), e-cigarettes only (1.5%), and dual usage (1.6%). Among adolescents in Taiwan, the following were risk factors for dual use: male, older, high monthly allowance, smoking parents, smoking friends, use of other tobacco products, contact with cigarette advertisements, and access to free cigarettes. Conclusions: Our results revealed an increase in the number of adolescents using e-cigarettes with traditional cigarettes. We recommend that the government continue smoking cessation programs while maintaining control over advertisements and promotions for tobacco products. Implications:This is the first study to examine the dual use of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes among adolescents in Taiwan. This study identified the risk factors of using traditional cigarettes only, using e-cigarettes only, and the dual use of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes, with nonsmokers used as a reference group. This study examined the relationship between exposure to cigarette promotions and the use of various tobacco products including the dual use of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes, both of which have been disregarded in previous studies. ?

"Prognostic performance of simplified out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and cardiac arrest hospital prognosis (CAHP) scores in an East Asian population: A prospective cohort study",2019,"Aim: The out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and cardiac arrest hospital prognosis (CAHP) scores were developed for early neuroprognostication after OHCA. Calculation of both scores requires estimation of the no-flow interval, which may be imprecise. We aimed to validate simplified OHCA and CAHP scores, which exclude the no-flow interval, in an East Asian cohort. Methods: This was a single-centre prospective observational study. Consecutive OHCA patients were screened between January 2011 and March 2017. Simplified OHCA and CAHP scores (sOHCA, sCAHP) were calculated as the original scores with the no-flow interval omitted. Association between independent variables and outcomes was examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) values were compared by paired DeLong test. Results: A total of 412 patients were included. An inverse association between sOHCA and sCAHP scores and neurological outcome was confirmed, and most of the variables included in the simplified score calculations were also independently associated with neurological outcomes in our cohort. The AUC values for the simplified scores were similar, and both had excellent discriminatory performance for favourable neurologic outcome (AUC = 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.77–0.86 for sOHCA and 0.84 with 95% confidence interval 0.80–0.89 for sCAHP, p-value = 0.19). Conclusion: The simplified OHCA and CAHP scores predicted neurological outcomes in successfully resuscitated East Asian OHCA patients with similar and excellent accuracy. The simplified OHCA and CAHP scores could potentially serve alongside the original scores as risk-adjustment tools for comparison of outcomes between regional OHCA registries worldwide. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; aged; Article; brain function; cardiac arrest hospital prognosis score; cardiovascular disease assessment; cohort analysis; consciousness; East Asian; female; heart rhythm; hospital discharge; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; out of hospital cardiac arrest; out of hospital cardiac arrest score; priority journal; prognostic assessment; prospective study; resuscitation; return of spontaneous circulation; risk factor"
"A new oligonucleotide array for the detection of multidrug and extensively drug-resistance tuberculosis",2019,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a global crisis and a threat to health security. Since conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) takes several weeks, we herein described a molecular assay to rapidly identify multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and reveal transmission associated-mutations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates in 6 to 7 hours. An array was designed with 12 pairs of primers and 60 single nucleotide polymorphisms of 9 genes: rpoB, katG, inhA, ahpC, embB, rpsL, gyrA, rrs and eis. We assessed the performance of the array using 176 clinical MTBC isolates. The results of culture-based DST were used as the gold standard, the GenoType MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl tests were used for parallel comparison, and gene sequencing was performed to resolve the discordance. The sensitivities and specificities of the array are comparable to those of the MTBDRplus test for resistance to isoniazid (INH) (100.0%, 96.7%) and rifampicin (RIF) (99.4%, 96.7%) and of the MTBDRsl test for resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) (100%, 100%) and second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs) (98.3%, 100%). The sensitivities of the array for detecting resistance to ethambutol and streptomycin were 79.3% and 64.9%, respectively. The array has potential as a powerful tool for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The effectiveness of rearfoot medial wedge intervention on balance for athletes with chronic ankle instability",2019,"BACKGROUND: Athletes with chronic ankle instability (CAI) often develop complications such as pain, instability, and reduced postural control and balance stability, all of which affect athletic performance. This study investigated the effects of a 4° medal wedge intervention on static and dynamic balance in athletes with CAI. METHODS: The participants were 24 healthy and 25 CAI athletes. Participants received a 4° medial wedge applied at the rear foot insole and completed the experiment measurements before and after the wedge intervention. The main outcome measures included the area and path length of the center of pressure when participants performed single-leg standing balance in the closed eye condition and the dynamic balance scores of a multiple single-leg hop stabilization test. RESULTS: The single-leg standing balance significantly improved in CAI (P?=?.027) and control groups (P?=?.005) after the medial wedge intervention. The dynamic balance scores significantly decreased from 53.00?±?25.22 to 41.24?±?21 48 (P?=?.015) in CAI group after medial wedge intervention. CONCLUSION: Wearing a 4° medial wedge applied at the rear foot insole improved static and dynamic balance immediately in athletes with CAI. We suggest that clinicians may provide the foot insole to improve balance deficit in athletes having CAI.","ankle; chronic disease; complication; equipment design; female; foot orthosis; heel; human; joint instability; male; sensory dysfunction; sport injury; treatment outcome; young adult; Ankle Joint; Athletic Injuries; Chronic Disease; Equipment Design; Female; Foot Orthoses; Heel; Humans; Joint Instability; Male; Sensation Disorders; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Examining stakeholder perspectives: Process, performance and progress of the age-friendly Taiwan program",2019,"Since Taiwan’s age-friendly city (AFC) program was launched in 2012, the central government has provided various resources to the country’s 22 local authorities, including budgetary support, policy advocacy, and consultation from a team of experts. This study examines stakeholder perspectives on the process, performance, and outcome of the AFC program. A 53-item questionnaire was developed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline, including mechanisms and processes (20 items), outcome evaluations (23 items), and resource integration (10 items). There was a “great difference” found among scores between facilitators and experts for “inter-exchange experience with local and international cities” (40%) and “monitor and revise indicators” (37%) in mechanisms and processes, “evaluate performance of indicators and action plans” (37%) in outcome evaluations, and “interaction between government and community” (46%) and “interaction between civil organization and senior society” (39%) in resource integration. Clearly, facilitators showed overly optimistic assessments in AFC mechanisms and processes, outcome evaluation, and resource integration. The results showed disconnect between experts’ expectations versus actual practice conducted by facilitators. Implications of these findings are to integrate top down expectations with the realities of bottom up practice to design more realistic evaluations; continue to educate stakeholders about design, implementation and evaluation; and further integrate resources from government, civil organizations, and community. ? 2019 by the authors.

The resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type efflux system plays a major role in tigecycline non-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii, but the mechanism in A. nosocomialis remains unknown. Our aim was to analyse the contribution of efflux-based tigecycline resistance in clinical A. nosocomialis isolates collected from multiple medical centres in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 57 A. nosocomialis isolates, including 46 TNAN and 11 tigecycline-susceptible A. nosocomialis (TSAN) isolates, were analysed. Of these, 46 TNAN isolates were clustered to ST410 (43 isolates) and ST68 (three isolates) by multi-locus sequence typing. Results: The relationship between the RND efflux pump and tigecycline resistance was indirectly verified by successfully reducing tigecycline resistance with NMP, an efflux pump inhibitor. The three RND efflux systems (AdeABC, AdeIJK and AdeFGH) were detected in all clinical isolates. The transcript level of adeB gene increased significantly and was correlated with tigecycline resistance. Moreover, the AdeRS two-component system was further classified into four different types of AdeRS patterns considering the amino acid sequence. Further analysis showed that tigecycline resistance was related to the transcript level of adeB gene and the AdeRS pattern. Conclusion: This study showed that the dissemination of TNAN isolates in Taiwan is attributable mainly to the spread of ST410. The AdeABC efflux pump appeared to play an important role in the tigecycline resistance of A. nosocomialis. ? 2018 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","1 (1 naphthylmethyl)piperazine; piperazine derivative; tigecycline; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; carrier protein; tigecycline; Acinetobacter; Acinetobacter nosocomialis; adea gene; adeb gene; adec gene; adef gene; adeg gene; adeh gene; adei gene; adej gene; adek gene; amino acid sequence; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium isolation; cell division; drug potentiation; gene overexpression; multilocus sequence typing; nodulation; nonhuman; priority journal; Taiwan; Acinetobacter; Acinetobacter infection; antibiotic resistance; biosynthesis; drug effect; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; physiology; Acinetobacter; Acinetobacter Infections; Amino Acid Sequence; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Membrane Transport Proteins; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Taiwan; Tigecycline"
"Characteristics of recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmia after catheter ablation in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy",2019,"Background: The reason for recurrence of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) after catheter ablation in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is not clear. Methods: In this study, 91 ARVC patients (age, 47 ± 13 years; 47 men) who underwent catheter ablation for drug-refractory ventricular arrhythmia (VA) were enrolled. The patients were categorized into single or multiple procedures (n = 28). The baseline characteristics and electrophysiological features of the patients were examined to elucidate the reason of the VA recurrences. Results: A total of 186 VAs were induced during the index procedure and 176 (94.6%) were eliminated. Successful, partially successful, and failed ablations were achieved in 89.0%, 8.8%, and 2.2% of the patients, respectively. During a mean follow-up period of 32 ± 26 months, 35 patients had VA recurrences. Forty-two repeat procedures were performed for 81 induced VAs in 28 patients. Of the 42 repeat procedures, successful, partially successful, and failed ablations were achieved in 37, 4, and 1 of the procedures, respectively. Most of the recurrent VAs (70 [72.9%]) originated from the newly-developed circuits owing to the scar progression. The patients with repeat procedure had worsening right ventricular remodeling. The multivariate analysis revealed that history as endurance athlete significantly predicted the need of a repeat procedure in spite of the initially successful endocardial/epicardial ablation and negative inducibility (hazard ratio: 3.014, 95% confidence interval: 1.493-6.084, P = 0.002). Conclusions: In spite of the initial complete VA elimination, history as an athlete was associated with scar progression, RV remodeling, and VA recurrences from the newly developed arrhythmogenic substrates/circuit in ARVC. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; age; Article; athlete; catheter ablation; clinical feature; disease exacerbation; endurance athlete; female; follow up; gender; heart electrophysiology; heart right ventricle dysplasia; heart ventricle remodeling; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; major clinical study; male; patient coding; priority journal; recurrent disease; repeat procedure; treatment outcome"
"A comparison of dose distributions in gross tumor volume between boron neutron capture therapy alone and combined boron neutron capture therapy plus intensity modulation radiation therapy for head and neck cancer",2019,"Nine patients with recurrent head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer received boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in one fraction at the Tsing-Hua Open pool reactor (THOR) utilizing the THORplan treatment planning system (TPS). The aims of the present study were to evaluate the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of 45 Gy in 20 fractions to compensate for the dose heterogeneity in gross tumor volume observed with single-fraction BNCT with mean prescription dose 19 Gy (w), and to evaluate planning quality indices of simulated BNCT+IMRT versus single-fraction BNCT alone. All IMRT plans were generated using the Eclipse TPS which employs the analytical anisotropic algorithm. The conformity index for the gross tumor volume (GTV) was better for the BNCT+IMRT plan than for the BNCT-alone plan (p = 0.003). In addition, the BNCT+IMRT plan provided significantly better homogeneity in the GTV (p = 0.03). The cold spots in inhomogeneous dose distribution in the BNCT plan may be a key factor for H&amp;N cancer recurrence. Our results suggest that single-fraction BNCT combined with compensated multi-fraction IMRT improves treatment homogeneity and conformity than single-fraction BNCT alone, especially for tumor volumes &gt;100 cm 3 , and possibly increases local tumor control. ? 2019 Lee et al.

"Placement of SurgiWrap? adhesion barrier film around the protective loop stoma after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery may reduce the peristomal adhesion severity and facilitate the closure",2019,"Purpose: A temporary loop stoma is often created after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. Peristomal adhesions may make stoma closure into a complicated operation. We demonstrated how to place the SurgiWrap? adhesion barrier film and evaluated the peristomal adhesion severity and feasibility of stoma closure. Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study. Patients were divided into a study group (placement of adhesion barrier film) and a control group (no placement). Patient characteristics, operative data, and severity of adhesions were recorded. We used logistic regression to probe the association between the variables and the adhesion severity. Results: A total of 180 patients were identified with 60 in the study group and 120 in the control group. In the study group, the adhesion severity (p < 0.001), operative time (p = 0.025), and time to flatus (p = 0.042) are significantly reduced. In logistic regression analysis, placement of the film (p < 0.001), neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (p = 0.041), and time interval between stoma creation and closure ≧?12?weeks (p = 0.038) are three significant factors influencing the peristomal adhesion. Conclusion: The placement of SurgiWrap? adhesion barrier film around the loop stoma after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery may reduce the peristomal adhesion severity and facilitate the stoma closure in terms of operative time and time to flatus. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; adult; aged; anastomosis leakage; Article; cancer surgery; case control study; clinical feature; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; feasibility study; female; flatulence; human; information processing; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; operation duration; priority journal; retrospective study; stoma; surgical infection; tissue adhesion; abdominal cavity; colorectal surgery; colorectal tumor; laparoscopy; middle aged; pathology; statistical model; stoma; tissue adhesion; treatment outcome; very elderly; tissue adhesive; Abdominal Cavity; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Colorectal Neoplasms; Colorectal Surgery; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Surgical Stomas; Tissue Adhesions; Tissue Adhesives; Treatment Outcome"
"Clinical efficacy of 60-mg dexlansoprazole and 40-mg esomeprazole after 24 weeks for the on-demand treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease grades A and B: A prospective randomized trial",2019,"Purpose: Research comparing the clinical efficacy of dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole has been limited. This study aims to compare the clinical efficacy of single doses of dexlansoprazole (modified-release 60 mg) and esomeprazole (40 mg) after 24-week follow-up in patients with mild erosive esophagitis. Methods: We enrolled 86 adult GERD subjects, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to two sequence groups defining the order in which they received single doses of dexlansoprazole (n=43) and esomeprazole (n=43) for 8 weeks as initial treatment. Patients displaying complete symptom resolution (CSR) by the end of initial treatment (8 weeks) were switched to on-demand therapy until the end of 24 weeks. Follow-up endoscopy was performed either at the end of 24 weeks or when severe reflux symptoms occurred. Five patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 81 patients (dexlansoprazole, n=41; esomeprazole, n=40) in the per-protocol analysis. Results: The GERDQ scores at 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, 20-, and 24-week posttreatment were less than the baseline score. The CSR, rate of symptom relapse, days to symptom resolution, sustained healing rate of erosive esophagitis, treatment failure rate, and the number of tablets taken in 24 weeks were similar in both groups. The esomeprazole group had more days with reflux symptoms than the dexlansoprazole group (37.3±37.8 vs 53.9±54.2; P=0.008). In the dexlansoprazole group, patients exhibited persistent improvement in the GERDQ score during the on-demand period (week 8 vs week 24; P<0.001) but not in the esomeprazole group (week 8 vs week 24; P=0.846). Conclusions: This study suggests that the symptom relief effect for GERD after 24 weeks was similar for dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole. Dexlansoprazole exhibited fewer days with reflux symptoms in the 24-week study period, with better persistent improvement in the GERDQ score in the on-demand period.

"Anti-invasion and antiangiogenic effects of stellettin B through inhibition of the akt/girdin signaling pathway and VEGF in glioblastoma cells",2019,"Angiogenesis and invasion are highly related with tumor metastatic potential and recurrence prediction in the most aggressive brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). For the first time, this study reveals that marine-sponge-derived stellettin B reduces angiogenesis and invasion. We discovered that stellettin B reduces migration of glioblastoma cells by scratch wound healing assay and invasion via chamber transwell assay. Further, stellettin B downregulates Akt/ Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (Akt/mTOR) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathways, which are essential for invasion and angiogenesis in glioblastoma. This study further demonstrates that stellettin B affects filamentous actin (F-actin) rearrangement by decreasing the cross-linkage of phosphor-Girdin (p-Girdin), which attenuates glioblastoma cell invasion. Moreover, stellettin B blocks the expression and secretion of a major proangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in glioblastoma cells. Stellettin B also reduces angiogenic tubule formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In vivo, we observed that stellettin B decreased blood vesicle formation in developmental zebrafish and suppressed angiogenesis in Matrigel plug transplant assay in mice. Decreased VEGF transcriptional expression was also found in stellettin B–treated zebrafish embryos. Overall, we conclude that stellettin B might be a potential antiangiogenic and anti-invasion agent for future development of therapeutic agents for cancer therapy. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Ethyl pyruvate attenuates ventilation-induced diaphragm dysfunction through high-mobility group box-1 in a murine endotoxaemia model",2019,"Mechanical ventilation (MV) can save the lives of patients with sepsis. However, MV in both animal and human studies has resulted in ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD). Sepsis may promote skeletal muscle atrophy in critically ill patients. Elevated high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) levels are associated with patients requiring long-term MV. Ethyl pyruvate (EP) has been demonstrated to lengthen survival in patients with severe sepsis. We hypothesized that the administration of HMGB1 inhibitor EP or anti-HMGB1 antibody could attenuate sepsis-exacerbated VIDD by repressing HMGB1 signalling. Male C57BL/6 mice with or without endotoxaemia were exposed to MV (10?mL/kg) for 8?hours after administrating either 100?mg/kg of EP or 100?mg/kg of anti-HMGB1 antibody. Mice exposed to MV with endotoxaemia experienced augmented VIDD, as indicated by elevated proteolytic, apoptotic and autophagic parameters. Additionally, disarrayed myofibrils and disrupted mitochondrial ultrastructures, as well as increased HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 protein, oxidative stress, autophagosomes and myonuclear apoptosis were also observed. However, MV suppressed mitochondrial cytochrome C and diaphragm contractility in mice with endotoxaemia (P?<?0.05). These deleterious effects were alleviated by pharmacologic inhibition with EP or anti-HMGB1 antibody (P?<?0.05). Our data suggest that EP attenuates endotoxin-enhanced VIDD by inhibiting HMGB1 signalling pathway. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Genetic variants in the circadian rhythm pathway as indicators of prostate cancer progression",2019,"Background: To determine the association between circadian pathway genetic variants and the risk of prostate cancer progression. Methods: We systematically evaluated 79 germline variants in nine circadian pathway genes in a cohort of 458 patients with localized prostate cancer as the discovery phase. We then replicated the significant findings in another cohort of 324 men with more advanced disease. The association of each variant with prostate cancer progression was evaluated by a log-rank test and Cox regression. Results: A single nucleotide polymorphism of the neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) gene (rs6542993 A>T) was found to be associated with a significantly higher risk of disease progression in both localized (P = 0.001) and advanced (P = 0.039) prostate cancer cases. In silico analysis revealed decreased expression levels of NPAS2 in carriers of the T allele of rs6542993 compared with those carrying the A allele. Consistently, downregulation of NPAS2 expression was associated with more aggressive prostate cancer and poor progression-free survival (log-rank P = 0.002). Conclusions: The NPAS2 rs6542993 polymorphism may be a promising biomarker, and may shed light on the pathways that govern prostate cancer progression. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; advanced cancer; aged; allele; Article; cancer growth; cancer risk; circadian rhythm; cohort analysis; gene; gene expression regulation; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; human; major clinical study; male; NPAS2 gene; progression free survival; prostate cancer; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; survival rate"
"Dapagliflozin prevents NOX- and SGLT2-dependent oxidative stress in lens cells exposed to fructose-induced diabetes mellitus",2019,"Purpose: Cataracts in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are a major cause of blindness in developed and developing countries. This study aims to examine whether the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the increased expression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) influences the cataract development in DM. Methods: Lens epithelial cells (LECs) were isolated during cataract surgery from patients without DM or with DM, but without diabetic retinopathy. In a rat model, fructose (10% fructose, 8 or 12 weeks) with or without dapagliflozin (1.2 mg/day, 2 weeks) treatment did induce DM, as verified by blood pressure and serum parameter measurements. Immunofluorescence stainings and immunoblottings were used to quantify the protein levels. Endogenous O2 - production in the LECs was determined in vivo with dihydroethidium stainings. Results: We investigated that GLUT levels in LECs differed significantly, thus leading to the direct enhancement of RAGE-associated superoxide generation in DM patients with cataracts. Superoxide production was significantly higher in LECs from rats with fructose-induced type 2 DM, whereas treatment with the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin prevented this effect in fructose-fed rats. Protein expression levels of the sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), GLUT1, GLUT5, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form (NADPH) oxidase subunit p67-phox, NOX2/4 and RAGE were upregulated in fructose-fed animals, whereas dapagliflozin treatment reversed these effects. Conclusions: In rats with fructose-induced DM, dapagliflozin downregulates RAGE-induced NADPH oxidase expression in LECs via the inactivation of GLUTs and a reduction in ROS generation. These novel findings suggest that the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin may be a candidate for the pharmacological prevention of cataracts in patients with DM. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Fecal microbiota transplantation: Review and update",2019,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a method to directly change the recipient's gut microbiota to normalize the composition and gain a therapeutic benefit. The history of FMT has been traced back to the 4th century and has been highly regarded since 2013, when the United States Food and Drug Administration approved FMT for treating recurrent and refractory Clostridium difficile infection. Since then, the range of FMT applications extended rapidly and broadly not only in gastrointestinal disorders, but also in extra-gastrointestinal diseases. Donor selection with questionnaire, interview, blood tests, and stool examinations should be strictly performed before FMT to reduce and prevent occurrence of any adverse events. Step-by-step cautious fecal and recipient preparation along with adequately choosing delivery methods based on individual clinical situations are key points of the FMT process. Although current evidence deems FMT as a generally safe therapeutic method with few adverse effects, the long-term outcomes of FMT have not been completely elucidated. Therefore, establishing periodicity and length of regular follow-up after FMT to monitor the clinical efficacy and long-term adverse events are other essential issues. In the future, we will look forward to personalized FMT for different patients and conditions according to varied hosts and diseases. ? 2018","Clostridium difficile infection; donor selection; esophagogastroduodenoscopy; fecal microbiota transplantation; government regulation; history of medicine; human; intestine flora; nonhuman; patient monitoring; patient safety; Review; stool donor; treatment contraindication; Clostridium infection; fecal microbiota transplantation; gastrointestinal disease; Peptoclostridium difficile; practice guideline; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; treatment outcome; trends; Clostridium difficile; Clostridium Infections; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Treatment Outcome"
"Current screening practice in patients under long-term hydroxychloroquine medication in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based cohort study",2019,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an analog of chloroquine, is widely used in various rheumatologic and dermatologic disorders. However, it may cause severe retinopathy with long-term use. The guidelines proposed by the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggested a baseline fundus examination and an annual screening after 5 years by using automated visual fields (VF) plus spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Both multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) can also be used to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to examine if the current HCQ screening practice in Taiwan was sufficient according to the guidelines to prevent severe macular complications.This study could remind every doctor to explain visual side effects thoroughly to every patient using HCQ, and refer patients for the ophthalmologic survey to eliminate potential visual impairment caused by this medicine.This nationwide population-based cohort study included all patients who started taking HCQ (n?=?5826) from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2007, in the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. The ICD codes used for HCQ retinopathy were 362.10, 362.55, 362.89, and 362.9. Patients previously diagnosed these retinal disorders were excluded. Demographic data including sex, age, diagnostic tools used, and the date of the initial diagnosis of the subsequent HCQ-related retinal disorder were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The patients taking HCQ <5 years were defined as group 1, and >5 years as group 2. The risk of developing retinal diseases between these 2 groups was compared with a 2-sample t-test for continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test for discrete variables. Multiple logistic regressions were used for odds ratio calculation.The baseline examination ratio of the automated VF, SD-OCT scans, and multifocal electroretinograms (mfERGs) in the first 3 months were only 0.2% in both groups. The screening ratio of the 3 examination tools after 5 years were 1.1% in group 1 and 1.2% in group 2. 2.5% and 3.9% of patients developed a retinal disorder after HCQ use in group 1 and 2, respectively. The risk of developing retinal disorder was significantly higher in group 2 (relative risk?=?1.53, P?=?.006). The odds ratio (OR) was also significantly higher in group 2 (1.67 with 95% cumulative incidence 1.20-2.30)The examination ratio according to the guidelines was very low in Taiwan. Thus, it is very important for doctors who prescribe HCQ to schedule both baseline and annual ophthalmology screening tests and inform patients of possible severe ocular complications, even in the patient taking HCQ <5 years. It is also important for ophthalmologists to review medical history carefully to find out the causes of retinotoxicity. Medications should be stopped, if possible when toxicity is recognized or strongly suspected.","antirheumatic agent; hydroxychloroquine; adult; aged; electroretinography; female; health survey; human; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; perimetry; procedures; retina disease; risk factor; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; vision test; Adult; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents; Electroretinography; Female; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Retinal Diseases; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Vision Screening; Visual Field Tests"
"Traditional Chinese medicine use is associated with lower end-stage renal disease and mortality rates among patients with diabetic nephropathy: A population-based cohort study",2019,"Background: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that imposes an enormous burden on the healthcare system. Although some studies show that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments confer a protective effect on DN, the long-term impact remains unclear. This study aims to examine end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality rates among TCM users with DN. Methods: A total of 125,490 patients with incident DN patients from 2004 to 2006 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan and followed until 2012. The landmark method was applied to avoid immortal time bias, and propensity score matching was used to select 1:1 baseline characteristics-matched cohort. The Kaplan-Meier method and competing-risk analysis were used to assess mortality and ESRD rates separately. Results: Among all eligible subjects, about 60% of patients were classified as TCM users (65,812 TCM users and 41,482 nonusers). After 1:1 matching, the outcomes of 68,882 patients were analyzed. For the ESRD rate, the 8-year cumulative incidence was 14.5% for TCM users [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.9-15.0] and 16.6% for nonusers (95% CI: 16.0-17.2). For the mortality rate, the 8-year cumulative incidence was 33.8% for TCM users (95% CI: 33.1-34.6) and 49.2% for nonusers (95% CI: 48.5-49.9). After adjusting for confounding covariates, the cause-specific hazard ratio of ESRD was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.84), and the hazard ratio of mortality for TCM users was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.47-0.50). The cumulative incidence of mortality increased rapidly among TCM users with ESRD (56.8, 95% CI: 54.6-59.1) when compared with TCM users without ESRD (30.1, 95% CI: 29.4-30.9). In addition, TCM users who used TCM longer or initiated TCM treatments after being diagnosed with DN were associated with a lower risk of mortality. These results were consistent across sensitivity tests with different definitions of TCM users and inverse probability weighting of subjects. Conclusions: The lower ESRD and mortality rates among patients with incident DN correlates with the use of TCM treatments. Further studies about specific TCM modalities or medications for DN are still needed. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Chinese drug; herbaceous agent; adult; Article; Chinese medicine; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; disease association; end stage renal disease; female; follow up; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; outcome assessment; population research; propensity score; prospective study; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; Taiwan; young adult; Chinese medicine; chronic kidney failure; cross-sectional study; diabetic nephropathy; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; mortality; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetic Nephropathies; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Middle Aged; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in patients with depressive disorders: A nationwide population-based cohort study",2019,"Objective The association between depression and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) remains debated. This study aimed to investigate the risk of BPPV in patients with depressive disorders. Design Longitudinal nationwide cohort study. Setting National health insurance research database in Taiwan. Participants We enrolled 10 297 patients diagnosed with depressive disorders between 2000 and 2009 and compared them to 41 188 selected control patients who had never been diagnosed with depressive disorders (at a 1:4 ratio matched by age, sex and index date) in relation to the risk of developing BPPV. Methods The follow-up period was defined as the time from the initial diagnosis of depressive disorders to the date of BPPV, censoring or 31 December 2009. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate the risk of BPPV by sex, age and comorbidities, with HRs and 95% CIs. Results During the 9-year follow-up period, 44 (0.59 per 1000 person-years) patients with depressive disorders and 99 (0.33 per 1000 person-years) control patients were diagnosed with BPPV. The incidence rate ratio of BPPV among both cohorts calculating from events of BPPV per 1000 person-years of observation time was 1.79 (95% CI 1.23 to 2.58, p=0.002). Following adjustments for age, sex and comorbidities, patients with depressive disorders were 1.55 times more likely to develop BPPV (95% CI 1.08 to 2.23, p=0.019) as compared with control patients. In addition, hyperthyroidism (HR=3.75, 95% CI 1.67-8.42, p=0.001) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (HR=3.47, 95% CI 1.07 to 11.22, p=0.038) were potential risk factors for developing BPPV in patients with depressive disorders. Conclusions Patients with depressive disorders may have an increased risk of developing BPPV, especially those who have hyperthyroidism and SLE. ?

"Secreted amphiregulin promotes vincristine resistance in oral squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of oral cancer. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the overall 5-year survival rate of patients with OSCC has not significantly improved. In addition, the prognosis of patients with advanced-stage OSCC remains poor. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel therapeutic modalities. Vincristine (VCR), a naturally occurring vinca alkaloid, is a classical microtubule-destabilizing agent and is widely used in the treatment of a number of cancers. Despite the proven antitumor benefits of VCR treatment, one of the major reasons for the failure of treatment is drug resistance. Changes in the tumor microenvironment are responsible for cross-Talk between cells, which may facilitate drug resistance in cancers; secreted proteins may promote communication between cancer cells to induce the development of resistance. To identify the secreted proteins involved in VCR resistance, conditioned media was obtained, and an antibody array was conducted to screen a comprehensive secretion profile between VCR-resistant (SAS-VCR) and parental (SAS) OSCC cell lines. The results showed that amphiregulin (AREG) was highly expressed and secreted in SAS-VCR cells. Pretreatment with exogenous recombinant AREG markedly increased drug resistance against VCR in OSCC cells, as assessed by an MTT assay. Colony formation, MTT and western blot assays were performed to investigate the effects of AREG knockdown on VCR sensitivity. The results indicated that AREG expression can regulate VCR resistance in OSCC cells; overexpression of AREG increased VCR resistance in parental cells, whereas AREG knockdown decreased the VCR resistance of resistant cells. In addition, it was also demonstrated that the glycogen synthase kinase-3β pathway may be involved in AREG-induced VCR resistance. These findings may provide rationale to combine VCR with blockade of AREG-related pathways for the effective treatment of OSCC. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"ASB6 Promotes the Stemness Properties and Sustains Metastatic Potential of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells by Attenuating ER Stress",2019,"Up-regulation of ASB6 has been previously associated with late-stage and poor prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. To explore the cellular and molecular basis of how ASB6 enhances the malignancy of OSCC, we employed the clonogenicity and migration assays, murine pulmonary metastasis model, Western blot, and immunofluorescence microscopy to characterize the phenotypes of OSCC cells with lentiviral-based stable overexpression or knockdown of ASB6. We found that ASB6 overexpression increases, whereas ASB6 knockdown decreases, the potential of tumor-sphere formation, colony formation, and expression of Oct-4 and Nanog. While knockdown of ASB6 decreases cell migration in vitro and lung metastasis in mice, the migratory potential was however not promoted by ASB6 overexpression. ASB6 knockdown down-regulates the level of vimentin, and the loss of filopodia formation became more prominent following CRISPR/Cas9-directed knockout of ASB6. Moreover, ASB6 was up-regulated when cells were grown in selective condition featured with a collateral effect of enhancing intracellular stress, and the level of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was further increased by knockdown of ASB6. Thus, ASB6 may attenuate ER stress that would otherwise accumulate and subsequently impede the potential of cells to acquire or sustain the stemness properties and metastatic capacity, thereby enhancing the malignancy of OSCC by increasing the population of cancer stem or stem-like cells.",""
"Factors associated with post-partum smoking relapse in Taiwan: A trial of Smoker's helpline",2019,"Objective: Many women quit smoking during pregnancy resume in postpartum period and difficult to prevent. No studies had focused on their psychosocial response in Taiwan. We analyzed data from a trial of Taiwan Smoker's Helpline (TSH) to determine factors associated with smoking relapse after delivery. Materials and methods: A prospective cohort was conducted at Taipei City Hospital during Sep. 2014 and Nov. 2015 period. We collected data by self-developed questionnaire combining theory of planned behavior (TPB), Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) from 68 women immediately after delivery, 2 months later and followed up until 6 months. Multivariable logistic models for relapse of smoking at the end of 3rd month and 6th month were created. Results: At 6th month, 42.6% participants relapsed with odds lower among first parity (OR = 0.04, 95% CI = <0.01–0.54, p = 0.015), having quitting experience in past (OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.01–0.84, p = 0.019) and higher perceived behavior control (PBC) (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98–1.00, p = 0.035), but greater for those with longer smoking duration in past (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.04–1.58, p = 0.018). Conclusion: Protective and precipitating factors to post-partum's smoking relapse were identified in our study. ? 2019","adult; Article; behavior control; cohort analysis; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence; female; human; maternal age; maternal smoking; prospective study; puerperium; smoking cessation; Taiwan; Theory of Planned Behavior"
"Histogram analysis of prostate cancer on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: A preliminary study emphasizing on zonal difference",2019,"Background This study evaluated the performance of histogram analysis in the time course of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for differentiating cancerous tissues from benign tissues in the prostate. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the histograms of DCE-MRI of 30 patients. Histograms within regions of interest(ROI) in the peripheral zone (PZ) and transitional zone (TZ) were separately analyzed. The maximum difference wash-in slope (MWS) and delay phase slope (DPS) were defined for each voxel. Differences in histogram parameters, namely the mean, standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of variation (CV), kurtosis, skewness, interquartile range (IQR), percentile (P10, P25, P75, P90, and P90P10), Range, and modified full width at half-maximum (mFWHM) between cancerous and benign tissues were assessed. Results In the TZ, CV for ROIs of 7.5 and 10mm was the only significantly different parameter of the MWS (P = 0.034 and P = 0.004, respectively), whereas many parameters of the DPS (mean, skewness, P10, P25, P50, P75 and P90) differed significantly (P = <0.001-0.016 and area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73-0.822). In the PZ, all parameters of the MWS exhibited significant differences, except kurtosis and skewness in the ROI of 7.5mm(P = <0.001-0.017 and AUC = 0.865-0.898). SD, IQR, mFWHM, P90P10 and Range were also significant differences in the DPS (P = 0.001-0.035). Conclusion The histogram analysis of DCE-MRI is a potentially useful approach for differentiating prostate cancer from normal tissues. Different histogram parameters of the MWS and DPS should be applied in the TZ and PZ. Copyright: ? 2019 Lai et al.

"Left ventricular and proximal aorta coupling in magnetic resonance imaging: Aging together?",2019,"Left ventricular and proximal aorta coupling in magnetic resonance imaging: aging together? Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 317: H300 –H307, 2019. First published April 12, 2019; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00694.2018.— The importance of aorta-ventricular coupling in cardiovascular disease is recognized but underestimated. The contribution of the age-related decline in ascending aortic function compared with characteristic impedance and total peripheral resistance on left ventricular function and remodeling is poorly studied. Our aim was to evaluate the relation of proximal aortic distensibility and impedance with left ventricular geometry and function in asymptomatic individuals. We prospectively studied 100 subjects (47 men, 53 women, age: 20 – 84 yr). Aortic strain, distensibility, arch pulse wave velocity, characteristic impedance (Zc), total peripheral resistance, left ventricular (LV) volumes and mass, wall stress, and peak global circumferential myocardial strain and strain rates were determined by MRI. Central pressures were measured from tonometry. Ea/Ev, an index of vascular-ventricular coupling, and LV wall stress were preserved across age-or aortic-stiffness-stratified groups. Static and pulsatile components of aortic load were differentially associated with age. Increased total vascular resistance was associated with decreased LV strain and increased concentric remodeling [ratio of LV mass to end-diastolic volume (M/V ratio)] in all individuals. In younger individuals (&lt;45 yr), aortic distensibility was related to LV strain and concentric remodeling (M/V ratio), whereas Zc was related to LV strain and concentric remodeling (M/V ratio) in older individuals (G45 yr). Early age-related stiffening of the ascending aorta is a component of LV afterload subsequently associated with increased aortic impedance and alterations in LV geometry, namely concentric remodeling, decreased myocardial strain, and increased stroke work such that LV wall stress and arterial-ventricular coupling are preserved. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Local flow and deformation can both be assessed with high precision noninvasively in the ascending aorta using MRI. Combined with central pressure measurement, they provide distensibility and impedance and simultaneous reference assess- ment of left ventricular deformation and geometry, hence a comprehensive evaluation of arterial-ventricular coupling to study physiology and disease. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","adult; aged; aging; aorta; arterial stiffness; Article; ascending aorta; controlled study; female; heart function; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle mass; heart left ventricle volume; heart muscle contractility; human; human experiment; male; myocardial strain; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prospective study; pulse wave; tonometry; vascular resistance; wall stress"
"A prospective, observational study on conversion of clinically isolated syndrome to multiple sclerosis during 4-year period (MS NEO study) in Taiwan",2019,"Importance CIS to MS conversion rates vary depending on population cohorts, initial manifestations, and durations of follow-up. Objective To investigate conversion rate of patients from CIS to MS and the prognostic significance of demographic and clinical variables in Taiwanese population. Design Nationwide, prospective, multi-centric, observational study from November 2008 to November 2014 with 4 years follow-up. Setting Multi-centre setting at 5 institutions in Taiwan. Participants 152 patients having single clinical event potentially suggestive of MS in last 2 years were enrolled as consecutive sample. 33 patients were lost to follow-up and 16 patients did not complete the study.103 patients completed the study. Intervention(s) (for clinical trials) or exposure(s) (for observational studies) Natural progression from first episode of CIS to MS or NMO was observed. Main outcome(s) and measure(s) Variables analysed were ‘proportion of patients converting to MS or NMO after first episode of CIS’, ‘duration between first episode of neurological event and diagnosis of MS’, ‘status of anti-AQP4 IgG’ and ‘length of longest contiguous spinal cord lesion in MS patients’. Association between baseline characteristics and progression to MS from CIS was analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Multivariate time dependent effect of baseline characteristics on progression to MS was plotted. Results 14.5% patients with CIS converted to MS after 1.1 ± 1.0 years with greater predisposition (18.8%) in those having syndromes referable to the cerebral hemispheres. Conversion rate from ON to MS was 9.7%. 90.9% patients had mild disease course. 46.7% patients had abnormal MRIs at baseline, with 0.6±0.5 contrast enhanced lesions. ‘Below normal BMI’ and ‘MRI lesion load ( 4 lesions)’ were identified as risk indicators for the development of MS. Amongst the patients who developed NMO as diagnosed by modern criteria, 80% were positive for anti-AQP4 IgG antibody. Conclusions and relevance ‘Below normal BMI’ and ‘number of demyelinating lesions (4)’ are significant predictors of conversion from CIS to MS. A low conversion rate to MS in Taiwanese CIS patients and majority of them having a mild course and minimal disability suggest the roles of geographic, genetic and ethnic factors. ? 2019 Ro et al.

"A Tangeretin Derivative Inhibits the Growth of Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cells by Epigenetically Restoring p21 Gene Expression and Inhibiting Cancer Stem-like Cell Proliferation",2019,"Prostate cancer ranks the second in incidence and the fifth in mortality cancer in male globally. Citrus polymethoxyflavonoids (PMFs), such as tangeretin (PMF1), have been found to exhibit various biological activities. Here, we evaluated the inhibitory effects and mechanism of synthetic 5,4′-didemethyltangeretin (PMF2) on human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. We found that PMF2 inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells (GI50 14.6?μM) more strongly than PMF1, and it was less cytotoxic against the normal human prostate RWPE-1 cells. PMF2 upregulated Bad and Bax, downregulated Bcl-2, and activated caspase-3 and PARP in the LNCaP cells, thereby inducing apoptosis. PMF2 also suppressed the anchorage-independent growth of the LNCaP cells. It triggered p21 gene expression by demethylation of the p21 promoter region, and inhibited the protein expressions of DNMT 3B and HDACs 1, 2, and 4/5/9 by epigenetic regulations. We further found that PMF2 showed interactions with DNMTs 1, 2, and 3A ex vivo, which might inhibit DNMT activity. Additionally, PMF2 decreased the anchorage-independent growth of isolated LNCaP cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) with high CD166 mRNA expression. These results indicated that PMF2 might inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer cells through different mechanisms, suggesting that PMF2 could be an innovative agent for prostate cancer therapy and prevention. ? 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.","5,4' didemethyltangeretin; activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; caspase 3; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; DNA methyltransferase; DNA methyltransferase 2; DNA methyltransferase 3A; DNA methyltransferase 3B; flavonoid; histone deacetylase 1; histone deacetylase 2; histone deacetylase 4; histone deacetylase 5; histone deacetylase 9; messenger RNA; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein BAD; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; protein p21; tangeretin; unclassified drug; anchorage independent growth; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer prevention; cancer stem cell; cancer therapy; controlled study; DNA demethylation; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug protein binding; drug selectivity; drug structure; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; epigenetics; ex vivo study; gene expression; GI50; human; human cell; in vitro study; LNCaP cell line; proapoptotic activity; promoter region; prostate cancer; protein analysis; protein expression; protein protein interaction; RWPE-1 cell line; upregulation"
"Cancer-coping profile predicts long-term psychological functions and quality of life in cancer survivors",2019,"Purpose: Cancer survivors experience significant psychosocial distress even after completion of cancer treatment. The association between cancer coping and cancer recovery is not well established. The present study investigated the cancer-coping profile and cancer outcomes in breast cancer survivors. Methods: A three-wave longitudinal study was conducted. In 2009 (wave 1), 248 breast cancer survivors completed a package of psychological inventories to evaluate cancer copying style, psychological distress, anxiety and depression, and quality of life. They received follow-up survey in 2012 (wave 2) and 2016 (wave 3). A latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted among participants in wave 1 to identify cancer-coping class. Identified cancer-coping class was used to predict psychological and survival outcomes in waves 2 and 3. Results: Two cancer-coping classes were identified through LPA, namely adaptive cancer coping (class I; 52%) and maladaptive cancer coping (class II; 47.8%). Demographic and clinical factors did not differ significantly between the two classes. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that the cancer-coping style in wave 1 predicted the psychological symptoms and quality of life outcomes at the two follow-ups (waves 2 and 3). Survivors in the adaptive group (class I) exhibited lower cancer distress, anxiety and depression scores, and higher quality of life scores than those in the maladaptive group did. Cancer coping were not found to be significantly associated with cancer survival or recurrence. Conclusions: The identified cancer-coping styles were predictive of the survivors’ psychological symptoms, psychological well-being, and health-related quality of life but not cancer survival or recurrence. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; breast cancer; cancer survival; cancer survivor; coping behavior; depression; distress syndrome; follow up; human; long term care; longitudinal study; major clinical study; maladjustment; priority journal; quality of life; anxiety disorder; breast tumor; cognitive defect; demography; depression; female; mental stress; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; tumor recurrence; very elderly; young adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety Disorders; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Cognition Disorders; Demography; Depressive Disorder; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Quality of Life; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"

"The role of regular liver function monitoring in antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury",2019,"Background: Antituberculosis (TB) drug-induced liver injury (ATLI) is a common adverse effect of anti-TB drugs. Whether regular monitoring of liver function can ameliorate ATLI has been widely debated. The current study aimed to investigate the liver test monitoring status of patients receiving anti-TB treatment in Taiwan, as well as the impact of scheduled liver function monitoring on the risk of ATLI. Methods: Patients who received anti-TB treatment at our hospital between 2009 and 2017 were enrolled for retrospective analysis. Results: A total of 1062 patients were included, and of them 469 (44.2%) received regular liver function monitoring (good monitoring group). ATLI was recognized in 100 (9.4%) patients. The good monitoring group detected more ATLI cases early compared with the poor monitoring group (14.7% vs 5.2%, and 21.4 vs 61.6 days, p < 0.01), with a lower peak serum alanine aminotransferase (276.1 vs 507.1 IU/L, p = 0.05). Conclusion: In the current study, less than half of all patients who received anti-TB drugs had their liver function monitored regularly. Scheduled monitoring of liver function could facilitate the early identification of more ATLI cases, thus leading to less liver injury. The implementation of periodic liver function monitoring tests in patients receiving anti-TB treatment should be re-emphasized and encouraged.

"Immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies: a phase 3, randomised, clinical trial and post-hoc efficacy analysis",2019,"Background: The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) can prevent herpes zoster in older adults and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies receiving immunosuppressive cancer treatments. Methods: In this phase 3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study, done at 77 centres worldwide, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients with haematological malignancies aged 18 years and older to receive two doses of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine or placebo 1–2 months apart during or after immunosuppressive cancer treatments, and stratified participants according to their underlying diseases. The co-primary objectives of the study were the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine compared with placebo from the first vaccination up to 30 days after last vaccination in all participants; evaluation of the proportion of participants with a vaccine response in terms of anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune response to the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; and evaluation of the anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune responses to the vaccine compared with placebo at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We assessed immunogenicity in the per-protocol cohort for immunogenicity and safety in the total vaccinated cohort. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01767467, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, number 2012-003438-18. Findings: Between March 1, 2013, and Sept 10, 2015, we randomly assigned 286 participants to adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine and 283 to placebo. 283 in the vaccine group and 279 in the placebo group were vaccinated. At month 2, 119 (80·4%, 95% CI 73·1–86·5) of 148 participants had a humoral vaccine response to adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine, compared with one (0·8%, 0·0–4·2) of 130 participants in the placebo group, and the adjusted geometric mean anti-glycoprotein E antibody concentration was 23 132·9 mIU/mL (95% CI 16 642·8–32 153·9) in the vaccine group and 777·6 mIU/mL (702·8–860·3) in the placebo group (adjusted geometric mean ratio 29·75, 21·09–41·96; p<0·0001) in all patients, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses persisted above baseline until month 13 in all strata and, as expected, vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo (within 7 days after vaccination pain was reported by 221 [79·5%] of 278 vaccine group participants and 45 [16·4%] of 274 placebo group participants; fatigue was reported by 162 [58·3%] of 278 vaccine group participants and 102 [37·2%] of 274 placebo group participants). Incidences of unsolicited or serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases, disease-related events, and fatal serious adverse events were similar between the groups. Interpretation: The immunocompromised adult population with haematological malignancies is at high risk for herpes zoster. The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine, which is currently licensed in certain countries for adults aged 50 years and older, is likely to benefit this population.

"miR-125b suppresses oral oncogenicity by targeting the anti-oxidative gene PRXL2A",2019,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a globally prevalent malignancy. The molecular mechanisms of this cancer are not well understood and acquire elucidation. Peroxiredoxin like 2A (PRXL2A) has been reported to be an antioxidant protein that protects cells from oxidative stress. Our previous study identified an association between PRXL2A upregulation in OSCC and a worse patient prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in the modulation of biological/pathological properties. The miR-125 family of genes drive pluripotent regulation across a wide variety of cancers. In this study, we identify the oncogenic eligibility of PRXL2A and clarify miR-125b as its upstream regulator. Downregulation of miR-125b can be observed in OSCC tumors. Lower miR-125b expression in tumors results in a worse patient prognosis at the relatively early stage. Reporter assays are able to validate that PRXL2A is a direct target of miR-125b. Exogenous miR-125b expression in OSCC cells results in increased oxidative stress, increased drug sensitivity, and suppressor activity that is paralleled by the knockout of PRXL2A gene. The suppressor activity of miR-125b is able to be rescued by PRXL2A, which suggests the existence of a miR-125b-PRXL2A regulatory axis that is part of OSCC pathogenesis. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) was found to be a downstream effector of the miR-125b-PRXL2A cascade. As a whole, this study has pinpointed novel clues demonstrating that downregulation of miR-125b suppressor underlies upregulation of PRXL2A in OSCC, and this then protects the affected tumor cells from oxidative stress. ? 2019 The Authors","microRNA 125b; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor Nrf2; cisplatin; microRNA; MIRN125 microRNA, human; peroxiredoxin; PRDX2 protein, human; reactive oxygen metabolite; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; carcinogenicity; controlled study; disease association; down regulation; drug sensitivity; gene; gene expression; gene knockout; gene targeting; genetic association; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; PRXL2A gene; upregulation; validation process; Western blotting; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; genetics; metabolism; mouth tumor; pathology; phenotype; receiver operating characteristic; reporter gene; tumor cell line; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cisplatin; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Genes, Reporter; Humans; MicroRNAs; Mouth Neoplasms; Oxidative Stress; Peroxiredoxins; Phenotype; Reactive Oxygen Species; ROC Curve"
"Applying a multiplexed primer extension method on dried blood spots increased the detection of carriers at risk of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in newborn screening program",2019,"Background: Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency might develop acute hemolytic anemia, chronic hemolytic anemia, and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia when exposed to high levels of oxidative stress. Severe hemolysis may occur in not only patients but also female carriers under certain conditions. However, 80%–85% of female carriers were undetected in an existing newborn screening program because of their wide-ranging levels of enzyme activity. Methods: We developed a cost- and time-efficient multiplex SNaPshot assay using dried blood spots. Results: By detecting 21 common mutations in Taiwan and Southeast Asia, the assay could determine 98.2% of the mutant alleles in our cohort of Taiwanese newborns. The 9 undetermined mutant alleles were consequently detected by Sanger sequencing, of which 5 unpublished variations—c.187G > A (Pingtung), c.585G > C (Tainan), c.586A > T (Changhua), c.743G > A (Chiayi), and c.1330G > A (Tainan-2)—were detected. Furthermore, 13% of mild mutations were missed in male infants whose enzyme levels at 6.1–7.0 U/gHb in the newborn screening program when set the cutoff value at 6.0 U/gHb. We therefore suggest increasing the cutoff value and applying the multiplex SNaPshot assay as the second tier for neonatal screening. Conclusions: Our approach could significantly increase the detection rate of male patients and female carriers with a reasonable cost and a reasonable number of clinic referrals. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","allele; Article; cohort analysis; disease carrier; dried blood spot testing; enzyme assay; enzyme blood level; female; gene mutation; genetic variation; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; human; male; multiplex SNaPshot assay; newborn; newborn screening; priority journal; reference value; Sanger sequencing; Southeast Asia; Taiwan; blood; DNA sequence; dried blood spot testing; genetics; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; newborn screening; nucleotide sequence; procedures; risk; time factor; primer DNA; Base Sequence; Cohort Studies; DNA Primers; Dried Blood Spot Testing; Female; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Neonatal Screening; Risk; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time Factors"
"2019 focused update of the guidelines of the Taiwan society of cardiology for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure",2019,"Heart failure is a growing epidemic, especially in Taiwan because of the aging population. The 2016 Taiwan Society of Cardiology - Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (TSOC-HFrEF) registry showed that the guidelinerecommended therapies were prescribed suboptimally both at the time of hospital discharge and during followup. We, therefore, conducted this 2019 focused update of the guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure to reinforce the importance of new diagnostic and therapeuticmodalities of heart failure. The 2019 focused update discusses new diagnostic criteria, pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacological management, and certain co-morbidities of heart failure. Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and If channel inhibitor is introduced as new and recommended medical therapies. Latest criteria of cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, heart transplantation, and ventricular assist device therapy are reviewed in the non-pharmacological management chapter. Co-morbidities in heart failure are discussed including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sleep-disordered breathing.We also explain the adequate use of oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation in heart failure management. A particular chapter for chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity is incorporated in the focused update to emphasize the importance of its recognition and management. Lastly, implications from the TSOC-HFrEF registry and post-acute care of heart failure are discussed to highlight the importance of guideline-directed medical therapy and the benefits of multidisciplinary disease management programs. With guideline recommendations, we hope that the management of heart failure can be improved in our society. ? 2019, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

"Factors associated with access of marital migrants and migrant workers to healthcare in taiwan: A questionnaire survey with quantitative analysis",2019,"In Taiwan, migrants come mostly for marriage and work. Several researchers have conducted health-related studies of marital migrants and migrant workers, but the access of the two groups to healthcare has not been studied. Therefore, our study investigated the factors associated with migrants’ access to healthcare, with the main foci being marital migrants and migrant workers in Taiwan. A structured and cross-sectional questionnaire was anonymously self-administered by migrants recruited to participate in this survey on a voluntary basis from 11 medical centers and 11 migrant-helping associations in Taiwan between May 1st and September 21st, 2018. A total of 753 questionnaires were analyzed. The majority of marital migrants (n = 243) and migrant workers (n = 449) surveyed were enrolled in Taiwan’s National Health Insurance system (92.7 vs. 93.5%, p = 0.68). More of the migrant workers (n = 205) than the marital migrants (n = 42) encountered language barriers while seeking medical services (48.0 vs. 17.1%, p < 0.001). A professional interpreter at the point of care was considered important by more of the migrant workers (n = 316) than the marital migrants (n = 89) (70.2 vs. 39.6%, p < 0.001). Although more than 90% of the surveyed migrants were enrolled in the health insurance system in Taiwan, many, especially among the migrant workers, still faced language barriers while seeking medical services. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection following rituximab treatment in HBsAg-negative, HBcAb-positive rheumatoid arthritis patients: A long-term, real-world observation",2019,"Aim: Longitudinal data of the reactivation of hepatitis B virus (rHBV) and serial serological markers or HBV-DNA has been limited. This study aimed to investigate the temporal course of rHBV development in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients undergoing long-term rituximab therapy. Methods: The occurrence of rHBV was examined in 157 RA patients during rituximab therapy. Serum levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV core antibody (HBcAb), and HBsAb were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, and viral loads by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Results: Among 157 patients undergoing rituximab therapy, 103 (65.6%) were HBsAg-negative and HBcAb-positive. Before rituximab therapy, 20 (19.4%) of these 103 patients were HBsAb-negative, while 83 (80.1%) were HBsAb-positive. Five (20%) HBsAb-negative patients developed rHBV after rituximab therapy. Among 83 HBsAb-positive patients, 4 (4.8%) developed rHBV. Among 9 patients with rHBV, 7 (77.7%) exhibited HBsAg seroreversion. Significant decline of HBsAb titers (mean?±?SD, 296.0?±?417.3?mIU/mL at baseline vs 187.0?±?332.5?mIU/mL after rituximab therapy, P?<?0.001) was observed in HBsAg-/HBsAb?+?patients. All HBsAg-negative patients who developed rHBV during rituximab therapy were characterized by baseline HBsAb titers?<?100?mIU/mL and negative HBsAb at the time of rHBV. HBsAb positivity was an independent protective factor for rHBV (hazards ratio: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.03-0.62, P?=?0.009). Conclusion: Baseline HBsAb positivity was a significant protective factor for rHBV in HBsAg-negative, HBcAb-positive RA patients receiving rituximab therapy. ? 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adalimumab; C reactive protein; corticosteroid; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; entecavir; etanercept; hepatitis B core antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; methotrexate; rheumatoid factor; rituximab; tenofovir; virus DNA; adult; aged; antibody blood level; Article; chronic drug administration; controlled study; DAS28; disease course; electrochemiluminescence; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; hepatitis B; human; immunoassay; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; seroconversion; treatment duration; virus load; virus reactivation"

"Masked pemphigus among pediatric patients with Castleman’s disease",2019,"Aim: Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a mucocutaneous autoimmune disorder accompanied with a neoplasm. Castleman's disease (CD), although rare, is the most common cause of PNP in children. It can be life-threatening when pulmonary involvement occurs. Our study aimed to describe the features of PNP resulting from CD and to find clues for the early diagnosis in pediatric patients. Method: We report the case of a 13-year-old girl who initially presented with oral ulcers and lichen planus, with progression to respiratory failure. A literature review of PNP and CD in children between 1997 and 2016 was performed. The clinical manifestations, pathological findings, treatment, and outcome were analyzed. Results: Thirty-two children were included in our study: 16 boys and 16 girls. Intractable mucocutaneous lesions developed early before CD was diagnosed. The clinical manifestations comprised oral ulcers (100%), polymorphous skin rash (86.7%) and genital (62.5%) erosion. Histopathological findings revealed lymphoplasmacytic cells infiltration (92%), vacuolar interface change (72%), acantholysis (68%), and keratinocytes necrosis (36%). Thirty patients underwent tumor resection. These patients mainly had unicentric CD, with the hyaline-vascular variant dominant. Twenty-six patients (81.2%) exhibited pulmonary involvement. The mortality rate was 70.0%. Among them, 90.5% exhibited pulmonary involvement, and 81.0% died of respiratory failure. Conclusion: Intractable mucocutaneous lesions with a concurrent tumor in children strongly indicate PNP resulting from CD. Because stomatitis or skin erosion may be the first presentation, mucocutaneous tissue biopsy and early detection of the underlying tumor are important. Earlier diagnosis is mandatory for the effective treatment of PNP and pulmonary involvement. ? 2018 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","azathioprine; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; methotrexate; prednisolone; tocilizumab; acantholysis; adolescent; adult; angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia; Article; cancer surgery; case report; cell infiltration; child; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; conjunctiva erosion; death; disease course; early diagnosis; erosion; female; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; infant; keratinocyte; lichen planus; lung transplantation; lymph node biopsy; male; mouth ulcer; mucocutaneous erosion; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; paraneoplastic pemphigus; pediatric patient; photodermatosis; plasmapheresis; priority journal; rash; respiratory failure; school child; skin necrosis; stomatitis; tonoplast; vagina atrophy; Waldenstroem macroglobulinemia; age; angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia; aphthous stomatitis; biopsy; bronchiolitis obliterans; complication; early diagnosis; fluorescent antibody technique; immunology; lichen planus; paraneoplastic syndrome; pemphigus; predictive value; risk factor; treatment outcome; x-ray computed tomography; Adolescent; Age Factors; Biopsy; Bronchiolitis Obliterans; Castleman Disease; Child; Early Diagnosis; Female; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Humans; Lichen Planus; Male; Paraneoplastic Syndromes; Pemphigus; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Stomatitis, Aphthous; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome"
"Exploring bowel dysfunction of patients following colorectal surgery: A cohort study",2019,"Aims and objectives: To examine changes in patients’ bowel function and to compare patients’ outcome among different operation and treatment after rectal resection. Background: Anal-preserving surgery is the trend of treatment of colorectal cancer and bowel function after surgery needs to be concerned. Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: A total of 38 patients with convenience sampling were recruited from a teaching hospital. The low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) score was used to assess bowel function disturbances before discharge and at 1?week, 1?month and 3?months after discharge. We followed the STROBE checklist to ensure rigour in our study. Results: Approximately half of the patients experienced major LARS, including daily stool frequency of more than seven times and stool clustering at least once a week. The LARS scores observed at 1?month after discharge were significantly higher than those observed before discharge. Patients who received intersphincteric resection had higher LARS scores compared with those who received other surgeries. Furthermore, patients who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy, operation (OP) and chemotherapy had the highest LARS scores compared with those who underwent only an OP. Conclusion: The patients experienced varied intestinal dysfunction after surgery based on their treatment plan and surgical method. Nurses should provide individualised health education for these patients. Relevance to clinical practice: A health education booklet is recommended to educate patients about LARS symptoms and the techniques to adapt in their daily lives after surgery. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","abdominal surgery; adult; aged; anal canal; cohort analysis; colorectal surgery; comparative study; defecation; feces incontinence; female; human; male; middle aged; postoperative complication; prospective study; questionnaire; rectum; rectum tumor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anal Canal; Cohort Studies; Colorectal Surgery; Defecation; Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"A case-control study of the association between sialolithiasis and osteoporosis",2019,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between osteoporosis and salivary gland stone using a population-based claims database. Design: A case-control design. Setting: Taiwan. Participants: We retrieved the sample for this case-control study from the Taiwan “Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005.” All 557 patients aged 40?years or older with a diagnosis of sialolithiasis were cases, and 1671 matched controls (without sialolithiasis) were selected. Subjects and Methods: We used the chi-square test to explore differences between cases and controls on socio-demographic characteristics. Furthermore, conditional logistic regressions were used to examine the association of sialolithiasis with previously diagnosed osteoporosis. Results: Of 2228 sampled patients, 171 (7.68%) had ever been previously diagnosed with osteoporosis; 58 (10.41%) among cases and 113 (6.76%) among controls (P?=?0.005). Conditional logistic regression analysis found that the odds ratio (OR) of prior osteoporosis for cases was 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-2.59, P?=?0.002) relative to controls after adjusting for urbanisation and the selected medical co-morbidities. Furthermore, we found that among patients aged ?65?years, the adjusted OR of prior osteoporosis for cases was 1.89 (95% CI?=?1.02-3.51). No significant relationship was observed among patients aged <65?years old. Conclusion: This study demonstrates an association between sialolithiasis and osteoporosis. Although the finding warrants further investigation, the results call for more awareness of the possible concurrence of osteoporosis among physicians and patients with salivary gland stones. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; aged; Article; case control study; chronic kidney failure; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; groups by age; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; osteoporosis; population research; prevalence; priority journal; sialolithiasis; Taiwan; urbanization"
"Incident Co-Morbidities in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Initially with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc Score of 0 (Males) or 1 (Females): Implications for Reassessment of Stroke Risk in Initially 'Low-Risk' Patients",2019,"Background Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are not recommended for 'low-risk' patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated the incidences of new risk factors developing, and the temporal trends in the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score in initially 'low-risk' AF patients. Second, we propose a reasonable timing interval at which stroke risk should be reassessed for such AF patients. Methods We studied 14,606 AF patients who did not receive anti-platelet agents or OACs with a baseline CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 0 (males) or 1 (females). The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores of patients were followed up and updated until the occurrence of ischaemic stroke or mortality or 31 December 2011. The associations between the prescription of warfarin and risk of adverse events once patients' scores changed were analysed. Decile values of durations to incident co-morbidities and from the acquirement of new co-morbidities to ischaemic stroke were studied. Results During a mean follow-up of 4 years, 7,079 (48.5%) patients acquired at least one new stroke risk factor component(s) with annual risks of 6.35% for hypertension, 3.68% for age ? 65 years, 2.77% for heart failure, 1.99% for diabetes mellitus and 0.33% for vascular diseases. The incidence for CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score increments was 12.1%/year. Initiation of warfarin was associated with a lower risk of adverse events (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.530; 95% confidence interval, 0.371-0.755). Among 6,188 patients who acquired new risk factors, 80% would acquire these co-morbidities after 4.2 months of AF diagnosis. The duration from the acquirement of incident co-morbidities to the occurrence of ischaemic stroke was longer than 4.4 months for 90% of the patients. Conclusion The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score increases in approximately 12% of initially 'low-risk' AF patients each year, and the initiation of warfarin once the score changed was associated with a better prognosis. Three to four months may be a reasonable timing interval at which stroke risk should be reassessed so that OACs could be prescribed in a timely manner for stroke prevention. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.","warfarin; anticoagulant agent; adult; Article; atrial fibrillation; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; CHA2DS2-VASc score; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comorbidity assessment; congestive heart failure; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; human; hypertension; ICD-9-CM; incidence; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; outcome assessment; priority journal; quality of life; risk factor; young adult; age; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; comorbidity; methodology; oral drug administration; risk; Taiwan; Administration, Oral; Adult; Age Factors; Anticoagulants; Atrial Fibrillation; Comorbidity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Research Design; Risk; Stroke; Taiwan"
"Planned Short-Course Radiation (scRT) is Superior to Upfront Concurrent Chemoradiation (CCRT) in Treating Metastatic Rectal Cancer",2019,"Background or Purpose: To compare the cost-performance between planned short-course radiation and upfront concurrent chemoradiation on metastatic rectal cancer. Methods: A total of 75 patients with metastatic rectal cancer who underwent planned short-course radiation or upfront concurrent chemoradiation were enrolled. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compute the survival rates. The χ2 test was used to compare baseline characteristics. The Cox proportional hazards model was applied to determine the prognostic influence of clinicopathological factors. Results: The planned short-course radiation is superior to upfront concurrent chemoradiation in overall survival for the patients with metastatic rectal cancer (34.8 vs. 20.2?months, P = 0.010). The planned short-course radiation was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.009, HR (95% CI) = 0.319(0.135–0.752)). The efficacy of radiation on downstaging was similar between planned short-course radiation and upfront concurrent chemoradiation. The total cost of concurrent chemoradiation is 4.52-fold more expensive than that of short-course radiation (340,142 vs. 75,106 NT dollars, respectively). Conclusions: Based on the impressive cost-performance of planned short-course radiation compared with upfront concurrent chemoradiation (better OS, modest downstaging and lower cost), planned short-course radiation should be the preferred radiation approach for managing metastatic rectal cancer. ? 2019, The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.",""
"Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: comparison of patient characteristics and clinical outcomes within Asia and between Asia, Europe and the Americas",2019,"Aims: Nearly 60% of the world's population lives in Asia but little is known about the characteristics and outcomes of Asian patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) compared to other areas of the world. Methods and results: We pooled two, large, global trials, with similar design, in 13 174 patients with HFrEF (patient distribution: China 833, India 1390, Japan 209, Korea 223, Philippines 223, Taiwan 199 and Thailand 95, Western Europe 3521, Eastern Europe 4758, North America 613, and Latin America 1110). Asian patients were younger (55.0–63.9 years) than in Western Europe (67.9 years) and North America (66.6 years). Diuretics and devices were used less, and digoxin used more, in Asia. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use was higher in China (66.3%), the Philippines (64.1%) and Latin America (62.8%) compared to Europe and North America (range 32.8% to 49.6%). The rate of cardiovascular death/heart failure hospitalization was higher in Asia (e.g. Taiwan 17.2, China 14.9 per 100 patient-years) than in Western Europe (10.4) and North America (12.8). However, the adjusted risk of cardiovascular death was higher in many Asian countries than in Western Europe (except Japan) and the risk of heart failure hospitalization was lower in India and in the Philippines than in Western Europe, but significantly higher in China, Japan, and Taiwan. Conclusion: Patient characteristics and outcomes vary between Asia and other regions and between Asian countries. These variations may reflect several factors, including geography, climate and environment, diet and lifestyle, health care systems, genetics and socioeconomic influences. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Association between continuity of care and long-term mortality in Taiwanese first-ever stroke survivors: An 8-year cohort study",2019,"Background Continuity of care is considered to be an important principle of stroke care; however, few analyses of empirically related outcomes have been reported. Objective This study examined the correlation between the continuity of care for outpatients after a stroke event and the survival of stroke patients over the year following hospital discharge. Research design Data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database were used in this study. We defined stroke as the ICD-9-CM codes 430 to 437, and all patients were followed up regarding their survival for at least one year. The modified modified continuity index (MMCI) was used as the indicator of continuity of care. Cox proportional hazard models with robust sandwich variance estimates were employed to analyze the correlation between continuity of care and stroke-related death. Results A total of 9,252 stroke patients were included in the analysis. Those patients who had a high and a completed COC had a higher percentage of survival (97.25% and 95.39%) compared to the other two groups. After controlling for other variables, compared with the low-level continuity of care group, the moderate-level, high-level and completed continuity of care groups still showed a significantly lower risk of death HR (95% CI) were: 0.63 (0.49–0.80), 0.56 (0.40–0.79) and 0.50 (0.39–0.63), respectively. Conclusion Continuity of care may increase the survival among stroke patients and therefore plays an important role in management of stroke after survival. ? 2019 Yang et al.

"Aspirin is associated with low recurrent risk in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients after curative resection",2020,"Background/Purpose: The risk of recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high. Apart from nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy, population-based studies suggest statin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin have chemopreventive effect on recurrence. The role of those drugs on HCC recurrence should be delineated. Methods: Consecutive 430 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients undergoing curative resection of HCC were enrolled. The detailed medical records including the use of statin, NSAID and aspirin were reviewed. All the patients had regular image study surveillance after the surgery. Predictors associated with recurrence were analyzed by Cox's proportional hazards models. Results: There were 58.8% patients in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A, and 37.6% had severe liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Of them, 47 (10.9%) patients had received potential chemoprophylactic agents either at the time of HCC diagnosis or before their HCC recurrence. During a median 50.3 months of follow-up, 54.7% patients experienced recurrence. The median time to recurrence was 15.4 months. In the univariate analysis, aspirin and statins use were significantly associated a low risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.18; p = 0.016, and HR: 0.50; p = 0.031, respectively). After adjusting competing factors, large tumor size, severe liver fibrosis, and high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level were significantly associated with recurrence. Importantly, aspirin use was found to significantly decrease the risk for HCC recurrence with the adjusted HRs of 0.22–0.24 based on the models. Conclusion: Aspirin use may have chemo-preventive effect on recurrence of hepatitis B virus-related HCC after curative resection. ? 2019","acetylsalicylic acid; albumin; alpha fetoprotein; antineoplastic agent; antithrombocytic agent; atorvastatin; bilirubin; fluindostatin; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; ibuprofen; indometacin; ketoprofen; mevinolin; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; piroxicam; pravastatin; rosuvastatin; adult; aged; albumin blood level; Article; bile duct carcinoma; bilirubin blood level; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cerebrovascular accident; coronary artery disease; female; Hepatitis B virus; human; hypertension; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; overall survival; platelet count; prothrombin time; recurrence free survival; recurrent disease; retrospective study; treatment duration; tumor volume; virus load"
"Medical conditions at enrollment do not impact efficacy and safety of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine: a pooled post-hoc analysis of two parallel randomized trials",2019,"In two pivotal efficacy studies (ZOE-50; ZOE-70), the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) demonstrated >90% efficacy against herpes zoster (HZ). Adults aged ?50 or ?70?years (ZOE-50 [NCT01165177]; ZOE-70 [NCT01165229]) were randomized to receive 2 doses of RZV or placebo 2?months apart. Vaccine efficacy and safety were evaluated post-hoc in the pooled (ZOE-50/70) population according to the number and type of selected medical conditions present at enrollment. At enrollment, 82.3% of RZV and 82.7% of placebo recipients reported ?1 of the 15 selected medical conditions. Efficacy against HZ ranged from 84.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 46.4–97.1) in participants with respiratory disorders to 97.0% (95%CI: 82.3–99.9) in those with coronary heart disease. Moreover, efficacy remained >90% irrespective of the number of selected medical conditions reported by a participant. As indicated by the similarity of the point estimates, this post-hoc analysis suggests that RZV efficacy remains high in all selected medical conditions, as well as with increasing number of medical conditions. No safety concern was identified by the type or number of medical conditions present at enrollment. ? 2019, ? 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.

"Two-month breathing-based walking improves anxiety, depression, dyspnoea and quality of life in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A randomised controlled study",2019,"Aims and objectives: To examine the effects of the two-month breathing-based walking intervention and its follow-up on anxiety, depression, dyspnoea and quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Background: Mind–body-related exercises improve bio-psychological symptoms and quality of life in chronic diseases, but these improvements are not proven for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Design: This was a randomised controlled study and applied the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. Methods: Outpatients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were recruited from a medical centre in Taiwan and randomly assigned to two groups. The walking group (n?=?42) received breathing, meditation and walking for two months, and the control group (n?=?42) did not. Data from the outcomes of anxiety, depression, dyspnoea and quality of life were collected at baseline and in Month 1, Month 2 and Month 3. Clinical trial registration was done (ClinicalTrials.gov.: NCT03388489). Findings: The results showed significant changes in anxiety, depression, dyspnoea and quality of life in the walking group across three months, compared to those in the control group and at baseline. Conclusion: This breathing-based walking intervention is promising to achieve bio-psychological well-being for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Relevance to clinical practice: This breathing-based walking, as a mind–body exercise, could serve as an evidence-based nursing care that contributes to improving anxiety, depression, dyspnoea and quality of life in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease outpatients. The feasibility and acceptability of the breathing-based walking were met the requirement of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease outpatients, which could be considered as home-based exercise. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aged; alternative medicine; anxiety; breathing exercise; chronic obstructive lung disease; complication; controlled study; depression; dyspnea; female; human; male; middle aged; nursing; procedures; psychology; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; Taiwan; walking; Aged; Anxiety; Breathing Exercises; Depression; Dyspnea; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mind-Body Therapies; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Quality of Life; Taiwan; Walking"
"4(1H)-quinolone derivatives overcome acquired resistance to anti-microtubule agents by targeting the colchicine site of β-tubulin",2019,"Developing new therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance of cancer cells is an ongoing endeavor. From among 2 million chemicals, we identi?ed ethyl 4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-6-carboxylate (AS1712) as a low-toxicity inhibitor of lung cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. We show that AS1712 is active against broad cancer cell lines and is able to bind in the colchicine-binding pocket of β-tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule assembly and, consequently, inducing mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Our cell-based structure-activity relationship study identified a new lead compound, RJ-LC-15-8, which had a greater anti-proliferative potency for H1975 cells than did AS1712, while maintaining a similar mechanism of action. Notably, AS1712 and RJ-LC-15-8 overcame P-glycoprotein efflux pump and β-tubulin alterations that lead to acquired resistance against microtubule-targeting drugs of cancer cells. AS1712 and RJ-LC-15–8 may be lead compounds that overcome acquired resistance to microtubule-targeting agents of cancer cells. ? 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","4 oxo 2 phenyl 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylic acid; antineoplastic agent; as 1712; beta tubulin; caspase 3; colchicine; cyclin A; cyclin B1; cytochrome c; ethyl 2 (3 fluorophenyl) 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; ethyl 2 (3 hydroxyphenyl) 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; ethyl 2 (3 methoxyphenyl) 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; ethyl 2 (4 bromophenyl) 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; ethyl 2 (4 fluorophenyl) 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; ethyl 2 (4 hydroxyphenyl) 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; ethyl 2 (4 methoxyphenyl) 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; ethyl 4 oxo 2 phenyl 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; ethyl 4 oxo 2 [3 (trifluoromethyl)phenyl] 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; isopropyl 4 oxo 2 phenyl 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; ixabepilone; methyl 4 oxo 2 phenyl 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxylate; n ethyl 4 oxo 2 phenyl 1,4 dihydroquinoline 6 carboxamide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; nocodazole; paclitaxel; quinolone derivative; unclassified drug; vincristine; antineoplastic agent; colchicine; quinolone derivative; tubulin; tubulin modulator; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; binding site; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle M phase; cell cycle progression; cell free system; centrosome; colony forming unit; comparative study; controlled study; crystal structure; high throughput screening; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence test; in vitro study; in vivo study; microtubule assembly; mitosis index; mitosis inhibition; mitosis spindle; molecular docking; mouse; MTS assay; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; protein targeting; quantitative analysis; structure activity relation; surface plasmon resonance; therapeutic index; tubulin polymerization assay; tumor growth; tumor xenograft; TUNEL assay; cell proliferation; chemistry; drug effect; drug resistance; metabolism; neoplasm; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Binding Sites; Cell Proliferation; Colchicine; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Molecular Docking Simulation; Neoplasms; Quinolones; Tubulin; Tubulin Modulators"
"Obliquely-arranged double skin paddles: A novel design to reconstruct extensive head and neck defects with a single fibula or peroneal flap",2019,"Objective: To reconstruct extensive head and neck defects usually necessitates double free flaps, which require a time-and-manpower-consuming surgical procedure. We present using a single fibula or peroneal flap with the novel design of obliquely-arranged double skin paddles to reconstruct an extensive head and neck defect. Methods: From 1998 to 2016, eight patients with the age of 52.25 (35–71) years old had extensive head and neck defects after oral cancer ablation. All of the defects were through and through with the size of 16.25 (12–24) cm × 8.8 (4.5–11) cm. Six of the defects were due to buccal cancer. One was due to tongue cancer, and another one was due to gingiva cancer. All the defects were reconstructed with obliquely-arranged double-paddle free fibula or peroneal flaps. The long axis of the skin paddles was arranged at certain angle (30–45 degrees) to the long axis of lower leg, and the two separate skin paddles were used as the form of island flaps by isolating the cutaneous perforators to create a true chimeric flap. Results: The skin paddle sizes were 14 cm × 3 cm–24 cm × 11 cm and 9.5 cm × 4.5 cm–13 cm × 8 cm. The average length of harvested fibula was 19 (10–30) cm. All of the eight flaps survived without obvious donor site morbidity. One patient had partial skin necrosis over recipient site, requiring surgical debridements and closure. One patient had superficial necrosis over the edge of outer skin paddle, which healed spontaneously. After the follow-up periods of 1 month to 3 year and 8 months, two patients died of sepsis. Six of them could resume soft diet and had no saliva drooling. The remaining two remained nasogastric diet and had saliva drooling. Conclusion: With the design of obliquely-arranged double paddles, we may maximize the harvested skin area of lateral lower leg to reconstruct an extensive head and neck defect with a single free flap. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; aged; Article; cause of death; chimeric flap; clinical article; debridement; donor site; fibula graft; follow up; gingiva tumor; graft recipient; head and neck malformation; head and neck surgery; human; hypersalivation; male; mandible resection; medical history; middle aged; morbidity; mouth cancer; mouth cavity; myocutaneous flap; obliquely arranged double skin paddle; peroneal flap; peroneus muscle; priority journal; sepsis; skin island flap; skin necrosis; soft diet; surgical technique; tongue cancer; wide excision; wound closure; cohort analysis; convalescence; esthetics; female; fibula; free tissue graft; head and neck tumor; mortality; neck dissection; pathology; physiology; procedures; quality of life; reconstructive surgery; retrospective study; risk assessment; skin transplantation; surgery; survival rate; transplantation; treatment outcome; vascularization; wound healing; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Esthetics; Female; Fibula; Free Tissue Flaps; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neck Dissection; Quality of Life; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Skin Transplantation; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; Wound Healing"
"High Circulatory Phosphate Level Is Associated with Cerebral Small-Vessel Diseases",2019,"High phosphate is linked to vascular calcification and endothelial dysfunction; however, its relationship with cerebral small-vessel diseases (CSVDs) is still unknown. Study subjects were prospectively recruited from the community-based I-Lan Longitudinal Aging Study. CSVDs including lacunes, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and cerebral microbleeds were evaluated using 3T magnetic resonance images. Multivariate analyses were performed to study the associations between circulatory phosphate level and the presence of CSVDs. In vitro experiments included human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) studies and western blotting. The present study included 186 subjects (age [mean ± standard deviation, range] 64.7 ± 8.6, 50–86.8?years; 93 men). Multivariate analysis revealed that circulatory phosphate levels > 3.925?mg/dL were associated with severe WMH with an odds ratio of 3.7 (95% confidence interval = 1.3–10.6) independent of age, sex, traditional vascular risk factors, total cholesterol, renal function, or circulatory calcium level. The in vitro study revealed a downregulation of tight junction protein (zona occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-5) expression in HBMECs after 48?h of treatment with high phosphate (2.5/5?mM). We are the first to report a relationship between circulatory phosphate and CSVDs. Our results suggest that high circulatory phosphate level might be a novel risk factor for CSVD, possibly by impairing BBB structures. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","calcium; cholesterol; claudin 5; phosphate; protein ZO1; biological marker; phosphate; adult; aged; Article; blood brain barrier; brain hemorrhage; calcium blood level; capillary endothelial cell; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular disease; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; female; human; human cell; in vitro study; kidney function; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phosphate blood level; priority journal; prospective study; Western blotting; white matter; aging; blood; cell culture; cerebrovascular disease; cohort analysis; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; risk factor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Biomarkers; Cells, Cultured; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Phosphates; Risk Factors"
"Risk factors associated with outcomes of peritoneal dialysis in Taiwan: An analysis using a competing risk model",2019,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one option for renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Maintenance of the PD catheter is an important issue for patient outcomes and quality of life. The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to clarify the risk factors of technique failure and outcomes at a single institute in Taiwan.The study enrolled ESRD patients who had received PD catheters in a tertiary hospital in northern Taiwan. Using a competing risks regression model, we reviewed clinical data and analyzed them in terms of the time to technical failure and clinical outcomes, including PD-related peritonitis and mortality.A total of 514 patients receiving PD between 2001 and 2013 were enrolled in the study. According to the multivariate analysis model, we found that diabetes mellitus was a risk factor for PD-related peritonitis (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-2.04, P=.021). Female gender and higher serum albumin levels were associated with lower risks of technique failure (SHR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48-0.94, P=.02; SHR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96, P=.023, respectively), but Gram-negative and polymicrobial infection increased the technique failure rate (SHR 1.68, 95% CI 1.08-2.61, P=.021; SHR 1.93, 95% CI 1.11-3.36, P=.02, respectively). Female gender was a risk factor associated with overall mortality (SHR 6.4, 95% CI 1.42-28.81, P=.016). Higher weekly urea clearance (Kt/V) and weekly creatinine clearance (WCCr) were associated with a lower risk of mortality (SHR 0.1, 95% CI 0.01-0.89, P=.04; SHR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, P=.004, respectively).Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor contributing to PD-related peritonitis. Male patients and lower serum albumin levels were associated with higher rates of technique failure. Female gender, lower Kt/V, and WCCr are risk factors for overall mortality in PD patients. ? 2019 the Author(s).

"Risk of severe herpes simplex virus infection in systemic lupus erythematosus: Analysis of epidemiology and risk factors analysis in Taiwan",2019,"Objective Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are susceptible to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, which occasionally leads to severe complications including meningoencephalitis and keratitis. However, few attempts to analyse the associated incidence and risk factors have been made. Methods We enrolled patients with SLE recorded between 1997 and 2012 and compared the incidence rate (IR) of severe HSV infection, including meningoencephalitis, septicaemia, ocular and visceral involvement, and other specific complications demanding hospitalisation, with that of a non-SLE cohort. A Cox multivariate proportional hazards model was applied to analyse the risk factors of severe HSV infection in patients with SLE. Results A total of 122 520 subjects (24 504 patients with SLE and 98 016 age-matched and sex-matched non-SLE controls) were included, and a higher IR of severe HSV infection was revealed in the SLE group (IR ratio=3.93, p<0.001). In patients with SLE, previous oral and genital infection (HR=2.29, p=0.049), intravenous steroid pulse therapy (HR=5.32, p<0.001) and daily oral dose of over 7.5 mg of prednisolone (HR=1.59, p=0.024) were independent risk factors for severe HSV infection, whereas age of ?18 (HR=0.45, p=0.029) was a protective factor. Conclusions Patients with SLE are at higher risk of severe HSV infection, and related risk factors include being older than 18 years, having a history of HSV mucocutaneous infection, recent receipt of steroid pulse therapy and a daily oral dose of steroid over 7.5 mg prednisolone. ?

"Longitudinal white matter changes following carbon monoxide poisoning: A 9-month follow-up voxelwise diffusional kurtosis imaging study",2019,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication exhibit progressive WM changes that are not well-understood. The purpose of this study was to detect longitudinal WM changes using voxelwise diffusional kurtosis imaging in patients with CO intoxication from the acute-to-chronic stage after CO intoxication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with CO intoxication and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Diffusional kurtosis imaging was performed on all subjects and was conducted repeatedly in patients at 1 week and 1, 3, and 9 months after CO intoxication. Voxelwise diffusional kurtosis imaging analysis was performed to detect global WM changes in the patients with and without WM lesions. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to compare the performance of diffusional indices in differentiating patients with delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae from patients without them. RESULTS: Invoxelwise analysis, progressiveWM changes were detectedinpatients with WM lesions. In the acute phase, WM injuries were found mainly in the dopaminergic pathways at 1 week, whereas in the chronic stage, WM injuries extended toward subcortical areas from 1 to 9 months. However, no significant WM change was noted in patients without WM lesions during the 9 months after CO intoxication. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that axial kurtosis and mean kurtosis values had better performance than other diffusional indices in differentiating patients with delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae from patients without them at 1 week after CO intoxication. CONCLUSIONS: Voxelwise diffusional kurtosis imaging analysis was helpful to longitudinally investigate WM changes and predict the prognosis of patients after CO intoxication. ? 2019 American Society of Neuroradiology.

"Probabilistic Integrated Human Mixture Risk Assessment of Multiple Metals Through Seafood Consumption",2019,"Inorganic arsenic (iAs), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and methylmercury (MeHg) are toxic metals that cause substantial health concern and are present in various seafood items. This study linked probabilistic risk assessment to the interactive hazard index (HI INT ) approach to assess the human mixture risk posed by the dietary intake of iAs, Cd, Pb, and MeHg from seafood for different age populations, and joint toxic actions and toxic interactions among metals were also considered in the assessment. We found that, in combination, an iAs–Cd–Pb–MeHg mixture synergistically causes neurological toxicity. Furthermore, an iAs–Cd–Pb mixture antagonistically causes renal and hematological effects and additively causes cardiovascular effect. Our results demonstrated that if toxic interactions are not considered, the health risk may be overestimated or underestimated. The 50th percentile HI INT estimates in all age populations for neurological, renal, cardiovascular, and hematological effects were lower than 1; however, the 97.5th percentile HI INT estimates might exceed 1. In particular, toddlers and preschoolers had the highest neurological risk, with 0.16 and 0.19 probabilities, respectively, of neurological HI INT exceeding 1. Saltwater fish consumption was the principal contributor to the health risk. We suggest that regular monitoring of metal levels in seafood, more precise dietary surveys, further toxicological data, and risk–benefit analysis of seafood consumption are warranted to improve the accuracy of human mixture risk assessment and determine optimal consumption. ? 2018 Society for Risk Analysis","Hazards; Health risks; Meats; Mercury compounds; Metals; Mixtures; Neurology; Benefit analysis; Hazard indices; Inorganic arsenic; Metal mixtures; Optimal consumption; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Seafood consumption; Toxic interactions; Risk assessment; cardiovascular disease; dietary intake; food consumption; health risk; heavy metal; index method; integrated approach; probability; public health; risk assessment; toxicity; toxicology; arsenic; cadmium; lead; mercury; metal; methylmercury derivative; adolescent; adult; aged; analysis; animal; child; diet; environmental monitoring; fish; food contamination; human; infant; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; probability; procedures; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; sea food; Taiwan; toxicity; water pollutant; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Arsenic; Cadmium; Child; Child, Preschool; Diet; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Food Contamination; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lead; Mercury; Metals; Methylmercury Compounds; Middle Aged; Probability; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Assessment; Seafood; Taiwan; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Young Adult"

"Graptopetalum paraguayense inhibits liver fibrosis by blocking TGF-β signaling in vivo and in vitro",2019,"Background and Aims: Liver fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, which occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases. Advanced liver fibrosis results in cirrhosis, liver failure, and portal hypertension. Activated hepatic perivascular stellate cells, portal fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts of bone marrow origin have been identified as major collagen-producing cells in the injured liver. These cells are activated by fibrogenic cytokines, such as TGF-β1. The inhibition of TGF-β1 function or synthesis is a major target for the development of antifibrotic therapies. Our previous study showed that the water and ethanol extracts of Graptopetalum paraguayense (GP), a Chinese herbal medicine, can prevent dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in rats. Methods: We used rat hepatic stellate HSC-T6 cells and a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat liver injury model to test the potential mechanism of GP extracts and its fraction, HH-F3. Results: We demonstrated that GP extracts and HH-F3 downregulated the expression levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and inhibited the proliferation and migration via suppression of the TGF-β1 pathway in rat hepatic stellate HSC-T6 cells. Moreover, the HH-F3 fraction decreased hepatic collagen content and reduced plasma AST, ALT, and γ-GT activities in a DEN-induced rat liver injury model, suggesting that GP/HH-F3 has hepatoprotective effects against DEN-induced liver fibrosis. Conclusion: These findings indicate that GP/HH-F3 may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis. The inhibition of TGF-β-mediated fibrogenesis may be a central mechanism by which GP/HH-F3 protects the liver from injury. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Traditional Chinese medicine therapy reduces the risk of total knee replacement in patients with knee osteoarthritis",2019,"Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease occurring in elderly people worldwide. For severe knee osteoarthritis, total knee replacement is the final treatment option. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is popular in Taiwan and has been shown to exert therapeutic effects on knee osteoarthritis. We investigated the long-term clinical effects of TCM for reducing the need for total knee replacement risk in patients with knee osteoarthritis.We used the National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a retrospective study of patients with knee osteoarthritis between 1997 and 2003 in Taiwan. Data from the date of diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis to total knee replacement were assessed using the Cox regression proportional hazards model, and the Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to determine the association between total knee replacement risk and TCM use.A total of 34,231 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who were diagnosed by orthopedic or rehabilitation physicians between 1997 and 2003 were included. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: 26,257 (76.7%) were TCM users and 7974 (23.3%) were TCM non-users. The mean follow-up period was 9.26 years. Multivariate regression demonstrated that using TCM may decrease the need for total knee replacement in patients with knee osteoarthritis (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR]=0.69, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.64-0.77) compared with TCM non-users. A relationship between longer TCM use and reduced total knee replacement use was observed, especially in patients who used TCM for ?120 days (aHR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.42-0.56).The results of this study suggested that TCM is associated with a reduced risk of total knee replacement in patients with knee osteoarthritis, with enhanced benefits from longer durations of TCM use. ? 2019 Oxford University Press.

"Novel SCA19/22-associated KCND3 mutations disrupt human KV4.3 protein biosynthesis and channel gating",2019,"Mutations in the human voltage-gated K+ channel subunit KV4.3-encoding KCND3 gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia types 19 and 22 (SCA19/22). The precise pathophysiology underlying the dominant inheritance pattern of SCA19/22 remains elusive. Using cerebellar ataxia-specific targeted next-generation sequencing technology, we identified two novel KCND3 mutations, c.950 G&gt;A (p.C317Y) and c.1123 C&gt;T (p.P375S) from a cohort with inherited cerebellar ataxias in Taiwan. The patients manifested notable phenotypic heterogeneity that includes cognitive impairment. We employed in vitro heterologous expression systems to inspect the biophysical and biochemical properties of human KV4.3 harboring the two novel mutations, as well as two previously reported but uncharacterized disease-related mutations, c.1013 T&gt;A (p.V338E) and c.1130 C&gt;T (p.T377M). Electrophysiological analyses revealed that all of these SCA19/22-associated KV4.3 mutant channels manifested loss-of-function phenotypes. Protein chemistry and immunofluorescence analyses further demonstrated that these mutants displayed enhanced protein degradation and defective membrane trafficking. By coexpressing KV4.3 wild-type with the disease-related mutants, we provided direct evidence showing that the mutants instigated anomalous protein biosynthesis and channel gating of KV4.3. We propose that the dominant inheritance pattern of SCA19/22 may be explained by the dominant-negative effects of the mutants on protein biosynthesis and voltage-dependent gating of KV4.3 wild-type channel. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cell surface protein; unclassified drug; voltage gated sodium channel beta 4 subunit; voltage gated sodium channel beta 4.3 subunit; adult; aged; animal tissue; Article; cerebellar ataxia; channel gating; dominant inheritance; electrophysiology; exon; female; gene; gene mutation; genetic variability; heterologous expression; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; kcnd3 gene; major clinical study; male; neuropathology; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; protein degradation; protein synthesis; sca19 gene; sca22 gene; sequence homology; young adult"

"Log margin-to-thickness ratio improves disease-specific survival prediction in oral cancer: A single cancer centre database",2019,"Objective: We examined whether dynamic margin criteria margin-to-thickness (MTR) ratio has superior predictive value compared with the resection margin or tumour thickness alone in the survival outcome in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Design: This is a retrospective cohort study. Setting: Oral squamous cell carcinoma patients treated in Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital Cancer Center between January 2006 and December 2013. Participants: A cohort of 302 patients with OSCC who had undergone surgical management. Main Outcomes Measures: Log MTR was calculated for each patient, and survival data were analysed using a multivariable Cox regression model. Discriminative analysis was performed using chi-square, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Harrell's C tests. Results: After assessing for discriminative ability, the linear trend of log MTR surpassed those of resection margin and tumour thickness in chi-square, AIC and Harrell's C tests for the advanced pathologic T (pT) category. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model revealed that log MTR <33% was associated with less favourable 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) (P?=?0.006) in the entire oral cancer study cohort. Other significant factors included perineural invasion (P?=?0.021), pT category, (P?=?0.005), pathologic N category (P?<?0.001) and differentiation category (P?=?0.022). Conclusions: Log MTR?<?33% may be a predictor of less favourable outcome in the DSS of OSCC. Log MTR outperformed both resection margin and tumour thickness alone in terms of discriminative analysis. Our study could help in presurgical planning for high-risk patients and in aiding the decision-making process for adjuvant treatment. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; aged; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer center; cancer specific survival; cancer surgery; clinical decision making; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; general hospital; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; perineural invasion; predictive value; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; retrospective study; surgical margin; treatment outcome; tumor volume; factual database; middle aged; mouth tumor; pathology; predictive value; risk assessment; squamous cell carcinoma; surgical margin; survival analysis; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; Margins of Excision; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Survival Analysis"
"Cross-wire technique for difficult contralateral limb cannulation during endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair for tortuous proximal aortic neck",2019,"In selected cases of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, such as patients with tortuous proximal aortic neck, achieving a successful cannulation can sometimes be difficult. Herein, we described a novel cross-wire technique to help overcome such anatomical variations. During the EVAR procedure among our 5 cases, the main body of the Gore Excluder Stent Graft was deployed through an ipsilateral guidewire. Because of a large angle between the contralateral guidewire and the contralateral short limb of the main body, a successful traditional cannulation was unfeasible. Therefore, the contralateral guidewire was cannulated into the ipsilateral long limb, and the ipsilateral guidewire was cannulated into the contralateral short limb. The contralateral and ipsilateral iliac limb components of the stent graft were deployed through the ipsilateral and contralateral guidewires, respectively. All 5 patients receiving this technique during EVAR of an abdominal aortic aneurysm were free of mortality or any kind of complication at the 1-year follow-up. In conclusion, the cross-wire technique might be safe and effective for EVAR of an abdominal aortic aneurysm when a traditional cannulation is unachievable in selected cases without creating additional percutaneous access or using extra devices. ?

A retrospective cohort study of patients ageing 20 years and older and also newly diagnosed with MG between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008, was conducted from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Observations of all 349 MG patients and 1,396 control individuals were made until a diagnosis of a depressive disorder by a psychiatrist, until death, or until December 31, 2013. A range of comorbidities were found, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, with cerebrovascular disease being reported more frequently in MG patients in comparison with control subjects. After adjustment of patients' sex, age, urbanization, comorbidities, and monthly income, results indicated that MG individuals are 1.94 times more at risk (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-3.27, P = 0.014) of developing depressive disorders than are controls. This showed an increased risk in the development of depressive disorders in people with MG. Thus, depressive symptoms in MG patients should be regularly assessed. ? 2019 Chu, Tseng, Liang, Yeh, Hu, Yang, Tsai and Shen.

"Sinus Venosus Interatrial Communication, Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return, Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm With Left Main Compression: Complex Case With Complex Management",2019,"A young female patient was referred for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Catheterization revealed a large sinus venosus interatrial communication (SVIAC), partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 15 Wood units, and bidirectional shunting. She was then put on target medication for PAH. Two years later, she had angina and underwent computed tomography examination, which showed pulmonary arterial aneurysm compressing the left main coronary. Coronary stenting was performed, which successfully relieved the compression and angina. Meanwhile, PVR lowered to 3.5 Wood units after medical therapy. Surgical correction for SVIAC and PAPVR was done successfully 5 years after diagnosis. ? 2018 Canadian Cardiovascular Society","adult; angina pectoris; Article; case report; clinical article; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; coronary stenting; dyspnea; electrocardiogram; female; follow up; heart catheterization; heart right ventricle; heart right ventricle hypertrophy; human; inferior cava vein; intravascular ultrasound; left coronary artery; left coronary artery compression; lung vascular resistance; lung vein drainage anomaly; multidetector computed tomography; pulmonary artery aneurysm; pulmonary vascular disease; sinus venosus; sinus venosus interatrial communication; superior cava vein; systemic circulation; thorax radiography; vein malformation"
"Drug trends among non-institutionalized Canadians and the impact of data collection changes in the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007 to 2015",2019,"Background There is a global trend of increasing use in prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. This hasn’t been verified in Canada. In addition, there are changes made to the collection method of medication information after the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) cycle 2. This study aims to review the potential impact of the changes in medication data collection and the trends in medication use if data quality remains similar throughout the CHMS cycles 1 to 4. This is fundamental for the analysis of this biomonitoring database. Methods The CHMS cycle 1 to 4 medication and household data were used to study the trends of medication use between 2007 and 2015. The use of prescription or OTC drugs was grouped based on the first levels of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification system. The total numbers of medications were asked in all cycles. However, only a maximum of 15 and 5 drugs could be respectively reported for existing and new prescription or OTC drugs in cycles 1 and 2. There were no restrictions on drug reporting after cycle 2. The trends of medication use were described as ratios, compared to cycle 1. Results The total numbers of the types of medication ever identified decreased from 739 to 603 between cycles 1 and 4. The proportions of using any drugs were from 0.90 to 0.88 between cycles 1 and 4 (ratio = 1.08 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.26). The numbers of drugs in use were from 3.9 to 3.8 (ratio = 1.05 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 0.86 to 1.24). The proportions of prescription drug use were from 0.53 to 0.55 (ratio = 1.13 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.37), while the numbers of prescription were from 1.51 to 1.68 (ratio = 1.20 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.48). The use of diabetes and thyroid medication had trends similar to the respective disease prevalence. The use and the numbers of drugs for blood and blood forming organs significantly increased between cycles 1 and 4 (ratio = 1.56 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.10). Conclusions There is an increasing trend in the use of blood and blood forming agents through cycles 2 to 4 and cardiovascular drugs in cycle 3. For diabetes and thyroid medication, the proportions of medication use increase proportionally with disease prevalence. The changes in the medication information collection method may not have important impact on the reporting of the use of prescription or OTC drugs. ? 2019 Chao et al.

"Spatial patterning, correlates, and inequality in suicide across 432 neighborhoods in Taipei City, Taiwan",2019,"More than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas. Understanding the spatial distribution of suicide in these settings may inform prevention. Previous analyses of the spatial distribution of suicide in cities have largely been conducted in Western nations. We investigated the spatial pattern of suicide and factors associated with its spatial distribution in Taipei City, Taiwan. We estimated smoothed standardized mortality ratios for overall suicide and suicide by sex/age group across 432 neighborhoods (mean population size: 5500) in Taipei City (2004–2010) using Bayesian hierarchical models. A range of area-level characteristics including socioeconomic deprivation, social fragmentation, income inequality, and linking social capital were investigated for their associations with suicide mortality. Overall suicide rates were below average in the city center, whereas above average rates were found in some suburbs. The cartogram highlighted the concentration of suicide burden in one western area of the city. Male suicides demonstrated generally similar spatial patterning across age groups, while the geographic distribution of female suicides differed by age. After adjusting for other variables, two area characteristics were found to be associated with area suicide rates: the proportion of divorced/separated adults (rate ratio [RR] per one standard deviation increase = 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.16), an indicator of social fragmentation; and median household income (RR = 0.80, 0.73–0.86), an indicator of socioeconomic deprivation. There was a 1.8-fold difference in suicide rates between neighborhood quintiles with the lowest and the highest median household income, with middle-aged males showing the largest gradient (3.2-fold difference). The geography of suicide in Taipei City showed spatial patterning and socioeconomic correlates distinct from cities in Western nations. There is a need for future research to better understand the correlates of change in the geographic distribution of suicide throughout the process of urban development. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","pesticide; correlation; geographical distribution; mental health; neighborhood; quality of life; spatial analysis; suicide; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; city; controlled study; divorced person; female; groups by age; health disparity; household income; human; indigenous people; intoxication; male; middle aged; neighborhood; sex difference; sex ratio; social capital; social status; spatial analysis; suburban area; suffocation; suicide; Taiwan; Taipei; Taiwan"
"Features of online hospital appointment systems in Taiwan: A nationwide survey",2019,"Background: In the Internet era, many web-based appointment systems for hospitals have been established to replace traditional systems. Our study aimed to highlight the features of online appointment systems for hospitals in Taiwan, where patients can visit outpatient departments without a referral. Methods: All hospitals online appointment systems were surveyed in October 2018. Features of first-visit registrations were analyzed and stratified according to the hospitals’ accreditation levels. Results: Of the 417 hospitals, 59.7% (249) had public online appointment systems. For first-visit patients, only 199 hospitals offered the option of making appointments online from 7 to 98 (mean 38.9) days prior to the appointment itself. Before appointments, 68 (34.2%) hospitals recommended specialties for patients to choose according to their symptoms, and only 11 (5.5%) had a function for sending messages to doctors. After appointments, 176 (88.4%) provided links to real-time monitoring of outpatient service progress. Conclusions: More than half of the hospitals in Taiwan have public online appointment systems. However, most of these systems simply fulfill the function of registration, and rarely take the opportunity to improve efficiency by gathering information regarding patients’ medical history or reasons for making the appointment. ? 2019 by the authors.

"G-protein coupled estrogen receptor in breast cancer",2019,"The G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), an alternate estrogen receptor (ER) with a structure distinct from the two canonical ERs, being ERα, and ERβ, is expressed in 50% to 60% of breast cancer tissues and has been presumed to be associated with the development of tamoxifen resistance in ERα positive breast cancer. On the other hand, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes 15% to 20% of breast cancers and frequently displays a more aggressive behavior. GPER is prevalent and involved in TNBC and can be a therapeutic target. However, contradictory results exist regarding the function of GPER in breast cancer, proliferative or pro-apoptotic. A better understanding of the GPER, its role in breast cancer, and the interactions with the ER and epidermal growth factor receptor will be beneficial for the disease management and prevention in the future. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Taiwan consensus statement on the management of chronic hepatitis B",2019,"The experts of Taiwan Association for the Study of Liver (TASL) have actively participated and led the guidelines on hepatitis B virus (HBV) management by Asian Pacific Association for the Study of Liver (APASL) which is the first international association for the study of liver to publish the statement on HBV management before. However, there are more and more new data on the natural history and treatment of HBV infection in the past decade. These include new application of an old biomarker (quantitative HBsAg), clinical significance of HBV genotype and naturally occurring mutations, the role of non-invasive examination in evaluating severity of hepatic fibrosis, clinical significance of outcome calculators, new drug or new combination strategies towards more effective therapy and organ transplantation including liver and non-liver transplantation. It is time to publish the guidelines on HBV management of Taiwan. Hence, TASL have conducted an expert meeting to review, to discuss and to debate the relevant literatures, followed by draft the manuscript of HBV management guidelines and recommendations. The guidelines include general management, indications for fibrosis assessment, time to start or stop drug therapy, choice of drug to initiate therapy, when and how to monitor the patients during and after stopping drug therapy. Recommendations on the therapy of patients in special circumstances, including women in childbearing age, patients with antiviral drug resistance, concurrent viral infection, hepatic decompensation, patient receiving immune suppression or chemotherapy and patients in the setting of liver transplantation and hepatocellular carcinoma, are also included. ? 2018","alanine aminotransferase; biological marker; entecavir; hepatitis B core antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; interleukin 28B; peginterferon alpha; tenofovir alafenamide; tenofovir disoproxil; virus DNA; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; entecavir; guanine; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B vaccine; antiviral resistance; Article; cancer chemotherapy; chronic hepatitis B; consensus; decompensated liver cirrhosis; disease severity; genotype; Hepatitis B virus; human; immunosuppressive treatment; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; liver transplantation; mixed infection; non invasive procedure; nonhuman; patient monitoring; practice guideline; pregnancy; Taiwan; treatment response; analogs and derivatives; blood; chronic hepatitis B; complication; disease exacerbation; disease management; drug effect; female; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver tumor; male; medical society; preventive health service; Taiwan; virology; virus load; Antiviral Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Consensus; Disease Management; Disease Progression; Female; Guanine; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; HIV Infections; Humans; Immunization Programs; Interferon-alpha; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Pregnancy; Societies, Medical; Taiwan; Viral Load"
"The impact on outcomes by using thiotepa in tandem transplant for pediatric high-risk embryonal brain tumors",2019,"BACKGROUND: Despite aggressive treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy, the outcome of pediatric high-risk embryonal brain tumors remains poor; especially in young children, in whom early radiotherapy inevitably brings significant long-term morbidities. Single or tandem autologous stem cell transplant has been reported to improve outcomes; but optimal use is not well defined. METHODS: Pediatric patients with high-risk embryonal brain tumors who underwent tandem transplant as consolidation from August 2011 to December 2017 were included. We performed a retrospective chart review and analyzed the outcomes to identify possible prognostic factors. RESULTS: Eleven pediatric patients with high-risk embryonal brain tumors were enrolled. They received double or triple autologous transplant at complete response in 5 patients and at partial response in 6 for a total of 24 transplants. There were five atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, four medulloblastoma, one primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and one pineoblastoma. Median age at diagnosis was 1.8 years (range, 0.6-11.2 years) and at transplant was 2.2 years (range, 1.2-11.9 years). Thiotepa-based regimens were used in 13 cycles of conditioning. All patients achieved successful engraftment. No transplant-related mortality was identified. With a median follow-up of 21.2 months (range, 6.9-51.8 months), seven patients had disease progression. Disease entity and the use of one or more cycles of thiotepa-based regimen during tandem transplant had statistically significant impact on both progression-free survival and overall survival. CONCLUSION: With successful engraftment and manageable toxicity, tandem transplant in pediatric patients with high-risk embryonal brain tumor is feasible and safe. Patients receiving tandem transplant with one or more cycles of thiotepa-based regimen might have better outcome than those without. In combination with salvage radiotherapy, a favorable 2-year overall survival could be achieved in the majority of patients.","antineoplastic agent; thiotepa; autotransplantation; brain tumor; child; female; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; infant; male; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; neoplasm; preschool child; retrospective study; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Brain Neoplasms; Child; Child, Preschool; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Infant; Male; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Retrospective Studies; Thiotepa; Transplantation, Autologous"
"Risk factors and psychological impact of syncope in migraine patients",2019,"Background: Migraine is associated with syncope. We investigated risk factors for syncope and burden of syncope in migraine patients. Methods: Participants were recruited from a headache clinic. All participants provided information on lifestyle, co-morbidity, syncope, headache and suicide, and completed the MIDAS and HADS questionnaires. Genetic data were available for a subset of participants. Risk of syncope in relation to participant’s characteristics and migraine susceptibility loci, and risks of psychological disorders associated with syncope, were calculated using logistic regression. Results: Underweight, regular tea intake, diabetes mellitus, and migraine with aura were associated with increased syncope risks, with adjusted ORs of 1.76 (95% CI 1.03–3.03), 1.84 (95% CI 1.22–2.79), 4.70 (95% CI 1.58–13.95), and 1.78 (95% CI 1.03–3.10), respectively. Preliminary results showed that rs11172113 in LRP1 was associated with syncope risks. Comorbid syncope in migraine patients was associated with increased risks of depression (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.18–3.22) and suicide attempt (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.48–5.48). Conclusion: Our study showed the potential roles of vascular risk factors in the association between migraine and syncope. Modifiable risk factors for syncope in patients with migraine include body mass index and tea intake. The debilitating psychological impact of co-morbid syncope in migraine patients warrants clinical attention of treating physicians. ?

"Tracheal sounds accurately detect apnea in patients recovering from anesthesia",2019,"Apnea should be monitored continuously in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) to avoid serious complications. It has been confirmed that tracheal sounds can be used to detect apnea during sedation in healthy subjects, but the performance of this acoustic method has not been evaluated in patients with frequent apnea events in the PACU. Tracheal sounds were acquired from the patients in the PACU using a microphone encased in a plastic bell. Concurrently, a processed nasal pressure signal was used as a reference standard to identify real respiratory events. The logarithm of the tracheal sound variance (log-var) was used to detect apnea, and the results were compared to the reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios (PLR), and negative likelihood ratios (NLR) were calculated. One hundred and twenty-one patients aged 55.5 ± 13.2?years (mean ± SD) with a body mass index of 24.6 ± 3.7?kg/m 2 were included in data analysis. The total monitoring time was 52.6?h. Thirty-four patients experienced 236 events of apnea lasting for a total of 122.2?min. The log-var apnea detection algorithm detected apnea with 92% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 46 PLR and 0.08 NLR. The performance of apnea detection in the PACU using the log-var tracheal sounds method proved to be reliable and accurate. Tracheal sounds could be used to minimize the potential risks from apnea in PACU patients. ? 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Anesthesiology; Value engineering; Acoustic monitoring; Apnea detection; Healthy subjects; Likelihood ratios; Potential risks; Reference method; Reference standard; Tracheal sound; Patient rehabilitation; adult; algorithm; anesthetic recovery; apnea; Article; body mass; diagnostic test accuracy study; exhalation; female; heart beat; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nose breathing; priority journal; respiratory tract parameters; sensitivity and specificity; sleep disordered breathing; tidal volume; trachea; tracheal sound; abnormal respiratory sound; acoustics; aged; anesthesia; anesthesiology; anesthetic recovery; apnea; auscultation; breathing; breathing rate; pathophysiology; polysomnography; reproducibility; signal processing; trachea; Acoustics; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Anesthesia; Anesthesia Recovery Period; Anesthesiology; Apnea; Auscultation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Reproducibility of Results; Respiration; Respiratory Rate; Respiratory Sounds; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Trachea"
"Effects of physical activity counselling in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: A randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Low physical activity is common in systemic lupus erythematosus populations. Aim: To evaluate the effect of physical activity counselling on physical activity and the association between physical activity changes and changes in fatigue, quality of sleep, and quality of life in women with systemic lupus erythematosus. Methods: A randomized, controlled, single-blind trial was conducted from March 2015 to August 2016. Seventy-six women with systemic lupus erythematosus were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. The intervention group received three sessions of physical activity counselling at 1, 4, and 8?weeks and three telephone follow-ups over 13?weeks. Outcome measures, which include daily steps, fatigue, quality of sleep, and the quality of life, were collected at baseline and 8 and 12?weeks. Results: The study showed that daily steps, quality of sleep, and vitality in the intervention group were significantly improved compared with those in the control group at weeks 8 and 12. Mental health was significantly improved only at week 8 in the counselling group. A positive correlation between physical activity changes and changes in vitality and mental health was observed. Conclusions: Physical activity counselling can improve physical activity. As physical activity increases, systemic lupus erythematosus women feel more energetic and happier. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",""
"Elafibranor inhibits chronic kidney disease progression in NASH mice",2019,"Identification of new pharmacological approaches to inhibit the excessive fat intake-induced steatohepatitis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is important. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatohepatitis and CKD share common pathogenesis involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and-δ. Elafibranor, a dual PPARα/δ agonist, can ameliorate the HFD-induced steatohepatitis. Nonetheless, the effects of HFD-induced CKD had not yet explored. This study investigated the effects of elafibranor (elaf) on the progression of HFD-induced CKD in mice. In vivo and in vitro renal effects were evaluated in HFD-elaf mice receiving 12 weeks of elafibranor (from 13th to 24th week of HFD feeding) treatment. In elafibranor-treated HFD mice, increased insulin sensitivity, reduced obesity and body fat mass, decreased severity of steatohepatitis, increased renal expression of PPARα, PPARδ, SIRT1, and autophagy (Beclin-1 and LC3-II) as well as glomerular/renal tubular barrier markers [synaptopodin (podocyte marker), zona occludin-1, and cubulin], reduced renal oxidative stress and caspase-3, and less urinary 8-isoprostanes excretion were observed. Aforementioned benefits of elafibranor were associated with low renal tubular injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis scores, less albuminuria, low urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and preserved glomerular filtration rate. Acute incubation of podocytes and HK-2 cells with elafibranor or recombinant SIRT1 reversed the HFD-sera-induced oxidative stress, autophagy dysfunction, cell apoptosis, barrier marker loss, albumin endocytosis, and reuptake reduction. Besides hepatoprotective and metabolic beneficial effects, current study showed that elafibranor inhibited the progression of HFD-induced CKD through activation of renal PPARα, PPARδ, SIRT1, autophagy, reduction of oxidative stress, and apoptosis in mice with steatohepatitis. ? 2019 Hung-Cheng Tsai et al.","8 isoprostane; alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; beclin 1; caspase 3; caspase 7; creatinine; cubulin; elafibranor; insulin; interleukin 6; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; protein; protein ZO1; sirtuin 1; synaptopodin; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; 2-(2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-3-oxo-1-propenyl)phenoxyl)-2-methylpropanoic acid; beclin 1; chalcone derivative; enzyme inhibitor; MAP1LC3 protein, mouse; microtubule associated protein; Ppara protein, mouse; propionic acid derivative; Sirt1 protein, mouse; sirtuin 1; albuminuria; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; body fat; body weight change; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; controlled study; disease exacerbation; disease severity; endocytosis; fat mass; food intake; glomerulus filtration rate; high-fat diet-induced steatohepatitis; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; in vitro study; in vivo study; insulin sensitivity; kidney mass; male; membrane structure; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; podocyte; protein expression; triacylglycerol level; adverse event; animal; chronic kidney failure; disease model; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; kidney; lipid diet; pathology; Animals; Apoptosis; Beclin-1; Chalcones; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Enzyme Inhibitors; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Kidney; Mice; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Oxidative Stress; Podocytes; PPAR alpha; PPAR delta; Propionates; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Sirtuin 1"
"Deltex1 suppresses T cell function and is a biomarker for diagnosis and disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus",2019,"Objective. Deletion of Deltex1 (DTX1) in mice caused hyperactivation of T cells and lupus-like autoimmune syndromes, however, the association of DTX1 with human autoimmune diseases is totally unknown. This study investigated the role of DTX1 in human T cell functions and its correlation with disease activity in patients with SLE. Methods. The influence of DTX1 on T cell function was evaluated using human primary cells. DTX1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls and SLE patients was measured by quantitative realtime PCR and the SLEDAI was used to assess disease activity. Results. After stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, silencing of DTX1 expression enhanced IFN-g secretion by human T cells. The expression of DTX1 in PBMCs was significantly lower in 100 SLE patients than in 50 age-and sexmatched healthy controls (DTX1/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.452 vs 1.269, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of the model was 0.737 (95% CI 0.658, 0.815). Intriguingly, a low DTX1 level in T cells led to high IFN-g production in SLE patients and had a correlation with severe disease activity. In addition, low DTX1 expression in SLE patients was associated with active LN, lung involvement or hypocomplementaemia. Conclusion. Knockdown DTX1 expression in human T cells reduced IFN-g secretion. DTX1 expression in the PBMCs was significantly lower in SLE patients and had an inverse correlation with disease activity, indicating that the DTX1 level may be a good disease marker of SLE. ? 2018 The Author(s).","antibody; cd28 antibody; CD3 antibody; deltex1 protein; gamma interferon; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; interleukin 2; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; adult; age; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cytokine production; disease activity; disease marker; female; gene silencing; human; human cell; lymphocyte function; major clinical study; male; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; sex; SLEDAI; systemic lupus erythematosus; T lymphocyte"
"Effectiveness and Safety of Four Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Asian Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation",2019,"Background: Whether four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are superior to warfarin in Asian patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) remains unclear. Methods: This nationwide retrospective cohort study was based on data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from June 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, covering patients with NVAF taking edoxaban (n = 4,577), apixaban (n = 9,952), rivaroxaban (n = 33,022), dabigatran (n = 22,371), and warfarin (n = 19,761). Propensity score weighting was used to balance covariates across study groups. Patients were followed up until occurrence of study outcomes or end date of study. Results: Edoxaban, apixaban, and rivaroxaban were associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism than warfarin. All DOACs had a lower risk of major bleeding than warfarin. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding than rivaroxaban and dabigatran, whereas the risk of major bleeding was comparable between edoxaban and apixaban. The reduced risks of thromboembolism/major bleeding for the four DOACs persisted in high-risk subgroups, including those with chronic kidney disease, elderly patients (age ? 75 years), secondary stroke prevention, or CHA2DS2-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ? 75 years, diabetes mellitus, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, and female sex) ? 4. A total of 2,924 (64%), 6,359 (64%), 31,108 (94%), and 19,821 (89%) patients received low-dose edoxaban (15-30 mg/d), apixaban (2.5 mg bid), rivaroxaban (10-15 mg/d), and dabigatran (110 mg bid), respectively. The effectiveness/safety outcomes with the four low-dose DOACs compared with warfarin were consistent with the main analysis. Conclusions: In the largest real-world practice study among Asian patients with NVAF, four DOACs were associated with a comparable or lower risk of thromboembolism, and a lower risk of bleeding than warfarin. There was consistency even among high-risk subgroups and whether standard-or low-dose regimens were compared. ? 2019 American College of Chest Physicians","anticoagulant agent; apixaban; dabigatran; edoxaban; rivaroxaban; warfarin; acute heart infarction; age distribution; aged; aging; Article; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; congestive heart failure; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; drug safety; embolism; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; human; hypertension; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; priority journal; propensity score; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk reduction; Taiwan; thromboembolism"

These Campylobacter species isolates were confirmed to the species level using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (all isolates) and multiplex PCR analysis (for C. fetus only). The performance of identification for Campylobacter species by the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS was evaluated. The genetic relatedness of C. fetus isolates was analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: The leading underlying medical conditions of these patients were malignancy (46.4%), hypertension (35.7%), and liver cirrhosis (23.2%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 5.4%. Using 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, 26 isolates of C. coli, 11 of C. jejuni, and 19 of C. fetus, including 15 C. fetus subsp. fetus and five C. fetus subsp. venerealis, were identified. Among the five C. fetus subsp. venerealis isolates recognized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, only two isolates were C. fetus subsp. venerealis by multiplex PCR method. The Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS failed to correctly identify C. fetus subsp. venerealis isolates. MLST analysis of C. fetus isolates revealed three STs: ST20 (n = 12), ST11 (n = 5), and ST57 (n = 2), which were compatible with three major PFGE clusters. Conclusion: Database expansion of MALDI-TOF MS for the correct identification of C. fetus to subspecies levels is needed. A novel clone of ST57-PFGE Cluster C of C. fetus subsp. venerealis was noted. ? 2017","RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; accuracy; adult; Article; bacteremia; bacterium identification; Campylobacter; Campylobacter fetus; Campylobacter venerealis; female; genotype; human; hypertension; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; malignant neoplasm; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; microbiological examination; middle aged; mortality rate; multilocus sequence typing; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; phenotype; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; retrospective study; RNA sequence; adolescent; aged; bacteremia; Campylobacter; campylobacteriosis; child; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; male; microbiology; mortality; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bacteremia; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Campylobacter; Campylobacter fetus; Campylobacter Infections; Child; DNA, Bacterial; Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Young Adult"
"E-cigarette use in a country with prevalent tobacco smoking: A population-based study in Taiwan",2019,"Background: The different profiles of e-cigarette users in different age groups have seldom been investigated, particularly in populations facing a high prevalence of cigarette smoking. This study aims to examine the prevalence and correlates of e-cigarette use separately for adolescents and adults in nationally representative samples in Taiwan. Methods: Among 17,837 participants in the 2014 National Survey of Substance Use in Taiwan, 4445 were aged 12 to 17 years and 13,392 were aged 18 to 64 years. Individuals’ lifetime tobacco use was divided into four groups: non-use, exclusive e-cigarette use, exclusive cigarette use, and dual use. Questions on sociodemographic features, use and problematic use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, and psychosocial distress, among others, were administered using a computer-assisted selfinterview on tablet computers. Results: Among lifetime users of e-cigarette (2.2% for adults and 0.8% for adolescents), 4.5% for adults and 36.6% for adolescents were exclusive e-cigarette users. From use of exclusive e-cigarettes to use of exclusive cigarettes to dual use, those usage groups were related to an increasing trend of adjusted odds ratios for use of other psychoactive substances, particularly problematic use of alcohol or drugs, and with more depressive symptoms. Two correlates were specific to e-cigarette use: alcohol use had stronger relationships with e-cigarette use among adolescents, and younger adults (18-34) were more likely to try e-cigarettes compared to older adults. Conclusions: These results provide essential information regarding e-cigarette use in the general population, and future prevention strategies should account for its specific correlates in young people. ? 2018 Yi-Lung Chen et al.","adolescent; adult; age distribution; child; cross-sectional study; electronic cigarette; epidemiology; female; health survey; human; male; middle aged; prevalence; smoking; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Taiwan; Tobacco Smoking; Young Adult"
"Mechanistic Insight Into the Activation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome by Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Macrophages",2019,"Gonorrhea is a type III legal communicable disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), one of the most common sexually transmitted bacteria worldwide. NG infection can cause urethritis or systemic inflammation and may lead to infertility or other complications. The NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a protein complex composed of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein and caspase-1 and is an important part of the cellular machinery controlling the release of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 and the pathogenesis of numerous infectious diseases. It has been reported that NG infection activates the NLRP3 inflammasome; however, the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this report, the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of NG-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages were studied. The results indicated that viable NG, but not heat-killed or freeze/thaw-killed NG, activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages through toll-like receptor 2, but not toll-like receptor 4. NG infection provided the priming signal to the NLRP3 inflammasome that induced the expression of NLRP3 and IL-1β precursor through the nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In addition, NG infection provided the activation signal to the NLRP3 inflammasome that activated caspase-1 through P2X7 receptor-dependent potassium efflux, lysosomal acidification, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactive oxygen species production pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NLRP3 knockout increased phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages and increases the bactericidal activity of macrophages against NG. These findings provide potential molecular targets for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs that could ameliorate NG-mediated inflammation.",""
"ECE-1 overexpression in head and neck cancer is associated with poor tumor differentiation and patient outcome",2019,"Background: Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) primarily converts big endothelins (ETs) into active endothelin-1 (ET-1). However, the expression pattern and prognostication status of ECE-1 in head and neck cancer (HNC) are enigmatic. In this study, we investigated ECE-1 expression and assessed the roles of ECE-1 as a predictor for HNC differentiation and prognosis. Materials and Methods: ECE-1 expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis using a tissue microarray (TMA) composed of 100 cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The correlation of ECE-1 expression with clinicopathologic variables and patient outcomes was analyzed. Results: ECE-1 may be overexpressed in HNC carcinoma cells. Higher ECE-1 level was detected more frequently in moderately to poorly differentiated tumors and showed a lower differentiation category compared to the G1 cases (p?=?0.015); this finding was further confirmed by an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 4.071 (p?=?0.042). Moreover, Kaplan–Meier survival analyses showed that a higher ECE-1 expression was associated with a poorer survival in patients with HNC (p?<?0.0001). On multivariate Cox proportional hazards models analysis, ECE-1 of high expression proved to be an independent prognostic factor with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.985 (p?<?0.001). Conclusion: Our data provide the first evidence that overexpression of ECE-1 in HNC is a predictor of poor tumor differentiation and prognosis. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Age, period and birth cohort effects on the prevalence of overweight and obesity among Taiwanese adolescents: A national population-based study",2019,"Background The age-period-cohort effects on youth overweight and obesity among junior and senior high school students in Taiwan is not clear. Methods We utilized the 2006-14 nationally representative School Physical Fitness Dataset. Based on the International Obesity Task Force cutoff criteria, a log-linear age-period-cohort analysis was performed to determine the influence of age, period and cohort on the trend in being overweight, obese and severely obese for both sexes. Results The final dataset included 1073173 individuals (n = 520 382 boys and 552 791 girls). For girls, the prevalence of overweight and obesity declined with age, and the prevalence of overweight declined over time. For boys, the prevalence of overweight and obesity declined with age and over time from 2006 to 2014. The prevalence of severe obesity declined over time and increased with age for the boys. The younger birth cohorts had greater odds of being overweight, obese and severely obese than the older birth cohorts. Conclusions After differentiating the age-period-cohort effects, the data suggested a decreasing temporal trend in overweight and obesity among adolescents in Taiwan from 2006 to 2014. Among the birth cohorts of the 1990s, the younger cohorts had greater odds of being overweight and obese than the older cohorts when they reached adolescence. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Serum pepsinogen as a predictor for gastric cancer death A 16-year community-based cohort study",2019,"Goals: The purpose of this article is to validate the long-term association between initial serum pepsinogen (PG) measurements and subsequent gastric cancer-specific deaths from a long-term longitudinal cohort. Background: Endoscopic surveillance can be effective and efficient in reducing gastric cancer mortality if a biomarker such as serum PG is available to identify high-risk individuals and if the biomarker also is specific to gastric cancer risk. Study: Between 1995 and 1998, a gastric cancer-screening program was conducted in a high-risk population: The first stage involved PG testing, and the second stage involved upper endoscopy. The outcome was gastric cancer death, which was monitored until December 31, 2010; results were expressed as the hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Other causes of death were used as comparators. Results: Among participants (n=3514) aged ?30 years, 1682 (47.9%) were screened to determine serum PG levels. After 16 years of followup, 14 deaths from gastric cancer were documented. Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, and Helicobacter pylori serological positivity showed that PG-I <30 μg/L and PG-I <30 μg/L or PG-I/II ratio <3 were significantly associated with the risk of gastric cancer death (HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.11-9.61 and HR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.18-10.12, respectively). In contrast, there were no significant associations between PG and other causes of death, including neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Conclusion: This long-term cohort study shows the usefulness of PG measurement as a biomarker that is specific to the risk of gastric cancer death.

"Integrating traditional Chinese medicine healthcare into dementia care plan by reducing the need for special nursing care and medical expenses",2019,"Reducing the need for advanced nursing care and medical expenses is an essential concern of dementia care. We investigated the impact of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on advanced nursing care and medical costs.We used Longitudinal Health Insurance Database to implement a cohort study of patients with dementia between 1997 and 2012 in Taiwan. Data from the onset of dementia to 1st advanced nursing care for the endotracheal tube, urinal indwelling catheterization, and nasogastric tube were assessed using Cox regression proportional hazards model, and independent t test was used to determine the difference of hospitalization costs and days. We also used ANOVA test to compare the hospital cost, hospital stay, and numbers according to different duration of TCM.We assessed 9438 new diagnosed patients with dementia without advanced nursing care were categorized into 2 groups: 4094 (43.4%) TCM users, and 5344 (56.6%) non-TCM users. In the TCM groups, 894 (21.8%) patients were declared as advanced nursing care, while 1683 (31.5%) patients were in non-TCM group. Cox proportional hazard regression indicated that using TCM may decrease the need for advanced nursing care (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=0.61, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.56-0.66) compared to non-TCM. The TCM users have lower hospitalization costs and hospitalization time compared to non-TCM users.Integrating TCM healthcare into dementia care was found to be associated with a lower need for advanced nursing care, hospitalization costs, and admission time with more benefits from longer durations of TCM use.

"Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of outpatient follow-up frequency in relation to three-year mortality in discharged patients with bipolar disorder",2019,"There is a lack of clarity in terms of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility comparisons across different outpatient (OPD) follow-up patterns in discharged patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In this study, adult patients hospitalised for BD treatment (n = 1,591) were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. With survival as the effectiveness measure and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the utility measure, a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis was conducted over the 3-year follow-up period by post-discharge frequency of OPD visits. Compared to those making 1–7, 8–12 and 18 or more OPD visits, BD patients making 13–17 OPD visits within the first year after discharge had the lowest psychiatric and total healthcare costs over the follow-up period. With survival status as the effectiveness outcome, making 13–17 OPD visits was more likely to be the cost-effective option, as revealed by incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Cost-utility analysis demonstrated that having 13–17 OPD visits was probably the more cost-effective option when considering QALYs; for instance, if society was willing to pay NTD1.5 million for one additional QALY, there was a 75.2% (psychiatric costs) to 77.4% (total costs) likelihood that 13–17 OPD visits was the most cost-effective option. In conclusion, post-discharge OPD appointments with a frequency of 13–17 visits within the first year were associated with lower psychiatric and total healthcare costs in the subsequent 3 years. Having an adequate outpatient follow-up frequency was likely to be cost-effective in the management of discharged patients with BD in this real-world setting. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; bipolar disorder; comorbidity; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; demography; female; follow up; health care cost; hospital discharge; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mortality; outcome assessment; outpatient; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; social aspect; survival; Taiwan; aftercare; ambulatory care; bipolar disorder; cost benefit analysis; economics; hospitalization; middle aged; mortality; statistics and numerical data; survival analysis; Adult; Aftercare; Ambulatory Care; Bipolar Disorder; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Health Care Costs; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Discharge; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Survival Analysis; Taiwan"
"The significance of tumor budding in oral cancer survival and its relevance to the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system",2019,"Background: To explore the clinicopathological significance of tumor budding (TB) on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) prognosis. Methods: Data of 200 patients with OSCC were retrieved from the cancer registration database in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Clinicopathological characteristics and survival relevant to TB were analyzed. Results: The data showed that TB was predominant in the tongue and floor of the mouth in younger patients with OSCC and correlated with several pathological factors, such as perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion. Patients with TB have significantly lower recurrence-free survival (P ?.0001). TB was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with early cancer stage (P =.042). Multivariate analysis demonstrated extranodal extension and TB as independent predictors of lymph node recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio = 9.90 and 3.89, respectively). Conclusion: TB is a significant predictor of tumor aggression with locoregional failure even in the revised 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer survival; data base; early cancer; female; follow up; human; human tissue; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; male; mouth cancer; perineural invasion; priority journal; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; squamous cell carcinoma; tongue; tumor budding"
"Factors of missed appointments at an academic medical center in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Missed appointments mean appointments neither attended nor canceled by patients. Missed appointments belong to one of the important subjects of hospital management because they would incur the inactivity of medical professionals and devices, occupy the health resources for other patients, and thus impair the quality of healthcare services. The aim of this study was to explore the factors of missed appointments at the outpatient department of an academic medical center in Taiwan. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on registration records of an academic medical center in Northern Taiwan in 2015. Fifteen variables of patients, appointments, and weathers were taken into analysis. Logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio of each variable. For nonfirst visits, we further built a logistic regression model with the five most influential variables and the personal attendance pattern of the previous three appointments. Results: Of 2 132 577 eligible appointments in 2015, the overall no-show rate was 16.9%. The influential factors included the following: (1) patient characteristics: younger than 40 years, ?6 visits, and a no-show rate between 50% and 75% in the previous year; (2) appointment characteristics: Saturdays, evenings, on the last third of the waiting list, only one appointment on the same day, online appointments, appointment-to-visit intervals (wait time) in 7 to 14 days, appointments to obstetrics/gynecology or pediatrics, first-time appointments, and the interval between the appointed visit and the previous visit in <7 days; and (3) weather characteristics: warm weathers and heavy rains. For nonfirst appointments, the influences in decreasing order were heavy rain, shorter interval between the appointed visit and the previous visit to the same department, higher no-show rate in the previous year, total absence in the personal attendance pattern of the previous three appointments, longer wait time, and children. Conclusion: The factors of missed appointments were multifaceted. Further measures could be undertaken accordingly to enhance healthcare efficiency.

"Mesenchymal stem cell exosomes as a cell-free therapy for nerve injury-induced pain in rats",2019,"Nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain is difficult to treat. In this study, we used exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UCMSC) as a cell-free therapy for nerve injury-induced pain in rats. Isolated UCMSC exosomes range in size from 30 to 160 nm and contain CD63, HSP60, and CD81 exosome markers. After L5/6 spinal nerve ligation surgery, single intrathecal injection of exosomes reversed nerve ligation-induced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities of right hindpaw of rats at initial and well-developed pain stages. Moreover, continuous intrathecal infusion of exosomes achieved excellent preventive and reversal effects for nerve ligation-induced pain. In immunofluorescent study, lots of Exo-green-labelled exosomes could be found majorly in the ipsilateral L5 spinal dorsal horn, dorsal root ganglion, and peripheral axons, suggesting the homing ability of UCMSC exosomes. They also appeared in the central terminals or cell bodies of IB4+, CGRP+, and NF200+ sensory neurons. In addition, exosome treatment suppressed nerve ligation-induced upregulation of c-Fos, CNPase, GFAP, and Iba1. All these data suggest that the analgesic effects of exosomes may involve their actions on neuron and glial cells. Exosomes also inhibited the level of TNF-α and IL-1β, while enhanced the level of IL-10, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in the ipsilateral L5/6 dorsal root ganglion of nerve-ligated rats, indicating anti-inflammatory and proneurotrophic abilities. Protein analysis revealed the content of vascular endothelial growth factor C, angiopoietin-2, and fibroblast growth factor-2 in the exosomes. In summary, intrathecal infusion of exosomes from UCMSCs may be considered as a novel therapeutic approach for nerve injury-induced pain. ? 2018 The Author(s).","2',3' cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase; adaptor protein; angiopoietin 2; brain derived neurotrophic factor; calcitonin gene related peptide; CD63 antigen; CD81 antigen; chaperonin 60; fibroblast growth factor 2; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; glial fibrillary acidic protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1; isolectin B4; neurofilament 200; neurofilament protein; protein c fos; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; vasculotropin C; actin binding protein; Aif1 protein, rat; angiopoietin 2; calcium binding protein; cytokine; fibroblast growth factor 2; nerve protein; vasculotropin C; analgesic activity; animal experiment; Article; cell body; controlled study; exosome; glia cell; hind paw; hypersensitivity; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; male; mechanical hypersensitivity; mesenchymal stem cell; nerve injury; nervous system inflammation; neuropathic pain; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; rat; sensory nerve cell; spinal cord dorsal horn; spinal ganglion; spinal nerve ligation pain; spinal pain; thermal hypersensitivity; umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell; upregulation; animal; complication; cytology; disease model; drug effect; exosome; hemispheric dominance; human; intraspinal drug administration; mesenchymal stem cell; metabolism; neuralgia; pathology; peripheral nerve injury; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; ultrastructure; Angiopoietin-2; Animals; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Exosomes; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Functional Laterality; Ganglia, Spinal; Humans; Injections, Spinal; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Microfilament Proteins; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neuralgia; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sensory Receptor Cells; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C"
"Prognostic significance of basal versus superior segment in patients with completely resected lung adenocarcinoma in the lower lobe",2019,"Background: Although the lower lobes of the lungs occupy half of the chest on both sides, the prognostic value of tumor location in lung cancer in the lower lobe has not been well demonstrated. This study investigated the prognostic value of tumor location (basal vs. superior) in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma in the lower lobe. Methods: A total of 207 patients undergoing lobectomy for lung adenocarcinoma in the lower lobe were included in the study. The association between tumor location and mediastinal lymph node metastasis was analyzed. Prognostic factors of overall survival and probability of freedom from recurrence (FFR) were also investigated. Results: During follow-up, 71 (34.3%) patients developed recurrence. Patients with basal segment tumors had a significantly higher possibility of developing N2 lymph node metastasis than those with superior segment tumors (P = 0.025). Univariate analysis showed that location in the basal (vs. superior) segment was a significant prognostic factor for a lower probability of FFR (P = 0.013). Basal (vs. superior) segment remained a significant prognostic factor for a lower probability of FFR (P = 0.010) in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Basal segment tumors have a significantly higher possibility of developing N2 lymph node metastasis than superior segment tumors in resected lung adenocarcinoma in the lower lobe. Tumor location at the basal segment was a significant prognostic factor for a lower probability of FFR. This information is useful for patient stratification of risk of postoperative recurrence. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Short sleep duration is associated with increased serum homocysteine: Insights from a national survey",2019,"Study Objectives: Both short sleep duration and increased serum homocysteine levels are associated with cardiovascular events. However, research on the relationship between sleep duration and serum homocysteine levels is sparse. The aim of this study is to examine the association between sleep duration and serum homocysteine levels from a national database. Methods: In total, 4,480 eligible participants older than 20 years who had serum homocysteine data and reported sleep duration were enrolled from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 2005 to 2006. The association between sleep duration and serum homocysteine levels was analyzed using multivariate regression models for covariate adjustment. Results: Serum homocysteine level was lowest in individuals with a sleep duration of 7 hours and increased in those with both shorter and longer self-reported total sleep time (groups were categorized into ? 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, and ? 9 hours). After adjustment for covariates, those in the group sleeping ? 5 hours had significantly higher serum homocysteine levels than the reference group (sleep duration of 7 hours). In subgroup analyses by sex, body mass index (BMI), and ethnicity, the association between short sleep duration (? 5 hours) and higher serum homocysteine levels persisted in women, individuals with obesity (BMI ? 30 kg/m 2 ), and non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions: This study highlighted that short sleep duration was associated with higher serum homocysteine levels in women, individuals with obesity (BMI ? 30 kg/m 2 ), and non-Hispanic whites; this finding might suggest increased vulnerability to cardiovascular risk or other atherothrombotic events in these groups in the context of short sleep. ? 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.All Rights Reserved.","homocysteine; adult; Article; Black person; blood level; body mass; Caucasian; ethnicity; female; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; Mexican American; middle aged; obesity; sex difference; sleep time"
"Liquid biopsy for detection of EGFR T790M mutation in nonsmall cell lung cancer: An experience of proficiency testing in Taiwan",2019,"Background: The use of liquid biopsy to detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a promising method to screen patients eligible for third-generation EGFR inhibitors. Proficiency testing (PT) programs involving liquid biopsy are currently lacking. In this study, we conducted a PT program to assess the quality assurance of liquid biopsy tests for detecting EGFR T790M mutation in molecular pathology laboratories in Taiwan. Methods: Whole blood samples (2 mL) with various concentrations of the EGFR T790M mutation were prepared and analyzed in six participating laboratories using their clinically validated assays. Results: For circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolation, three of the six participating laboratories used the cobas cfDNA Sample Preparation Kit, and three used the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. For testing platforms, two of the six participating laboratories used mass spectrometry, three used the cobas EGFR mutation test, and one used a laboratory-developed test. There was 100% concordance in detection of all the given concentrations of EGFR T790M mutation between the participating laboratories and different testing platforms. The testing platforms used by all participating laboratories could successfully detect EGFR T790M mutation to an expected frequency of 1%. Conclusion: In this first PT program using liquid biopsy in Taiwan, local clinical laboratories were suitably equipped and proficient in the use of cfDNA to test for the EGFR T790M mutation. Establishing a routine PT system to ensure the reliability and accuracy of liquid biopsy in clinical practice in Taiwan would be helpful.

"Beyond a measure of liver function—bilirubin acts as a potential cardiovascular protector in chronic kidney disease patients",2019,"Bilirubin is a well-known neurotoxin in newborn infants; however, current evidence has shown that a higher serum bilirubin concentration in physiological ranges is associated with a lower risk for the development and progression of both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults. The protective mechanisms of bilirubin in CVD, CKD, and associated mortality may be ascribed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Bilirubin further improves insulin sensitivity, reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and inhibits platelet activation in at-risk individuals. These effects are expected to maintain normal vascular homeostasis and thus reduce the incidence of CKD and the risks of cardiovascular complications and death. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in the biological actions of bilirubin in the pathogenesis of CVD and CKD progression, and further propose that targeting bilirubin metabolism could be a potential approach to ameliorate morbidity and mortality in CKD patients. ? 2018 by the authors.

Therefore, a glutathione (GSH)-responsive micelle, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive micelle, and a dual GSH-/ROS-responsive micelle were prepared to evaluate the feasibility of using stimuli-responsive micelles to treat TICSCs and MCSCs. The experimental results demonstrate that ROS-responsive and dual ROS-/GSH-responsive micelles efficiently induce the death of both TICSCs and MCSCs because they could release drugs on both CSCs. However, GSH-responsive micelles were sensitive to TICSCs but not to MCSCs because the latter expressed a low GSH level. Relevant results suggest that the micelles with an ROS-responsive characteristic have great potential for delivering payloads efficiently to treat both TICSCs and MCSCs. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Diseases; Oncology; Stem cells; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Cancer stem cells; Cancer therapy; Drug resistance; Metastatic cancers; Nano-carriers; Reactive oxygen species; Stimuli-responsive micelles; Tumor recurrences; Micelles"
"Autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma: Post-transplant outcomes of Taiwan Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry",2019,"Background/Purpose: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal plasma cell malignancy. The primary choice of treatment for MM is induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). This study aimed to analyze the treatment efficacy of ASCT in a Taiwanese cohort and evaluate possible prognostic factors. Methods: From the database of the Taiwan Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, data on 396 patients with MM who underwent ASCT were reviewed. Results: The average age of participants was 54.8 years, and there were more men than women (57.6% vs. 42.4%). Most patients were diagnosed with IgG-type myeloma (52.4%), followed by IgA-type (23.2%) and light-chain type (21.4%). Patients with Durie Salmon Staging System (DSS) III disease accounted for 61.9% of the study cohort, while 23.7% had stage II and 14.4% had stage I disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after ASCT were 46.5 months and 70.4 months, respectively. DSS III was a poor prognostic factor affecting both PFS and OS with a duration of 35.9 months and 69.0 months, respectively, compared with the other two stages (p = 0.006 and p = 0.03, respectively). In addition, patients with better treatment response before ASCT had better PFS and OS compared with those who did not show a response (both p < 0.0001). The overall incidence of organ toxicities associated with transplantation was low. Conclusion: In conclusion, our cohort showed that myeloma patients with early DSS and better treatment response before ASCT had better long-term survival outcomes. ? 2018","immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin light chain; melphalan; antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; bloodstream infection; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cause of death; cohort analysis; cytomegalovirus infection; drug megadose; female; herpes zoster; human; long term survival; major clinical study; male; mucosa inflammation; multiple myeloma; organ injury; overall survival; pneumonia; progression free survival; register; skin infection; transplantation conditioning; treatment response; adolescent; autotransplantation; epidemiology; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; middle aged; mortality; multiple myeloma; multivariate analysis; remission; retrospective study; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Multivariate Analysis; Registries; Remission Induction; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"The association of obesity and coronary artery disease genes with response to SSRIs treatment in major depression",2019,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, treatment response during an initial therapeutic trial is often poor and is difficult to predict. Heterogeneity of response to SSRIs in depressed patients is partly driven by co-occurring somatic disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and obesity. CAD and obesity may also be associated with metabolic side effects of SSRIs. In this study, we assessed the association of CAD and obesity with treatment response to SSRIs in patients with MDD using a polygenic score (PGS) approach. Additionally, we performed cross-trait meta-analyses to pinpoint genetic variants underpinnings the relationship of CAD and obesity with SSRIs treatment response. First, PGSs were calculated at different p value thresholds (PT) for obesity and CAD. Next, binary logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association of the PGSs to SSRIs treatment response in a discovery sample (ISPC, N = 865), and in a replication cohort (STAR*D, N = 1,878). Finally, a cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis was performed by combining summary statistics. We show that the PGSs for CAD and obesity were inversely associated with SSRIs treatment response. At the most significant thresholds, the PGS for CAD and body mass index accounted 1.3%, and 0.8% of the observed variability in treatment response to SSRIs, respectively. In the cross-trait meta-analyses, we identified (1) 14 genetic loci (including NEGR1, CADM2, PMAIP1, PARK2) that are associated with both obesity and SSRIs treatment response; (2) five genetic loci (LINC01412, PHACTR1, CDKN2B, ATXN2, KCNE2) with effects on CAD and SSRIs treatment response. Our findings implicate that the genetic variants of CAD and obesity are linked to SSRIs treatment response in MDD. A better SSRIs treatment response might be achieved through a stratified allocation of treatment for MDD patients with a genetic risk for obesity or CAD. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","ataxin 2; cadm2 protein; citalopram; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B; linc01412 protein; negr1 protein; park2 protein; phactr1 protein; pmaip1 protein; potassium channel KCNE2; protein; serotonin uptake inhibitor; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Article; body mass; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; clinical trial (topic); cohort analysis; coronary artery disease; disease association; female; gene locus; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; human; major clinical study; major depression; male; meta analysis (topic); multicenter study; obesity; pharmacogenomics; polygenic score; priority journal; scoring system; single nucleotide polymorphism; treatment response"
"Alcohol consumption and risk of chronic kidney disease: A nationwide observational cohort study",2019,"Alcohol consumption is a significant public health issue worldwide. The rat model and epidemiological studies have both reported conflicting results about the effects of alcohol on the kidneys. We aimed to explore the relationships between alcohol consumption and chronic kidney disease. Data from the National Health Interview Survey, the National Health Insurance research database, and the National Deaths Dataset were used. Standardized in-person interviews were executed in 2001, 2005, and 2009 to obtain the demographic characteristics of study population. The participants were followed up until 2013. The primary outcome was new-onset chronic kidney disease. We analyzed 45,200 adults older than 18 years (50.8% men and 49.2% women), and the overall mean (SD) age was 42.73 (16.64) years. During the 8.5 (3.5) years of follow-up, new-onset chronic kidney disease was recognized in 1535 (5.5%), 292 (2.7%), and 317 (4.9%) non-drinking, social-drinking, and regular-drinking participants, respectively. The participants who were social and regular drinkers had a significantly decreased risk of chronic kidney disease incidence (social drinking: Adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74–0.97; p = 0.018; regular-drinking: AHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74–0.98; p = 0.024), with baseline demographics and comorbidities adjusted. In conclusion, social and regular drinkers had decreased risk of chronic kidney disease when compared with non-drinkers. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Increased risk of chronic liver disease in patients with major depressive disorder: A population-based study",2019,"Objective: This study investigated the prevalence and incidence of chronic liver disease in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and aimed to identify associated factors. Methods: Data of 766,427 adult subjects aged ?18 years were randomly selected from the National Health Research Institute database from the year 2005. The study first searched for subjects with at least one primary diagnosis of MDD in 2005, and then for those with a primary or secondary diagnosis of chronic liver disease were also identified. The differences in the prevalence of chronic liver disease and its associated factors between patients with MDD and the general population in 2005 were then analyzed. We also compared the incidence of chronic liver disease in patients with MDD and in the general population from 2006 to 2010. Results: The prevalence of chronic liver disease in patients with MDD was 2.27 times as high as that of the general population in 2005 (12.4% vs. 5.8%; odds ratio (OR) = 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.07–2.48). The average annual incidence of chronic liver disease in patients with MDD during 2006–2010 was also higher than that of the general population (2.6% vs. 1.7%; risk ratio (RR) = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.37–1.7). Conclusions: Patients with MDD had a significantly higher prevalence and incidence of chronic liver disease than the general population. Among patients with MDD, an older age, the male sex, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and first-generation antipsychotic use were factors associated with chronic liver disease. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","neuroleptic agent; adult; age; alcohol liver cirrhosis; alcohol liver disease; alcoholic fatty liver; Article; biliary cirrhosis; chronic hepatitis; chronic liver disease; controlled study; diabetic patient; disease association; female; health insurance; human; hyperlipidemia; incidence; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; major depression; male; middle aged; prevalence; priority journal; psychopharmacotherapy; sex difference; Taiwan; adolescent; aged; chronic disease; complication; factual database; liver disease; major depression; odds ratio; psychology; risk factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antipsychotic Agents; Chronic Disease; Databases, Factual; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Incidence; Liver Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Young Adult"
"Impact of body-mass factors on setup displacement during pelvic irradiation in patients with lower abdominal cancer",2019,"Background. The aim of the study was investigate the impact of body-mass factors (BMF) on setup displacement during pelvic radiotherapy in patients with lower abdominal cancers. Patients and methods. The clinical data of a training cohort composed of 60 patients with gynecological, rectal, or prostate cancer were analyzed. The daily alignment data from image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) were retrieved. Setup errors for were assessed by systematic error (SE) and random error (RE) through the superior-inferior (SI), anteriorposterior (AP), and medial-lateral (ML) directions. Several BMFs and patient-related parameters were analyzed with binary logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curves. A scoring system was proposed to identify those with greater setup displacement during daily treatment. The results were validated by another cohort. Results. A large hip lateral diameter correlated with a greater SI-SE and AP-SE, whereas a large umbilical AP diameter correlated with a greater ML-SE and ML-RE. A higher SI-RE was associated with a large hip circumference. The positive predictors for setup uncertainty were chosen to dichotomize patients into groups at high risk and low risk for setup displacement. Based on the scoring system, the adequate treatment margins for the SI direction in the highand low-risk groups were 5.4 mm and 3.8 mm, whereas those for the ML direction were 8.2 mm and 4.2 mm, respectively. The validated cohort showed a similar trend. Conclusions. Large BMFs including hip lateral diameter, hip circumference, and umbilical AP diameter are associated with greater setup uncertainty. Based on the scores, IGRT or required treatment margins can be adapted for patients with high risk features. ? 2019 Wei-Chieh Wu, Yi-Ru Chang, Yo-Liang Lai, An-Cheng Shiau, Ji-An Liang, Chun-Ru Chien, Yu-Cheng Kuo, Shang-Wen Chen, published by Sciendo.","abdominal cancer; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; female genital tract cancer; high risk patient; hip circumference; human; image guided radiotherapy; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; medical parameters; middle aged; pelvis; prediction; prostate cancer; radiological parameters; random error; receiver operating characteristic; rectum cancer; retrospective study; scoring system; systematic error; trend study; uncertainty; validation study; very elderly"
"Andrographolide and its potent derivative exhibit anticancer effects against imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cells by downregulating the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein",2019,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is clinically treated with imatinib, which inhibits the kinase activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. However, imatinib resistance remains a common clinical issue. Andrographolide, the major compound of the medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata, was reported to exhibit anticancer activity. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of andrographolide and its derivative, NCTU-322, against both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant human CML cell lines. Both andrographolide and NCTU-322 downregulated the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in imatinib-resistant CML cells through an Hsp90-dependent mechanism similar to that observed in imatinib-sensitive CML cells. In addition, NCTU-322 had stronger effects than andrographolide on downregulation of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, induction of Hsp90 cleavage and cytotoxicity of CML cells. Notably, andrographolide and NCTU-322 could induce differentiation, mitotic arrest and apoptosis of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells. Finally, the anticancer activity of NCTU-322 against imatinib-resistant CML cells was demonstrated in vivo. In summary, our data demonstrated that andrographolide and NCTU-322 inhibit Bcr-abl function via a mechanism different from that of imatinib, and they induced multiple anticancer effects in both imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML cells. Our findings demonstrate that andrographolide and NCTU-322 are potential therapeutic agents again CML. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","alanine aminotransferase; andrographolide; antineoplastic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; BCR ABL protein; caspase 3; creatinine; diterpenoid; glycoprotein E1; heat shock protein 90; histone H3; imatinib; nctu 322; STAT5 protein; unclassified drug; andrographolide; antineoplastic agent; diterpene; imatinib; Andrographis paniculata; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer resistance; cell cycle; cell differentiation; cell viability; chronic myeloid leukemia; controlled study; cytoplasm; down regulation; drug mechanism; human; human cell; IC50; in vivo study; K-562 cell line; KBM-5 cell line; leukemia cell; metaphase; missense mutation; mitosis inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein function; urea nitrogen blood level; Western blotting; cell cycle checkpoint; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; chronic myeloid leukemia; drug effect; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; mononuclear cell; oncogene; physiology; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Diterpenes; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, abl; Humans; Imatinib Mesylate; Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Molecular Structure"
"Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction risk score for secondary prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events in a real-world cohort of post-acute myocardial infarction patients",2019,"Background: Patients who survive myocardial infarction (MI) are at risk of recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events. This study stratified post-MI patients for risk of recurrent CV events using the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (TRS 2°P). Methods and Results: This was an observational study that applied TRS 2°P to a consecutive cohort of post-MI patients. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal ischemic stroke. A total of 1,688 post-MI patients (70.3±13.6 years; male, 63.1%) were enrolled. After a mean follow-up of 41.5±34.4 months, 405 patients (24.0%) had developed a primary outcome (9.3%/year) consisting of 278 CV deaths, 134 non-fatal MI, and 33 non-fatal strokes. TRS 2°P was strongly associated with the primary outcome. The annual incidence of primary composite endpoint for patients with TRS 2°P 0 was 1.0%, and increased progressively to 39.9% for those with TRS 2°P ?6 (HR, 27.6; 95% CI: 9.87-77.39, P<0.001). The diagnostic sensitivity of TRS 2°P for the primary composite endpoint was 76.3% (95% CI: 72.1-80.5%). Similar associations were also observed between TRS 2°P and CV death and non-fatal MI, but not non-fatal ischemic stroke. Conclusions: TRS 2°P reliably stratified post-MI patients for risk of future CV events. ? 2019, Japanese Circulation Society.

"Clinical and genetic profiles of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in Taiwan",2019,"Objective: The clinical and genetic profiles of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) in Chinese populations remain elusive. We aim to characterize the features of ATTR in a Taiwanese cohort of Han Chinese descent. Methods: Seventy-nine patients with molecularly confirmed ATTR from 57 Taiwanese families were identified by sequencing the transthyretin gene (TTR). The clinical and electrophysiological data were scrutinized. Cardiac involvement of ATTR was evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac scintigraphy. Four microsatellite and seven single-nucleotide polymorphism markers flanking TTR were genotyped to investigate the founder effect of the TTR Ala97Ser mutation. Results: Most of the patients had a peripheral neuropathy with variable autonomic symptoms. The average age at disease onset (AO) was 58.2?±?7.2?years, and the male patients had an earlier AO than female patients (56.6?±?5.7?years vs. 61.8?±?8.9?years, P?=?0.013). Electrophysiological studies revealed a generalized axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy and isolated median neuropathy in 84.5% and 15.5% of the patients, respectively. Up to 80% of the patients with ATTR had symptomatic or subclinical cardiac involvement. Six TTR mutations were identified in the participants including one novel mutation Glu89Asp. Among them, Ala97Ser was the most common mutation, accounting for 91.2% of the ATTR pedigrees. Detailed haplotype analyses demonstrated a shared haplotype in the 47 patients with the Ala97Ser mutation, suggesting a founder effect. Interpretation: The present study delineates the distinct features of ATTR in Taiwan and provides useful information for the diagnosis and management of ATTR, especially in patients of Chinese descent. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Efficacy of laser acupuncture for carpal tunnel syndrome: A study protocol for a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial",2019,"INTRODUCTION: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy that causes hand discomfort and work disability. Since no satisfactory conventional treatments for mild to moderate CTS exist, we apply complementary alternative medicine (CAM) to this problem. Laser acupuncture (LA), a new, non-invasive therapy which uses low-level-laser therapy (LLLT) in acupuncture could help to manage CTS. However, only one small randomized, double-blind and crossover trial had been conducted, which is not enough to provide an evidence-based assessment of the effects of LA on CTS. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study protocol is to investigate the efficacy of LA therapy on patients with mild to moderate CTS through sonography of the median nerve and offer clear parameters of LLLT. METHODS: This study protocol is a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial. Forty subjects aged 20 to 80 years old and diagnosed as having mild to moderate CTS will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (real LA, 3-sessions a week for 2 weeks) and control group (sham LA, 3-sessions a week for 2 weeks). All subjects will be asked to wear night splints as the fundamental management approach. The laser parameters will include a wavelength of 808?nm, power output of 300 mW and power density of 300 mW/mm, with ten seconds of treatment for each acupuncture point (PC4, PC6, PC7, PC8, LI4, LI10, LI11, HT3, HT7, and LU10). Sham LA treatment will be applied without any laser power output. The primary outcome will be based the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire and secondary outcomes included a visual analog scale, cross sectional area of median nerve by sonography and electrophysiological test before interventions and after 2, 4, 8, 12 weeks postintervention.
