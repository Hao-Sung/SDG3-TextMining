The Act's presumption of capacity and its safeguarding the interests of 'unwise decisions' being made are perhaps its most relevant features for older people with problems of substance misuse. The Act also advocates setting out advance statements and decision making in advance, further protecting individuals who may be unable to make decisions for themselves in the future. Best interest decision making is another guiding principle of assessing whether or not an individual who is deemed as lacking capacity to make their own decisions is at risk of their needs remaining unmet. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..",Capacity; Consent; Decision making capacity; Mental capacity; Mental Capacity Act 2005; Myopia; Substance abuse,,2-s2.0-84927799695

Such care is associated with treatment by more than one service at any one time or by one service after another. This has meant the lack of an overview and ineffective management of more than one group of disorders. Integrated services are relatively new to service delivery for older people, but considerable progress has been made in the past decade to address this unmet need. This chapter outlines service implications, current systems of service delivery and the development of integrated SMCD services for older people, drawing upon existing research and drawing out future direction in this expanding field of mental health. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Elderly; Older People; Service integration; Substance Abuse,,2-s2.0-84927792312

To provide some historical perspective on changes in ECT practice, the objective of the present study was to identify trends in ECT practice in selected teaching hospitals in South London, UK, between 1949 and 2006.Methods: Annual rates of ECT for 1949-1970 were estimated from the contemporary hospital reports of the Maudsley and Bethlem Royal hospitals in South London, UK. Case notes were also retrospectively reviewed to calculate annual rates of ECT administration and extract demographic and clinical information for approximately every 5 years between 1987 and 2006.Results: The annual rate of ECT peaked at 35% of total admission in 1956 and declined gradually thereafter to 10.8% by 1970 and fell below 2.2% from 1991 onward. Depressed and female patients were more likely to receive ECT. Compared to previous years, patients were more severely ill and treatment resistant in 2006, whereas ethnic minorities made up 30% of patients receiving ECT compared to approximately 14% in the preceding years.Conclusions: Currently, ECT seems to be provided increasingly late in more severe illness episodes. The ethnicity of patients receiving ECT in South London may be becoming more representative of the background population, but ECT is being used relatively more frequently for nonaffective disorders in ethnic minorities.

A two-sided one page information leaflet was designed for patients being discharged from hospital after a paracetamol overdose. Patients presenting with an acute paracetamol overdose, irrespective of whether they were treated or not, were recruited to read the leaflet and then answer a brief structured questionnaire based on the leaflet. The readability of the information leaflet was assessed using the Flesch reading ease score. Thirty patients (15 male, 12 female, 3 not recorded; mean age 38?±?13.0?years) were recruited, wherein 100% of patients reported the language used was understandable, 96.6% knew which symptoms would require urgent medical review after discharge and 100% of patients knew the liver was affected by paracetamol. The Flesch reading ease score was 67.6 (out of a maximum of 100), equivalent to a UK reading age of 10–11years old. Our information leaflet for all patients being discharged after paracetamol overdose was well received by patients, provided them with the required knowledge and had an appropriate reading age based on UK literacy rates. We would recommend that this leaflet could be used as a template on a national level, localized to individual hospitals, to improve patient knowledge of paracetamol toxicity, and facilitate early medical review in the event of deterioration following discharge from the hospital. ? 2014 The Authors.

The aims of this study were to examine whether dentists' practice and beliefs changed after guidance publication to determine whether a knowledge translation intervention was required, and to inform its development.METHODS: Three postal surveys sent to three independent, random samples of dentists throughout Scotland pre- and post-guidance publication. The questionnaire, framed using the theoretical domains framework (TDF), assessed current practice and beliefs relating to recommended management of patients on bisphosphonates.RESULTS: The results (N = 420) suggest that any significant impact the guidance may have had on the recommended management of patients on bisphosphonates by primary care dentists, had reached its peak ten months post publication. A more positive attitude, greater perceived ability, and greater motivation were all associated with significantly more performing of all recommended behaviours at every time point.CONCLUSIONS: Prior to this study, there was little available information about how patients on bisphosphonates were being managed in primary dental care, or what beliefs may be influencing management decisions. This study was able to identify levels of compliance pre- and post-guidance publication and determine that further intervention was necessary to enable sustained uptake of recommendations. Using the TDF to identify beliefs associated with best practice made it possible to suggest theoretically informed strategies for service improvement. The next step is to test the intervention(s) in a randomised controlled trial.",,"bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; clinical practice; female; human; male; practice guideline; statistics and numerical data; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diphosphonates; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Male; Practice Patterns, Dentists'",2-s2.0-84964314484

Rather, these objectives are assumed to be met ""by random opportunity"".(1) This study explored the case of geriatric learning opportunities on internal medicine clinical teaching units, to better understand the affordances and limitations of curriculum by random opportunity. Methods Using audio-recordings of morning case review discussions of 13 patients > 65 years old and the Canadian geriatric core competencies for medical students, we conducted a content analysis of each case for potential geriatric and non-geriatric learning opportunities. These learning opportunities were compared with attendings' case review teaching discussions. The 13 cases contained 40 geriatric-related and 110 non-geriatric-related issues. While many of the geriatric issues (e.g., delirium, falls) were directly relevant to the presenting illness, attendings' teaching discussions focused almost exclusively on non-geriatric medical issues, such as management of diabetes and anemia, many of which were less directly relevant to the reason for presenting to hospital. Results The authors found that the general medicine rotation provides opportunities to acquire geriatric competencies. However, the rare uptake of opportunities in this study suggests that, in curriculum-by-random-opportunity, presence of an opportunity does not justify the assumption that learning objectives will be met. Conclusions More studies are required to investigate whether these findings are transferrable to other vulnerable populations about which undergraduate students are expected to learn through curriculum by random opportunity. ? 2014 Author(s).",Clinical Clerkship; Core competencies; Curriculum-By-Random-Opportunity; Geriatrics,,2-s2.0-84936879167

Both conditions have clinical and laboratory features, response to treatment and outcome different from their adult counterparts. A common form of sclerosing cholangitis in childhood has strong autoimmune features and is referred to as autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC). The presentation of AIH and sclerosing cholangitis is nonspecific and can mimic most other liver disorders. As prompt treatment, particularly in AIH, is life saving, it is imperative to suspect these conditions and perform appropriate investigations in all children who present with a cryptogenic liver disorder. ? 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

However, it is not clear whether this association is direct or mediated through the increased cognitive impairment associated with NFTs. Methods: We sought to determine whether the extended MAPT haplotype was associated with the worsening of delusions and hallucinations in a combined cohort of 95 patients who participated in 2 clinical trials of treatment with memantine. Results: After controlling for baseline dementia severity, exposure to memantine, and antipsychotics, analysis shows that carriers of at least one H2 allele had a 5.4-fold (. P=.03) increased risk of worsening hallucinations. There was some evidence of association with worsening delusions but only in analysis by allele. Conclusion: These results are the first to indicate that the H2 allele of the extended MAPT haplotype negatively affects the course of psychotic symptoms in AD independently of disease severity. It will be important for future research to examine MAPT transcription in people with AD with and without psychotic symptoms to understand the exact mechanisms underlying these findings. ? 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",Alzheimer disease; Delusions; Hallucinations; MAPT; Psychosis; Tau,"MAPT protein; memantine; neuroleptic agent; protein derivative; quetiapine; risperidone; unclassified drug; amino acid receptor blocking agent; MAPT protein, human; memantine; tau protein; adult; aged; allele; Alzheimer disease; Article; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; delusion; dementia; disease association; disease severity; female; genetic association; hallucination; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neurofibrillary tangle; psychosis; randomized controlled trial; treatment response; Alzheimer disease; disease course; genetics; haplotype; Psychotic Disorders; treatment outcome; Aged; Alleles; Alzheimer Disease; Antipsychotic Agents; Delusions; Disease Progression; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; Female; Hallucinations; Haplotypes; Humans; Male; Memantine; Psychotic Disorders; tau Proteins; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84912530066

Background: International research suggests that patients transferred from critical care units after-hours have a higher mortality rate than transfers during daytime, although the reasons remain unknown. Design: A prospective exploratory study. Methods: Twenty-nine patients transferred from a UK critical care unit to a ward within the same hospital after-hours for 10 weeks beginning April 2009 were compared with 29 transfers during daytime hours matched on potentially confounding characteristics. UK Critical Care Unit transfer guidelines have remained unchanged since data collection. Outcomes were as follows: (i) frequency of nursing observations; (ii) time periods from transfer to first medical review; (iii) time period from transfer to first clinical observations; (iv) frequency of transfer to an inappropriate ward; (v) delayed transfers from Critical Care Unit to ward. Results: Using Wilcoxon's Rank test (two tail) to compare paired data from the matched groups, observations were recorded significantly less frequently within the first 12 hours for after-hours transfers. Time from transfer to first clinical observations was significantly longer for after-hour transfer patients. The delay from when the patient was ready for ward care and actual transfer was also longer for the after-hours transfer group. Conclusions: Surveillance differences, including time to the first set of observations and frequency of observations in the first 12 hours, are potential factors that may explain the differential mortality associated with after-hours transfers. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",After-hours transfers; Critical care; Mortality; Nursing; Observation,"adolescent; adult; aged; cohort analysis; comparative study; female; health care delivery; human; intensive care; intensive care unit; male; middle aged; mortality; patient transport; physiologic monitoring; prospective study; statistics and numerical data; time; United Kingdom; very elderly; Adolescent; Adult; After-Hours Care; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Critical Care; Female; Great Britain; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Patient Transfer; Prospective Studies; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84909641969

With easy accessibility and visibility, the skin has been considered a favorable organ to study stem cell behaviors. In particular, the skin provides valuable materials for tissue engineering and testing of novel therapeutic approaches including gene therapy and regenerative medicine. The skin consists of multiple cell lineages, including interfollicular/follicular keratinocytes, melanocytes, sebocytes, and follicular/intradermal mesenchymal cells. Nowadays, iPSCs can be generated from various skin-derived cell populations. Elegant label-tracking experiments have successfully identified their stem/early precursor cell populations. Following molecular and cellular biological experimentations and transgenic studies the elucidation of necessary factors, signaling networks, environments supporting their behavior, and interactions in organogenesis and homeostasis have been uncovered. Taking advantage of the knowledge accumulated by these works, iPSC-derived keratinocytes and melanocytes have been successfully induced, which holds promise as future materials for the bioengineering of the skin and hair, and investigation of biology of skin stem cells. Recently, the concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has been proposed. Cancer stem cells have been implied to originate from stem cell subsets and, accordingly, iPSCs may be converted to skin CSCs, especially most life-threatening melanoma CSCs. Those iPSC-derived CSCs may significantly enhance our understanding of cancer biology and allow the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Recently, patient-specific iPSCs were established from intractable genodermatoses, including epidermolysis bullosa, and corrected for their genetic defects. Thus, iPSC technology should open a new era of stem cell biology, genetic/regenerative medicine and oncology in the field of dermatology. ? 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Epidemiologic evidence on epigenetics in psychiatry, however, is currently very sparsely available. With the aim to address the current status of the literature on evidence indicative of involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in psychiatric disorders, we describe a clear role for epigenetic mechanisms in development and aging of the brain, with experiences and environmental exposures particularly during early life having considerable impact on the development of functional abilities of the brain. Besides the psychiatric consequences of classical syndromes of genetic imprinting in humans, findings of twin discordance, parent-of-origin effects, paternal age effects, and sex differences in psychiatric disorders suggest epigenetic involvement in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. The evidence is further strengthened by observations of endurable effects of various environmental exposures during life on risk of psychiatric disorders, and preliminary epigenetic studies showing differential epigenetic profiles in patients with several psychiatric disorders. Findings of these first (and preliminary) epigenetic studies should be interpreted with caution because of small samples sizes, lack of replication, limitations in the etiologic validity of psychiatric diagnoses, and in accessibility of the regions and cell types of the brain at appropriate periods during life. Despite the sparse availability, the current evidence for epigenetic involvement in (particularly early) brain development, mental health, and psychiatric disorders appears very promising, and may be used in bringing together inherited and acquired risk factors into a neurodevelopmental etiological model of psychiatric disorders with epigenetics as a plausible key mediating mechanism. Given the dynamic nature of epigenetic regulation of gene expression and the potential reversibility of epigenetic modifications, future well-designed multidisciplinary and translational studies will be of key importance in order to identify new targets for prevention and therapeutic strategies. ? 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

HIV gp120 is a highly glycosylated protein, with an average of 25 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS). Determination of the site occupancy, microheterogeneity, and chemical structure of glycans attached to the potential glycosylation sites on gp120 have been performed on recombinant gp120 and gp140 by site analysis of glycosylation involving a combination of chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. These studies were complemented by lectin-binding studies, and finally by mass spectrometric glycosylation analysis of gp120 isolated directly from infectious virions produced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In contrast to host cell glycoproteins, gp120 was shown to contain a population of incompletely processed oligomannose-type glycans that interact with host lectins, promote HIV infection, and alter cell signaling. These glycans also form the basis of the epitopes of several highly potent HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from HIV-infected individuals, making them a key feature for immunogen design. Furthermore, an elevated level of oligomannose-type glycans was evidenced on gp120 isolated from HIV-1 virions produced in PBMCs, compared to recombinant material, along with a subset of highly processed and sialylated, bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex-type glycans. The effect of variation in viral production systems has also been reported, with envelope glycoprotein derived from pseudoviral particles produced in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells exhibiting predominantly an oligomannose population, compared to gp120 isolated from a single-plasmid infectious molecular clone. The gp120 glycan profile is remarkably similar across primary viral isolates from Africa, Asia, and Europe and consequently represents an attractive target for vaccine development. Finally, glycan remodeling and mutagenesis can also be employed for pseudoviral particle production and recombinant protein expression, to probe broadly neutralizing antibody specificity, structural analysis, and immunogen design. ?

It describes the curious observation whereby exercise-induced ischaemia on second effort is significantly reduced or even abolished if separated from first effort by a brief rest period. However, the precise mechanism via which this cardio-protection occurs remains uncertain. Three possible explanations for reduced myocardial ischaemia on second effort include: first, an improvement in myocardial perfusion; second, increased myocardial resistance to ischaemia similar to ischaemic preconditioning; and third, reduced cardiac work through better ventricular–vascular coupling. Obtaining accurate coronary physiological measurements in the catheter laboratory throughout exercise demands a complex research protocol. In the 1980s, studies into warm-up angina relied on great cardiac vein thermo-dilution to estimate coronary blood flow. This technique has subsequently been shown to be inaccurate. However exercise physiology in the catheter laboratory has recently been resurrected with the advent of coronary artery wires that allow continuous measurement of distal coronary artery pressure and blood flow velocity. This review summarises the intriguing historical background to warm-up angina, and provides a concise critique of the important studies investigating mechanisms behind this captivating cardio-protective phenomenon. ? 2014 The Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.

Pre-eclampsia (defined as hypertension and proteinuria occurring after 20 weeks? gestation of pregnancy) [2] is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the developing world, and is also associated with poor fetal outcomes, including fetal growth restriction, and intrauterine fetal death [3]. The World Health Organisation estimates that around 26% of severe maternal pregnancy outcomes are associated with pre-eclampsia [4], and it is thought to be responsible for approximately 40,000 maternal deaths annually [5]. 99% of these deaths occur in developing countries [1]. There are a number of factors and challenges contributing to the stark disparity in pre-eclampsia related morbidity and mortality in the developing world, compared to the developed world. Restricted or under-staffed maternity services, particularly in rural areas with poor transport systems, mean that women in low and middle-income countries may present late or infrequently to antenatal care where pre-eclampsia (a frequently asymptomatic condition) may be diagnosed. However, even when uptake of antenatal healthcare is high, pre-eclampsia remains under-diagnosed. Early and accurate identification of at-risk women depends on regular and accurate blood pressure monitoring [6-8]. However, training in the use of the technically challenging sphygmanometer may be insufficient, and equipment may be lacking or defective [7]. Detection of proteinuria by dipstick has low specificity and depends on a regular supply of accurate urine dipsticks. Once pre-eclampsia is diagnosed (often at a late stage), skilled management is essential (timely delivery of the infant with skilled attendance, preceded by blood pressure control and seizure prevention). However, access to such care may be restricted by transport limitations and referral options, particularly for poor women in rural settings. Once care has been accessed, the quality may be sub-standard. For example, although magnesium sulphate has been shown to be effective for the prevention and control of eclamptic seizures [2] it is yet to be widely used in many low and middle income countries [4]. Efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality due to the complications of preeclampsia in low and middle income countries must be based around improving detection of pre-eclampsia in community and primary care settings, accompanied by improved access to higher-level facilities which can safely induce labour or deliver by caesarean section, with the availability of appropriate high quality medications for blood pressure control and seizure prophylaxis. ? 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that remains clinically silent for many decades. Sudden rupture of “high-risk/vulnerable” plaques has been shown to be responsible for the majority of acute cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Therefore, early detection of biological processes associated with atherosclerosis progression and plaque instability may improve diagnosis and treatment and help to better monitor the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising tool to detect molecular and cellular changes in the carotid, aortic and coronary vessel wall including endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, vascular remodelling, enzymatic activity, intraplaque haemorrhage and fibrin deposition and thus may allow early detection of unstable lesions and improve the prediction of future coronary events. Evaluation of atherosclerosis at both, the preclinical and clinical level includes non-contrast-enhanced (NCE) and contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI with and without the use of MR contrast agents. To increase the biological information obtained by MRI a variety of targeted-specific molecular probes have been developed for the non-invasive visualization of particular biological processes at the molecular and cellular level. This review will discuss the recent advances in molecular MRI of atherosclerosis, covering both pulse sequence development and also the design of novel contrast agents, for imaging atherosclerotic disease in vivo. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Atherosclerosis; Contrast agent; Coronary artery disease; Molecular MR imaging,caspase; endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1; fibrin; gadofosveset; gadolinium; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; iron oxide; lipocortin 5; low density lipoprotein; monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging agent; PADGEM protein; proteinase; superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; apoptosis; atherosclerosis; blood clotting; cardiovascular inflammation; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery disease; diffusion weighted imaging; disease course; electrocardiography; endothelial dysfunction; fibrin deposition; heart infarction; heat stroke; human; hypoxia; lipid storage; macrophage; magnetic resonance angiography; molecular imaging; neovascularization (pathology); nonhuman; pathophysiology; Review; single photon emission computer tomography,2-s2.0-84919912583

We examined the availability and receipt of the BCP in HIV outpatient clinics in Kenya and Uganda. A survey of 120 PEPFAR-funded facilities determined the services offered. At each of the 12 largest facilities, a longitudinal cohort of 100 patients was recruited to examine care received and health status over three months. The full BCP was offered in 14% (n = 17/120) of facilities; interventions most commonly offered were Support for family testing (87%) and Condoms (87%), and least commonly IPT (38%). Patients (n = 1335) most commonly reported receiving Cotrimoxazole (57%) and Multivitamins (36%), and least commonly IPT (4%), directly from the facility attended. The BCP (excluding Isoniazid) was received by 3% of patients directly from the facility and 24% from any location. BCP receipt was associated with using antiretroviral therapy (ART; OR 1.1 (95% CI 1.0-1.1), receipt from any location) but not with patient gender, wealth, education level or health. The BCP should be offered at more HIV care facilities, especially Isoniazid, and to more people irrespective of ART use.

The proliferation history of these tumors is still largely unknown. Here we present a novel approach to rebuild the proliferation trees that recapitulate the history of individual colorectal adenomas by mapping the progressive acquisition of somatic point mutations during tumor growth. Results: Using our approach, we called high and low frequency mutations acquired in the X chromosome of four mismatch repair deficient colorectal adenomas deriving from male individuals. We clustered these mutations according to their frequencies and rebuilt the proliferation trees directly from the mutation clusters using a recursive algorithm. The trees of all four lesions were formed of a dominant subclone that co-existed with other genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells. However, despite this similar hierarchical organization, the growth dynamics varied among and within tumors, likely depending on a combination of tumor-specific genetic and environmental factors. Conclusions: Our study provides insights into the biological properties of individual mismatch repair deficient colorectal adenomas that may influence their growth and also the response to therapy. Extended to other solid tumors, our novel approach could inform on the mechanisms of cancer progression and on the best treatment choice. ? 2014 De Grassi et al.",Cancer genomics; Clonal evolution; Colorectal cancer; Tumor proliferation history,"genomic DNA; accuracy; adult; aged; Article; case report; codon; colorectal adenoma; controlled study; copy number variation; environmental factor; exon; gene mapping; gene sequence; heredity; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; male; medical history; point mutation; single nucleotide polymorphism; tumor growth; X chromosome; adenoma; algorithm; clonal evolution; colorectal tumor; DNA sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; middle aged; mismatch repair; mutation rate; pathology; procedures; X chromosome; Adenoma; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Chromosomes, Human, X; Clonal Evolution; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA Mismatch Repair; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Middle Aged; Mutation Rate; Sequence Analysis, DNA",2-s2.0-84924558128

Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: A university in the UK. Participants: All employees on the university employee database were eligible to participate. Those who completed and returned the questionnaire were included in the sample. Respondents were 131 university employees. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: An AUDIT cut-off score of ?8 was used as a measure of hazardous drinking. AUDIT total score as well as a score of ?1 in each of the three conceptual domains of alcohol consumption (questions 1-3), dependence symptoms (questions 4-6) and alcohol-related problems (questions 7-10) were used as indicators of levels of drinking and alcohol-related consequences. Secondary outcomes were employees' demographics. Results: Over one third (35%) of respondents were classified as hazardous drinkers. Twenty three per cent reported having blackouts after drinking and 14% had injuries or had injured someone. The odds of being a hazardous drinker for an employee in central departments (Human Resources, Registry etc) is only one third of that of an employee in science and health-related departments (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.91). The proportion of hazardous drinkers was higher in males compared to females (43% and 30% respectively), part-time compared to full-time (46% and 34% respectively), and academic compared to non-academic employees (39% and 32% respectively), although these were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Furthermore, age, religion and ethnic origin were not found to be significantly associated with hazardous drinking, although total scores were significantly lower for ethnic minorities compared to white employees (p = 0.019). Conclusions: In this study, hazardous drinking was highly prevalent among university employees. However, overt recruiting of staff to address sensitive issues such as alcohol misuse is problematic. ? 2014 Awoliyi et al.",,adult; African American; African Caribbean; alcohol abuse; alcohol consumption; alcohol use disorder; alcoholism; article; Asian; Caucasian; cross-sectional study; drinking behavior; ethnic difference; female; health hazard; Hispanic; human; injury; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonmedical occupations; scoring system; sex difference; United Kingdom; university; university staff; young adult; aged; alcoholism; demography; ethnic group; odds ratio; prevalence; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Alcoholism; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Ethnic Groups; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Sex Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities,2-s2.0-84905057312

The study was conducted from November 2012 to February 2013.Main outcome measures Relative knowledge and awareness of ADRs and ADR reporting, and performance in an assessment of these aspects.Results Thirty-one DSs, 35 DF1s and 98 GDPs took part in the study. Awareness of the Yellow Card Scheme varied between groups (30.8%, 48.6% and 88.8% respectively). Reported use of the scheme was uniformly low (2.6%, 5.7% and 5.1% respectively). There were no differences in knowledge about ADRs and ADR reporting between the three groups of dentists as indicated by median scores achieved in the questionnaire test (54%, 73% and 62% for DSs, DF1s and GDPs respectively; p = 0.638). All of the DSs, 91.4% of DF1s and 91.8% of GDPs said that they would welcome further training. Key topics included training on ADRs to medicines commonly used in their dental practice and deciding what ADRs needed to be reported. The most popular format for delivery of this training was formal lectures for DF1s and GDPs, but workshops for DSs. Postgraduate deaneries were the most popular provider choice for DF1s and GDPs.Conclusions Dentists at different stages of their careers showed variable awareness and knowledge of the UK Yellow Card Scheme and what to report. Training should be tailored to fit the needs of the different groups. A questionnaire survey incorporating a summative knowledge assessment demonstrated variable levels of knowledge about adverse drug reactions and what to report. Large majorities of all groups (>90%) expressed a desire for training in these areas and in the case of graduate and practising dentists, indicated that this should be organised by the postgraduate deaneries. ? 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"adult; attitude to health; dental student; dentist; drug surveillance program; England; female; general practice; human; male; questionnaire; Adult; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Dentists; England; Female; General Practice, Dental; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Students, Dental; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84905042776

Most of the empirical work in this area has focused on the allocation of healthcare resources and priority setting at the local or national level. The variety of the more or less articulated theoretical efforts behind such initiatives is remarkable and has been accompanied, to date, by an overall lack of method specificity. We propose a set of methodological requirements for online deliberative procedures for bioethics. We provide a theoretical motivation for these requirements. In particular, we discuss and adapt an epistocratic proposal and argue that, regardless of its merits as a general political theory, a more refined version of its normative claims can generate a useful framework for the design of bioethical forums that combine maximal inclusiveness with informed and reasonable deliberation.

Here, we focus on the antiplatelet management of lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) secondary to atherosclerosis. Alongside the ageing demographic of industrialized nations, the prevalence of PAD is increasing significantly in line with its association to smoking and diabetes. As the pharmacotherapeutic armamentarium against coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease has been enhanced, the increasing survival of arteriopaths has also allowed the sequelae of PAD to become more manifest. The use of antiplatelet agents for PAD has been shown to significantly attenuate the risk of vascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and nonfatal stroke. As well as reducing adverse cardiovascular events, antiplatelet therapy also has a significant role in maintaining vessel patency following revascularization procedures. We critically appraise the evidence behind the recent class IA recommendation for antiplatelet therapy in individuals with symptomatic LEAD. ? 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Most studies comparing multilateral health agencies have failed to clearly propose a method for conducting agency comparisons. Methods: This study conducted a qualitative case study methodological approach, such that secondary and primary case study literature was used to conduct case study comparisons of multilateral health agencies. Results: Through the proposed Sequential Comparative Analysis (SCA), the author found a more effective way to justify the selection of cases, compare and assess organizational transformative capacity, and to learn from agency success in policy sustainability processes. Conclusions: To more affectively understand and explain why some multilateral health agencies are more capable of adapting to country and individual healthcare needs, SCA provides a methodological approach that may help to better understand why these agencies are so different and what we can learn from successful reform processes. As funding challenges continue to hamper these agencies' adaptive capacity, learning from each other will become increasingly important. ? 2014 G?mez; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"comparative study; health care; health insurance; health policy; institutional framework; policy reform; reform process; sustainability; article; case study; change management; health care need; health care organization; health care policy; methodology; organizational efficiency; priority journal; qualitative research; sequential comparative analysis; sustainable development; capacity building; health care delivery; health care planning; human; international cooperation; needs assessment; nonbiological model; organization and management; world health organization; Capacity Building; Delivery of Health Care; Health Planning; Humans; International Agencies; Models, Organizational; Needs Assessment; Qualitative Research; World Health Organization",2-s2.0-84902120117

This chapter describes the protective effects of green tea extract and EGCG on ocular tissues, including corneal epithelium cells, human lens epithelial cells, and retinal pigment epithelium cells. Green tea extract and EGCG affect a variety of molecular events, from receptor-mediated processes to signaling and altered gene expression. Green tea extract and EGCG could play important roles in the treatment of many ophthalmologic diseases, such as dry eye disease, keratitis, corneal ischemia, corneal trauma or degeneration, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, ocular hypertension, glaucoma, ocular infections, and other eye-related pathology.

Young A.F.,36818967900;,Mapping of areas vulnerable to leptospirosis based on the analysis of floods in the S?o Paulo Metropolitan Area,2014,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84956788464&partnerID=40&md5=4127a432cd03ff9cd4e088ce94fbe525,"This chapter focuses on the relationship between climate change and the impacts of climate events, as well the importance to manage the associated risk. According to IPCC (2012), the impacts of climate extremes and the potential for disasters emerge from the interaction of physical conditions (weather/climate), from the exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems. With global climate change, extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods are expected to occur with increasing frequency and greater intensity, which contaminates freshwater supplies, heightens the risk of water-borne diseases, and creates breeding grounds for diseases such as leptospirosis. Infectious disease outbreaks have been reported following major flood events in developing countries, and these outbreaks vary in magnitude and rates of mortality. The objective of the study was to evaluate leptospirosis at geographic locations based on environmental factors and produce a predictive disease risk map. The area of study is S?o Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA), one of the largest megacities in the world (with 19,956,590 people). In this case, we considered the previous analysis of Coelho and Massad (2012), where for each additional 20 mm of precipitation there was an average increase of 15.6 % in hospital admissions, as the precipitation increased from 20 mm to 120 mm. Within this context, we considered the spatial distribution of the daily number of leptospirosis cases and the probability of flood events in SPMA. We used ArcGIS to integrate the spatial information and non-spatial attribute data, where each spatial feature and its attribute information were linked. The ArcGIS also provided the ""math"" module to perform mathematical operations in order to analyze the geographical patterns and trends of the region. As a result, a map of vulnerability was produced based on the leptospirosis risk evaluation which can enable decisions to be made on strategies and interventions for improving the conditions of people living in disease-prone areas. ? 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We tested whether high-frequency airway oscillation (HFAO), a novel form of airflow oscillation generation can modulate induced dyspnoea and respiratory strength and/or patterns following 5 weeks of HFAO training (n = 20) compared to a SHAM-RMT (conventional flow-resistive RMT) device (n = 15) in healthy volunteers (13 males; aged 20-36 yrs). HFAO causes oscillations with peak-to-peak amplitude of 1 cmH<inf>2</inf>O, whereas the SHAM-RMT device was identical but created no pressure oscillation. Respiratory function, dyspnoea and ventilation during 3 minutes of spontaneous resting ventilation, 1 minute of maximal voluntary hyperventilation and 1 minute breathing against a moderate inspiratory resistance, were compared PRE and POST 5-weeks of training (2x30 breaths at 70% peak flow, 5 days a week). Training significantly reduced NRS dyspnoea scores during resistive loaded ventilation, both in the HFAO (p = 0.003) and SHAM-RMT (p = 0.005) groups. Maximum inspiratory static pressure (cm H<inf>2</inf>O) was significantly increased by HFAO training (vs. PRE; p<0.001). Maximum inspiratory dynamic pressure was increased by training in both the HFAO (vs. PRE; p<0.001) and SHAM-RMT (vs. PRE; p = 0.021) groups. Peak inspiratory flow rate (L.s-1) achieved during the maximum inspiratory dynamic pressure manoeuvre increased significantly POST (vs. PRE; p = 0.001) in the HFAO group only. HFAO reduced inspiratory resistive loading-induced dyspnoea and augments static and dynamic maximal respiratory manoeuvre performance in excess of flow-resistive IMT (SHAM-RMT) in healthy individuals without the respiratory discomfort associated with RMT. ? 2014 Morris et al.",,adolescent; adult; amplitude modulation; article; breathing rate; controlled study; dyspnea; female; flow rate; high frequency airway oscillation; high frequency oscillation; human; lung volume; male; maximum inspiratory dynamic pressure; maximum inspiratory static pressure; muscle strength; outcome assessment; peak inspiratory flow; pressure measurement; resistive loaded ventilation; respiratory function; respiratory tract parameters; scoring system; spontaneous resting ventilation; voluntary hyperventilation; breathing exercise; breathing muscle; clinical trial; dyspnea; health; high frequency ventilation; hyperventilation; inhalation; pathophysiology; physiology; rest; young adult; Adult; Breathing Exercises; Dyspnea; Female; Health; High-Frequency Ventilation; Humans; Hyperventilation; Inhalation; Lung Volume Measurements; Male; Respiratory Muscles; Rest; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84925283687

For each patient on the database with a tooth restored with a direct or indirect restoration with or without a root filling, the subsequent history of intervention on that tooth was consulted, and the next date of intervention, if any could be found in the data set, was obtained. Thus a data set was created of restored teeth and whether they have also received root fillings, with the dates of restoration and root filling placement and the dates, if any, of re-intervention. Modified Kaplan-Meier statistical analysis was used to quantify the distribution of time to intervention.Results Data for over 80,000 different adult patients were analysed, of whom 46% were male and 54% female. A total of 538,967 restoration placements were obtained from the data over a period of 11 years, of which 30,073 were root fillings.CONCLUSIONS: Examination of the survival of restorations in teeth with and without root canal fillings indicated that those with root canal fillings have shorter intervals before re-intervention than teeth without root fillings.

Paranoid thinking has been linked to greater availability in memory of past threats to the self. However, remembered experiences may not always closely resemble events that trigger paranoia, so novel explanations must be elaborated for the likelihood of threat to be determined. We investigated the ability of paranoid individuals to construct explanations for everyday situations and whether these modulate their emotional impact. Methods. Twenty-one participants experiencing paranoia and 21 healthy controls completed a mental simulation task that yields a measure of the coherence of reasoning in everyday situations. Results. When responses featured positive content, clinical participants produced less coherent narratives in response to paranoid themed scenarios than healthy controls. There was no significant difference between the groups when responses featured negative content. Conclusions. The current study suggests that difficulty in scenario construction may exacerbate paranoia by reducing access to non-threatening explanations for everyday events, and this consequently increases distress. Practitioner Points When working with distress associated with paranoia, practitioners should devote attention to developing coherent narratives where others are viewed as helpful and caring. Some cases of distress associated with paranoia may result from an uncertain and confused state of mind rather than threatening thought content alone. ? 2012 The British Psychological Society.",,"adult; analysis of variance; article; case control study; delusion; emotion; female; human; imagination; learning; male; mental stress; paranoid psychosis; physiology; psychological aspect; psychological rating scale; statistics; thinking; uncertainty; verbal communication; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Case-Control Studies; Delusions; Emotions; Female; Humans; Imagination; Male; Narration; Paranoid Disorders; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Set (Psychology); Stress, Psychological; Thinking; Uncertainty",2-s2.0-84893535279

This study aimed to use routine clinical data to estimate the prevalence of DD and unmet treatment need in a community drug and alcohol service, and to appraise the feasibility of using routine data for such purposes. Methods: First, a screening checklist was developed to determine whether a particular service-user met DD caseness criteria. Second, the electronic care records of 227 service-users were screened for DD caseness, as well as for documentation of current and/or previous receipt of mental health treatment. Findings: Seventy-two percent screened positive for having DD. Of these, around half were not receiving current treatment for their mental health, while 37% had never received mental health treatment. Higher rates of DD were found amongst women and those in treatment for alcohol dependence. Conclusions: The findings corroborate previous research showing high prevalences of DD and unmet treatment need within drug and alcohol services in general, and amongst certain high-risk subgroups in particular. The study demonstrates that using routine data to estimate unmet treatment need is feasible within the limited resources available to frontline services. ? 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

As a result, the paper aims to tease out the discrepancies between what is said (of alcohol by policy-makers) and what is done (about alcohol within policy) through the conceptual lens of alcohol as nuisance. It does this in order to: (1) deepen current empirical engagements with alcohol control policies in South Africa and the Global South; (2) explore what stakeholders know or believe about the drinking practices that they seek to regulate and (3) highlight the dynamic tensions between what is said and what is done. In so doing, the paper contributes novel empirical data to the growing cannon of geographical engagements with drinking practices and policies by situating its analysis in the context of the Western Cape.

The management of diabetes has historically been solely a physician’s domain and has revolved around lifestyle intervention combined with pharmacotherapy to address insulin resistance and/or defective beta-cell function, the core issues in the pathophysiology of this disease. While the pharmacological armamentarium to treat T2DM has expanded considerably, few patients are able to achieve and maintain optimal glycemic targets in the long term.

Diarrhoea can occur in 2%–95% of patients, the wide range resulting from differences in the patient populations and the definition of diarrhoea adopted (Whelan 2007). It may result in a number of negative clinical sequelae, including fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, faecal incontinence andpressure sores. This is a frequent reason for discrepancies between prescription and intake of EN in hospitalized patients (Martins et al. 2012) and may even result in the cessation of EN, which may exacerbate under nutrition and its associated consequences of increased morbidity and mortality. Importantly, diarrhoea is also distressing and burdensome for both patients and their carers (Majid et al. 2012). The chapter briefly reviews the mechanisms of diarrhoea during EN and then critically appraises recent and emerging evidence on the prevention and management of this distressing complication. ? 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,2-s2.0-85053646607

New antibiotics are becoming available for the treatment of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, but there is limited data on their clinical effectiveness and the choice of therapy remains problematic. In addition, glycopeptide resistance can transfer from enterococci to the much more virulent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), although this has so far occurred infrequently.

Dental hygiene-therapists (DHTs) are mid-level providers that can deliver routine care working alongside dentists. This study examines patterns of delegation (selected tasks and patients) by dental students to DHT students training together in an integrated team. Methods: A retrospective sample of patient data (n = 2,063) was extracted from a patient management system showing the treatment activities of two student cohorts (dental and DHT) involved in team training in a primary care setting in the South of England over two academic years. The data extracted included key procedures delegated by dental students to DHT students coded by skill-mix of operator (e.g., fissure sealants, restorations, paediatric extractions) and patient demography. χ2 tests were conducted to investigate the relationship between delegation and patient age group, gender, smoking status, payment-exemption status, and social deprivation. Results: A total of 2,063 patients managed during this period received treatments that could be undertaken by either student type; in total, they received 14,996 treatment procedures. The treatments most commonly delegated were fissure sealants (90%) and restorations (51%); whilst the least delegated were paediatric extractions (2%). Over half of these patients (55%) had at least one instance of delegation from a dental to a DHT student. Associations were found between delegation and patient age group and smoking status (P &lt; 0.001). Children under 18 years old had a higher level of delegation (86%) compared with adults of working age (50%) and patients aged 65 years and over (56%). A higher proportion of smokers had been delegated compared with non-smokers (45% cf. 26%; P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The findings suggest that delegation of care to DHT students training as a team with dental students, involved significantly greater experience in treating children and adult smokers, and providing preventive rather than invasive care in this integrated educational and primary care setting. The implications for their contribution to dentistry and the dental team are discussed, along with recommendations for primary care data recording. ? 2014 Wanyonyi et al.",,adult; aged; chi square test; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; dental student; disease course; doctor patient relation; England; extraction; female; gender; human; information processing; major clinical study; male; mouth hygiene; patient care; patient coding; primary medical care; skill mix; smoking; social isolation; young adult,2-s2.0-84988431122

The presence of lupus erythematosus cells and the detection of anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) seropositivity subsequently led to the adoption of the term “lupoid hepatitis” and the idea that the condition stems from a loss of immunological tolerance [2]. The positive impact of steroid therapy, initially recognised in the early 1960s, resulted in the publication of three controlled clinical trials which incontrovertibly showed the life-saving value of corticosteroids in the treatment of “HBsAg-negative hepatitis” [3-5]. The recognition that “chronic active autoimmune hepatitis”, as it was then known, constituted a distinct clinical entity followed the systematic evaluation of its clinical symptoms, laboratory features and molecular immunopathology. During two working meetings held in the early 1990s, the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) introduced the term “autoimmune hepatitis”, as originally suggested by Ian Mackay in 1965 [6], since the disease frequently presents acutely and often has a fluctuating course, characterised by spontaneous remission, being therefore occasionally inactive. The IAIHG continues to monitor developments in the field regularly and was responsible for the development of an initial scoring system for the diagnosis of AIH [7], subsequently revised [8]. More recently, a simplified system, designed for use in clinical practice, has been proposed by the group [9]. ? Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",,,2-s2.0-84955119902

It is an infringement of an individual’s human rights as recognized in United Nations’ (UN) Conventions (Human Rights Act 1998). One in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime [1]. The British Crime Survey documented a 7% annual prevalence amongst women in 2010/11 [2]. In the clinical setting, prevalence of intimate partner violence amongst women ranges between 13–41% [3]. On average, 30% of women who have been in a relationship report violence, either physical or sexual in nature, from their partner [4]. Fifty-six per cent of most serious sexual offences are committed by partners [5]. Despite their commonness in society, abuse and violence continue to be taboo subjects to discuss especially during consultations. Domestic violence has adverse health and other effects, and the evidence for a correlation between domestic violence and child mistreatment is strengthening. Healthcare professionals and clinicians may be presented both with the short- and long-term impacts and with its direct and indirect consequences.

It differs from other types of drug abuse in that it is primarily a problem of children and adolescents, and the substances used are legally available. Reliable prevalence estimates are difficult to obtain. Ashton (1990) found that between 3.5 and 10% of adolescents may have at least experimented with volatile substances, and that between 0.5 and 1% of the secondary school population may be current users. Ramsey et al. (2001) found that 7% of a sample of young people reported lifetime use of volatile substances but only 1% had used within the last year and less than this within the last month, suggesting that this behaviour was not habitual or regular use. Solvent abuse is often very localized and in these circumstances the percentage of young people using these substances may be considerably higher. The majority of volatile substance abusers are aged between 12 and 19. In a survey of over 2000 14–15-year-olds in London schools, Best et al. (2004) found the mean age of first use was 12.6 years, with those who used volatile substances tending to start use very soon after the first offer (see ‘Adolescent lifestyle’). Volatile substances act like CNS (central nervous system) sedatives with a similar picture of acute intoxication. These substances are generally highly fat-soluble and diffusely toxic to the nervous system. ? Cambridge University Press 2007.",,,2-s2.0-84952922466

Across all blood centres, the demand for blood and blood products is steadily increasing as the population ages and innovative medical and surgical techniques are introduced. The demands for blood have begun to exceed supply, and the increase in complexity of donation has had a knock-on effect on recruitment of blood donors. Compared with two decades ago, the donation process has become increasingly regulated as attempts are made to acquire quality blood that is safe and free from disease and infection. The results of this increased regulation are increased donor loss through deferral, disqualification (Davey, 2004) and an apathy towards volunteering (Putnam, 2000). In the United States and the United Kingdom, blood stocks have been further impacted in recent years by the implementation of strict deferral guidelines for the prevention and transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) (US Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration & Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 2003; United Kingdom Blood Transfusion Services, 2002; US Department of Health and Human Services & Food and Drug Administration Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 2002). ?

Frequently, the managers and the leaders are neither adequately informed regarding EBP nor sufficiently educated in the techniques of EBΡ adoption and implementation to be capable supporters of such efforts. Encouragement, provision of specific incentives and reward through positive feedback can be important steps during the familiarization of the healthcare personnel with the procedures of EBP implementation. Specifically, recently published evidence underlines the finding that a percentage of 73% of healthcare personnel consider the managerial role to be the most important factor for promoting research in the healthcare setting. In parallel, economic support for the provision of educational programs to benefit nurses during the process of familiarization with EBP should be a priority of managers. Because of the importance of EBP for the improvement of quality of care in healthcare settings, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the allocation of specific managerial and leadership roles to educated healthcare professionals who will lead the team is of crucial significance, as these leaders will promote the aim of securing the best possible conditions for the patients and the healthcare professionals and, by extension, for the organization itself. ?

Nevertheless, a lower bone mineral density baseline has been observed pre-conceptually, associated with both the hypoestrogenic state of the condition and the possibility that premature ovarian insufficiency was developed prior to achieving peak bone mass.

So far, genetic variation only explains ?20-25% of the variability of human survival to age 80+. This clearly implies that other factors (environmental, epigenetic and lifestyle) contribute to lifespan and the rate of healthy ageing within an individual. Twin studies in the past two decades proved to be a very powerful tool to discriminate the genetic from the environmental component. The aim of this review is to describe the basic concepts of the twin study design and to report some of the latest studies in which high-throughput technologies (e.g. genome/epigenome-wide assay, next generation sequencing, MS metabolic profiling) combined with the classical twin design have been applied to the analysis of novel 'omics' to further understand the molecular mechanisms of human ageing.

Certain activities have been shown to commonly precede these attacks including a high carbohydrate intake, strenuous exercise and a heavy alcohol intake. This effect can be explained by an increased activity of Na+/ K+ ATPase in myocytes as a result of these activities. However, this does not fully explain the pathogenesis of this condition and it appears that a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors is involved. Recently, genetic mutations in two channel types involved in potassium homeostasis: Na+/ K+ ATPase and inward rectifying potassium channels, have been shown to be associated with this condition by increasing the risk of hypokalaemia.

The lack of guidelines has meant clinicians have been left to manage these cases from specialist advice or past experience. In view of this the British Association of Oral Surgeons (BAOS) membership was surveyed to assess current practice.Design An electronic survey consisting of nine closed multiple-choice questions was circulated to all 435 registered BAOS members. A section for open comments was also included. The data was transcribed, organised and reduced to themes by hand and finally analysed.Results One hundred and eighty members completed the questionnaire giving a response rate of 41%. Ninety-two percent of clinicians had direct involvement in managing patients on DAPT and of these 80% had not encountered a bleeding complication. DAPT was continued for simple dental extraction under local anaesthetic by 83% of respondents and 73% for surgical extractions. Two thirds of the respondents did not follow any guidelines but for those that did the most common was the UK Medicines Information protocols. Only 10% of respondents reported a significant post-operative bleeding complication following surgery in patients on DAPT.Conclusion This survey confirmed the continued variable management of patients on DAPT undergoing dentoalveolar surgery. Reported bleeding rates were low with over 75% of patients not having their DAPT treatment interrupted. ? 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to: first, establish which risk assessment method (i.e. structured professional judgement or actuarial) is most reliable for predicting treatment outcomes for individuals with PD. Second, determine whether individuals identified as high risk are more likely to have poorer treatment outcomes. Third, determine if engagement in treatment helps to reduce risk assessment scores. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 50 patients were recruited from a medium secure forensic PD service. Their risk was assessed using one structured professional judgement instrument (the HCR-20) and one actuarial instrument (the RM2000). The study used a retrospective cohort design. Findings – Overall, the HCR-20 was a better predictor of treatment outcome than the RM2000. Personality-disordered offenders with high HCR-20 scores are at an increased risk of adverse treatment outcomes. Research limitations/implications – This investigation used a small, non-randomised sample of male patients with PD at one South East England medium secure unit. The data were over-represented by white British males. Future research should compare PD offenders with non-PD offenders to investigate what factors best predict poorer treatment outcomes. Originality/value – The findings indicate that structured professional judgement approaches are more effective predictors of risk than actuarial measures for assessing patients with PD. This study therefore adds value to forensic services and to the risk assessment debate. ? 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",HCR-20; Offenders; Personality disorder; Risk assessment; RM2000; Treatment outcomes,adult; antisocial personality disorder; Article; assessment of humans; drug misuse; follow up; Historical Clinical Risk Management 20; human; legal aspect; major clinical study; male; mental disease; offender; personality disorder; prediction; recidivism; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; Risk Matrix 2000; sexual crime; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-84927510883

However, one-time assessments of behaviour are likely to possess limited reliability, leading to attenuated longitudinal correlation coefficient magnitudes. How much this bias might have affected behavioural continuity estimates in longitudinal research is presently unknown. Using a data set from the Mauritius Child Health Project, we particularize the attenuating effects of single-occasion behavioural assessments on consistency estimates of impulsive-aggressive behaviour over time. Specifically, two nursery teachers provided 15 consecutive weekly ratings of the aggressive behaviour of 99 four-year-old children. The same children were reassessed for the presence of externalizing behaviour problems at the ages of 8 and 10. There were substantial increases in both reliability and predictive correlation coefficient magnitudes when the preschool scores were aggregated across several weekly ratings. A further increase resulted after the two outcome assessments were combined into a composite score of school-age externalizing symptoms. A generalized procedure, developed from the correction for attenuation formula, is introduced to describe the relation of aggregation to predictive validity in longitudinal research. ? 2014 The British Psychological Society.",Aggregation; Aggression; Behaviour problems; Externalizing behaviour; Longitudinal research; Reliability; Stability; Validity,"aggression; child; child behavior; Child Behavior Disorders; female; human; impulsiveness; longitudinal study; male; methodology; physiology; preschool child; prognosis; psychometry; reproducibility; standards; Aggression; Child; Child Behavior; Child Behavior Disorders; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Prognosis; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design",2-s2.0-84925302229

Constraints for social learning in heatwave risk management in London, UK",2014,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925012294&partnerID=40&md5=7d9ef1c03719de5a680361b5110392d3,"This study explores constraints on social learning in local government disaster risk management strategies. The focus of the study is on local authorities, public health organizations, and voluntary sector organizations in London, and the way in which their heatwave planning approaches are shaped by the UK National Heatwave Plan. Local authorities are identified in the UK as agents of disaster risk management through the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act, which provides a legal mandate for local authorities to plan for and respond to contingencies, including heatwaves. This role raises questions on whether local authorities are well positioned to lead on the development and implementation of risk planning strategies that are flexible and adaptive to changing risk contexts. The analysis in this paper explores constraints on social learning in local risk planning organizations. London, UK, a global frontrunner in urban climate change adaptation, serves as an in-depth case study, drawing on six months of empirical research with local risk management organizations. Findings suggest that scarce administrative capacities and volatile political priorities constrain critical reflection and innovation in local planning organizations. Learning unfolds as incremental problem-solving, rather than fundamental change, and is directed at coping with dysfunctionalities of existing risk planning strategies. This prevalence of single-loop, rather than double or triple-loop learning stabilizes the planning regime of the National Heatwave Plan and potentially undermines transformation towards preventive, rather than response-based disaster risk management strategies. The research thus calls into question whether local authorities in the UK are well positioned to act as agents of change and transformation in disaster risk management.",Climate change; Disaster risk management; Heatwave; Organizations; Social learning,Disasters; Laws and legislation; Planning; Problem solving; Risk assessment; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Critical reflections; Empirical research; Fundamental changes; Health organizations; Heatwave; Political priorities; Risk management strategies; Social learning; Climate change,2-s2.0-84925012294

Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs operate as regulatory networks that target functionally related genes in physiological and pathological conditions. This property offers a unique opportunity to devise functional interventions that can overcome any redundancy mechanisms in disease. Additionally, miRNAs typically exert mild effects under baseline conditions, but have a more pronounced response under stress suggesting that off-target effects on uninjured tissue will be limited. Attractive as it may seem, miRNA biology can also be a serious concern for the safety of the potential applications, as miRNAs tend to function in a context-dependent manner and participate in both positive and negative feedback loops. Besides their role as mediators of disease, the presence of miRNAs in biological fluids has now been well documented. These circulating miRNA signatures may offer a great diagnostic and prognostic tool as disease biomarkers. Here we will review the recent developments in miRNA research with a particular emphasis on secreted miRNAs as targets for novel therapeutic approaches to cardiovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular disease; MicroRNA; Therapeutic application,biological marker; microRNA; Article; cardiovascular disease; cell communication; drug targeting; heart disease; human; medical research; nonhuman; priority journal; vascular disease; vascularization,2-s2.0-84921673433

The purpose of this paper is to present findings from an exploratory study which investigated how different agencies and professionals support people experiencing multiple exclusion homelessness (MEH) to develop and maintain their social networks amid other competing priorities, such as reducing substance misuse and re-offending.Design/methodology/approach - The study was undertaken in England 2010-2011 in three case study sites. Data were collected in 76 interviews with practitioners and managers, from disciplines including housing support, social work, criminal justice, mental health and substance misuse services. Totally, 56 interviews and five focus groups were also undertaken with people with experiences of MEH. Data were analysed thematically. Data from one site in particular permitted a focus on personal relationships and social networks which were seen as beneficial but also potentially problematic. These data are drawn upon to reflect on the implications for housing providers and practitioners.Findings - While multiple factors had often led to the loss of social networks among homeless people, findings revealed that practitioners working with homeless people may be able to promote existing social networks, such as partnerships, help develop new ones, and support people withdrawing from less positive relationships. The authors conclude that practitioners should be alert to structural changes that threaten social networks and may need to enhance skills in creating opportunities to foster existing positive relationships in direct work with their clients and in collaboration with other professionals. The need to be careful of blurring professional boundaries is also observed.Practical implications - This paper suggests approaches that may encourage practitioner reflection and commissioning practice in achieving good outcomes for people with experiences of MEH by highlighting the importance of social networks and the potential for practitioners to foster supportive relationships.Originality/value - This paper considers the often under-researched area of day-to-day engagement with social networks and the implications of working to support these as part of the role of homelessness services. While drawing primarily on recent research in England the themes raised will have wider relevance to housing and care services generally. ?

In her previous pregnancies she had numerous complications thought to be related to diabetes including recurrent macrosomia and polyhydramnios. In her second pregnancy she underwent emergency caesarean section for fetal tachycardia at 34 weeks’ gestation. Her baby was diagnosed with unexplained cerebral ischaemic injury and limb ischaemia requiring amputation. Postnatally she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus with subsequent poor control. Very high insulin demands in this fourth pregnancy and an unusual phenotypic appearance in the patient and her mother raised suspicion of an underlying condition. Genetic studies confirmed the clinical diagnosis of familial partial lipodystrophy. ?

In the field of asthma and rhinitis, there continued to be a focus on heterogeneity and phenotypes with increasing use of biostatistical techniques to determine clusters of similar populations. Obesity- and aspirin-associated disease are intriguing associations with asthma which were explored in a number of papers. We published a number of excellent papers on mechanisms of airway inflammation and how this relates to physiology, pathology, genetics and biomarkers in both human and experimental model systems. In terms of mechanisms, there is less on individual cell types in allergic disease at the moment, but the immunology of allergic disease continued to fascinate our authors. Another area that was popular both in the mechanisms and in the epidemiology sections was early life events and how these lead to allergic disease, with an increasing focus on the role of the microbiome and how this influences immune tolerance. In the clinical allergy section, oral immunotherapy for food allergy is clearly a major topic of interest at the moment as was in vitro testing to distinguish between sensitization and allergic disease. There was less on inhalant allergy this year, but a good representation from the drug allergy community including some interesting work on non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. In the allergen section, important new allergens continue to be discovered, but the major focus as in the last couple of years was on working out how component-resolved approaches can improve diagnosis and management of food and venom allergy. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,allergen; animal; human; hypersensitivity; immunology; Allergens; Animals; Humans; Hypersensitivity,2-s2.0-84911371036

Through personalised advice, alcohol brief interventions (ABIs) target drinking habits, which are deemed damaging to health. They are not targeted at dependent drinkers for whom a more intensive and specialist service would be better suited. In response to recent shifts in public-health strategy away from ABIs, and the publication of new trials into their effectiveness, this article evaluates the value of ABIs through the review of eleven relevant studies. Findings suggest that hazardous drinkers did reduce their drinking patterns following ABI, but not more so than control participants who were given standard treatment. The evolution of standard treatment to include thorough screening, non-personalised advice and sometimes literature on alcohol intake delivers an intervention, that is effective in reducing drinking. Therefore, future research and practice should focus on screening methods and quality of standard care rather than on brief interventions. ? 2014 MA Healthcare Ltd.",Alcohol brief interventions (abis); Alcohol strategy; Harmful and hazardous drinking; Practice nursing; Public health,,2-s2.0-84910140937

This article aims to enhance health professionals' understanding in order to equip practice and district nurses to deliver HIV care provision.

It is therefore imperative that nurses tailor adherence strategies according to each patient's requirements.

Furthermore, the use of motivational interviewing for antiretroviral adherence is highlighted as a potential intervention to help patients overcome the physical, psychological and physiological challenges of living with HIV-associated comorbidities.

For policy making and planning of high-quality clinical service models, clinical and social contexts need to be considered. Longitudinal, contextual information can be provided by historical analyses, including the successes and failures of earlier, similar services. Historical analyses complement clinical, randomised controlled studies and may contribute to ensuring optimum outcomes for future schemes.Methods: Standard historical methodology was used, including searching published sources and institutional and personal archives and conducting a 'witness seminar' and individual oral history interviews.Results: Proposals to create joint units have existed since 1947. Most clinically successful units were led by enthusiastic, dedicated clinicians. Joint units had the potential to provide appropriate assessment and treatment for patients with multiple disorders and education for staff and students. Joint units never became widespread.Conclusions: Reasons for the limited success of joint geriatric-psychiatric units might have included personalities of individuals, administrative boundaries separating geriatrics and medicine, unequal numbers of geriatricians and old-age psychiatrists, varying professional ideologies about the meaning of 'integrated' services, lack of reciprocity for each other's inpatients and lack of government support. Identified stumbling blocks need to be considered when planning joint clinical schemes. If current research indicates benefits of integrated wards for patients and their families, there needs to be ways to ensure that personal factors and fashions of management or government re-prioritisation will not lead to their premature termination.

We emphasise particularly on robotic prostatectomy, new developments in radiotherapy, novel technologies in focal therapy such as cryosurgery and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) has similar oncologic outcomes to open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP); however, patients who undergo RALRP are more likely to have improved short-term potency rates. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and proton-beam therapy (PBT) have similar oncologic outcomes to external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT). IMRT has exhibited an improved gastrointestinal side effect profile compared to EBRT. PBT is not cost-effective compared to other radiotherapy modalities. Early studies of focal therapies in localised PCa have yielded positive results. Treatment decisions should be driven by cancer risk and patient preference rather than by financial incentives or availability of technology. ?

The cohort was also stratified into calendar year before and after the year 2000 for subgroup analyses. Data were collected from the Swedish Patient Register. The two surgical groups were matched based on the propensity score to mimic a randomized trial design. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Results: 4,163 patients were included. There were no differences in survival in patients who underwent definitive surgical procedures compared to those who underwent minimal surgery for a bleeding peptic ulcer during the full study period. Using minimal surgery group as the reference, the HRs for death in the definitive surgery group within 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, and 5 years were 0.87 (95% CI 0.72-1.05), 0.93 (0.80-1.09), 1.00 (95% CI 0.87-1.14), and 1.05 (95% CI 0.95-1.16), respectively. The corresponding HRs during the calendar period after the year 2000 were 1.05 (95% CI 0.65-1.69), 1.18 (95% CI 0.81-1.73), 1.17 (0.84-1.62), and 1.27 (95% CI 0.99-1.63), respectively. Conclusion: This study found no worse overall survival after minimal surgery compared to more extensive surgery for refractory peptic ulcer bleeding, and indicated better long-term survival in the minimal surgery group during the more recent study period. A minimal approach is probably sufficient in most cases. ? 2014 S.

A practical implementation is proposed, and the index is subsequently used with mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) to correct TLA estimates obtained from approximate lesion contours. The methodology is illustrated on fractal and synthetic objects contaminated by partial volume effects (PVEs), validated on realistic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET simulations and tested for its robustness using a clinical 18F-fluorothymidine PET test-retest dataset.Results: TLA estimates were stable for a range of resolutions typical in PET oncology (4-6 mm). By contrast, the space-filling index and intensity estimates were resolution dependent. TLA was generally recovered within 15% of ground truth on postfiltered PET images affected by PVEs. Volumes were recovered within 15% variability in the repeatability study. Results indicated that TLA is a more robust index than other traditional metrics such as SUVmean or TV measurements across imaging protocols.Conclusions: The fractal procedure reported here is proposed as a simple and effective computational alternative to existing methodologies which require the incorporation of image preprocessing steps (i.e., partial volume correction and automatic segmentation) prior to quantification. ? 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",fractal dimension; partial volume effects; PET; quantification; space-filling; total lesion activity,"3' fluorothymidine f 18; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; Article; fractal analysis; geometry; oncology; positron emission tomography; quantitative analysis; simulation; algorithm; chemistry; computer program; computer simulation; fractal analysis; human; image processing; neoplasm; normal distribution; positron emission tomography; procedures; reproducibility; scintiscanning; theoretical model; three dimensional imaging; tumor volume; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Fractals; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Models, Theoretical; Neoplasms; Normal Distribution; Positron-Emission Tomography; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Tumor Burden",2-s2.0-84908191968

A number of electronic bibliographic databases were searched, including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed and PsycINFO, for relevant studies published since 1990. Papers were restricted to those published in English which presented data from studies conducted in high-income countries, with priority given to systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and other quantitative studies which present a higher level of evidence.Findings - Many factors may affect maternal and infant health during and after pregnancy. Potentially modifiable factors with an evidence base to support intervention include improving diet, and the avoidance of smoking, alcohol and illicit drugs. Good clinical management of underlying illness is also important, along with attempts to engage women in improving health prior to conception and postnatally rather than once pregnancy is established.Research limitations/implications - The evidence base for interventions on some potentially modifiable risk factors is incomplete. There is good evidence of benefit from some health behaviours such as smoking cessation and uptake of breastfeeding and accumulating evidence of the benefit of some models of maternity care.Practical implications - Good maternal health during and after pregnancy plays a key role in giving the child a better start in life. Improved health behaviours are vital but often these are heavily dependent on social context and hence working to tackle social inequality and provide maternity care tailored to individual need is likely to be just as important as trying to directly alter behaviour.Originality/value - Pregnancy and the postnatal period present an opportunity to improve maternal health and have a positive effect on future child health. Greater investment is required in this antenatal period of life. ?

Factors that contribute to growth and differentiation of connective tissue and bone regulate diverse cells of periodontal origin. Although these agents have significant appeal in promoting periodontal wound healing and bone regeneration, the outcome of current methods may be attenuated in an inflammatory environment. Focused generation of required components for periodontal regeneration is a challenge in the context of molecular redundancy associated with multiple isoforms. Epithelial / mesenchymal tissue interactions are closely modulated by several pleiotropic actions of soluble molecular signals in mineralized and non-mineralized tissues. Significant advances in regenerative tissue engineering rely on fine tuning of activity profiles of redundant isoforms of human osteogenic proteins towards more streamlined activity. Accurate dissemination of active agents to connective tissue and bone, underscores regenerative procedures. Targeted therapy comprising slow release devices, loaded scaffolds, fillers and vehicular microcapsules, delivers stimulatory agents over critical temporal phases of wound healing. Techniques for tissue engineering and gene therapy enhance expansion of cell populations and protein expression.

The publication of a series of logical manuscripts was at the origin of the Leibniz renaissance at the beginning of the twentieth century. In subsequent decades, this renaissance has been fostered by the publication of a wealth of manuscripts in the extraordinary variety of fields of Leibniz's inquiry - from metaphysics to physics, from mathematics to jurisprudence, from medicine to natural and revealed theology. The study of these texts has transformed historiography on Leibniz, showing how his theoretical interests were part of an ultimately practical, over-arching project of moral and religious inspiration, aiming at the improvement of the human condition and at the promotion of the common good. This paper follows the main phases of this transformation, from Bertrand Russell's monograph of 1900 to the challenges currently facing Leibniz historiography. ? 2014 Vita e Pensiero / Pubblicazioni dell'Universit?

London has the UK's most ethnically diverse areas but presents challenges in resident-based data collection due to the large number of hospitals. Aims: To investigate the rates and characteristics of self-poisoning presentations in two central London boroughs. Method: All incident cases of self-poisoning presentations of residents of Lambeth and Southwark were identifi ed over a 12-month period through comprehensive acute and mental health trust data collection systems at multiple hospitals. Analysis was done using STATA 12.1. Results: A rate of 121.4/100,000 was recorded across a population of more than half a million residents. Women exceeded men in all measured ethnic groups. Black women presented 1.5 times more than white women. Gender ratios within ethnicities were marked. Among those aged younger than 24 years, black women were almost 7 times more likely to present than black men were. Conclusion: Self-poisoning is the commonest form of self-harm presentation to UK hospitals but population-based rates are rare.

Other cell types (fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, immune cells) and the extracellular matrix also play key roles in cardiac function, both in health and in disease. Excitation-contraction coupling links the electrical activation of cardiomyocytes to cellular contraction. Calcium is a key second messenger in this process; its entry into the cell triggers further calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which then activates the contractile machinery. Subsequent reduction in calcium concentration brings about cardiac relaxation, which is necessary for the heart to re-fill. Calcium also regulates other critical processes in the heart including transcription of genes and the matching of energy supply from the mitochondria with cellular demand. In health, the contractile function of the heart is regulated by several factors, including its loading conditions, autonomic influences and many locally produced autocrine/paracrine agents. These factors alter contractile strength through two main mechanisms, namely the modulation of the calcium transient within cardiomyocytes and/or changes in myofilament sensitivity to calcium. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Design: A face-to-face, questionnaire-facilitated survey among Black African, Black Caribbean and South Asian parents. Setting: An opportunistic sample of parents was recruited from Sure Start centres, churches and play groups across key London boroughs. Subjects: Three hundred and forty-nine interviews were included; 107 Black African, fifty-four Black Caribbean, 120 South Asian and sixty-four of Black mixed-race ethnicity. Results: Fifty-two per cent of Black and 66 % of South Asian parents had accurate understanding of the guidelines. Inaccurate knowledge of the guidelines was associated with weaning before 17 weeks (P < 0.001); 36 % of Black Africans and 31 % of Black Caribbeans were weaned before 4 months compared with 16 % of South Asians. All BME groups were most influenced by weaning information from the previous generations of mothers in their families, which was associated with earlier weaning (21.5 (sd 6.5) v. 24.1 (sd 4.2) weeks; F(2,328) = 5.79, P = 0.003), and less so by professional infant feeding advice, which was associated with a later weaning age (23.7 (sd 5.1) v. 20.7 (sd 5.7) weeks; F(1,344) = 34.7, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Lack of awareness of the Department of Health weaning guidelines is common among these BME populations, whose weaning behaviour is strongly influenced by informal advice. Further research is necessary to elucidate the influences on weaning in these populations and to facilitate the development of infant feeding support which is salient for BME groups in the UK.

Methods Case report with 42 months follow-up. Case description An 81-year-old man, who had never suffered from headache before July 2010, developed strictly left-sided headaches. The pain was restricted to the left side of the scalp and felt more intense in the frontal area. The intensity was moderate to high with a throbbing quality. The pain had an orthostatic component and was worsened by neck hyperextension and Valsalva maneuvers. Neurological and general examinations were normal, except for a reduced range of motion of the neck. He was prescribed indomethacin orally 25mg t.i.d. and had a partial response. After a week, he was given a dosage of 50mg t.i.d. with complete remission of the pain. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal, while an magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine showed a non-homogeneous mass behind the odontoid process of C2, narrowing the subarachnoid space in C1, stretching the posterior longitudinal ligament, and touching the left vertebral artery. A computed tomography scan showed calcification of the soft tissue around the odontoid process and a thickening of the left C2 root. After 4 months, the indomethacin dosage was reduced step-by-step. Indomethacin was discontinued in March 2012. Since then, the headache has not recurred. Discussion We here present the case of a patient with headache and radiological findings of crowned dens. However, the clinical presentation differed from previous CDS cases in the literature in that the pain was unilateral with frontal localization and throbbing quality, as well as an orthostatic component and lack of either fever or inflammatory signs. The differential diagnosis also includes a remitting form of hemicrania continua, presenting with an atypical presentation, with neuroimaging incidental finding of CDS. Conclusion This case widens the spectrum of the clinical presentation of crowned dens, a condition that should be kept in mind in cases of unilateral headache in older patients. ? 2014 American Headache Society.",crowned dens syndrome; hemicrania continua; postural change; unilateral headache; Valsalva,"indometacin; indometacin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; aged; article; case report; cervical spine; computer assisted tomography; Crowned Dens syndrome; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug withdrawal; follow up; headache; human; male; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; odontoid process; pain assessment; posterior longitudinal ligament; priority journal; range of motion; remission; soft tissue calcification; spine disease; spondylosis; subarachnoid space; Valsalva maneuver; vertebral artery; very elderly; whiplash injury; X ray analysis; calcinosis; complication; connective tissue; headache; neck pain; pathology; radiography; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Calcinosis; Cervical Vertebrae; Connective Tissue; Headache; Humans; Indomethacin; Male; Neck Pain",2-s2.0-84904503699

It was found that children with atopic dermatitis were significantly more likely to have varicella zoster virus infection complicated by cellulitis (21% versus 6%; p=0.05), haemorrhagic varicella (14% versus 2%; p=0.04) and superimposed 'skin and soft tissue infection' (61% versus 34%; p=0.008).

This study modelled the diffusion signal by intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) to obtain parameters related to the vasculature and tissue diffusion. This revealed a small vascular contribution to the signal in tumor and peri-tumoral stroma within 8 mm. Monoexponential fitting performed worse than the IVIM model in tumor and stroma within 8 mm, but was sufficient in more distal stromal regions where lower microvessel density is expected.

Additionally, muscle activity of the diaphragm and the extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles varies during different sleep stages. Nonetheless respiration during sleep remains stable in healthy subjects. In patients with ventilatory insufficiency caused by uni- or bilateral diaphragm paralysis or other neuromuscular diseases respiration is most vulnerable during sleep. Hence, sleep disordered breathing is frequently seen in early stages of these diseases. Simple lung function studies like spirometry in upright and supine position can provide first evidence towards the presence of sleep disordered breathing. Only later during the course of the diseases patients will present with symptoms of disturbed sleep and ventilatory insufficiency. Goal of the care in patients with diaphragmatic paralysis and neuromuscular disorders must be to diagnose sleep-related breathing disorders early on and to initiate appropriate therapy in the form of non-invasive ventilation in order to improve quality of life and prognosis of these patients. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Neuromuscular disease; Polysomnography; Respiration; Sleep, REM; Vital capacity",article; diaphragm paralysis; human; lung function; neuromuscular disease; noninvasive ventilation; pathophysiology; prognosis; quality of life; sleep; sleep disordered breathing; sleep stage; supine position,2-s2.0-84903869302

Nocturnal sleep (23:00-07:00) followed by next-day performance (09:00-17:00) was studied in 12 subjects administered 100, 200, 300 mg modafinil and placebo, 0.5 h before bedtime. Performance overnight (19:00-08:45) followed by sleep (09:15-15:15) was studied in nine subjects administered 100, 200, 300, 400 mg modafinil, 300 mg caffeine and placebo at 22:15. Modafinil dose-dependently reduced sleep duration (nocturnal: 200 mg, p<0.05; 300 mg, p<0.001; morning: 300 and 400 mg, p<0.05) and REM sleep (nocturnal: 300 mg; morning: 400 mg; p<0.05). The statistical model revealed that reduced REM sleep was due to alerting activity, with no evidence of direct suppression of REM sleep, suggesting dopaminergic activity. Enhanced performance with modafinil during overnight work varied with dose (200 mg>100 mg; 300, 400 mg>200, 100 mg, caffeine). However, in the study of next-day performance, the enhancement was attenuated at the highest dose (300 mg) by the greater disturbance of prior sleep.

The framework has then been applied to a brain cancer gene expression profile derived from Affymetrix Human Genome U95Av2 Array, where the number of interrogated genes is six times larger than that in the previously studied colon cancer data set. Three information theory based filters were used for comparison. Our experimental results show that the framework outperforms them in terms of classification performance based upon three performance measures. Additionally, to demonstrate how effectively feature interdependence can be tackled within the framework, two sets of enrichment analysis have also been performed. The results also show that more statistically significant gene sets and regulatory interactions could be found in our gene signature. Therefore, this framework could be promising for high-throughput gene selection around gene synergy.",Brain cancer; Feature interdependence; Feature selection; Gene signature selector; Microarray data analysis,Artificial intelligence; Feature extraction; Gene expression; Information theory; Brain cancer; Classification performance; Feature interdependence; Gene expression profiles; Gene signatures; High-throughput technologies; Microarray data analysis; Regulatory interactions; Diseases,2-s2.0-84902330885

Automatic prostate segmentation can improve speed, reproducibility and consistency of the process. In this work, we propose a method for automatic segmentation of the prostate in magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) images. The method utilizes the complementary property of the elastogram and the corresponding T2-weighted image, which are obtained from the phase and magnitude components of the imaging signal, respectively. It follows a variational approach to propagate an active contour model based on the combination of region statistics in the elastogram and the edge map of the T2-weighted image. The method is fast and does not require prior shape information. The proposed algorithm is tested on 35 clinical image pairs from five MRE data sets, and is evaluated in comparison with manual contouring. The mean absolute distance between the automatic and manual contours is 1.8mm, with a maximum distance of 5.6mm. The relative area error is 7.6%, and the duration of the segmentation process is 2s per slice. ? 2014 SPIE.",Active contours; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance elastography; Prostate cancer,Diseases; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Urology; Active contours; Automatic segmentations; Complementary property; Magnetic resonance elastography; Mean absolute distance; Prostate cancers; Prostate segmentation; Variational approaches; Image segmentation,2-s2.0-84902118264

Abnormal blood-flow patterns include high-speed jet flow and regurgitant flow. Such pathological blood-flow patterns are nowadays mostly inspected by means of color Doppler ultrasound imaging. To date, Doppler ultrasound has been the prevailing modality for blood-flow analysis, providing non-invasive and cost-effective blood-flow imaging. Since recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly employed to measure time-resolved blood-flow data. Albeit more expensive, MRI enables volumetric velocity encoding, providing true vector-valued data with less noise. Domain experts in the field of ultrasound and MRI have extensive experience in the interpretation of blood-flow information, although they employ different analysis techniques. We devise a visualization framework that extends on common Doppler ultrasound visualizations, exploiting the added value of MRI velocity data, and aiming for synergy between the domain experts. Our framework enables experts to explore the advantages and disadvantages of the current renditions of their imaging data. Furthermore, it facilitates the transition from conventional Doppler ultrasound images to present-day high-dimensional velocity fields. To this end, we present a virtual probe that enables direct exploration of MRI-acquired blood-flow velocity data using user-friendly interactions. Based on the probe, Doppler ultrasound inspired visualizations convey both in-plane and through-plane blood-flow velocities. In a compound view, these two-dimensional visualizations are linked to state-of-the-art three-dimensional blood-flow visualizations. Additionally, we introduce a novel volume rendering of the blood-flow velocity data that emphasizes anomalous blood-flow patterns. The visualization framework was evaluated by domain experts, and we present their feedback. ? 2014 SPIE.",Blood flow; Cardiovascular; Doppler ultrasound; MRI; Visualization and interaction,Computer aided diagnosis; Data visualization; Flow patterns; Flow velocity; Hemodynamics; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Non Newtonian flow; Probes; Ultrasonic imaging; Velocity; Visualization; Volume rendering; Blood flow; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardiovascular; Color Doppler ultrasounds; Different analysis techniques; Doppler ultrasound; Doppler ultrasound images; Visualization framework; Blood,2-s2.0-84902108581

Its link with multiple etiological pathways has been studied before. Inflammatory markers have been demonstrated to predict similar mental and physical disorders as neuroticism. However, currently no study has focused on the shared genetic background of neuroticism and inflammatory markers. In the present study we will focus on the phenotypic and genetic relationship between neuroticism and three commonly used inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and Immunoglobulin-G (IgG). Material and Methods: The study was conducted in 125 Dutch female twin pairs. For each participant, four different neuroticism scores were available to calculate a neuroticism composite score that was used in the statistical analyses. Blood samples for inflammatory marker determination were taken after an overnight fast. Heritabilities, phenotypic and genetic correlations were estimated using bivariate structural equation modeling. Results: Heritabilities are fair for neuroticism (0.55), CRP (0.52) and fibrinogen (0.67) and moderate for IgG (0.43). No significant phenotypic or genetic correlations were found between neuroticism and the inflammatory markers. Interaction models yielded no moderation of the genetic and environmental pathways in the regulation of inflammatory markers by neuroticism. Conclusion: Substantial heritabilities were observed for all variables. No evidence was found for significant shared (or moderation of) genetic or environmental pathways underlying neuroticism and inflammatory status. ?

METHOD: 20 young, healthy male subjects were recruited. One hundred compressions divided into four sets, with roughly six seconds between each set to indicate 'ventilation', were performed within approximately a 1.5 minute protocol. Chest compression rate, depth and number were measured along with the subject's heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). RESULTS: All mean values were used in two-tailed t-tests using SPSS to compare +1 Gz values (control) versus simulated hypogravity values. The AHA (2005) compression standards were maintained in hypogravity. RPE and HR increased by 32% (p<0.001) and 44% (p=0.002), respectively, when ECCs were performed during Mars simulation, in comparison to +1 Gz. In hypogravity, the triceps brachii showed significantly less activity (p<0.001) when compared with the other three muscles studied. The comparison of all the other muscles showed no difference at +1 Gz or in hypogravity. CONCLUSIONS: This study was among the first of its kind, however several limitations were faced which hopefully will not exist in future studies. Evaluation of a great number of muscles will allow space crews to focus on specific strengthening exercises within their current training regimes in case of a serious cardiac event in hypogravity.

His great interest became the genesis and repair of cleft lip and palate and, in addition to clinical work, he undertook an experimental study of the embryology of cleft palate in pregnant rats exposed to three teratogenic agents. The microscopic work was carried out in his garden shed in Christchurch. His groundbreaking work on amniotic puncture at a critical period came to international notice and he was given the first Chair in Teratology of the Royal College of Surgeons. In experimental studies he showed that thalidomide induced focal haemorrhage in the developing embryo. Poswillo was also Consultant Oral Surgeon at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead and his skills as surgeon and teacher attracted numerous trainee surgeons. He was Professor of Oral Surgery in Adelaide and then in London. Poswillo was Chairman of two advisory committees whose lucid reports on anaesthesia, sedation and resuscitation in dentistry (Poswillo Report) and on tobacco and health were far-reaching and influential.

They have an important role in many human cancers, including malignant melanoma. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been used to investigate S100 expression in melanoma tissue sections. This study aimed to determine the accuracy and sensitivity of these two types of antibodies in detecting S100 proteins in paraffin processed tissue cases of malignant melanoma. The study compared routinely used rabbit polyclonal anti-S100 antibody raised against both anti-S100A and B isoforms (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), as per studies by Timar16, and compared and contrasted findings with mouse monoclonal anti-S100A and anti-S100B antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The study involved the assessment of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 56 cases of malignant melanoma, consisting of 23 superficial spreading, nine nodular, eight lentigo maligna, five acral lentigenous forms, five metastatic melanomas (two sentinel lymph node positive cases and three cases of nodal involvement from cases of elective nodal groin dissections), and six cases of desmoplastic malignant melanoma (DMM). The slides were stained by immunohistochemical methods on an automated platform (BenchMark XT; Roche, USA) and employing the iView detection system. All slides were examined by routine light microscopy by two independent assessors. The best results for both intensity of staining and percentage of positive tumor cells were achieved with polyclonal anti-S100 antibody and monoclonal anti-S100B antibody. Anti-S100A antibody yielded weaker staining intensity (with mean intensity of 1·8, compared to 2·8 for both anti-S100B antibody and polyclonal anti-S100 antibody), and a lower percentage of positive melanoma cells (an average of 74% for anti-S100A, compared to 95% for both anti-S100B antibody and polyclonal anti-S100 antibody). This result was statistically significant (P&lt;0·01). Staining in cases of DMM gave the same results (P&lt;0·01). The conclusion from this study is that polyclonal anti-S100 antibody and monoclonal anti-S100B antibody are more suitable than monoclonal anti-S100A antibody for diagnostic investigations of malignant melanoma, irrespective of the histological type of melanoma. ?

PARTICIPANTS: 554 adults, 55% females, on HIV treatment for at least two years at two public hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective cohort design, tracing changes in study participants' formal employment status since the first HIV-positive diagnosis. Data collection included historical medical records review and interviewer-administered questionnaires. RESULTS: 44% of all study participants (39% and 49% among males and females, respectively) were formally employed at the time of the study, primarily in low-skilled jobs in the private sector. The majority (83%) of males and 60% of females remained in formal employment since being diagnosed as HIV-positive. Female gender, education to grade 12 or higher, a smaller household size and being married were significantly associated with current formal employment. Formal employment was unrelated to HIV treatment indicators (CD4 count, viral load and duration since diagnosis). Of those in formal employment, 68 (28%) were aware of HIV policies at their workplaces, which was also positively associated with the duration in their current employment. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: PLHIV in developing country contexts can enter into and maintain formal employment, especially when treatment and workplace support are available. Thus, employer organisations should implement effective workplace HIV policies to enhance employment experiences of their workforce living with HIV. Care and support services for people on HIV treatment should also address their career development needs. ? 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.",Chronic illness; Employment continuation; South Africa; Stigma; Workplace HIV policies,adult; blood; CD4 lymphocyte count; developing country; employment; female; HIV Seropositivity; human; male; middle aged; organization and management; personnel management; policy; retrospective study; socioeconomics; South Africa; statistics and numerical data; time; virus load; workplace; Adult; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Developing Countries; Employment; Female; HIV Seropositivity; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organizational Policy; Personnel Selection; Retrospective Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa; Time Factors; Viral Load; Workplace,2-s2.0-84900439449

Methods: We identified all subjects in the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) during the period January 2007-December 2010 for whom information was recorded which identified their psychiatric co-morbidity status and their HCV status. Multivariate analysis was used to identify risk factors that could predict HCV infection. Results and conclusions: The HCV prevalence rate was 32%. HCV infected subjects were younger (21.4% versus 23.1%) when they first started to use drugs, they were more likely to be white (85.1% versus 13.1%) and male (74% versus 72.6%), to have urgent housing problems (13.0% versus 9.7%), to inject (42.8% versus 18.8%), and to share injecting paraphernalia (35.4% versus 9.2%). After adjusting for demographics and drug and alcohol use behaviours, the Odds Ratio of psychiatric co-morbidity for HCV infection was 1.33 (95% CI 1.01-1.75).

Mental health problems in parents who misuse alcohol may impact parenting in specific ways, and these may be different for mothers and for fathers. The purpose of this paper is to make a preliminary investigation of alcohol misuse and mental health problems in mothers, and explore ways in which these might affect their parenting. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with professionals involved in services for mothers who misuse alcohol, including those working in addiction psychiatry, in primary care, and in the provision of parenting services. These interviews were then examined using thematic analysis. Findings: Themes emerged including specific mental health problems (depression, anxiety and personality disorders), and related issues, such as self-medication. Particularly relevant for mothers were post-natal depression, the effect on maternal alcohol misuse and mental health when children are removed, the role of domestic violence, and the importance for identification of home visits by services. Different types of alcohol misuse were linked to different mental states and different parenting behaviours in parents. Findings in the general parenting and substance misuse literature were confirmed, and a new addition was that expressed emotion may play a role in families where mothers misuse alcohol. Originality/value: The findings increased the understanding of the relationships between maternal alcohol misuse, mental health issues and parenting, raising several new points for consideration. ?

Little is known about pupils' experiences of ED within a school setting. Method: Five hundred and eleven 11- to 19-year-old school pupils completed an online questionnaire exploring their experiences of ED (72% female, 28% male). Responses were analysed using content analysis principles. Results: Of the participants, 38% had a current or past ED, 49% of these had never received a formal diagnosis. Of the respondents, 59% saw a need to raise ED awareness. Only 7% would confide in a teacher about an ED. Conclusions: Efforts are needed to break down barriers to disclosure and support teachers to play an effective role in the detection and early intervention for ED. ? 2013 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.",Anorexia; Binge-eating disorder; Bulimia; Eating disorders; School; Teacher,adolescent; adult; article; child; eating disorder; female; health education; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; questionnaire; school child; teacher,2-s2.0-84897502961

This first national survey aimed to determine the nature of pharmacological treatments delivered in England including the extent of maintenance therapy, supervised consumption and specialties prescribing. Method: Data were gathered regarding opiate substitutes & other medications prescribed for opiate, alcohol & benzodiazepine dependence, drug & alcohol relapse prevention and comorbidities. Evidence of distinct approaches to younger compared with older adolescents was sought. Results: The overall response rate was 73%. The majority treated were over 16 years. 85% treatments were opiate substitute therapies; many received longer term maintenance therapy. Prescribing for alcohol dependence & comorbidity was low; the largest prescribing group were General Practitioners. Conclusions: Questions remain about the scale of youth dependence, the use of substitute agents in maintenance treatment and the number of adolescent addiction specialists in the treatment cadre. ? 2013 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.",,acamprosate; antidepressant agent; atomoxetine; atypical antipsychotic agent; benzodiazepine derivative; buprenorphine; chlordiazepoxide; codeine; disulfiram; fluoxetine; lofexidine; melatonin; methadone; methylphenidate; naltrexone; psychotropic agent; risperidone; zopiclone; adolescent; adolescent health; adult; age; alcohol withdrawal; alcoholism; article; benzodiazepine dependence; comorbidity; drug detoxification; general practitioner; health survey; human; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; medical specialist; opiate addiction; patient compliance; practice guideline; prescription; prevalence; priority journal; psychopharmacotherapy; substance abuse; treatment duration; United Kingdom; withdrawal syndrome; young adult,2-s2.0-84897498399

The patient was referred to a specialist endodontic practice for management of an upper right central incisor tooth. A CBCT scan was performed. The images of the left maxillary sinus showed a total lack of pneumatisation, prompting the diagnosis of aplasia. The patient's otolaryngologist was made aware of the findings. Clinical evaluation of volumetric images should be performed by an adequately trained dentist or radiologist so the maximum amount of information is gathered for the patient.

AIM: To review the changes in the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD in DSM-5, compared to DSM-IV. METHOD: The diagnostic criteria for ASD and ADHD in DSM-IV and DSM-5 are compared. The new diagnostic criteria are summarised and relevant literature is discussed. RESULTS: The new category ASD includes the majority of the pervasive developmental disorders; however, in DSM-5, patients without stereotypical patterns of behaviour or interests will, from now on, be classified as having Social Communication Disorder.The threshold for meeting the diagnostic criteria for ADHD has been lowered slightly. However, this is supported by clinical and epidemiological data and is unlikely to result in over-diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Research into subtypes of ASD may stagnate as a result of the changes introduced in DSM-5. For clinicians, the diagnostic criteria for ASD and ADHD may be more clear-cut and possibly more user-friendly than the diagnostic criteria for these disorders as given in DSM-IV.",ADHD; Autism; DSM-5,"article; attention deficit disorder; autism; developmental disorder; diagnostic test accuracy study; DSM-5; DSM-IV; human; neurologic disease; social communication disorder; stereotypy; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Child, Preschool; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Humans; Psychometrics; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-84896481369

Achieving balance-between hypo- and hyper-glycaemia; between energy intake and energy consumption; between insulin action and insulin secretion; between attention to diabetes and attention to everything else-remains challenging, but progress has been made over the last three decades, both in our understanding of how nature achieves balance and in the tools we have to try to reproduce the actions of nature in disease states. In particular, the role of the brain in controlling diabetes, from glucose sensing to decision making, has been investigated.

At present, it is unclear whether the glutamatergic system is affected in these disorders. In this study, we measured α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor GluA subunits in the postmortem neocortex of a cohort of prospectively studied Lewy body dementia cases, as well as age-matched controls by immunoblotting. We found losses of GluA2/3/4 immunoreactivities in Lewy body dementias which correlated with higher pre-death Hoehn and Yahr scores and with longer Parkinson's disease duration before dementia onset, but not with dementia severity, cortical Lewy body burden, or amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burden. Our study suggests that GluA2/3/4 losses may be a neurochemical marker of motor disability in Lewy body dementias. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",AMPA receptors; Glutamatergic system; Lewy body dementia; Motor function; Neocortex,"AMPA receptor; levodopa; aged; amyloid plaque; article; clinical feature; controlled study; diffuse Lewy body disease; disease severity; female; human; human tissue; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; male; motor dysfunction; neocortex; neurofibrillary tangle; Parkinson disease; pH; priority journal; senile plaque; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Lewy Body Disease; Male; Motor Skills; Neocortex; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Plaque, Amyloid; Protein Subunits; Receptors, AMPA; Severity of Illness Index",2-s2.0-84892674721
