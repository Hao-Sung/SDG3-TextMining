The independent variables tested were participant gender, visual task condition (30??min and 60??min), and length of rest time (5??min, 10??min, and 15??min). The critical fusion frequency (CFF) value and simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) scores were used as dependent measures. Gender showed no significant effect on CFF values or SSQ scores. Greater CFF values and SSQ scores were produced by the 60-min visual task than the 30-min visual task. The results of this study suggest that after completing a 30-min visual task, a rest time of at least 10??min is necessary for participants to recover, and a rest time of more than 15??min needs to follow a 60-min visual task. ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Critical fusion frequency; Optical head-mounted display; Simulator sickness questionnaire; Visual fatigue; Visually induced motion sickness,Diseases; Helmet mounted displays; Human engineering; Street traffic control; Surveys; Virtual reality; Vision; Critical fusion frequency; Induced motions; Optical heads; Simulator sickness; Visual fatigue; Wearable technology,2-s2.0-85068216258

However, pathogens often build up antibiotic resistance over time, leading to serious failure of the treatment. Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) is an appealing alternative, but successful treatment of the bacterial infection requires a plentiful supply of AgNP, which can negatively impact human health if people are excessively exposed to the particles. Here, we present a method to overcome this challenge by synthesizing nanodiamond-supported AgNP noncovalently conjugated with albumin molecules to achieve enhanced antibacterial activity and strengthened biocompatibility. Using Escherichia coli as a model bacterium, we found that the albumin-conjugated silver-diamond nanohybrids showed a long-term bactericidal effect after 36 days of the treatment at the AgNP concentration of 250 ?g mL?1. Moreover, the toxicity of the nanohybrids to human cells (including human fibroblasts, lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, and breast adenocarcinoma cells) is low even at the particle concentration of 500 ?g mL?1. The method provides a general and practical solution to the concerns of bacterial resistance against AgNP and issues associated with the size, shape, aggregation, and toxicity of AgNP are largely resolved. Finally, we demonstrate that the nanohybrids can be readily incorporated into natural polysaccharides (such as guar gum) to form three-in-one hydrogels, showing promising applications in nanomedicine. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85072128576

The expression of CTSS was knocked down using siRNA transfection, and enzymatic activity was inhibited by the highly-selective CTSS inhibitor RJW-58. The results of in vitro functional assays, western blot analysis, and an in vivo colonization model demonstrated that CTSS was positively related to cellular adhesive ability. Moreover, both CTSS knockdown and inhibition significantly decreased Ca2+ influx via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) without changing STIM1 and Orai1 expression levels, while RJW-58 dose-dependently reduced the activation of the Ca2+-dependent downstream effectors, NFAT1 and Rac1. The results of immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CTSS could bind to STIM1, which was reversed by CTSS inhibition. In addition, confocal microscopy and super-resolution imaging showed that CTSS inhibition led to STIM1 puncta accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced the interaction between active STIM1 and EB1. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that the lysosomal cysteine protease, CTSS, plays an important role in mediating Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating STIM1 trafficking, which leads to the suppression of cell migration and invasion. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Ca2+; Cathepsin S (CTSS); Lysosomal cysteine protease; Metastasis; Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE),calcium ion; calcium release activated calcium channel 1; cathepsin S; eb1 protein; nfat1 protein; protein; Rac1 protein; small interfering RNA; stromal interaction molecule 1; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer cell; cell adhesion; cell invasion; cell motility; confocal microscopy; controlled study; downstream processing; endoplasmic reticulum; enzyme activity; female; GBM8401 cell line; gene knockdown; genetic transfection; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; NOD SCID mouse; nonhuman; OECM-1 cell line; PC-9 cell line; priority journal; store operated calcium entry; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85071494468

Through the combination of morphological manipulation of active layer and interfacial engineering, the resulting OSCs deliver a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.09%. Importantly, large-area (216 cm2) blade-coated bulk-heterojunction OSCs is also demonstrated, and the resulting devices deliver a high PCE up to 5.03%, which is comparable to those of the devices processed with halogenated solvents (PCE = 5.20%). Additionally, the devices processed with halogen-free solvents also exhibit superior stability, maintaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 3960 h of continuous operation. More encouragingly, halogen-free solvents-based manufacturing process can also be performed under ambient conditions, and a moderate PCE of 3.67% is attained for large-area (216 cm2) OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 3.67% represents the highest efficiency ever reported for air-processed large-area OSCs. This work paves the way towards the realization of environmentally-friendly large-area OSCs with high performance and long-term stability. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Air-processing; Blade-coating; Halogen-free solvent; Large area; Organic solar cells,Butyric acid; Carboxylation; Coatings; Efficiency; Halogenation; Heterojunctions; Organic solvents; Air processing; Blade coatings; Halogen-free; Large area; Manufacturing process; Morphological manipulations; N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; Power conversion efficiencies; Organic solar cells,2-s2.0-85071398493

Heart rhythm complexity analysis is derived from non-linear heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and has shown excellent performance in predicting clinical outcomes in several cardiovascular diseases. However, heart rhythm complexity has not previously been studied in pulmonary hypertension patients. We prospectively analyzed 57 patients with pulmonary hypertension (31 with pulmonary arterial hypertension and 26 with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) and compared them to 57 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Heart rhythm complexity including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and multiscale entropy (MSE) and linear HRV parameters were analyzed. The patients with pulmonary hypertension had significantly lower mean RR, SDRR, pNN20, VLF, LF, LF/HF ratio, DFAα1, MSE slope 5, scale 5, area 1–5 and area 6–20 compared to the controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that heart rhythm complexity parameters were better than traditional HRV parameters to predict pulmonary hypertension. Among all parameters, scale 5 had the greatest power to differentiate the pulmonary hypertension patients from controls (AUC: 0.845, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, adding heart rhythm complexity parameters significantly improved the discriminatory power of the traditional HRV parameters in both net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement models. In conclusion, the patients with pulmonary hypertension had worse heart rhythm complexity. MSE parameters, especially scale 5, had excellent single discriminatory power to predict whether or not patients had pulmonary hypertension. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85069707758

Nonetheless, the incidence and determinants of post-intervention thrombotic events are unclear. This prospective cohort study evaluated the incidence and timing of thrombotic events after endovascular therapy and analysed the clinical, angiographic, and biological determinants of thrombosis. Of the 236 patients enrolled, 91 experienced post-intervention thrombotic events within 1 year. The 1-year thrombosis-free patency was 28% for thrombosed accesses, 53% for non-thrombosed grafts, and 78% for non-thrombosed fistulas. Forty-one of the 91 thrombotic events (45%) occurred within 3 months post-intervention. In the univariate analysis, early thrombosis was associated with longer haemodialysis duration (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.02), graft access (HR, 7.69; 95% CI, 3.33–20.0), multiple stenoses (HR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.36–5.37), and high indoxyl sulphate (IS) levels (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.32–1.82). Late thrombosis was associated with diabetes (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.01–3.57), cardiovascular disease (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.27–4.54), and endothelial progenitor cell counts (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99). After multivariate adjustment, high IS was the major predisposing factor for early post-intervention thrombosis (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.18–1.69). Our findings suggest that measures to decrease IS could target the most critical period of thrombosis. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85069643260

Numerous lung cancer cell types have exhibited electrotaxis under direct current electric fields (dcEF). Physiological electric fields (EF) play key roles in cancer cell migration. In this study, we investigated electrotaxis of NSCLC cells, including human large cell lung carcinoma NCI-H460 and human lung squamous cell carcinoma NCI-H520 cells. Non-cancerous MRC-5 lung fibroblasts were included as a control. After dcEF stimulation, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells, which both exhibit epithelial-like morphology, migrated towards the cathode, while MRC-5 cells, which have fibroblast-like morphology, migrated towards the anode. The effect of doxycycline, a common antibiotic, on electrotaxis of MRC-5, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells was examined. Doxycycline enhanced the tested cells’ motility but inhibited electrotaxis in the NSCLC cells without inhibiting non-cancerous MRC-5 cells.

Multiple stimuli regulate PKM2’s activity through allosteric modulation and post-translational modifications. Furthermore, PKM2 can partner with KDM8, an oncogenic demethylase and enter the nucleus to serve as a HIF1α co-activator. Yet, the mechanistic basis of the exon-10 region in allosteric regulation and nuclear translocation remains unclear. Here, we determined the?crystal structures and kinetic coupling constants of exon-10 tumor-related mutants (H391Y and R399E), showing altered structural plasticity and reduced allostery. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed increased interaction with KDM8 for H391Y, R399E, and G415R. We also found a higher degree of HIF1α-mediated transactivation activity, particularly in the presence of KDM8. Furthermore, overexpression of PKM2 mutants significantly elevated cell growth and migration. Together, PKM2 exon-10 mutations lead to structure-allostery alterations and increased nuclear functions mediated by KDM8 in breast cancer cells. Targeting the PKM2-KDM8 complex may provide a potential therapeutic intervention. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85065896674

The N, S-GQDs and Au-PANI were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal pyrolysis and interfacial polymerization, respectively. Subsequently, 2–9 nm N, S-GQDs are successfully decorated onto 30–50 nm Au-PANI nanowires by Au-thiol linkage to serve as the bifunctional probe for amplifying the electrochemical activity as well as anchoring anti-CEA. The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI nanowires are excellent conducting materials to accelerate the electron transfer, while the formation of CEA antibody-antigen bioconjugates after the addition of CEA significantly increase the charge transfer resistance, and subsequently provides a highly stable and label-free immunoassay platform for the impedimetric detection of CEA.

The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI based immunosensor also shows high selectivity and stability over other cancer makers and amino acids. Moreover, this promising platform is successfully applied to the detection of CEA in human serum samples with excellent recovery of (96.0 ± 2.6)–(103 ± 3.8)%. These results clearly demonstrate a newly developed highly efficient and label-free impedimetric immunosensor for the detection of CEA using N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI nanowires as the biosensing probe, which can pave the gateway for the fabrication of high performance and robust impedimetric immunosensor to detect cancer makers in early stage of cancer diagnosis and therapy. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85065640638

Several inactivated H7N9 vaccines have been evaluated in clinical trials, including whole-virion vaccines, split vaccines and subunit vaccines. Recently, we developed a new suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cell line for influenza viruses production. However, the properties of purified antigen from sMDCK cells remain unclear. In this study, the stability of influenza H7N9 vaccine bulk derived from sMDCK cells was investigated, and the data were compared with the vaccine antigen derived from our characterized adhesion MDCK (aMDCK) cells in serum-free medium. The influenza H7N9 bulks derived from sMDCK and aMDCK cells were stored at 2–8 °C for different periods of time, and a number of parameters selected to monitor the H7N9 vaccine antigen stability were evaluated at each interval (1, 3 and 12 months). The monitored parameters included virus morphology, hemagglutinin (HA) activity, HA concentration, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. The sMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk showed similar morphology to that of the aMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk, and there were no obvious changes after the extended storage periods. Furthermore, the HA titer, HA concentration, and antigenicity of sMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk were stable after 28 months of storage. Finally, the results of hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization tests showed that sMDCK- and aMDCK-derived H7N9 vaccines had comparable immunogenicity. These results indicated that sMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk has good stability compared to that of aMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk.

In this study, recombinant H7 antigen was obtained from engineered stable clones of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for subsequent large-scale production. The stable CHO cell clones were also adapted to grow in serum-free suspension cultures. To improve the immunogenicity of the recombinant H7 antigens, we evaluated the use of a novel combination adjuvant of PELC and CpG (PELC/CpG) to augment the anti-H7N9 immune responses in mice.

However, the majority of PCa patients receiving the androgen deprivation therapy develop recurrent castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within two years. Chemotherapies show little effect on prolonging survival of CRPC patients and new treatments are needed. Previous studies reported that the extracts from rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) exhibit chemopreventive properties in some cancer models, including skin, liver and oesophagus cancers in animals. We therefore investigate if extracts from rooibos can suppress the proliferation of CRPC cells. Purpose: We investigated whether an aspalathin-rich green rooibos extract (GRT?; 12.78 g aspalathin/100 g extract) demonstrates anti-cancer activity against CRPC cells. Methods: High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to profile the major flavonoids in GRT. Hoechst-dye proliferation assay, 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assay and flow cytometry assay were used to explore the effects of GRT on the proliferation and cell cycle progression of CRPC cells. Comet assay was used to survey whether GRT induces apoptosis in CRPC cells. LNCaP 104-R1 xenograft nude mice model was used to determine the inhibitory effect of GRT on CRPC tumors in vivo. Micro-Western Array (MWA) and Western blot analysis were carried out to unravel the underlying molecular mechanism. Results: GRT contained aspalathin as the most abundant flavonoid. GRT suppressed the proliferation and survival of LNCaP 104-R1, LNCaP FGC and PC-3 PCa cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that GRT decreased the population of PCa cells in S phase but increased the cell population in G2/M phase. Comet assay confirmed that GRT induced apoptosis in LNCaP 104-R1 cells. Gavage of 400 mg/kg GRT suppressed LNCaP 104-R1 xenografts in castrated nude mice. MWA and Western blot analysis indicated that GRT treatment suppressed Akt1, phospho-Akt Ser473, Cdc2, Bcl-2, TRAF4 and Aven, but increased activated Caspase 3, cytochrome c, and p27Kip1. Overexpression of Akt rescued the suppressive effects of GRT on CRPC cells. Co-treatment of GRT with Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and Akt inhibitor GSK 690693 exhibited additive inhibitory effect on proliferation of CRPC cells. Conclusions: GRT suppresses the proliferation of CRPC cells via inhibition of Akt signaling. ? 2019",Akt; Apoptosis; Aspalathin; Castration-resistant prostate cancer; Micro-Western Array; Rooibos,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; 4 [2 (4 amino 1,2,5 oxadiazol 3 yl) 1 ethyl 7 (3 piperidinylmethoxy) 1h imidazo[4,5 c]pyridin 4 yl] 2 methyl 3 butyn 2 ol; 4 [4 (4' chloro 2 biphenylylmethyl) 1 piperazinyl] n [4 [3 dimethylamino 1 (phenylthiomethyl)propylamino] 3 nitrobenzenesulfonyl]benzamide; antineoplastic agent; aspalathin; aven protein; bioquercitrin; caspase 3; cyclin dependent kinase 1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cytochrome c; flavonoid; green rooibos extract; hyperin; isoorientin; isoquercitrin; isovitexin; luteolin 7 glucoside; nothofagin; orientin; plant extract; protein; protein bcl 2; protein kinase B; rutoside; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 4; unclassified drug; vitexin; Akt signaling; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer survival; castration resistant prostate cancer; cell cycle M phase; cell cycle S phase; cell proliferation; cell viability; comet assay; controlled study; dose response; drug dose increase; enzyme phosphorylation; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; gene overexpression; herbal tea; high performance liquid chromatography; in vivo study; male; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression level; tumor xenograft; Western blotting",2-s2.0-85070529977

By using xenograft orthotopic implantation of prostate cancer PC3 cells and subsequently comparing bone metastatic with primary tumor-derived cancer cells, we find that H2S-producing?enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is upregulated in bone-metastatic PC3 cells. Clinical data further reveal that the expression of CTH is elevated in late-stage prostate cancer patients, and higher CTH expression correlates with poor survival from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate cancer RNA-seq datasets. CTH promotes NF-κB nuclear translocation through H2S-mediated sulfhydration on cysteine-38 of the NF-κB p65 subunit, resulting in increased IL-1β expression and H2S-induced cell invasion. Knockdown of CTH in PC3 cells results in the suppression of tumor growth and distant metastasis, while overexpression of CTH in DU145 cells promotes primary tumor growth and lymph node metastasis in the orthotopic implanted xenograft mouse model. Together, our findings provide evidence that CTH generated H2S promotes prostate cancer progression and metastasis through IL-1β/NF-κB signaling pathways. ? 2019 The Authors.

To limit GI proteolysis, a biomimetically mineralized aluminum-based metal–organic framework (Al-MOF) system that is resistant to ambient temperature and pH and can act synergistically as a delivery vehicle and an adjuvant is synthesized over a model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to act as armor. To overcome mucosal barriers, a yeast-derived capsule is used to carry the Al-MOF-armored OVA as a “Trojan Horse”-like transport platform. In vitro experiments reveal that the mineralization of Al-MOFs forms an armor on OVA that protects against highly acidic and degradative GI conditions. However, the mineralized Al-MOFs can gradually disintegrate in a phosphate ion-containing simulated intracellular fluid, slowly releasing their encapsulated OVA. In vivo studies reveal that the “Trojan Horse”-like transport platform specifically targets intestinal M cells, favoring the transepithelial transport of the Al-MOF-armored OVA, followed by subsequent endocytosis in local macrophages, ultimately accumulating in mesenteric lymph nodes, yielding long-lasting, high-levels of mucosal S-IgA and serum IgG antibodies. Such an engineered delivery platform may represent a promising strategy for the oral administration of prophylactic or therapeutic antigens for vaccination. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Although rapid and accurate detection can efficiently prevent its spread, the sensitivity and specificity of current rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are relatively low. In this study, a self-driven microfluidic device was developed to rapidly detect the H1N1 influenza virus via a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay. The device was capable of 1) virus isolation via H1N1-specific aptamers conjugated magnetic beads, 2) virus lysis, 3) isothermal nucleic acid amplification, and 4) colorimetric detection of the virus. The limit of detection was measured to be only 3 × 10?4 hemagglutinating units (HAU)/reaction, which is sensitive enough for clinical applications. The entire procedure could be performed in only 40 min by capillary forces through a novel polydimethylsiloxane surface treatment in cooperation with hydrophobic soft valves. This is the first time that a simple, self-driven passive microfluidic chip has been demonstrated to be capable of performing sample pretreatment, RT-LAMP, and H1N1 virus detection on a single chip. This microfluidic chip may therefore serve a promising RIDT with high sensitivity and high specificity for point-of-care diagnostics in the near future. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Capillary-driven; Influenza A (H1N1); Microfluidics; Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs); Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP),Diagnosis; Fluidic devices; Isotherms; Nucleic acids; Silicones; Surface treatment; Transcription; Viruses; Capillary-driven; Colorimetric detection; Diagnostic tests; Influenza A; Loop mediated isothermal amplifications; Micro-fluidic devices; Point of care diagnostic; Sensitivity and specificity; Microfluidics,2-s2.0-85066630800

However, full structural identification of glycans remains challenging. The glycan structure was conventionally determined by chemical methods or NMR spectroscopy, which require a large amount of sample and are not readily applicable for glycans extracted from biological samples. Although it has high sensitivity and is widely used for structural determination of molecules, current mass spectrometry can only reveal parts of the glycan structure. Herein, the full structures of glycans, including diastereomers, the anomericity of each monosaccharide, and the linkage position of each glycosidic bond, which can be determined by using tandem mass spectrometry guided by a logically derived sequence (LODES), are shown. This new method provides de novo oligosaccharide structural identification with high sensitivity and has been applied to automatic in situ structural determination of oligosaccharides eluted by means of HPLC. It is shown that the structure of a given trisaccharide from a trisaccharide mixture and bovine milk were determined from nearly 3000 isomers by using 6–7 logically selected collision-induced dissociation spectra. The entire procedure for mass spectrometry measurement guided by LODES can be programmed in a computer for automatic full glycan structure identification. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

An external electric field (EEF) is applied to direct the orientation of antibodies during their immobilization on a chip. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure the binding forces between immobilized antibody and targeting antigen under the influence of EEF at different angles. The maximum binding force under a specific angle (optimal angle; oa) of EEF (maxEEFoa) implies the optimal orientation of the antibodies on the chip. In this report, two different cancer carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecules 5 (CEACAM5) &amp; 1 (CEACAM1) were used for the examples of disease antigen detection. maxEEFoa of anti-CEACAM5 or anti-CEACAM1 immobilized on a general chip was firstly determined. Spectroscopy of AFM revealed that both binding forces were the largest ones with their antigens when maxEEFoa was applied as compared with no or other angles of EEF. These antibody proteins accompanied with the application of EEF were secondly immobilized on silicon-nanowires (n = 1000) and the field effects were measured (?I) as their target antigens were approached. Results showed that ?I was the largest ones when maxEEFoas (225°/270° and 135°/180° for anti-CEACAM5 and anti-CEACAM1, respectively) were applied as compared with other angles of EEF.

We aimed to examine the mortality benefit of metformin therapy in patients with type 2 DM and ACS, compared with non-metformin anti-diabetes agents users. Methods: Data were extracted from the prospective nationwide ACS-DM Taiwan Society of Cardiology registry. Propensity score (PS) matching on baseline characteristics and treatment measures was performed for metformin versus non-metformin users. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare mortality outcomes among the PS-matched cohort as the primary analysis. The Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for all pre-determined covariates and quintiles of the PS among the overall population were performed as the secondary analyses. Results: Of 1157 patients with type 2 DM and ACS receiving anti-diabetes agents, 78 patients (6.7%) died over the 2-year follow-up period. After PS matching, 318 metformin users were matched with 318 non-metformin users. Metformin users had a lower all-cause mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26–0.95) in the primary analysis.

Their levels of PI/EA were examined using the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II. The severity of IA was assessed using the Chen Internet Addiction Scale. The relationships among self- identity, PI/EA, and IA were examined using structural equation modeling. The severity of self-identity confusion was positively associated with both the severity of PI/EA and the severity of IA. In addition, the severity of PI/EA indicators was positively associated with the severity of IA. These results demonstrated that the severity of self-identity confusion was related to the severity of IA, either directly or indirectly. The indirect relationship was mediated by the severity of PI/EA. Self-identity confusion and PI/EA should be taken into consideration by the community of professionals working on IA.

In cancer staging, lymphatic spread has been used to assess the invasiveness of tumor cells. However, from the endothelium's perspective, the analysis downplays the peri-lesional activities of lymphatic vessels. This unintended bias is largely due to the lack of 3-dimensional (3-D) tissue information to depict the lesion microstructure and vasculature in a global and integrated fashion. Methods: We targeted the pancreas as the model organ to investigate lymphatic vessel remodeling in cancer lesion progression. Transparent pancreases were prepared by tissue clearing to facilitate deep-tissue, tile-scanning microscopy for 3-D lymphatic network imaging. Findings: In human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, we identify the close association between the pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions and the lymphatic network. In mouse models of PanIN (elastase-CreER;LSL-KrasG12D and elastase-CreER;LSL-KrasG12D;p53+/?), the 3-D image data reveal the peri-lesional lymphangiogenesis, endothelial invagination, formation of the bridge/valve-like luminal tubules, vasodilation, and luminal invasion. In the orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, we identify the localized, graft-induced lymphangiogenesis and the peri- and intra-tumoral lymphatic vessel invasion. Interpretation: The integrated view of duct lesions and vascular remodeling suggests an active role, rather than a passive target, of lymphatic vessels in the metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Our 3-D image data provide insights into the pancreatic cancer microenvironment and establish the technical and morphological foundation for systematic detection and 3-D analysis of lymphatic vessel invasion.

However, without an adjuvant, most subunit vaccines are poorly immunogenic. This work develops a bioinspired nanocomposite hyaluronic acid hydrogel system that incorporates N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (TMC/NPs) that carry a model subunit vaccine ovalbumin (OVA) that can elicit a potent and prolonged antigen-specific humoral response. Experimental results indicate that the nanocomposite hydrogel system (NPs-Gel) can retain a large proportion of its TMC/NPs that are bonded by covalent/electrostatic interactions and extend the release of the encapsulated OVA, enabling their localization at the site of hydrogel injection. The positively charged TMC/NPs can be effectively internalized by dendritic cells, significantly augmenting their maturation, suggesting that TMC can function as an adjuvant-based OVA delivery system. Upon subcutaneous implantation in mice, the NPs-Gel acts as an in situ depot that recruits and concentrates immune cells. The TMC/NPs that do not have any specific interactions with the hydrogel network are released rapidly and internalized by the neighboring immune cells, providing a priming dose, while those retained inside the NPs-Gel are ingested by the recruited and concentrated immune cells over time, acting as a booster dose, eliciting high titers of OVA-specific antibody responses. These experimental results suggest particulate vaccines that are integrated in such a bioinspired hydrogel system may be used as single-injection prime-boost vaccines, enabling effective and persistent humoral immune responses. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Adjuvant; Catechol; Nanocomposite hydrogel; Single-injection vaccine; Vaccine delivery,Cells; Cytology; Hyaluronic acid; Hydrogels; Mammals; Nanocomposites; Vaccines; Adjuvant; Catechol; Humoral immune response; Hyaluronic acid hydrogels; N-trimethyl chitosans; Nanocomposite hydrogels; Specific interaction; Vaccine delivery; Immune system; chitosan nanoparticle; hyaluronic acid; nanocomposite; ovalbumin; animal cell; animal experiment; antibody response; antibody titer; antigen specificity; Article; cell maturation; covalent bond; dendritic cell; drug delivery system; drug release; experimental study; host cell; humoral immunity; hydrogel; immunocompetent cell; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; priority journal; single drug dose; static electricity,2-s2.0-85067670463

Boron species are an essential element for plant growth and can cause health concerns in human beings at high concentrations in water environments. The composition of thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) contains a wide variety of metal oxides and can be tailored as promising functional mesoporous carriers for boron crystallization recovery in the presence of barium ions and hydrogen peroxide. In this study, waste-derived mesoporous aluminosilicate (MAS) nanomaterial in the presence of barium ions and hydrogen peroxide was used as a carrier for sustainable recovery of crystallized boron, a priority wastewaters pollutant. The MAS shows the hierarchically homogeneous distribution of nanostructured aluminosilicate particles with an average size of 12.8 ± 3.6 nm on the surface after the activation with Na2CO3 at 1000 °C. Moreover, the negatively charged surface and the mesoporous structure of MAS enhance the adsorption of Ba2+ onto MAS, and the Langmuir adsorption capacity of 105 mg/g is achieved, which is conducive to the enhancement of the recovery of boron species. Moreover, the recovery efficiency and crystallization ratio of boron by MAS can be up to 84.5 and 93.4%, respectively. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy images and the high-temperature X-ray diffraction results confirm the boron recovery mechanism that the negatively charged functional group as well as the mesoporosity of MAS triggers the rapid formation of needle-shaped precipitates of barium peroxoborate, and then converted to barium borate after calcination at 1050 °C. Results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate the possibility of fabricating environmentally benign mesoporous aluminosilicate adsorbents from TFT-LCD waste to sustainably recover and crystallize boron species from water and wastewater in COP-FBC.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is the main component of honey bee propolis. We determined if CAPE affects the signaling and stability of AR in PCa cells. Methods: Effects of CAPE on AR transcriptional activity and localization were determined by reporter gene assay and immunofluorescent microscopy. Western blotting, fluorescent polarization, computer simulation, and animal experiment were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism how CAPE reduces the stability of AR. Results: CAPE treatment dose-dependently suppressed the transcriptional activity of AR as well as the protein levels of AR and its target gene PSA. Cyclohexamide treatment revealed that androgen stabilized AR protein, but AR stability was diminished by CAPE. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that androgen promoted the nucleus translocation of AR in PCa cells, while treatment with CAPE reduced protein level of AR in both nucleus and cytoplasm. CAPE treatment suppressed the phosphorylation of Ser81 and Ser213 on AR, which regulates the stability of AR. CDK1 and AKT are the kinases phosphorylating Ser81 and Ser213 on AR, respectively. CAPE treatment significantly reduced the protein level and activity of CDK1 and AKT in PCa cells. Overexpression of CDK1 or AKT rescued the AR protein level under CAPE treatment. Conclusions: Our results suggested that CAPE treatment reduced AR stability and AR transcriptional activity in PCa cells, implying the possibility of using CAPE as a treatment for advanced PCa.

The mortality of cervical cancer has declined significantly primarily due to the widespread use of Pap smear tests as a screening test and therapeutic vaccination. However, cervical cancer still remains a severe disease among the female population, as the prognosis of metastatic cervical cancer is very poor. Key methods: In this study, we performed 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS to analyze differentially expressed proteins between HeLa and invasive HeLa-I5 cells. Key findings: According to our proteomics data, 68 differentially expressed proteins between the HeLa and HeLa-I5 cells were identified. One of these differentially expressed proteins, Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), was selected as a candidate for further studies. To correlate the role of PGRMC1 with cellular migration and cancer progression, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown the expression of PGRMC1. Similar function of PGRMC1 was also observed in two other cervical cancer lines, CaSki and ME-180. Significance: PGRMC1 plays an essential role in regulating cancer progression and metastasis of cervical cancer cells, thus serving as a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer. ? 2019",Cervical cancer; Metastasis; PGRMC1; Proteomics,"membrane protein; progesterone receptor membrane component 1; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; membrane protein; PGRMC1 protein, human; progesterone receptor; Article; Ca Ski cell line; cancer growth; cell function; cell migration; cervical adenocarcinoma cell line; controlled study; female; gene knockdown; HeLa cell line; HeLa I5 cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; ME-180 cell line; metastasis; protein expression; protein function; proteomics; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; uterine cervix cancer; cell motion; cell proliferation; genetics; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; metabolism; pathology; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; uterine cervix tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Female; HeLa Cells; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Proteomics; Receptors, Progesterone; RNA, Small Interfering; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85067417367

Using the established (CRISPR/Cas9 targeting promoters of SFRPs and targeting SFRPs transcript) system, we find that nuclear SFRPs interact with β-catenin and either promote or suppress TCF4 recruitment. SFRPs bind with β-catenin on both their N and C termini, which the repressive effects caused by SFRP-β-catenin-N-terminus binding overpower the promoting effects of their binding at the C terminus. By high Wnt activity, β-catenin and SFRPs only bind with their C termini, which results in the upregulation of β-catenin transcriptional activity and cancer stem cell (CSC)-related genes. Furthermore, we identify disulfide bonds of the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and two threonine phosphorylation events of the netrin-related motif (NTR) domain of SFRPs that are essential for their role as biphasic modulators, suggesting that SFRPs are biphasic modulators of Wnt signaling-elicited CSC properties beyond extracellular control. Liang et al. find that CRD and NTR domains of nuclear SFRPs induce opposite effects on Wnt signaling by interacting with distinct β-catenin regions to modulate TCF4 recruitment. Disulfide bonds of CRD domain and two threonine phosphorylation events of NTR domain in SFRPs are required to generate Wnt/β-catenin-elicited CSC properties. ? 2019 The Author(s)",cancer stem cell; CRISPR/Cas9; secreted frizzled-related protein; Wnt signaling,beta catenin; cysteine; netrin; nuclear protein; regulator protein; secreted frizzled related protein; secreted frizzled related protein 1; secreted frizzled related protein 2; secreted frizzled related protein 3; secreted frizzled related protein 4; secreted frizzled related protein 5; threonine; transcription factor 4; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; amino terminal sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer stem cell; carboxy terminal sequence; cellular parameters; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; extracellular matrix; female; human; human cell; human tissue; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; protein binding; protein domain; protein function; protein motif; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein transport; regulatory mechanism; transcription regulation; upregulation; Wnt signaling,2-s2.0-85069697202

We identified that AM630, a cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) antagonist, down-regulated leptin expression in mature adipocytes differentiated from either stromal vascular fractions isolated from inguinal fat pads of C57BL/6J mice or 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. However, the leptin-suppressive effects of AM630 preserved in CB2-deficient adipocytes indicated the off-target activity of AM630 in leptin expression. Pharmacological and genetic studies, cheminformatics, and docking simulation were applied to identify the potential protein target of AM630 that modulates leptin expression in differentiated primary preadipocytes. Screening of the reported off-targets of AM630 identified a synthetic cannabinoid WIN55212-2 exerting the same function. Target deconvolution and docking simulation suggested that AM630 and WIN55212-2 were both inhibitors of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS). Further studies showed that L-PGDS positively regulates leptin expression. Although glucocorticoid and aldosterone were previously reported to induce expression of both L-PGDS and leptin, our data demonstrated that L-PGDS mediates only glucocorticoid-induced leptin expression in differentiated primary preadipocytes. No effect was observed after aldosterone treatment. This newly discovered glucocorticoid – L-PGDS – leptin pathway may provide insights into current clinical use of glucocorticoid and management of their undesired effects such as obesity. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",AM630; Drug target; Glucocorticoid; Leptin; Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase,6 iodo 3 (4 methoxybenzoyl) 2 methyl 1 (2 morpholinoethyl)indole; glucocorticoid; leptin; lipocalin type prostaglandin d2 synthase; unclassified drug; adipocyte; animal cell; Article; cell differentiation; controlled study; down regulation; in vitro study; inguinal fat pad; male; mediator; molecular docking; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; proadipocyte; protein expression,2-s2.0-85066409694

This summary plot can inspect gene mutation rate and sample mutation burden with their relevant clinical details, which is a common first step for analyzing the recurrence and co-occurrence of gene mutations across samples. The cBioPortal and iCoMut are two web-based tools that allow users to create intricate visualizations from pre-loaded TCGA and ICGC data. For custom data analysis, only limited command-line packages are available now, making the production of CoMut plots difficult to achieve, especially for researchers without advanced bioinformatics skills. To address the needs for custom data and TCGA/ICGC data comparison, we have created CoMutPlotter, a web-based tool for the production of publication-quality graphs in an easy-of-use and automatic manner. Results: We introduce a web-based tool named CoMutPlotter to lower the barriers between complex cancer genomic data and researchers, providing intuitive access to mutational profiles from TCGA/ICGC projects as well as custom cohort studies. A wide variety of file formats are supported by CoMutPlotter to translate cancer mutation profiles into biological insights and clinical applications, which include Mutation Annotation Format (MAF), Tab-separated values (TSV) and Variant Call Format (VCF) files.

In addition to coding genes and miRNAs, the contribution of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to tumor metastatic dissemination and the mechanisms controlling their expression are areas of intensive investigation. Here, we show that lncRNA NORAD is downregulated in lung and breast cancers, and that NORAD low expression in these cancer types is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. NORAD is transcriptionally repressed by the Hippo pathway transducer YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex in conjunction with the action of NuRD complex. Functionally, NORAD elicits potent inhibitory effects on migration and invasion of multiple lung and breast cancer cell lines, and repression of NORAD expression participates in the migration- and invasion-stimulatory effects of the YAP pathway. Mechanistically, NORAD exploits its multiple repeated sequences to function as a multivalent platform for binding and sequestering S100P, thereby suppressing S100P-elicited pro-metastatic signaling network. Using cell and mouse models, we show that the S100P decoy function of NORAD suppresses lung and breast cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis.

Many AURKA mutations were identified in cancer patients. Overexpressing wild-type Aurka developed a low incidence of hepatic tumors after long latency in mice. However, none of the AURKA mutant animal models have ever been described. The mechanism of mutant AURKA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis is still unclear. A novel AURKA mutation with a.a.352 Valine to Isoleucine (V352I) was identified from clinical specimens. By using liver-specific transgenic fish overexpressing both the mutant and wild-type AURKA, the AURKA(V352I)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis was earlier and much more severe than wild-type AURKA. Although an increase of the expression of lipogenic enzyme and lipogenic factor was observed in both AURKA(V352I) and AURKA(WT) transgenic fish, AURKA(V352I) has a greater probability to promote fibrosis at 3 months compared to AURKA(WT). Furthermore, the expression levels of cell cycle/proliferation markers were higher in the AURKA(V352I) mutant than AURKA(WT) in transgenic fish, implying that the AURKA(V352I) mutant may accelerate HCC progression. Moreover, we found that the AURKA(V352I) mutant activates AKT signaling and increases nuclear β-catenin, but AURKA(WT) only activates membrane form β-catenin, which may account for the differences. In this study, we provide a new insight, that the AURKA(V352I) mutation contributes to early onset hepatocarcinogenesis, possibly through activation of different pathways than AURKA(WT). This transgenic fish may serve as a drug-screening platform for potential precision medicine therapeutics. ? 2019 by the authors.",AKT signaling pathway; Aurora A kinase (AURKA); Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); Zebrafish; β-catenin,"aurora A kinase; beta catenin; carbohydrate responsive element binding protein; cell protein; connective tissue growth factor; cycline; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; fatty acid synthase; heparanase; isoleucine; mammalian target of rapamycin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatidate phosphatase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase B; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; unclassified drug; valine; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; AURKA gene; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cell cycle; cell proliferation; cola1a1 gene; controlled study; ctgfa gene; disease severity; fibrosis; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; gene overexpression; hpse gene; liver carcinogenesis; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; transgenic fish; upregulation; zebra fish",2-s2.0-85068699567

Nevertheless, few studies have demonstrated the efficacy of first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs in patients harboring the uncommon p.L747P and p.L747S mutations in exon 19 of EGFR. Materials and methods: From 2005–2018, we identified patients with lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR p.L747P or p.L747S mutations using DNA and cDNA sequencing or commercial kits and recorded their clinical data. Published data pertaining to these mutations were also reviewed. Results: Twelve eligible patients were enrolled at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), and ten additional patients were identified in published literature. In NTUH cohort, the direct DNA sequencing had a 60.0% (3 of 5 patients)false-negative rate, and use of commercial kits all caused misidentification of EGFR p.L747P or p.L747S. Of the 7 patients receiving EGFR TKI treatment, five stage-IV lung adenocarcinoma patients that received afatinib had a 80.0% objective response rate (ORR), while two patients administered gefitinib or erlotinib showed a 0% ORR. The median progression-free survival (PFS)rates were 11.97 and 0.92 months (P = 0.012)for afatinib and gefitinib/erlotinib, respectively. No patients (0%)acquired p.T790 M resistance after failure of afatinib (n = 3). Of 10 patients harboring EGFR p.L747P from published literature, six patients used first-generation EGFR TKIs as treatment also showed 0% ORR and 1.00 month median PFS. Conclusions: Patients with the uncommon EGFR mutations p.L747P and p.L747S could be incorrectly classified as having wild-type EGFR or a 19DEL when using direct DNA sequencing or commercial kits.

Hence, large-scale production and direct induction of functional DCs ex vivo from HSCs are crucial to HSC research and clinical potential, such as vaccines for cancer and immune therapy. Methods: In a previous study, we developed a serum-free HSC expansion system (SF-HSC medium) to expand large numbers of primitive HSCs ex vivo. Herein, a DC induction and expansion medium (DC medium) was proposed to further generate large numbers of functional DCs from serum-free expanded HSCs, which were developed and optimized by factorial design and the steepest ascent method. Results: The DC medium is composed of effective basal medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium [IMDM]) and cytokines (2.9 ng/mL stem cell factor [SCF], 2.1 ng/mL Flt-3 ligand, 3.6 ng/mL interleukin [IL]-1β, 19.3 ng/mL granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] and 20.0 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]). After 10-day culture in DC medium, the maximum fold expansion for accumulated CD1a+CD11c+ DCs was more than 4000-fold, and the induced DCs were characterized and confirmed by analysis of growth kinetics, surface antigen expression, endocytosis ability, mixed lymphocyte reaction, specific cytokine secretion and lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Discussion: In conclusion, the combination of DC medium and SF-HSC medium can efficiently induce and expand a large amount of functional DCs from a small scale of HSCs and might be a promising source of DCs for vaccine and immune therapy in the near future. ? 2019 International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy",dendritic cells; ex vivo expansion; hematopoietic stem cells; immunotherapy; induction,CD34 antigen; dendritic cell vaccine; dextran; Flt3 ligand; fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran; gamma interferon; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; lipopolysaccharide; membrane antigen; receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase C; stem cell factor; tumor necrosis factor; Article; CD3+ T lymphocyte; cell count; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytokine release; dendritic cell; endocytosis; ex vivo study; experimental design; factorial design; fluorescence; hematopoietic stem cell; human; human cell; large scale production; mixed lymphocyte reaction; priority journal; stem cell expansion; stimulation,2-s2.0-85065803293

There has been substantial evidence indicating that adequate levels of physical activity, such as prescribed exercise, can be an effective intervention for prevention and treatment of many chronic health conditions, as well as for improvement of mental health, quality of life and well-being. Many countries in the world have developed policies and guidelines for promotion of participation in physical activity and application of prescribed exercise as a means of intervention for chronic health conditions. Subsequently, the roles of exercise professionals in the community and health care system who provide services to the general community members, individuals with various health conditions, as well as elite athletes, and their professional training, qualifications and standards need to be defined and implemented. This article provides a preliminary comparison of the exercise professionals and their current roles in the community and health care systems between Australia and China (including mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong, as they have different health care systems), aiming to promote the recognition of exercise professionals in the health care systems, and facilitate the global development of the exercise-related professions, for a healthier world. ? 2019 The Society of Chinese Scholars on Exercise Physiology and Fitness",Athletic trainer; Clinical exercise physiology; Exercise prescription; Exercise professionals; Health care; Sport scientists,,2-s2.0-85065507853

Overexpression of transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is involved in the inauspicious development of several types of cancer, including lung tumor aggressiveness. Our laboratory has previously found that MED28, a Mediator subunit for transcriptional activation, modulates cell growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion in human breast cancer cells. The objective of the current study is to investigate the potential role of MED28 and FOXM1 in NSCLC. In addition to A549 and PC9 cells, we also used a doxycycline-inducible system to generate FOXM1-overexpressed A549-DN cells, and we explored the connection of MED28 with FOXM1 and their effect on migration. Herein, we report that the increased expression levels of both MED28 and FOXM1 elevated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), a metastasis marker, which enhanced cell migration and matrigel invasion of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, MED28 interacted with FOXM1, and both exhibited a mutual effect on the expression and subcellular localization. Moreover, MED28 small interfering RNA-mediated MMP2 gene suppression could be attenuated by inducible expression of a constitutively active form of FOXM1, which consequently restored the migration and invasion ability of NSCLC cells. Our data indicate that MED28 interacts with FOXM1, and each affects the expression and localization of the other, and, more importantly, both regulate MMP2-dependent migration and invasion in human lung cancer cells. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",forkhead box M1 (FOXM1); invasion; lung cancer; matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2); MED28; migration,forkhead box protein M1; gelatinase A; med28 protein; protein; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; A-549 cell line; Article; cell invasion; cell migration; cellular distribution; controlled study; gene repression; human; human cell; non small cell lung cancer; PC-9 cell line; priority journal; protein expression; protein interaction; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85057823726

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the abnormal expression of DDR1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has not been well investigated. Methods: The expression of DDR1 on OSCC patients was determine by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Specific targeting by miRNAs was determined by software prediction, luciferase reporter assay, and correlation with target protein expression. The functions of miR-486-3p and DDR1 were accessed by MTT and Annexin V analyses using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and methylation specific PCR (MSP) were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms by arecoline treatment. Results: Here, we reported that DDR1 was significantly upregulated in OSCC tissues and its levels were inversely correlated with miR-486-3p expression. The experimental results in vitro confirmed that miR-486-3p decreased DDR1 expression by targeting the 3′-UTR of DDR1 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-486-3p led to growth inhibition and apoptosis induction with a similar function by knockdown of DDR1. Aberrant methylation of ANK1 promoter was a highly prevalent in OSCC and contributes to oral carcinogenesis by epigenetic silencing of ANK1 and miR-486-3p. We found that miR-486-3p can be transcriptionally co-regulated with its host gene ANK1 through epigenetic repression. DNA methylation inhibitor treatment re-expressed ANK1 and miR-486-3p. Importantly, arecoline, a major betel nut alkaloid, recruited DNMT3B binding to ANK1 promoter for DNA methylation and then attenuated the expression of miR-486-3p in OSCC. Conclusion: This study was the first to demonstrate that betel nut alkaloid may recruit DNMT3B to regulate miR-486-3p/DDR1 axis in oral cancer andmiR-486-3p and DDR1 may serve as potential therapeutic targets of oral cancer. ? 2019 The Author(s).",ANK1; DDR1; DNA methylation; miR-486-3p; Oral cancer; OSCC,"arecoline; discoidin domain receptor 1; DNA methyltransferase 3B; lipocortin 5; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 486 3p; unclassified drug; ANK1 protein, human; ankyrin; arecoline; DDR1 protein, human; discoidin domain receptor 1; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase; DNA methyltransferase 3B; microRNA; MIRN486 microRNA, human; 3' untranslated region; ANK1 gene; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; DNA methylation; gain of function mutation; gene expression; gene function; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; loss of function mutation; luciferase assay; molecular mechanics; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; MTT assay; oncogene; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein targeting; real time polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; aged; chemistry; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; mouth tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell line; tumor suppressor gene; 3' Untranslated Regions; Aged; Ankyrins; Apoptosis; Arecoline; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Discoidin Domain Receptor 1; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases; DNA Methylation; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; HEK293 Cells; Humans; MicroRNAs; Mouth Neoplasms; Promoter Regions, Genetic",2-s2.0-85068144471

Mutations of mitochondrial DNA, proteins and impaired mitochondrial function have been implicated in the neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and injury of the central nervous system (CNS). The dynamic feature of mitochondrial fusion, fission, trafficking and turnover have also been documented in these diseases. Perspectives: A major bottleneck of traditional approach to correct mitochondria-related disorders is the difficulty of drugs or gene targeting agents to arrive at specific sub-compartments of mitochondria. Moreover, the diverse nature of mitochondrial mutations among patients makes it impossible to develop one drug for one disease. To this end, mitochondrial transplantation presents a new paradigm of therapeutic intervention that benefits neuronal survival and regeneration for neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, and CNS injury. Supplement of healthy mitochondria to damaged neurons has been reported to promote neuronal viability, activity and neurite re-growth. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent advance and development on mitochondrial therapy. Conclusion: Key parameters for the success of mitochondrial transplantation depend on the source and quality of isolated mitochondria, delivery protocol, and cellular uptake of supplemented mitochondria. To expedite clinical application of the mitochondrial transplantation, current isolation protocol needs optimization to obtain high percentage of functional mitochondria, isolated mitochondria may be packaged by biomaterials for successful delivery to brain allowing for efficient neuronal uptake. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Mitochondrial dynamics; Mitochondrial therapy; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuronal regeneration; Stroke,acute heart infarction; acute lung injury; Article; cell function; cell survival; cell therapy; cell transplantation; cell viability; cerebrovascular accident; clinical protocol; degenerative disease; disorders of mitochondrial functions; extracorporeal oxygenation; human; infertility; liver injury; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrion; nerve regeneration; nervous system injury; neurite outgrowth; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; Pearson syndrome; priority journal; process optimization; spinal cord injury; transient ischemic attack; traumatic brain injury,2-s2.0-85067302322

Angiogenic and neuroprotective effects were assessed following ADSC transplantation in suspension or in the form of cell sheet. We found superior blood flow restoration, tissue vascularization and innervation, and fibrosis reduction after transplantation of HGF-producing ADSC sheet compared to other groups. We suggest that the observed effects are determined by pleiotropic effects of HGF, along with the multifactorial paracrine action of ADSC which remain viable and functionally active within the engineered cell construct.

This review examines several crucial aspects of sedentary behaviors and health and discusses the possibilities of developing public health guidelines on daily sedentary time. The following issues were observed and analyzed to review the evidence regarding sedentary time and health: First, the profile of the daily sedentary time of adults across different countries was described. Second, the physical activity guidelines provided by the World Health Organization or government authorities of various countries were reviewed. Third, evidence was obtained on systematic reviews and meta-analyses to explore the recommended limit of daily sedentary time; spending a higher amount of time on sedentary activities than the recommended threshold may damage adult health. Fourth, measurement methods of sedentary behaviors may moderate the associations between sedentary time and mortality across studies. Finally, conclusions and suggestions for future research were proposed. In summary, an increased sedentary time is associated with high morbidity and mortality risks in adults. Self-reported questionnaires typically underestimate the total sedentary time compared with that obtained using device-based measures. Recent metaanalyses revealed that sedentary time of >9 h/day may increase the all-cause mortality risk. However, based on few studies conducted with objectively-assessed sedentary time, the current evidence is insufficient to form guidelines. More large-scale and long-term prospective studies with objective measures of sedentary time are required to validate these findings.

Sorafenib was the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for treating advanced HCC until recently, so development of new target therapy is urgently needed. In this study, we established a zebrafish drug screening platform and compared the therapeutic effects of two multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 419S1 and 420S1, with Sorafenib. All three compounds exhibited anti-angiogenesis abilities in immersed fli1:EGFP transgenic embryos and the half inhibition concentration (IC50) was determined. 419S1 exhibited lower hepatoxicity and embryonic toxicity than 420S1 and Sorafenib, and the half lethal concentration (LC50) was determined. The therapeutic index (LC50/IC50) for 419S1 was much higher than for Sorafenib and 420S1. The compounds were either injected retro-orbitally or by oral gavage to adult transgenic zebrafish with HCC. The compounds not only rescued the pathological feature, but also reversed the expression levels of cell-cycle-related genes and protein levels of a proliferation marker. Using a patient-derived-xenograft assay, we found that the effectiveness of 419S1 and 420S1 in preventing liver cancer proliferation is better than that of Sorafenib. With integrated efforts and the advantage of the zebrafish platform, we can find more effective and safe drugs for HCC treatment and screen for personalized medicine. ? 2019 by the authors.

These viruses are reassortant viruses containing HA and NA genes from American-lineage H5N2 and six internal genes from local H6N1 viruses. According to a serological survey, the Taiwan H5N2 viruses can cause asymptomatic infections in poultry workers. Therefore, a development of influenza H5N2 vaccines is desirable for pandemic preparation. In this study, we employed reverse genetics to generate a vaccine virus having HA and NA genes from A/Chicken/CY/A2628/2012 (E7, LPAI) and six internal genes from a Vero cell-adapted high-growth H5N1 vaccine virus (Vero-15). The reassortant H5N2 vaccine virus, E7-V15, presented high-growth efficiency in Vero cells (512 HAU, 107.6 TCID50/mL), and passed all tests for qualification of candidate vaccine viruses. In ferret immunization, two doses of inactivated whole virus antigens (3 ?g of HA protein) adjuvanted with alum could induce robust antibody response (HI titre 113.14).

Tools for improving the use of medications have been developed, but they mainly targeted physicians. Objective We evaluated the effects of reinforcement of patient and family education on the usage of guideline-recommended secondary prevention medications. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected registry of patients with ACS who were admitted to a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan between February 2015 and April 2017. The control group included 76 patients discharged before implementing the electronic-based patient and family education (PFE) system. The intervention group included 206 patients discharged after implementation. The primary outcome was the prescription rate of all four guideline-recommended drugs. Predictors of adherence were also evaluated. Results The study cohort included 282 ACS patients (188 men and 94 women) with a mean age of 68.5 years (standard deviation, 14.2). The intervention group patients were younger, had more family history of premature cardiovascular disease, more dyslipidemia, and underwent more reperfusion therapy. The intervention group was prescribed more guideline-recommended drugs than the control group: dual antiplatelet agents, 79.61% vs. 47.37% (p<0.001); statins, 74.76% vs. 34.21% (p<0.001); beta-blockers, 81.07% vs. 46.05% (p<0.001); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, 62.62% vs. 38.16% (p<0.001); and a combination of all four medications, 39.32% vs. 14.47% (p<0.001). After adjusting baseline variables, the PFE system remained a significant contributor to adherence to these drugs use (P = 0.02).

Here, we found that MT-1 expression was suppressed by 14-3-3ε, and MT-1 overexpression abolished 14-3-3ε-induced cell proliferation and tumor growth. We identified that 14-3-3ε induced expression of ZNF479, a novel potential transcriptional regulator by gene expression profiling and ZNF479 contributed to 14-3-3ε-suppressed MT-1 expression. ZNF479 induced the expression of DNMT1, UHRF1, and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex proteins (ASH2L and Menin), and increased tri-methylated histone H3 (H3K4me3) levels, but suppressed H3K4 (H3K4me2) di-methylation. ZNF479-suppressed MT-1 expression was restored by silencing of ASH2L and DNMT1. Furthermore, ZNF479 expression was higher in HCC tissues than that in the non-cancerous tissues. Expression analyses revealed a positive correlation between the expression of ZNF479 and DNMT1, UHRF1, ASH2L, and Menin, and an inverse correlation with that of ZNF479, ASH2L, Menin, and MT-1 isoforms. Moreover, correlations between the expression of ZNF479 and its downstream factors were more pronounced in HCC patients with hepatitis B. Here, we found that ZNF479 regulates MT-1 expression by modulating ASH2L in HCC. Approaches that target ZNF479/MLL complex/MT-1 or related epigenetic regulatory factors are potential therapeutic strategies for HCC. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; histone H3; metallothionein I; methionine; mixed lineage leukemia protein; protein 14 3 3; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; ash2l gene; cancer chemotherapy; carcinogenesis; cell function; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene; gene control; gene expression; gene silencing; histone methylation; human; human cell; human tissue; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; tumor growth; tumor volume; uhrf1 gene; znf479 gene,2-s2.0-85066318960

The responses of NPs to hyperthermia as a cancer treatment method are complex and variable. Herein, the heating properties of the casein-coated magnetic NPs (MNPs) under an alternating magnetic field were investigated. The casein-coated MNPs were synthesized via one-pot chemical method. The casein-coated MNPs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), zeta potential, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis. TEM images of casein-coated MNPs show that their shapes are spherical and their core sizes are between 20nm and 25nm. The FTIR and EDAX results confirmed the presence of casein on the surface of MNPs. The VSM shows the superparamagnetic nature of iron oxide and casein-coated iron oxide NPs with the magnetic saturation of 60emu/g and 44.86emu/g, respectively, at room temperature. Furthermore, hyperthermia tests for casein-coated MNPs with various concentrations and frequencies are performed. Hyperthermia results show that lower concentrations of casein-coated MNPs dispatch higher heating into their surrounding medium, whereas maximum specific absorption rate occurs at the concentration of 1mg/mL for the frequency of 150kHz. Findings of this study suggest that casein-coated MNPs have great potential as an anticancer agent in hyperthermia cancer therapy. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",cancer treatment; casein; Iron oxide NPs; magnetic fluid hyperthermia; specific absorption rate,,2-s2.0-85062911891

Exosomes, secreted by various cells of the human body into body fluids, contain protein, mRNA, miRNA, and signaling molecules. Physiologically, exosomes assist in the intercellular transport of protein and RNA. Immunologically, exosomes exhibit antigen-presenting capability. In recent studies, exosomes were found to be associated with the pathophysiology of cardiovascular, renal, neurological, and ocular diseases. In addition, exosomes may play a major role in cancer metastasis. Due to the extremely small size and scarcity of exosomes in living samples, many early studies utilized sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation for exosome collection. However, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation is rather time consuming and requires large biological sample quantities. Newer exosome studies combined immunoaffinity and microfluidic system approaches for more efficient exosome collection. Our review summarizes existing methods for EV isolation and notes their advantages and disadvantages. These promising approaches are all characterized by isolation efficiency, and savings in cost, labor, and time. Optimization of current methods is a necessary step toward clinically-relevant diagnostic product production, but the fact that EVs are already widely used in disease diagnosis and treatment encourages continued efforts. ? 2019",,"heparin; macrogol; microRNA; tumor marker; diagnostic value; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exosome; human; immunoaffinity chromatography; immunomagnetic separation; microfluidics; precipitation; priority journal; protein aggregation; Review; scanning electron microscopy; size exclusion chromatography; sucrose density gradient centrifugation; transcriptomics; ultrafiltration; affinity chromatography; chemistry; density gradient centrifugation; exosome; microfluidic analysis; Centrifugation, Density Gradient; Chromatography, Affinity; Exosomes; Humans; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques",2-s2.0-85062036297

Because the overexpression of the sigma-2 receptor is frequently reported in glioma clinical samples and associated with poor prognosis and malignancy, we herein studied the anti-tumor effect of the sigma-2 receptor agonist PB221 (4-cyclohexyl-1-[3-(5-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)propyl]piperidine) on an anaplastic astrocytoma tumor model based on previous encouraging results in pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Methods: The expression of the sigma-2 receptor, transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97), in ALTS1C1 and UN-KC6141 cell lines was measured by RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR. The binding of sigma-2 receptor fluorescent ligands PB385 (6-[5-[3-(4-cyclohexylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-5-yloxy]-N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)hexanamine) and NO1 (2-{6-[2-(3-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)propyl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one-5-yloxy]hexyl}-5-(dimethylamino)isoindoline-1,3-dione) was examined by flow cytometry and the fluorescent plate reader. The antitumor activity of PB221 was initially examined in the murine brain tumor cell line ALTS1C1 and then in the murine pancreatic cell line UN-KC6141. The potential therapeutic efficacy of PB221 for murine brain tumors was examined by in vitro migration and invasion assays and in vivo ectopic and orthotopic ALTS1C1 tumor models. Results: The IC50 of PB221 for ALTS1C1 and UN-KC6141 cell lines was 10.61 ± 0.96 and 13.13 ± 1.15 μM, respectively. A low dose of PB221 (1 μM) significantly repressed the migration and invasion of ALTS1C1 cells, and a high dose of PB221 (20 μM) resulted in the apoptotic cell death of ALTS1C1 cells. These effects were reduced by the lipid antioxidant α-tocopherol, but not by the hydrophilic N-acetylcysteine, suggesting mitochondrial oxidative stress is involved. The in vivo study revealed that PB221 effectively retarded tumor growth to 36% of the control tumor volume in the ectopic intramuscular tumor model and increased the overall survival time by 20% (from 26 to 31 days) in the orthotopic intracerebral tumor model. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the sigma-2 receptor agonist PB221 has the potential to be an alternative chemotherapeutic drug for brain tumors with comparable side effects as the current standard-of-care drug, temozolomide. ? 2019 The Author(s).",,"2 [6 [2 (3 (6,7 dimethoxy 3,4 dihydroisoquinolin 2(1h)yl)propyl) 3,4 dihydroisoquinolin 1(2h) one 5 loxy]hexyl] 5 (dimethylamino)isoindoline 1,3 dione; 4 cyclohexyl 1 [3 (5 methoxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalen 1 yl)propyl]piperidine; 6 [5 [3 (4 cyclohexylpiperazin 1 yl)propyl] 5,6,7,8 tetrahydronaphthalen 5 yloxy] n (7 nitro 2,1,3 benzoxadiazol 4 yl)hexanamine; acetylcysteine; alpha tocopherol; membrane protein; sigma 2 opiate receptor; sigma receptor agonist; transmembrane protein 97; unclassified drug; membrane protein; piperidine derivative; tetralin derivative; TMEM97 protein, human; ALTS1C1 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell invasion assay; cell migration assay; concentration response; drug efficacy; flow cytometry; fluorescence analysis; glioblastoma; glioblastoma cell line; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; metastasis inhibition; mitochondrial oxidative stress; mouse; nonhuman; overall survival; oxidative stress; pancreatic cell line; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; receptor binding; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tumor model; UN-KC6141 cell line; animal; astrocytoma; brain tumor; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; dose response; drug effect; drug screening; genetics; human; male; metabolism; tumor cell line; Animals; Astrocytoma; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Oxidative Stress; Piperidines; Tetrahydronaphthalenes; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85066450949

In a relatively simple environment, a metagenomics sequencing data is dominated by a few species. By analyzing the alignment of reads from microbial species, single nucleotide polymorphisms can be discovered and the evolutionary history of the populations can be reconstructed. The ever-increasing read length will allow more detailed analysis about the evolutionary history of microbial or tumor cell population. A simulator of shotgun sequences from such populations will be helpful in the development or evaluation of analysis algorithms. Results: Here, we described an efficient algorithm, MetaSMC, which simulates reads from evolving microbial populations. Based on the coalescent theory, our simulator supports all evolutionary scenarios supported by other coalescent simulators. In addition, the simulator supports various substitution models, including Jukes-Cantor, HKY85 and generalized time-reversible models. The simulator also supports mutator phenotypes by allowing different mutation rates and substitution models in different subpopulations. Our algorithm ignores unnecessary chromosomal segments and thus is more efficient than standard coalescent when recombination is frequent. We showed that the process behind our algorithm is equivalent to Sequentially Markov Coalescent with an incomplete sample. The accuracy of our algorithm was evaluated by summary statistics and likelihood curves derived from Monte Carlo integration over large number of random genealogies. ? 2018 The Author.",,,2-s2.0-85066061436

The Intensive-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is one of the most important cancer's radiotherapy process, and it is critical for cancer patients to receive the treatment as soon as possible. Therefore, having an effective patient scheduling model can not only reduce the patients' waiting time but improve the IMRT treatment quality. This study proposed a mathematical model to improve patient scheduling efficiency, and this research considered the practical characteristics in actual medical procedures.

Checklists were chosen a priori as an outcome due to prior evidence of effectiveness. Drawing on individual interviews with 20 clinicians and three focus groups with 17 patients, we describe four activity systems within hemodialysis care. We then outline a novel design process that includes co-design activities with clinicians, and four rapid-cycle iterations that progressively incorporated activity system elements into checklist design. We contribute a new type of checklist design to HCI: one that supports diagnostic thinking rather than consistent task completion.

Particularly, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounts for the highest proportion of thyroid cancer. Up to now, there are few researches discussing the pathogenesis and progression mechanisms of PTC from the viewpoint of systems biology approaches. In this study, first we constructed the candidate genetic and epigenetic network (GEN) consisting of candidate protein–protein interaction network (PPIN) and candidate gene regulatory network (GRN) by big database mining. Secondly, system identification and system order detection methods were applied to prune candidate GEN via next-generation sequencing (NGS) and DNA methylation profiles to obtain the real GEN. After that, we extracted core GENs from real GENs by the principal network projection (PNP) method. To investigate the pathogenic and progression mechanisms in each stage of PTC, core GEN was denoted in respect of KEGG pathways. Finally, by comparing two successive core signaling pathways of PTC, we not only shed light on the causes of PTC progression, but also identified essential biomarkers with specific gene expression signature. Moreover, based on the identified gene expression signature, we suggested potential candidate drugs to prevent the progression of PTC with querying Connectivity Map (CMap). ? 2019 by the authors.

Although vocal emotion has been explored in previous studies, little is known about how perception of different vocal emotional expressions modulates the functional brain network topology. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional brain networks under different attributes of vocal emotion by graph-theoretical network analysis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were performed on 36 healthy participants.We utilized the Power-264 functional brain atlas to calculate the interregional functional connectivity (FC) from fMRI data under resting state and vocal stimuli at different arousal and valence levels. The orthogonal minimal spanning trees method was used for topological filtering. The paired-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction across all regions and arousal-valence levels were used for statistical comparisons. Our results show that brain network exhibits significantly altered network attributes at FC, nodal and global levels, especially under high-arousal or negative-valence vocal emotional stimuli. The alterations within/between well-known large-scale functional networks were also investigated. Through the present study, we have gained more insights into how comprehending emotional speech modulates brain networks. These findings may shed light on how the human brain processes emotional speech and how it distinguishes different emotional conditions. ? 2019 The Author(s).",brain network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; graph-theoretical analysis; resting state; vocal emotion,"adult; arousal; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; filtration; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; male; rest; speech; stimulus; theoretical study; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; emotion; image processing; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; voice; young adult; Adult; Arousal; Brain Mapping; Emotions; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Voice; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85067091325

Snakebite envenomation is not an uncommon issue in Taiwan. We design a study to obtain an understanding of the characteristics of snakebites and snakebite patients in a medical center in northern Taiwan. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective medical records study of an 8-year period. We used the key word 'snake' to search the emergency department (ED) diagnosis of all patients and then used antivenom management codes to select patients for inclusion. The species of snake involved, time and site of the bite, geographic data of the patients and patient outcomes were recorded. Results: In total, there were 125 snakebite patients (male 70%, female 30%). The snakes involved were Protobothrops mucrosquamatus (50%), followed by Trimeresurus stejnegeri (7%). The feet and ankles were the most frequently bitten areas (42.4%). The peak months were July and October. The average ED stasis time was 2 hours and 45 minutes, and 65.6% of snakebite patients received antivenom. In patients bitten by P. mucrosquamatus, there was a high surgical rate, 23.8% higher than those reported in other studies. No mortalities or side effects of antivenom were reported in these patients. Conclusion: We propose a clinical flow chart for physicians who are treating patients bitten by P. mucrosquamatus. Snakebites, especially those inflicted by P. mucrosquamatus, induce severe soft tissue swelling, which can mimic compartment syndrome. Antivenom for P. mucrosquamatus is the first and only choice of treatment. The amount of antivenom needs to match the clinical symptoms. Patients bitten by P. mucrosquamatus may need longer observation times than patients bitten by other species of snakes, in addition to toxicologist consultations, sonographic examinations, and measurement of the objective compartment pressure before surgery. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Sciences | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",compartment syndrome; Protobothrops mucrosquamatus; Snake; Trimeresurus stejnegeri,antibiotic agent; cephalosporin; clindamycin; penicillin derivative; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; snake venom antiserum; Article; chronic pain; compartment syndrome; decision making; echography; edema; envenomation; fasciotomy; female; hospital admission; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; respiratory failure; retrospective study; snakebite; Taiwan; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85066807664

The multidrug resistant property of OS produces a major obstacle to chemotherapy, since the effective drug dose cannot be achieved via conventional drug delivery routes without serious systemic cytotoxicity. Microbubbles in conjunction with ultrasound (US) has recently been shown to spatially and temporally permeabilize the cellular membrane, promoting drug penetration into tumors. Here, we investigated whether drug (doxorubicin, DOX)-loaded bubbles (DOX-bubbles) can serve as drug-loaded carriers in combination with US in order to facilitate tumor drug delivery. The proposed bubbles have a high payload capacity (efficiency of 69.4 ± 9.1%, payload of 1.4 mg/mL) for DOX. In vitro data revealed that when used in combination with US (1-MHz), these DOX-bubbles facilitate DOX entering into tumor cells. In tumor-bearing animals, DOX-bubbles + US could provide 3.7-fold suppression of tumor growth compared with the group without insonation (1.8 ± 0.9 cm3 vs. 8.5 ± 2.2 cm3) because of the acceleration of DOX-induced tumor necrosis. In the meantime, the tumor perfusion and volume can be monitored by DOX-bubbles with contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. Our data provide useful information in support of translating the use of theranostic US-responsive bubbles for regulated tumor drug delivery into clinical use. ? 2019 by the authors.

Their isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were mitogen-activated and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-interleukin (IL)-2, and anti-interferon (IFN)-γ antibodies for flow cytometry, and the plasma levels of cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-α2, IL-10, IL-8, GM-CSF, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, were measured through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The results demonstrated that regardless of the administration route, morphine delivery slightly reduced IL-2 expression in CD4 cells after activation, and the same effect was not noted for CD8 cells. Intravenous or epidural morphine tended to reduce IFN-γ expression in CD8 cells. Spinal and IV morphine substantially increased IL-6 production, whereas epidural morphine hindered IL-10 and GM-CSF production. IV morphine injection reduced MCP-1 production in plasma. Compared with spinal morphine, IV or epidural morphine may more effectively inhibit the expression of various cytokines and thus affect immune response.All 3 routes of morphine injection tended to decrease IL-2 production by CD4 cells, whereas IV or epidural morphine injection showed lower IFN-γ production by CD8 cells.

We have found that tranilast may block the S100A6-lysozyme interaction and enhance binding of S100A6 to RAGE. Using WST1 assay, we have found that lysozyme, most probably by blocking the interaction between S100A6 and RAGE, inhibits cell proliferation while tranilast may reverse this effect by binding to lysozyme.

To promote successful SDM, it is crucial to assess the level of perceived involvement in SDM in women with breast cancer. Objective The aims of this study were to apply Rasch analysis to examine the construct validity and person reliability of the 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) in women with breast cancer. Methods The construct validity of SDM-Q-9 was confirmed when the items fit the Rasch model's assumptions of unidimensionality: (1) infit and outfit mean square ranged from 0.6 to 1.4; (2) the unexplained variance of the first dimension of the principal component analysis was less than 20%. Person reliability was calculated. Results A total of 212 participants were recruited in this study. Item 1 did not fit the model's assumptions and was deleted. The unidimensionality of the remaining 8 items (SDM-Q-8) was supported with good item fit (infit and outfit mean square ranging from 0.6 to 1.3) and very low unexplained variance of the first dimension (5.3%) of the principal component analysis. The person reliability of the SDM-Q-8 was 0.90. Conclusions The SDM-Q-8 was unidimensional and had good person reliability in women with breast cancer. Implications for Practice The SDM-Q-8 has shown its potential for assessing the level of perceived involvement in SDM in women with breast cancer for both research and clinical purposes. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Many running-related injuries have a sex bias, particularly patellofemoral pain (PFP), as female runners are approximately twice as likely to develop PFP compared to males. However, very little is currently known regarding sex differences in coordinative variability during running. Research Question: Are there sex differences in continuous relative phase (CRP) variability for pelvis-thigh and thigh-shank couplings during the stance phase of running? Methods: Pelvis, thigh, and shank segment kinematics were collected on 15 female and 15 male subjects during overground running at a self-selected easy pace (2.39–3.56 m/s) using a 10-camera 3D motion capture system. Continuous relative phase (CRP) variability was calculated between the pelvis-thigh and thigh-shank, and averaged during four distinct stance sub-phases. A mixed effects linear model compared CRP variability between sexes at each stance sub-phase. Results: Compared to males, females displayed significantly lower pelvis-thigh CRP variability in the transverse plane during the loading response phase, and significantly lower thigh-shank CRP variability in the sagittal plane during the loading response and pre-swing phases. Significance: Lower coordinative variability in females during the loading response for two couplings may provide additional insight into the sex bias for developing certain running-related injuries. However, any injury implications from these results are speculative and should be interpreted with caution. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Continuous relative phase; Hip; Injury implications; Knee,adult; Article; clinical article; continuous relative phase variability; female; human; kinematics; lower limb; male; musculoskeletal system parameters; patellofemoral joint; pelvis; priority journal; runner; running; sex difference; standing; thigh; adolescent; biomechanics; hip; knee; lower limb; middle aged; physiology; running; sexual characteristics; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Hip Joint; Humans; Knee Joint; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Pelvis; Running; Sex Characteristics; Thigh; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85063649202

Recently, researchers have become interested in the effects of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on schizophrenia, but the lack of evidence-based results from random clinical trials (RCTs) has limited their effectiveness. Moreover, longitudinal data must be examined using appropriate study designs. We recruited 60 schizophrenia patients and randomly assigned them to an MBI or to a treatment-as-usual group. Negative symptoms, positive symptoms, mindfulness, and depression were assessed at baseline, post-course, and at a 3-month follow-up. Descriptive analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to examine the effects of MBI. We found that MBI mitigated the severity of negative symptoms and of general schizophrenic psychopathology except for the positive symptoms and for those of depression. Unexpectedly, we did not find long-term effect of mindfulness on negative symptoms. Larger sample sizes, long-term practical course, more rigorous study procedures, and a double-blind design should be considered in future studies. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",GEE; Mindfulness; Negative symptoms; PANSS; Schizophrenia,adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; depression; disease severity; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; mindfulness; negative syndrome; positive syndrome; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; therapy effect; treatment outcome; treatment planning; adolescent; aged; double blind procedure; middle aged; psychology; schizophrenia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Depression; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85063085988

Understanding the demography of free-roaming dog populations is essential for developing an effective management plan. An evaluation of their welfare status would be beneficial to earn public support for the management plan. In this study, we estimated the population size, survivorship, and health of a free-roaming dog population in Yangmingshan National Park (YMSNP), Taiwan, during 2016–2018. YMSNP is a rural area with human settlements but also a protected area of conservation concern. We identified 191, 176, 216 individuals at our sampling sites in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Using a photographic capture-recapture method and extrapolation, we estimated that there were 786–979 dogs in the park during this 3-year period. The annual apparent survival rate of identified dogs was 16.7% for 2016–2017 and 23.9% for 2017–2018. The dogs had a high rate of lameness and dermatosis of 5.1–8.8% and 14.2–18.1%, respectively. Thirty-five blood samples showed that 34.3% of the dogs were anemic, 37.1% showed abnormal white blood cell counts, and 68.6% exhibited abnormal platelet counts. These results suggested that the dogs were at high density with low survivorship and in poor health, and new individuals entered the population continuously. Interventions to manage this dog population and to improve their welfare must be carried out. Our study provides an example for monitoring and managing a free-roaming dog population in a rural, conservation area in Southeast Asia. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Capture-recapture method; Complete blood cell count; Free-roaming dog; Population management; Welfare status,"hemoglobin variant; animal health; animal lameness; animal welfare; Article; blood cell count; blood sampling; demography; dog disease; erythrocyte count; female; leukocyte count; male; national park; nonhuman; platelet count; population density; population size; priority journal; public health; rural area; skin disease; stray dog; survival rate; Taiwan; wildlife; wound; animal; dog; physiology; recreational park; Animal Welfare; Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Parks, Recreational; Population Density; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85062863794

Here, we applied entropy analysis to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signal in subjects with late-life depression (LLD), an illness combined with emotion dysregulation and aging effect. Methods: A total of 35 unremitted depressed elderly and 22 control subjects were recruited. Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis was performed in the entire brain, 90 automated anatomical labeling-parcellated ROIs, and five resting networks in each study participant. Limitations: Due to ethical concerns, all the participants were under medication during the study. Results: Regionally, subjects with LLD showed decreased entropy only in the right posterior cingulate gyrus but had universally increased entropy in affective processing (putamen and thalamus), sensory, motor, and temporal nodes across different time scales. We also found higher entropy in the left frontoparietal network (FPN), which partially mediated the negative correlation between depression severity and mental components of the quality of life, reflecting the possible neural compensation during depression treatment. Conclusion: MSE provides a novel and complementary approach in rs-fMRI analysis. The temporal-spatial complexity in the resting brain may provide the adaptive variability beneficial for the elderly with depression. ? 2019",Depression; Entropy; Late-life; Quality of life; Resting-state fMRI,adult; aged; aging; Article; brain; clinical article; controlled study; emotion; entropy; female; frontoparietal cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Geriatric Depression Scale; geriatric patient; human; late life depression; male; mental health; posterior cingulate; priority journal; putamen; quality of life; thalamus; brain; brain mapping; cingulate gyrus; depression; entropy; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychology; quality of life; rest; antidepressant agent; Aged; Antidepressive Agents; Brain; Brain Mapping; Depressive Disorder; Entropy; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Rest; Thalamus,2-s2.0-85062700960

The NPs were loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and indocyanine green (ICG) for dual modality cancer treatment and coated with cholesterol-PEG (C-PEG) for MDR abrogation in treatment of human MDR breast cancer. The in vitro cellular uptake of the DOX/ICG loaded nanoparticles (DI-NPs) by MDR cancer cells was significantly enhanced owing to effective inhibition of the P-gp activity by C-PEG and γ-PGA receptor-mediated endocytosis. DOX localization in cytoplasm and nucleus was observed particularly with the photo-thermal effect that facilitated intracellular drug release. As a result, the C-PEG coated DI-NPs after photo-irradiation exhibited a synergistic effect of combination (chemo/thermal) therapy to depress the proliferation of MDR cancer calls. The ex vivo biodistribution study revealed an enhanced tumor accumulation of C-PEG (2000) coated DI-NPs in MCF-7/MDR tumor-bearing nude mice due to the excellent EPR effects by the NP surface PEGylation. The MDR tumor growth was almost entirely inhibited in the group receiving combination therapy from CP2k-DI-NPs and photo-irradiation along with substantial cell apoptosis of tumor tissues examined by immunohistochemical staining. The results demonstrate a promising dual modality therapy system, CP2k-DI-NPs, developed in this work for effective combination therapy of human MDR breast cancer. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Cholesterol-PEG; Combination chemo/thermal therapy; Drug delivery nanoparticles; Multidrug resistance; Synergistic effect,"Amino acids; Cell death; Chemotherapy; Cholesterol; Controlled drug delivery; Functional polymers; Irradiation; Mammals; Molecular biology; Nanometals; Nanoparticles; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Combination chemo/thermal therapy; Drug delivery nanoparticle; Functionalized nanoparticles; Immunohistochemical staining; Multidrug resistance; Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid; Receptor-mediated endocytosis; Synergistic effect; Diseases; ABC transporter subfamily B; cholesterol; doxorubicin; indocyanine green; macrogol 2000; nanocarrier; polyglactin; polyglutamic acid; antineoplastic antibiotic; doxorubicin; indocyanine green; nanoparticle; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; breast cancer; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell nucleus; cell viability; concentration (parameter); confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; cytoplasm; cytotoxicity; drug accumulation; drug clearance; drug delivery system; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug half life; drug inhibition; drug metabolism; drug potentiation; drug release; drug transport; endocytosis; ex vivo study; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; MCF-7 cell line; mouse; multidrug resistance; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; PEGylation; photon correlation spectroscopy; photothermal therapy; priority journal; animal; Bagg albino mouse; breast tumor; cell proliferation; chemistry; drug effect; drug resistance; drug screening; intravenous drug administration; multidrug resistance; nude mouse; particle size; pathology; surface property; tissue distribution; tumor cell line; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Doxorubicin; Drug Resistance, Multiple; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Humans; Indocyanine Green; Injections, Intravenous; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Nanoparticles; Particle Size; Surface Properties; Tissue Distribution",2-s2.0-85061351072

Here, we report lightweight hybrid composite mats, having porosity around 40%, composed of amorphous carbon, zinc oxide nanorods and nickel zinc ferrite for excellent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in the X-band (8.2–12.4 GHz). The vibrating sample magnetometer measurement confirmed that the saturation magnetization value (Ms) of the composite materials enhances with the weight percentage of zinc oxide nanorods-nickel zinc ferrite (ZNF) powder, which leads to enhanced magnetic loss of the electromagnetic waves. With the thickness of 1.0 mm, the total EMI shielding effectiveness of the amorphous carbon composite was measured to be 25.70 dB which was further enhanced to 53 dB by the incorporation of the ZNF powder. Such high increment is attributed to the enhanced magnetic properties, interfacial polarization and dielectric properties of the composite. The synergistic combination of the materials results in the high reflection coefficient and absorption coefficient of the composites which were measured to be ?0.916 and ?0.083, respectively. Thus, the composites can shield up to 99.999% power of the electromagnetic waves which is shared by the 8.394% reflection and 91.605% absorption. Moreover, the magnetic, electrical and EMI shielding properties of the composites can be tuned by controlling the amount of ZNF powder in composites. Hence, the composite mats can be suitable for applications in defense and telecommunication. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electrical properties; EMI shielding; Hybrid; Magnetic properties; Nano-structures,Amorphous carbon; Carbon carbon composites; Circular waveguides; Dielectric properties of solids; Electric properties; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic wave interference; Electromagnetic wave reflection; Electromagnetic waves; Ferrite; II-VI semiconductors; Magnetic properties; Magnetic shielding; Nanorods; Nickel; Pollution; Saturation magnetization; Signal interference; Telecommunication industry; Zinc oxide; Electro magnetic pollution; Electromagnetic interference shielding; EMI shielding; EMI shielding effectiveness; Hybrid; Interfacial polarization; Synergistic combinations; Vibrating sample magnetometer; Electromagnetic shielding,2-s2.0-85060330187

Method: A presentation of scholarship is presented temporally relating to the following: (a) gender scholarship, (b) cross cultural voids in race and ethnicity, (c) situating of cultural sport psychology in present day, with the emergence of European scholars, (d) the topics of intersectionality of identity and acculturation are drawn upon to reveal diverse approaches taken in this line of scholarship and practice, and (e) reflections and recommendations are proposed, calling for openness of perspectives and topic areas. Results: The presentation of scholarship is intended to serve as a form of advocacy for diverse approaches in cultural sport psychology. This advocacy is exemplified through such terms as cultural praxis and decolonization, beyond a broader call for receptiveness for diverse epistemological approaches.

Upregulation of ST3Gal1 has been associated with worse prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, the protein substrates of ST3Gal1 implicated in tumor progression remain elusive. In our study, we demonstrated that ST3GAL1-silencing significantly reduced tumor growth along with a notable decrease in vascularity of MCF7 xenograft tumors. We identified vasorin (VASN) which was shown to bind TGF-β1, as a potential candidate that links ST3Gal1 to angiogenesis. LC-MS/MS analysis of VASN secreted from MCF7, revealed that more than 80% of its O-glycans are sialyl-3T and disialyl-T. ST3GAL1-silencing or desialylation of VASN by neuraminidase enhanced its binding to TGF-β1 by 2- to 3-fold and thereby dampening TGF-β1 signaling and angiogenesis, as indicated by impaired tube formation of HUVECs, suppressed angiogenesis gene expression and reduced activation of Smad2 and Smad3 in HUVEC cells. Examination of 114 fresh primary breast cancer and their adjacent normal tissues showed that the expression levels of ST3Gal1 and TGFB1 were high in tumor part and the expression of two genes was positively correlated. Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed a significantly shorter relapse-free survival for those with lower expression VASN, notably, the combination of low VASN with high ST3GAL1 yielded even higher risk of recurrence (p = 0.025, HR = 2.967, 95% CI = 1.14–7.67). Since TGF-β1 is known to transcriptionally activate ST3Gal1, our findings illustrated a feedback regulatory loop in which TGF-β1 upregulates ST3Gal1 to circumvent the negative impact of VASN. ? 2018 The Authors.

Although some studies show that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments confer a protective effect on DN, the long-term impact remains unclear. This study aims to examine end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality rates among TCM users with DN. Methods: A total of 125,490 patients with incident DN patients from 2004 to 2006 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan and followed until 2012. The landmark method was applied to avoid immortal time bias, and propensity score matching was used to select 1:1 baseline characteristics-matched cohort. The Kaplan-Meier method and competing-risk analysis were used to assess mortality and ESRD rates separately. Results: Among all eligible subjects, about 60% of patients were classified as TCM users (65,812 TCM users and 41,482 nonusers). After 1:1 matching, the outcomes of 68,882 patients were analyzed. For the ESRD rate, the 8-year cumulative incidence was 14.5% for TCM users [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.9-15.0] and 16.6% for nonusers (95% CI: 16.0-17.2). For the mortality rate, the 8-year cumulative incidence was 33.8% for TCM users (95% CI: 33.1-34.6) and 49.2% for nonusers (95% CI: 48.5-49.9). After adjusting for confounding covariates, the cause-specific hazard ratio of ESRD was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.84), and the hazard ratio of mortality for TCM users was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.47-0.50). The cumulative incidence of mortality increased rapidly among TCM users with ESRD (56.8, 95% CI: 54.6-59.1) when compared with TCM users without ESRD (30.1, 95% CI: 29.4-30.9). In addition, TCM users who used TCM longer or initiated TCM treatments after being diagnosed with DN were associated with a lower risk of mortality. These results were consistent across sensitivity tests with different definitions of TCM users and inverse probability weighting of subjects. Conclusions: The lower ESRD and mortality rates among patients with incident DN correlates with the use of TCM treatments. Further studies about specific TCM modalities or medications for DN are still needed. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Chronic kidney disease; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic nephropathy; End-stage renal disease; Mortality; Traditional Chinese medicine,"Chinese drug; herbaceous agent; adult; Article; Chinese medicine; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; disease association; end stage renal disease; female; follow up; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; outcome assessment; population research; propensity score; prospective study; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; Taiwan; young adult; Chinese medicine; chronic kidney failure; cross-sectional study; diabetic nephropathy; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; mortality; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetic Nephropathies; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Middle Aged; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85063944060

IAPs-mediated regulation of NF-kB signaling is based on the formation of protein complexes by their type-I BIR domains. The XIAP-BIR1 domain dimerizes to bind two TAB1 monomers, leading to downstream NF-kB activation. Thus, impairment of XIAP-BIR1 dimerization could represent a novel strategy to hamper cell survival in cancer. To this aim, we previously reported NF023 as a potential inhibitor of XIAP-BIR1 dimerization. Here we present a thorough analysis of NF023 binding to XIAP-BIR1 through biochemical, biophysical and structural data. The results obtained indicate that XIAP-BIR1 dimerization interface is involved in NF023 binding, and that NF023 overall symmetry and the chemical features of its central moiety are essential for an efficient interaction with the protein. Such strategy provides original hints for the development of novel BIR1-specific compounds as pro-apoptotic agents. ?2019 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, biobanks also face sustainability challenges comprising three dimensions - ""financial,"" ""operational,"" and ""social."" The Taiwan Biobank (TWB), as a large-scale national biobank that supplies valuable phenotypic and genetic information to biomedical researchers on an application basis to investigate the relationship among personal health, genes, lifestyle, environment and diseases of the Taiwanese population, has not been sufficiently explored by researchers. Although the TWB has successfully reached a few milestones since its inception, it faces many sustainability challenges. For the next chapter of the TWB, we propose three strategies to improve sustainability. First, the Ministry of Health and Welfare launched the TWB as an infrastructure project under the leadership of Academia Sinica in 2012. We now believe that it is time that the TWB is transformed into a legal entity as a nondepartmental public body. This would not only ensure efficient, effective, and flexible operation, but would also facilitate cooperation with commercial entities. Second, we suggest that the TWB integrates with other Taiwanese biobanks to reduce cost, improve low utilization, and expand specimen collection. Third, self-financing is important if funding is ceased. Besides implementing a cost-recovery model, the commodities developed by the TWB (e.g., TWB 2.0 microarray) will help increase income. After each of these strategies has been discussed in detail, this article will conclude by highlighting how these practices can help improve biobank sustainability. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",biobank networks; commercialization; non-departmental public body; sustainability; Taiwan Biobank,Article; biobank; biotechnology; cost utility analysis; environmental sustainability; funding; human; international cooperation; leadership; priority journal; Taiwan; Taiwanese,2-s2.0-85064213986

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of 45 Gy in 20 fractions to compensate for the dose heterogeneity in gross tumor volume observed with single-fraction BNCT with mean prescription dose 19 Gy (w), and to evaluate planning quality indices of simulated BNCT+IMRT versus single-fraction BNCT alone. All IMRT plans were generated using the Eclipse TPS which employs the analytical anisotropic algorithm. The conformity index for the gross tumor volume (GTV) was better for the BNCT+IMRT plan than for the BNCT-alone plan (p = 0.003). In addition, the BNCT+IMRT plan provided significantly better homogeneity in the GTV (p = 0.03). The cold spots in inhomogeneous dose distribution in the BNCT plan may be a key factor for H&amp;N cancer recurrence. Our results suggest that single-fraction BNCT combined with compensated multi-fraction IMRT improves treatment homogeneity and conformity than single-fraction BNCT alone, especially for tumor volumes &gt;100 cm 3 , and possibly increases local tumor control. ? 2019 Lee et al.

This study examined whether haptic perception, which relies on somatosensory afferents, is impaired in children with DCD. Haptic sensitivity and acuity were systematically quantified in children with DCD and contrasted to the performance of typically developing (TD) children and young adults (each group N = 20). All participants performed a curvature detection task measuring haptic sensitivity and a curvature discrimination task measuring haptic acuity. In both tasks, participants moved the index finger of their dominant hand over a surface contour and verbally indicated whether they could detect its curvature or discriminate between two curved contours. Based on their verbal responses haptic detection and discrimination thresholds were obtained. The main findings are as follows: First, the DCD group had significantly elevated haptic discrimination thresholds (lower haptic acuity) compared to both TD children and adult controls. Second, we found no evidence that haptic sensitivity is impaired in DCD. Third, haptic acuity significantly correlated with clinical motor measures, indicating that higher levels of haptic acuity were associated with higher motor abilities.

Influenza VLPs can be obtained by the overexpression of HA, M1, NA, and/or M2 viral proteins in insect, mammalian, or plant cells. In this study, we reported to obtain highly immunogenic influenza VLPs by molecular incorporation with B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) or proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). Since BAFF and APRIL act as homotrimers to interact with their receptors, we engineered the VLPs by direct fusion of BAFF or APRIL to the transmembrane anchored domain of H5HA gene. Results showed that immunizations with the HA-transmembrane anchored BAFF- or APRIL-VLPs only formulated in alum but not MPL adjuvant elicited significantly higher IgG titers in sera. However, only the BAFF-VLPs formulated in alum adjuvant elicited more broadly neutralizing antibodies against the homologous and two heterologous H5N1 clade/subclade viruses and conferred protective immunity against live virus challenges. As the multi-subtype influenza vaccines containing a variety of HA subtypes can confer broader protective immunity, we also obtained multi-subtype H5H7 BAFF-VLPs and H1H5H7 BAFF-VLPs and demonstrated that these multi-subtype BAFF-VLPs were able to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies against multiple HA subtypes.

Therefore, these phototherapeutic nanohybrids may enhance cancer therapy in future clinical applications. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cu-in-S; Hyaluronic acid; Nanohybrids; Photodynamic therapy; Photothermal therapy,"Biomedical engineering; Cells; Copper compounds; Diseases; Hyaluronic acid; Nanorods; Nanostructured materials; Organic acids; Photodynamic therapy; Photosensitizers; Clinical application; Cu-In-S; Heterostructured nanorods; Nanohybrids; Photodynamic activities; Photothermal conversion efficiencies; Photothermal therapy; Tumor-specific targeting; Cerium compounds; biomaterial; copper; hyaluronic acid; indium; nanotube; photosensitizing agent; phytochlorin; porphyrin; singlet oxygen; sulfur; animal; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; experimental melanoma; female; growth, development and aging; light; male; metabolism; mouse; nonmammalian embryo; photochemotherapy; tumor cell line; zebra fish; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Copper; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Female; Hyaluronic Acid; Indium; Light; Male; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice; Nanotubes; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Porphyrins; Singlet Oxygen; Sulfur; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-85059223883

This work presents an oil-structured nanoemulsion system that consists of a phase-changeable fatty acid that allows EXT (EXT@PC/NEMs) to be delivered orally and absorbed efficiently in the small intestine. To construct an appropriate vehicle to encapsulate EXT, an oil-in-water single emulsion is generated at 37 °C, which is well above the melting point of the fatty acid but below the denaturation temperature of the peptide drug. The as-prepared EXT@PC/NEMs are physically stable when stored at 4 °C, as they form a solid core, which prevents drug leakage. Upon their oral delivery at body temperature, the deformable liquid EXT@PC/NEMs may undergo effective cellular uptake, enhancing their permeability across the intestinal epithelium. The orally administered PC/NEMs significantly improve the bioavailability of EXT via intestinal lymphatic transport, ultimately accumulating in the pancreas, suggesting the possibility of orally delivering labile peptide drugs. The delivered EXT may act on pancreatic β- and α-cells to stimulate insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion, respectively, reducing the blood glucose level, eventually having antidiabetic effects. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, development of influenza H7N9 vaccines is critical for pandemic preparedness. Currently, there are three means of production of commercial influenza vaccines: egg-based, mammalian cell-based, and insect cell-based platforms. The insect cell-based platform has the advantage of high speed in producing recombinant protein. In this study, we evaluate the stability and immunogenicity of two different influenza H7 HA expression constructs generated using the baculovirus system, including membrane-based full-length HA (mH7) and secreted ectodomain-based H7 (sH7). The mH7 construct could form an oligomer-rosette structure and had a high hemagglutinin (HA) titer 8192. In contrast to mH7, the sH7 construct could not form an oligomer-rosette structure and did not have HA titer before cross-linking with anti-His antibody. Thermal stability tests showed that the sH7 and mH7 constructs were unstable at 43 °C and 52 °C, respectively. In a mice immunization study, the mH7 construct but not the sH7 construct could induce robust HI and neutralizing antibody titers. In conclusion, further development of the mH7 vaccine candidate is desirable. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",H7N9; Hemagglutinin; Influenza vaccine; Transmembrane domain,His antibody; influenza vaccine; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; neutralizing antibody; oligomer; unclassified drug; virus antibody; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody titer; Article; baculovirus expression system; controlled study; drug stability; female; influenza A (H7N9); influenza vaccination; mouse; nonhuman; oligomerization; priority journal; protein cross linking; rosette formation; vaccine immunogenicity; virus load,2-s2.0-85057213018

We extend the conventional model H for macrophase separations by considering a logistic growth of cancer cells and also a mechanical friction between dermis and epidermis. Importantly, our model exhibits a microphase separation due to the proliferation of cancer cells. By numerically solving the time evolution equations of the cancer composition and its velocity, we show that the phase separation kinetics strongly depends on the cell proliferation rate as well as on the strength of hydrodynamic interactions. A steady-state diagram of cancer patterns is established in terms of these two dynamical parameters and some of the patterns correspond to clinically observed cancer patterns. Furthermore, we examine in detail the time evolution of the average composition of cancer cells and the characteristic length of the microstructures.

From March until late summer in 2014, the Tver region, north of the city of Moscow, was considerably affected by long-lasting peat bog fires. Peat bog smoldering emissions from three types of smoke (underground, inside grass, and above grass) were analyzed by an extensive suite of instrumentation that sampled and measured their optical and chemical properties. The particle composition was characterized by organic species with high OC/EC ratios (10–20), with water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and levoglucosan (Lev) comprising the largest fraction, up to 30 and 9%, respectively, of the OC. Aliphatic, aromatic, carbonyl, and carboxylate functionalities in the underground smoke were enriched by nitro compounds, and brown carbon (BrC) was identified by a high Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE) of 4.1. Organic “tar balls” in the peat smoke were more abundant (78.5%) than individual Ca-rich (e.g., Ca-oxides or carbonates), Fe-rich (e.g., Fe-oxides), and Al-rich (e.g., alumosilicates) particles. Peat smoke plumes affected an urban site in Moscow in August 2014, with ambient PM 10 mass loadings reaching up to 97 ?g m –3 and OC, EC, and ionic species accounting for a large percentage of the total aerosol enhancement. With the transport of air masses from the peat bog region to Moscow, the OC/EC ratio and AAE reached peak values of 7 and 1.3, respectively. Levoglucosan served as a molecular marker of the impact of peat smoldering, approaching a maximum ambient concentration of 108 ng m –3 . WSOC correlated well with Lev, indicating secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation associated with peat burning emissions. Spectral absorbance features showed characteristics similar to peat burning and traffic source emissions during fire and non-fire related days, confirming the potential effect of transported peat smoke on air quality in megacities. ?

We aimed to investigated whether unplanned and frequent medication changes in RDN studies affected the BP response to RDN by conducting sensitivity and subgroup analyses, according to antihypertensive medication change rates in a meta-analysis of RCTs. Methods: We searched the PUBMED, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases up to May 2018. RCTs that studied the effects of RDN on hypertensive patients were included. A meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.3. Results: A total of 12 studies were included, of which four fulfilled the inclusion criteria of &lt; 10% medication change rate in our review.

In contrast, the pooled analysis of the 12 studies and the subgroup analysis of eight studies with &gt; 10% medication change rates both had a high level of heterogeneity and no significant BP reduction.

During tumor progression, dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to involve tumor initiation and modulate oral cancer malignancy. MiR-450a was significantly upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients without functional reports. This study was attempted to uncover the molecular mechanism of novel miR-450a in OSCC. Mir-450a expression was examined by quantitative RT-PCR, both in OSCC cell lines and patients. Specific target of miR-450a was determined by software prediction, luciferase reporter assay, and correlation with target protein expression. The functions of miR-450a and TMEM182 were accessed by adhesion and transwell invasion analyses. Determination of the expression and cellular localization of TMEM182 was examined by RT-PCR and by immunofluorescence staining. The signaling pathways involved in regulation of miR-450a were investigated using the kinase inhibitors. Overexpression of miR-450a in OSCC cells impaired cell adhesion ability and induced invasiveness, which demonstrated the functional role of miR-450a as an onco-miRNA. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-mediated expression of TMEM182 was regulated by miR-450a induction. MiR-450a-reduced cellular adhesion was abolished by TMEM182 restoration. Furthermore, the oncogenic activity of TNF-α/miR-450a/TMEM182 axis was primarily through activating extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. ERK1/2 inhibitor prevented the TNF-α-induced miR-450a expression and enhanced adhesion ability. Our data suggested that TNF-α-induced ERK1/2-dependent miR-450a against TMEM182 expression exerted a great influence on increasing OSCC motility. Overall, our results provide novel molecular insights into how TNF-α contributes to oral carcinogenesis through miR-450a that targets TMEM182. ? 2019 Hsing et al.

The model achieved AUC values of 0.920 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.908–0.932) in testing dataset 1 and 0.925 (95% CI, 0.914–0.937) in testing dataset 2. Under a high sensitivity operating point, the sensitivity and specificity were 92.5% and 79.8% for testing dataset 1; 91.8% and 79.9% for testing dataset 2. Under a high specificity operating point, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.3% and 87.5% for testing dataset 1; 83.7% and 87.5% for testing dataset 2. The DNN model maintained high predictability 5 years after being developed. The model achieved similar performance to other clinical risk assessment scores. Conclusions Using a DNN algorithm on this large electronic health record database is capable of obtaining a high performing model for assessment of ischemic stroke risk. Further research is needed to determine whether such a DNN-based IDSS could lead to an improvement in clinical practice. ? 2019 Hung et al.

Xerostomia may predispose patients to periodontal disease (PD) and an association between SS and PD has been reported. This association may be bidirectional; therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the risk of SS in patients with PD using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. A total of 135,190 patients were enrolled in our analysis. In all, 27,041 patients with PD were matched by gender, age, insured region, urbanization and income, with cases and controls in a 1:4 ratio. Both groups were followed and the risks of SS were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression. Finally, 3292 (2.4%) patients had newly diagnosed SS. Patients with PD had a significantly higher risk of subsequent SS (903 (3.3%) vs. 2389 (2.2%), adjusted hazard 1.47, 95% confidence interval: 1.36–1.59). In conclusion, patients with PD had an approximately 50% increased risk of subsequent SS. Physicians should be aware of the symptoms and signs of SS in patients with PD. ? 2019 by the authors.

Methods: Six patients who received a therapeutic trial of cortical stimulation were included retrospectively. The frequency of seizures was recorded before and after implantation. Surgical procedure- and stimulation-related adverse effects were also recorded. Results: The mean reductions in seizures were 61% at 1 year, 68% at 2 years, and 80% at 3–7 years post-implantation. The median follow-up time was 54 months (range 36–156 months). The etiologies of epilepsy included polymicrogyria in two patients, post-traumatic in one patient, and periventricular heterotopia, post-encephalitis, and familial lateral temporal lobe epilepsy in the remaining three patients. Status epilepticus stopped immediately after stimulation in three patients with focal status epilepticus or epilepsia partialis continua at baseline, with a long-term reduction in seizures of more than 90% and improvements in conscious level. Tissue incompatibility with the connection wire was noted in one patient, which subsided after the system was removed. Conclusions: Open-loop cortical stimulation of epileptic foci improved seizure control in our patients with refractory focal epilepsy of diverse etiologies. Electrical cortical stimulation stopped epilepsia partialis continua/focal status epilepticus immediately after the intervention and exhibited a sustained effect in reducing seizures. No procedure-related complications were observed. Further case cohort studies are needed to clarify which patients respond to open-loop cortical stimulation. ? 2019",Cortical stimulation; Epilepsia partialis continua; Malformation of cortical development; Refractory epilepsy,"adolescent; adult; Article; clinical article; disease control; drug resistant epilepsy; electrical cortical stimulation; electrostimulation; encephalitis; epileptic state; female; focal epilepsy; follow up; human; lateral temporal lobe epilepsy; male; microgyria; patient safety; periventricular heterotopia; priority journal; retrospective study; young adult; biophysics; brain cortex; complication; diagnostic imaging; drug resistant epilepsy; electroencephalography; electrotherapy; focal epilepsy; longitudinal study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; single photon emission computed tomography; treatment outcome; Adult; Biophysics; Cerebral Cortex; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Electroencephalography; Epilepsies, Partial; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85060955403

In that regard, several epidemiological studies suggest that long-term exposure to estrogen could increase ovarian cancer risk, although its precise role remains controversial. To decipher a mechanism for this, we previously generated a mathematical model of how estrogen-mediated upregulation of the transcription factor, E2F6, upregulates the ovarian cancer stem/initiating cell marker, c-Kit, by epigenetic silencing the tumor suppressor miR-193a, and a competing endogenous (ceRNA) mechanism. In this study, we tested that previous mathematical model, showing that estrogen treatment of immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells upregulated both E2F6 and c-KIT, but downregulated miR-193a. Luciferase assays further confirmed that microRNA-193a targets both E2F6 and c-Kit. Interestingly, ChIP-PCR and bisulphite pyrosequencing showed that E2F6 also epigenetically suppresses miR-193a, through recruitment of EZH2, and by a complex ceRNA mechanism in ovarian cancer cell lines. Importantly, cell line and animal experiments both confirmed that E2F6 promotes ovarian cancer stemness, whereas E2F6 or EZH2 depletion derepressed miR-193a, which opposes cancer stemness, by alleviating DNA methylation and repressive chromatin. Finally, 118 ovarian cancer patients with miR-193a promoter hypermethylation had poorer survival than those without hypermethylation. These results suggest that an estrogen-mediated E2F6 ceRNA network epigenetically and competitively inhibits microRNA-193a activity, promoting ovarian cancer stemness and tumorigenesis. ? 2018 The Authors.

It is thus desirable to develop oral therapy systems for the local treatment of colon cancers featured with highly selective delivery to cancer cells and minimized systemic drug absorption. The present study demonstrates the effective accumulation and cell uptake of the doxorubicin and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles-loaded solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) delivery system for chemo/magnetothermal combination therapy at tumors by hierarchical targeting of folate (FA) and dextran coated on SLN surfaces in a sequential layer-by-layer manner. Both the in vitro and in vivo characterizations strongly confirmed that the dextran shells on SLN surfaces not only retarded the cellular transport of the FA-coated SLNs by the proton-coupled FA transporter on brush border membranes in small intestine, but also enhanced the particle residence in colon by specific association with dextranase. The enzymatic degradation and removal of dextran coating led to the exposure of the FA residues, thereby further facilitating the cellular-level targeting and uptake of the SLNs by the receptor-mediated endocytosis. The evaluation of the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the hierarchically targetable SLN therapy system by oral administration showed the effective inhibition of primary colon tumors and peritoneal metastasis in terms of the ascites volume and tumor nodule number and size, along with the absence of systemic side effects. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Combination therapy; Hierarchical targeting; Local colon cancer treatment; Oral formulations; Solid lipid nanoparticles,Cell membranes; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Dextran; Diseases; Iron oxides; Molecular biology; Nanoparticles; Tumors; Anti-cancer chemotherapy; Brush border membranes; Combination therapy; Hierarchical targeting; Oral formulations; Receptor-mediated endocytosis; Solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN); Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles; Targeted drug delivery; dextran; dextranase; doxorubicin; folic acid; polysaccharide; solid lipid nanoparticle; superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; A-549 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; ascites cell; cancer chemotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell transport; cell volume; colon cancer; controlled study; CT26 cell line; drug accumulation; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug reexposure; drug release; drug synthesis; endocytosis; enzymatic degradation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; nonhuman; peritoneum metastasis; priority journal; small intestine; target cell; thermotherapy; tumor volume,2-s2.0-85060340665

However, nearly one billion people are forced to drink water contaminated with bacteria, leading to diarrhea, dehydration, and even death. Previously, various photocatalysts have been applied to replace high-cost and highly toxic methods for sewage treatment. Nevertheless, the requirement of external light sources limits their application. Herein, we develop a new type of nanocatalyst based on single- and few-layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets (NSs) that can catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to inactivate bacteria either through a piezoelectric effect (mechanical vibration) or photocatalytic effect (light irradiation). After 60 min of mechanical vibration or visible-light irradiation, the MoS 2 NSs can reduce Escherichia coli (E. Coli) by 99.999%. In addition, the ROS generation efficiency and bacterial disinfection performance of the catalyst can be enhanced by depositing Au nanoparticles (NPs) on MoS 2 NSs. The period of mechanical vibration or visible-light irradiation that achieves the same 99.999% reduction in E. coli is shortened to 45 min. Moreover, a hybridization of the piezoelectric and photocatalytic effects results in a performance superior to that obtained with the individual effects. A 99.999% reduction in E. coli is also accomplished within 15 min through a combination of mechanical vibration and near-infrared (NIR)-light irradiation. This MoS 2 nanocatalyst is a promising candidate for nextgeneration water purification systems because of its ability to be triggered by diverse environmental stimuli. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Bacterial disinfection; Molybdenum disulfide; Nanosheets; Photocatalytic effect; Piezocatalytic effect; Reactive oxygen species,Disinfection; Escherichia coli; Gold nanoparticles; Infrared devices; Layered semiconductors; Light; Light sources; Molybdenum compounds; Nanocatalysts; Nanosheets; Piezoelectricity; Sewage treatment; Sulfur compounds; Vibrations (mechanical); Water pollution; Environmental stimuli; Escherichia coli (E. coli); Molybdenum disulfide; Photocatalytic effect; Piezocatalytic effect; Reactive oxygen species; Visible-light irradiation; Water purification systems; Irradiation,2-s2.0-85058413481

When the size of a material is reduced to the nanoscale, its properties may change significantly and becomes a new substance.

For example, buckyballs are spherical fullerenes and carbon nanotubes are cylindrical fullerenes. Fullerenes have been under intensive investigation for their expanding applications in electronics, energy, medicine, and many other research fields. Nanostructure analysis is very important for understanding the formation of different materials and their properties. In this study, a virtual laboratory is developed for learning fullerene production and its nanostructure analysis. The learners can use the arc discharge equipment to produce fullerenes and then use the transmission electron microscope (TEM) to observe the nanostructures of different fullerene samples. The high interactivity and 3D visual effects of the virtual laboratory enable the learners to become familiar with the geometrical structures and properties of fullerenes.

Given that PAR2 activation in airway epithelial cells compromises the airway epithelium barrier by disruption of E-cadherin adhesion, PAR2 may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Although PAR2 is known to promote the migration of lung cancer cells, the detailed mechanism of this event is still not clear. Here, we found that PAR2 is highly expressed in several lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. In two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, CL1-5 and H1299 cells, activation of PAR2 induces migration and Slug-mediated EMT. The underlying mechanisms involved in PAR2-induced migration and EMT in CL1-5 cells were further investigated. We showed that PAR2-induced migration of CL1-5 cells is mediated by the Src/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway. β-arrestin 1, not G protein, is involved in this PAR2-mediated Src/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. PAR2-induced EMT in CL1-5 cells is dependent on the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). The activation of ERK2 further mediates Slug stabilization through suppressing the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In addition, a poor prognosis was observed in lung adenocarcinoma patients with a high expression of PAR2. Thus, PAR2 regulates migration through β-arrestin 1-dependent activation of p38 MAPK and EMT through ERK2-mediated stabilization of Slug in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Our finding also suggests that PAR2 might serve as a therapeutic target for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",EMT; ERK1/2; Lung adenocarcinoma; PAR2; Slug; β-Arrestin,"beta arrestin 1; beta arrestin 2; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; guanine nucleotide binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; nerve cell adhesion molecule; proteinase activated receptor 2; transcription factor Slug; uvomorulin; vimentin; beta arrestin 1; cadherin; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; MAPK1 protein, human; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; proteinase activated receptor 2; SNAI1 protein, human; transcription factor Snail; Article; cancer prognosis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell surface; CL1-5 cell line; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; epithelioid cell; human; human cell; lung adenocarcinoma; MAPK signaling; NCI-H1299 cell line; overall survival; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein stability; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; apoptosis; cell motion; epithelial mesenchymal transition; epithelium cell; genetics; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Apoptosis; beta-Arrestin 1; Cadherins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Epithelial Cells; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Receptor, PAR-2; Signal Transduction; Snail Family Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-85055270950

We demonstrate that a polycistronic cluster of engineered synthetic small RNAs targeting ZIKV is expressed and fully processed in Aedes aegypti, ensuring the formation of mature synthetic small RNAs in the midgut where ZIKV resides in the early stages of infection.

We unveiled a novel c-Met regulating mechanism that could be applied as a modality for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) therapy. Methods: Upregulation of keratin 16 (KRT16) was found by comparing isogenic pairs of low and high invasive human OSCC lines via microarray analysis. OSCC cells with ectopic expression or silencing of KRT16 were used to scrutinize functional roles and associated molecular mechanisms. Results: We observed that high KRT16 expression significantly correlated with poorer pathological differentiation, advanced stages, increased lymph nodes metastasis, and decreased survival rate from several Taiwanese OSCC patient cohorts. We further revealed that miR-365-3p could target ETS homologous factor (EHF), a KRT16 transcription factor, to decrease migration, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance in OSCC cells via inhibition of KRT16. Under confocal microscopic examination, c-Met was found possibly partially associates with KRT16 through β5-integrin. Colocalization of these three proteins may facilitate c-Met and β5-integrin-mediated signaling in OSCC cells. Depletion of KRT16 led to increased protein degradation of β5-integrin and c-Met through a lysosomal pathway leading to inhibition of their downstream Src/STAT3/FAK/ERK signaling in OSCC cells. Knockdown of KRT16 enhanced chemosensitivity of OSCC towards 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Various combination of c-Met inhibitor (foretinib), protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein), β5-integrin antibody, and 5-FU markedly augmented cytotoxic effects in OSCC cells as well as tumor killing effects in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Our data indicate that targeting a novel miR-365-3p/EHF/KRT16/β5-integrin/c-Met signaling pathway could improve treatment efficacy in OSCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).",C-met; Chemoresistance; ETS homologous factor; Keratin 16; miR-365-3p; Oral squamous cell carcinoma; β5-integrin,"beta5 integrin; cytokeratin 16; ETS homologous factor; fluorouracil; foretinib; genistein; microRNA; microRNA 365 3p; scatter factor receptor; transcription factor; unclassified drug; beta integrin; beta5 integrin; cytokeratin 16; EHF protein, human; fluorouracil; KRT16 protein, human; microRNA; MIRN365 microRNA, human; scatter factor receptor; transcription factor; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; beta5 integrin c met signaling pathway; cancer staging; cancer stemness; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cell differentiation; cell migration; chemosensitivity; cohort analysis; confocal microscopy; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; ectopic expression; female; gene function; gene silencing; genetic association; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; infant; KRT16 gene; lymph node metastasis; lysosome; major clinical study; male; metastasis; microarray analysis; molecular biology; mouse; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nonhuman; oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line; priority journal; protein degradation; protein depletion; protein localization; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; survival rate; Taiwanese; transcription initiation; tumor invasion; upregulation; animal; cell motion; drug effect; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; lymph node metastasis; mouth tumor; pathology; SCID mouse; signal transduction; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Fluorouracil; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Integrin beta Chains; Keratin-16; Lymphatic Metastasis; Mice; Mice, SCID; MicroRNAs; Mouth Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-85061854254

Therefore, they play a crucial role in tumor development and tumor treatment responses. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain tumor in humans, with extremely poor survival rates. GBM CSCs are believed to contribute to cancer initiation, invasion, metastasis, and recurrence, and they can also lead to poor conventional radiation therapy and chemotherapy outcomes. Efficiently eliminating CSCs is thus crucial to developing GBM treatment strategies. This study aimed to demonstrate the application of a vertical charged-particle irradiation platform in CSC research. The cell irradiation results indicated that GBM CSCs were more radio-resistant and had a higher survival rate than ordinary GBM tumor cells. Expression of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair modulation protein in GBM CSCs was also higher than in ordinary GBM tumor cells, suggesting that the radioresistance of GBM CSCs might be relative to efficient DNA DSB repair. Targeting the DNA DSB repair mechanism could thus be a potential strategy for enhancing GBM tumor control. All of the results demonstrated that the vertical charged-particle irradiation platform provides a suitable environment for CSC charged-particle irradiation research. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cancer stem cell; Cell irradiation platform; Charged-particle accelerator; Double-strand break repair,Chemotherapy; Cytology; Diseases; DNA; Irradiation; Particle accelerators; Radiation; Radiotherapy; Repair; Stem cells; Tumors; Cancer stem cells; Conventional radiation therapy; Critical properties; DNA double strand breaks; Double strand break repair; Glioblastoma multiforme; Particle irradiation; Tumor development; Charged particles,2-s2.0-85060114192

OCT4, a homeobox transcription factor, is essential for self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, but little is known about the role of OCT4 in non-germ-cell tumorigenesis. Here, we report that hypoxia stimulates a short isoform of OCT4, called OCT4B, via a HIF2α-dependent pathway to induce the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and facilitate cancer dissemination. OCT4B overexpression decreased epithelial barrier properties, which led to an increase in cell migration and invasion in lung cancer cells. OCT4B knockdown attenuated HIF2α-induced EMT and inhibited cancer dissemination in cell-line and animal models. We observed that OCT4B bound the SLUG promoter and enhanced its expression, and SLUG silencing inhibited OCT4B-mediated EMT, accompanied with decreased cell migration and invasion. Correlation analysis revealed that OCT4B expression was significantly associated with the SLUG level in lung tumors. These results provide novel insights into OCT4B-mediated oncogenesis in cancer dissemination. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",,"hypoxia inducible factor 2alpha; octamer transcription factor 4; octamer transcription factor 4B; transcription factor Slug; unclassified drug; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1; octamer transcription factor 4; POU5F1 protein, human; Pou5f1 protein, mouse; tumor protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; gene silencing; HIF2 alpha gene; human; human tissue; lung cancer cell line; lung tumor; male; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; OCT4B gene; oncogene; priority journal; promoter region; signal transduction; SLUG gene; tumor hypoxia; A-549 cell line; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell transformation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genetics; hypoxia; lung tumor; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; A549 Cells; Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Humans; Hypoxia; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Proteins; Octamer Transcription Factor-3",2-s2.0-85053390566

The biggest difficulty in the development of rehabilitation robots is the consideration of the clinical needs. This study investigated the usability of a novel cable-driven exoskeletal robot specifically designed for hand rehabilitation. Methods: The study consists of three steps, including prototype development, spasticity observation, and usability evaluation. First, we developed the prototype robot DexoHand to manipulate the patient’s fingers based on the clinical needs and the cable-driven concept established in our previous work. Second, we applied DexoHand to patients with different levels of spasticity. Finally, we obtained the system usability scale (SUS) and assessed its usability. Results: Two healthy subjects were recruited in the pre-test, and 18 patients with stroke and four healthy subjects were recruited in the formal test for usability. The total SUS score obtained from the patients and healthy subjects was 94.77 ± 2.98 (n = 22), indicating an excellent level of usability. The satisfaction score was 4.74 ± 0.29 (n = 22), revealing high satisfaction with DexoHand. The tension profile measured by the cables showed the instantaneous force used to manipulate fingers among different muscle tone groups. Conclusions: DexoHand meets the clinical needs with excellent usability, satisfaction, and reliable tension force monitoring, yielding a feasible platform for robot-assisted hand rehabilitation.

SMAs have been receiving considerable attention in the research field of materials science, and their applications include robotics, automotive, aerospace, and biomedical industries. Observing the SMA's shaping and restoration processes is important for understanding its working principles and applications. However, the transformation of its crystal structure with temperature can only be seen using special equipment, such as a transmission electron microscope (TEM), which is an expensive apparatus and the operation requires professional skills. In this study, a teaching module is designed using virtual reality (VR) technology and research results of an SMA to show its shape memory properties, shaping and restoration processes, as well as the real-life applications in an immersive and interactive way. A teaching experiment has been conducted to analyze students' learning effectiveness using the teaching module (the experimental group) compared with that of using real SMA materials as the teaching aids (the control group). Two classes of students in the Department of Materials Science (one as the experimental group and the other as the control group) were selected as the samples by convenience sampling from a university in North Taiwan. The experimental group contained 52 students and the control group contained 70 students. A nonequivalent pretest-posttest design was adopted to explore whether the two groups had a significant difference in learning effectiveness. The experimental results reveal that the teaching module can improve the learning effectiveness significantly (p = 0.001), and the questionnaire results also show that a majority of the students had positive attitudes about the teaching module. They believed that it could increase their learning motivation and help them understand the properties and applications of the SMA. ? 2019 by the authors.",Austenite; Martensite; Shape memory alloy (SMA); Transmission electron microscope (TEM); Virtual reality (VR),,2-s2.0-85061399567

However, whether cordycepin affects FAK expression and cellular functions in ECs and the specific molecular mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we found that cordycepin suppressed FAK expression and the phosphorylation of FAK (p-FAK) at Tyr397 in ECs. Cordycepin inhibited the proliferation, wound healing, transwell migration, and tube formation of ECs. Confocal microscopy revealed that cordycepin significantly reduced FAK expression and decreased focal adhesion number of ECs. The suppressed expression of FAK was accompanied by induced p53 and p21 expression in ECs. Finally, we demonstrated that cordycepin suppressed angiogenesis in an in vivo angiogenesis assay and reduced HCC tumor growth in a xenograft nude mice model. Our study indicated that cordycepin could attenuate cell proliferation and migration and may result in the impairment of the angiogenesis process and tumor growth via downregulation of FAK and induction of p53 and p21 in ECs. Therefore, cordycepin may be used as a potential adjuvant for cancer therapy. ? 2019 by the authors.

Although it is a healthy microbiota, genetic and epigenetic alterations in host and pathogen, and microenvironment changes would lead to thrush, vaginal yeast infection, and even hematogenously disseminated infection. Despite the fact that cytotoxicity is well-characterized, few studies discuss the genome-wide genetic and epigenetic molecular mechanisms between host and C. albicans. The aim of this study is to identify drug targets and design a multiple-molecule drug to prevent the infection from C. albicans. To investigate the common and specific pathogenic mechanisms in human oral epithelial OKF6/TERT-2 cells during the C. albicans infection in different strains, systems modeling and big databases mining were used to construct candidate host-pathogen genetic and epigenetic interspecies network (GEIN). System identification and system order detection are applied on two-sided next generation sequencing (NGS) data to build real host-pathogen cross-talk GEINs. Core host-pathogen cross-talk networks (HPCNs) are extracted by principal network projection (PNP) method. By comparing with core HPCNs in different strains of C. albicans, common pathogenic mechanisms were investigated and several drug targets were suggested as follows: orf19.5034 (YBP1) with the ability of anti-ROS; orf19.939 (NAM7), orf19.2087 (SAS2), orf19.1093 (FLO8) and orf19.1854 (HHF22) with high correlation to the hyphae growth and pathogen protein interaction; orf19.5585 (SAP5), orf19.5542 (SAP6) and orf19.4519 (SUV3) with the cause of biofilm formation.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed the histograms of DCE-MRI of 30 patients. Histograms within regions of interest(ROI) in the peripheral zone (PZ) and transitional zone (TZ) were separately analyzed. The maximum difference wash-in slope (MWS) and delay phase slope (DPS) were defined for each voxel. Differences in histogram parameters, namely the mean, standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of variation (CV), kurtosis, skewness, interquartile range (IQR), percentile (P10, P25, P75, P90, and P90P10), Range, and modified full width at half-maximum (mFWHM) between cancerous and benign tissues were assessed. Results In the TZ, CV for ROIs of 7.5 and 10mm was the only significantly different parameter of the MWS (P = 0.034 and P = 0.004, respectively), whereas many parameters of the DPS (mean, skewness, P10, P25, P50, P75 and P90) differed significantly (P = <0.001-0.016 and area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73-0.822). In the PZ, all parameters of the MWS exhibited significant differences, except kurtosis and skewness in the ROI of 7.5mm(P = <0.001-0.017 and AUC = 0.865-0.898). SD, IQR, mFWHM, P90P10 and Range were also significant differences in the DPS (P = 0.001-0.035). Conclusion The histogram analysis of DCE-MRI is a potentially useful approach for differentiating prostate cancer from normal tissues. Different histogram parameters of the MWS and DPS should be applied in the TZ and PZ. Copyright: ? 2019 Lai et al.

Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is overexpressed in gastric cancer, but the mechanisms and particularly the role of the epigenetic regulation of IL-8, are unclear. Here, we report that KDM4B, but not KDM4A/4C, upregulated IL-8 production in the absence or presence of Helicobacter pylori. Moreover, KDM4B physically interacts with c-Jun on IL-8, MMP1, and ITGAV promoters via its demethylation activity. The depletion of KDM4B leads to the decreased expression of integrin αV, which is exploited by H. pylori carrying the type IV secretion system, reducing IL-8 production and cell migration. Elevated KDM4B expression is significantly associated with the abundance of p-c-Jun in gastric cancer and is linked to a poor clinical outcome. Together, our results suggest that KDM4B is a key regulator of JNK/c-Jun-induced processes and is a valuable therapeutic target. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,CD51 antigen; histone demethylase; histone lysine demethylase 4; histone lysine demethylase 4a; histone lysine demethylase 4b; histone lysine demethylase 4c; interleukin 8; interstitial collagenase; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; small interfering RNA; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; virulence factor; Article; cancer therapy; cell migration; controlled study; disease association; gene expression; gene silencing; genetic association; Helicobacter pylori; histone demethylation; histone modification; human; human cell; outcome assessment; priority journal; promoter region; protein depletion; protein interaction; protein targeting; stomach carcinogenesis; transcription initiation; type IV secretion system; upregulation,2-s2.0-85060534854

We utilized a conceptual framework, based on safety theory and best practices, to categorize survey questions. Fifty-two prequalification surveys were identified containing 112 unique questions. Most included questions related to lagging indicators (83 percent), safety management leadership (75 percent), and worker training (60 percent). Safety management system elements such as hazard prevention and control, program evaluation and improvement, and coordination and communication were notably absent in 90 percent of the surveys. There was little consistency in the surveys available concerning leading indicators of safety. Only a small number of surveys currently in use incorporate all the elements of best practices associated with robust safety management systems. ?

Our aim is to compare the clinical manifestations, brain MRIs and prognoses of heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy by different intake routes. Methods: We present two patients with toxic leukoencephalopathy caused by intravenous (IV) injection of heroin and 48 additional cases from systematic reviews of the literature published between 1994 and 2018. Results: Among the 50 heroin abusers who developed leukoencephalopathy, inhalation was the most popular route (60%), followed by IV injection (30%) and snorting (10%). Mental changes, mutism and urine/fecal incontinence were the major symptoms in patients who IV injected heroin, while cerebellar ataxia and dysarthria were more common among those who inhaled heroin. Delayed-onset encephalopathy uniquely occurred in those who IV injected heroin, whereas progressive encephalopathy was more commonly observed in those who inhaled heroin. Clinical improvement was observed in 60% of patients, the overall mortality rate was 12%, and higher mortality was observed in patients who used the inhalation route (16.7%). The hallmarks on the MRIs of those who inhaled heroin were posterior to anterior involvement of the cerebral white matter and lesions in the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, cerebellum and brainstem. In contrast, those who IV injected heroin had more frequent lesions in the subcortical U fibers and the genu of the internal capsules. Conclusion: These data could help physicians make an early diagnosis and predict prognosis and suggest that prompt antioxidative or symptomatic treatments might reduce the long-term consequences and mortality of heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Heroin; Inhalation; Intravenous; Leukoencephalopathy; MRI; Snorting,"alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; choline; diamorphine; n acetylaspartic acid; ubidecarenone; diamorphine; narcotic agent; acute kidney failure; adult; akinetic mutism; Article; bradykinesia; brain disease; brain stem; capsula interna; case report; cerebellar ataxia; cerebellum; clinical article; clinical feature; compulsion; confusion; corpus callosum; delta rhythm; dysarthria; electroencephalogram; emergency ward; feces incontinence; Glasgow coma scale; hepatitis; heroin dependence; human; hyperthermia; inhalation; intoxication; intravenous drug abuse; irritability; leukoencephalopathy; limb weakness; male; mental disease; mortality rate; mutism; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; paraplegia; priority journal; prognosis; rhabdomyolysis; systematic review; tachycardia; urge incontinence; urinalysis; urine retention; white matter lesion; chemically induced; complication; diagnostic imaging; heroin dependence; inhalational drug administration; intranasal drug administration; intravenous drug administration; leukoencephalopathy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; pathophysiology; Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Intranasal; Administration, Intravenous; Adult; Heroin; Heroin Dependence; Humans; Leukoencephalopathies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Narcotics",2-s2.0-85057276887

Because of its widespread influence on all aspect of human life in the next decade and beyond. Name a few, Self-driving cars, bio-tech, health, medicine, robotics, smart cities, AIoT, Energy and FinTech, the list goes on and on. To electronic packaging the hardware of AI, there are many types of packaging forms depends on the system architecture of the AI. Basically, it follows Von Neumann computer architecture for high performance computing (HPC). Processors are closely communicated with the nearby memory units for data exchange. There are other emerging technologies for AI, like quantum computing and Neuron inspired processor. This paper is focused in the packaging of high end Von Neumann type of computer system. One key functional element used in HPC is ""interposer"". The interposers can be classified by their compositions. There are three popular materials used for the interposers; silicon, organic and glass. One rough classification is Interposer-S, Interposer-G, Interposer-O. If one looks the interposer structure closely, the ""Interposer-X"" name means the core materials used for supporting redistribution layers (RDL). Core materials are used for mechanical supporting and to make the interposer internal connections between the top RDL and bottom RDL. No wonder people are trying to reduce the thickness of the interposer. To an extreme, no core is needed at all. That is the popular TXV-less solution. The ""Interposer' term is generally means silicon interposer with fine line (a few μm to sub μm) RDL. ? 2018 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Coremaking; Electronic data interchange; Electronics packaging; Microsystems; Quantum computers; Electronic Packaging; Emerging technologies; Functional elements; High performance computing (HPC); Internal connections; Redistribution layers; Rough classification; System architectures; Computer architecture,2-s2.0-85062457763

Nevertheless, little is known about the relationships of non-red?meat protein sources and flavor preferences with sleeping patterns among the older adults and the oldest-old in China. Methods: Using a nationally representative database, the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (n = 5241, with 2407 males and 2834 females), older adults’ quality of sleep, daily hours of sleep, and recommended range of sleeping duration (7 to 8?h daily) were studied. Food consumption behaviors included fish, eggs, milk and bean products, nuts, and flavor preferences. Sex-stratified multivariable logistic and ordinary least squares regression models were performed for statistical analyses. Results: Nearly 61% of older adults reported good quality of sleep, but only 39% slept within the recommended hours of sleep daily. In general, less frequent consumption of eggs was associated with lower odds of reporting good quality of sleep among both male and female older adults. Among male participants, monthly consumption of milk products was associated with lower odds of good quality of sleep (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.60, 95% CI 0.41, 0.88; p < 0.01), compared with daily consumers. However, this relationship was not observed among female older adults. Fish consumption was not associated with any sleeping patterns for either sex.

PQ is also toxic to humans, and even contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, PQ is generally excluded from pesticide residue monitoring programs due to the lack of suitable determination methods. Thus, this study developed a detection method combined with simple extraction and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to rapidly determine and quantify the PQ residue on legumes without destructive procedures and high-cost instruments. Following the extraction procedure of the QuPPe-method, however, we took whole adzuki beans (Vigna angularis) extracted via a mixture of methanol and 1% formic acid at room temperature and followed by a 1 min cleanup by SPE. The PQ values for adzuki beans determined by LC/MSMS showed that regardless of whether extraction was followed by the QuPPe-method or the method we proposed, a consistent and low relative standard deviation (RSD) below &lt;22% was found. In this study, we proposed to extract PQ on the surface of the beans by shaking briefly with solvent, and then the PQ molecules were detected and quantified by depositing Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) and performing SERS within 10 min. Using a coating of deposited Ag nanoparticles, SERS can achieve a limit of detection (LOD) for PQ on the order of 1 μg L -1 (?4 × 10 -9 M) and a method detection limit (MDL) for adzuki beans of 0.8 μg kg -1 (?3.3 × 10 -9 M). This sensitivity at the ppb level absolutely met the maximum residue limit (MRL) for PQ in dried beans as declared by most countries, including the US (0.3 mg kg -1 ), Australia (1.0 mg kg -1 ) and Taiwan (0.2 mg kg -1 ). Taiwan will ban the use of PQ as a defoliating agent for harvest in adzuki bean fields in 2019; therefore, developing a method for detecting PQ residues in the field or in import markets is necessary for consumer health and for authorities.

AR (androgen receptor) and PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) have key roles in these processes. We report in this study, KDM8/JMJD5, a histone lysine demethylase/dioxygnase, exhibits a novel property as a dual coactivator of AR and PKM2 and as such, it is a potent inducer of castration and therapy resistance. Previously, we showed that KDM8 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and tumor metabolism in breast cancer cells. Its role in prostate cancer has not been explored. Here, we show that KDM8’s oncogenic properties in prostate cancer come from its direct interaction (1) with AR to affect androgen response and (2) with PKM2 to regulate tumor metabolism. The interaction with AR leads to the elevated expression of androgen response genes in androgen-deprived conditions. They include ANCCA/ATAD2 and EZH2, which are directly targeted by KDM8 and involved in sustaining the survival of the cells under hormone-deprived conditions. Notably, in enzalutamide-resistant cells, the expressions of both KDM8 and EZH2 are further elevated, so are neuroendocrine markers. Consequently, EZH2 inhibitors or KDM8 knockdown both resensitize the cells toward enzalutamide. In the cytosol, KDM8 associates with PKM2, the gatekeeper of pyruvate flux and translocates PKM2 into the nucleus, where the KDM8/PKM2 complex serves as a coactivator of HIF-1α to upregulate glycolytic genes. Using shRNA knockdown, we validate KDM8’s functions as a regulator for both androgen-responsive and metabolic genes. KDM8 thus presents itself as an ideal therapeutic target for metabolic adaptation and castration-resistance of prostate cancer cells. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"androgen; androgen receptor; enzalutamide; histone demethylase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; JMJD5 enzyme; KDM8 enzyme; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase M2; short hairpin RNA; transcription factor EZH2; unclassified drug; AAA protein; androgen receptor; AR protein, human; ATAD2 protein, human; carrier protein; DNA binding protein; EZH2 protein, human; HIF1A protein, human; histone demethylase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; KDM8 protein, human; membrane protein; phenylthiohydantoin; small interfering RNA; thyroid hormone; thyroid hormone-binding proteins; transcription factor EZH2; tumor protein; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer resistance; carcinogenesis; castration resistant prostate cancer; castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line; cell cycle; cell survival; chemosensitization; controlled study; cytosol; gene conversion; gene expression; gene knockdown; gene translocation; genetic regulation; glycolysis; hormone receptor interaction; hormone response; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; molecular pathology; mouse; nonhuman; Nu Nu mouse; nuclear reprogramming; nude mouse; priority journal; protein expression; protein protein interaction; protein transport; signal transduction; tumor growth; tumor immunity; upregulation; adenocarcinoma; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; castration resistant prostate cancer; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; nucleocytoplasmic transport; pathology; physiology; protein analysis; tumor cell line; xenograft; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA-Binding Proteins; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Glycolysis; Heterografts; Histone Demethylases; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Proteins; Phenylthiohydantoin; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; Protein Interaction Mapping; Receptors, Androgen; RNA, Small Interfering; Thyroid Hormones",2-s2.0-85052531213

The development of a direct and effective technique for the rapid detection and screening of 4-NP is, therefore, of urgent need. In this study, the blue luminescent sulfur-doped graphene quantum dots (S-GQDs) with a size of 1-5 nm are fabricated using a one-step pyrolysis procedure in the presence of citric acid and 3-mercaptosuccinic acid. The S-GQDs exhibit a strong emission band at 450 nm under the excitation of 330 nm UV light. 4-NP can serve as the fluorescence quencher by the π-π interaction with S-GQD, resulting in the linear decrease in fluorescence intensity after the addition of various 4-NP concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 200 μM. The S-GQDs serve as the sensing probe to enhance the analytical performance on 4-NP detection with the limit of detection values of 0.7 and 3.5 nM in deionized water and wastewater, respectively. The S-GQD based sensing platform can be used to detect 4-NP in different matrices of water and wastewater. In addition, the detected percentages of spiked 4-NP concentrations in the presence of different matrices and interferences are in the range of (98 ± 5)-(108 ± 2)%. Moreover, the S-GQD based paper sensor can rapidly screen 4-NP in wastewater within 1 min.

Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) are expressed on many cell types including DCs. Therefore, targeting of antigen to DCs via FcγRs is an attractive strategy for vaccine development. This study employ formyl peptide receptor-like 1 inhibitory protein (FLIPr), an FcγR binding protein secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, to deliver antigen to DCs. Our results show that FLIPr is a competent vehicle in delivering antigen to CD8+ DCs for induction of potent immunities without extra adjuvant formulation. Fusion antigen with FLIPr enables effective antigen presentation on both MHC class II and class I to induce memory T cell responses. Altogether, using FLIPr as an antigen delivery vector has great potential to apply antigens for cancer immunotherapy as well as other infectious disease vaccines. ? 2019 Chiang, Wu, Chen, Liu, Leng and Chen.",Antitumor immunity; Dendritic cells; FLIPr; Immunotherapy; Targeted antigen,CD40 antigen; endotoxin; epitope; Fc receptor; FLICE inhibitory protein; formylpeptide receptor like 1; gamma interferon; interleukin 2; interleukin 7 receptor; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; ovalbumin; adaptive immunity; amino acid sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antigen presentation; antineoplastic activity; Article; binding assay; bioassay; cancer immunotherapy; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; dendritic cell; Dengue virus; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; Escherichia coli; expression vector; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence activated cell sorting; immunoblotting; killing assay; memory T lymphocyte; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; protein expression; protein purification; spleen cell; Staphylococcus aureus; T lymphocyte activation; tumor growth; tumor immunity; vaccination,2-s2.0-85071575190

Also, the exact molecular mechanism of kurarinone for induction cytotoxicity remains unknown. Material and methods: We investigated the effects of kurarinone on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration in H1688 SCLC cells. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Apoptotic indices such as cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase activity, and death receptors were evaluated by flow cytometry. Transwell migration and invasion assays were also included. Results: Our results indicated that kurarinone significantly decreased H1688 cell viability and induced the accumulation of sub-G1 fractions by activating caspase-3,-9, and PARP cleavage accompanied by the elevated release of cytochrome c and mitochondrial dysfunction in H1688 cells. Additionally, kurarinone promoted Fas and TRAIL receptor-1 and-2 expression via the caspase-8/Bid pathway, suggesting that kurarinone triggered apoptosis via the mitochondria-mediated and receptor-mediated apoptotic pathways. We also observed that kurarinone repressed migration and invasion capabilities of SCLC cells by suppressing the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins and matrix metalloproteinases. Conclusion: Our findings provided evidence that kurarinone can induce apoptosis in SCLC cells via multiple mechanisms and delayed the cell migration and invasion of SCLC cells. ? 2019 Chung et al.",Apoptosis; Caspase; Invasiveness; Kurarinone; Migration; Small cell lung carcinoma,caspase; caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; cytochrome c; death receptor; death receptor 4; death receptor 5; kurarinone; matrix metalloproteinase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell cycle; cell invasion; cell migration; cell migration assay; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; disorders of mitochondrial functions; drug mechanism; enzyme activity; epithelial mesenchymal transition; flow cytometry; human; human cell; lung small cell carcinoma cell line; mitochondrial membrane potential; MTT assay; NCI-H1688 cell line; protein expression; protein metabolism; protein secretion; signal transduction,2-s2.0-85071169209

The World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Taipei (2016) highlights the possibility of encountering IF and requires that research on biospecimens address biobank feedback policies in their informed consent process, leaving open the possibility that the policy may be “no return”. As clinicians and researchers begin to use these “resources”, the possibility of finding clinically significant IF is becoming a reality. Discussion: In line with the WMA's Declaration of Taipei, a pragmatic approach is needed to deal with the issue of returning IF in biobank governance. Indeed, the impacts and concerns associated with the return of IF differ across different stakeholder groups and jurisdictions. Therefore, the framework governing IF return needs to be custom-built, taking into account the nature of each research project and the unique features of biobanks. To this end, in addition to facilitating biobank transparency, establishing an endurable and horizontal connection among biobanks and clinical institutions under a public health system will improve efficiency and effectiveness. Hence, subject to contemporary Taiwanese ethical and/or legal regulations, this article argues for the establishment of an updated framework for imaging-related and genetic-related IF return within the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), mainly based on a limited obligation to disclose life-threatening information revealed by imaging, but not genetic, information. After discussing some of the ethical, legal and social issues encountered by the TWB and accounting for the experiences of other international biobanks, we propose a systematic framework for returning IF, mainly on a “limited obligation” basis, which offers better and more comprehensive protection for biobank-participants' rights and health. ? 2019 The Authors",Biobanks; Bioethics; Framework; Incidental finding; The WMA Declaration of Taipei (2016),Diagnosis; Philosophical aspects; Biobanks; Bioethics; Framework; Incidental findings; The WMA Declaration of Taipei (2016); Laws and legislation; adult; biobank; bioethics; clinician; human; incidental finding; informed consent; public health; responsibility; review; scientist; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85070760189

According to the WHO bulletin report, the H5N1 virus is a zoonotic disease threat that has infected more than 850 humans, causing over 450 deaths. In addition, an outbreak of another new and highly pathogenic influenza virus (H7N9) occurred in 2013 in China. These highly pathogenic influenza viruses could potentially cause a worldwide pandemic. it is crucial to develop a rapid production platform to meet this surge demand against any possible influenza pandemic. A potential solution for this problem is the use of cell-based bioreactors for rapid vaccine production. These novel bioreactors, used for cell-based vaccine production, possess various advantages. For example, they enable a short production time, allow for the handling highly pathogenic influenza in closed environments, and can be easily scaled up. In this study, two novel disposable cell-based bioreactors, BelloCell and TideCell, were used to produce H5N1 clade II and H7N9 candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Madin- Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were used for the production of these influenza CVVs. A novel bench-scale bioreactor named BelloCell bioreactor was used in the study. All culturing conditions were tested and scaled to 10 L industrial-scale bioreactor known as TideCell002. The performances of between BelloCell and TideCell were similar in cell growth, the average MDCK cell doubling time was slightly decreased to 25 hours. The systems yielded approximately 39.2 and 18.0 μg/ml of HA protein with the 10-liter TideCell002 from the H5N1 clade II and H7N9 CVVs, respectively. The results of this study not only highlight the overall effectiveness of these bioreactors but also illustrate the potential of maintaining the same outcome when scaled up to industrial production, which has many implications for faster vaccine production. Although additional studies are required for process optimization, the results of this study are promising and show that oscillating bioreactors may be a suitable platform for pandemic influenza virus production. ? 2019 Lai et al.",,hemagglutinin; influenza vaccine; animal cell; Article; cell density; cell growth; cladistics; Influenza A virus (H5N1); Influenza A virus (H7N9); MDCK cell line; nonhuman; scale up; vaccine production; Vero cell line; virus culture,2-s2.0-85070662422

Preferably, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) would be carried out prior to antibiotic prescription, though it is generally thought to be too complex and labor-intensive. In order to assist clinicians with better antibiotic administration for the effective treatment of bacterial infections, an integrated microfluidic system (IMS) capable of automating AST for 1-2 antibiotics against clinical bacterial pathogens was developed herein. Accurate determination of the minimum and fractional inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin, gentamicin, and linezolid were determined by assaying growth of two clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates via a colorimetric assay on-chip. By applying various antibiotic combinations against a single pathogen in multiple chambers, the IMS could identify the optimal drug combination and the minimum effective dosage by evaluating the fractional inhibitory concentration index. This IMS possessed several advantages over conventional methods, including (1) a 50% reduction in bacterial sample and reagent volume (<50 μL per well), (2) less potential for human error due to its automatic nature, (3) faster liquid manipulation time by integrating the microfluidic components rather than labor-intensive process, and (4) straightforward result interpretation via colorimetric change instead of turbidity degree. Personalized medicine for treatment of bacterial infections may therefore be realized using this IMS. ?

DIII of the E proteins is an independent domain and stretches out on the virion surface that can elicit type-specific neutralizing antibodies. For recombinant DIII vaccine development, prime-boost immunizations can provide an advantage of eliciting more type-specific neutralizing antibodies by recalling DIII antigens after DIII booster to improve protection. Methods: The DIII of the E genes of DENV and ZIKV were fused with bacterial fliC gene for the expression of flagellin-DIII (FliC-DIII) fusion proteins. Prime-boost immunization strategies by the second-dose booster of four DENV serotype or ZIKV FliC-DIII fusion proteins were used to investigate the induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection against viral infections. Cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies in each group of antisera were also examined using in vitro antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay. A series of glycan-masking E antigens were finally constructed for prime-boost immunizations to abolish the elicitation of cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies for ADE activity. Results: We showed that inclusion of a bivalent live-attenuated vaccine with a FliC-DIII booster is superior in eliciting neutralization titers and protection in vivo against all four-serotype DENVs. We also demonstrated that recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding four-serotype DENV prMEs with a FliC-DIII prime-boost scheme is capable of eliciting good antibody responses. In contract, recombinant adenovirus vector of ZIKV prME gene priming, followed by ZIKV FliC-DIII booster did not improve vaccine efficacy. The glycan-masking mutation on the ZIKV E protein ij loop (E-248NHT), but not on DENV2 E protein ij loop (E-242NHT), resulted in abolishing the elicitation of cross-reactive antibodies for DENV and ZIKV infection enhancements.

In this paper, we propose a facile strategy to develop a polydopamine (PDA)-coated Au nanostar (NS@PPFA) as a multifunctional nanoplatform for cancer targeting and combination therapy. The Au nanostar demonstrated high photothermal conversion efficiency because of the tip-enhanced plasmonic effect. Modification of PDA and folic acid on the NS surface improved its drug-loading efficiency and targeting capability. In vitro, compared with nontargeted cells, targeted breast cancer MCF-7 cells demonstrated efficient uptake of chemodrug-loaded NS-D@PPFA through the receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway. In combination with the photothermal effect induced by near-infrared laser irradiation, controlled payload release could be activated in response to both internal (acid) and external (photothermal) stimuli, leading to an efficient chemo-photothermal action against MCF-7 cells and drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells. By contrast, cellular damage was less obvious in normal HaCaT (human skin keratinocytes) and NIH-3T3 cells (murine fibroblasts). In addition, payload-free NS@PPFA exhibited a high binding affinity (Kd = 2.68 × 10-10 M) toward vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A165), which was at least two orders of magnitude stronger than that of highly abundant plasma proteins, such as human serum albumin. Furthermore, in vitro study showed that NS@PPFA could effectively inhibit VEGF-A165-induced proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, resulting in additional therapeutic benefits for eradicating tumors through a simultaneous antiangiogenic action in chemo-photothermal treatment. The combined treatment also exhibited the lowest microvessel density, leading to a potent antitumor effect in vivo.

Seed evidence could be grouped into several categories based on the types of crimes they are associated with, including child abuse, homicides and drugs. Most commonly, seeds are examined microscopically and identified to the plant species level to show a linkage between persons and places. More recently, forensic researchers have evaluated the potential for extracting and typing DNA from seeds to further individualize the samples. As a model system, tomato seeds were examined microscopically after different cooking treatments and assessed for the potential to DNA type seeds for variety identification. A sufficient quantity and quality of DNA were recovered from uncooked, digested and undigested tomato seeds for amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis; however, any form of cooking destroyed the seed DNA. A simple microscopic analysis was able to distinguish between a cooked tomato seed versus an uncooked seed. This article is intended to provide an overview of case examples and current techniques for the forensic examination of seeds as plant-derived evidence. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

Using a murine orthotopic anaplastic astrocytoma model, ALTS1C1, this study showed that brain tumor edge had a very unique microenvironment, having higher microvascular density (MVD) and better vessel function than the tumor core, but on the other hand was also positive for hypoxia markers, such as pimonidazole (PIMO), hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIX). The hypoxia at tumor edge was transient, named as peripheral hypoxia, and caused by different mechanisms from the chronic hypoxia in tumor core. The correlation of CAIX staining with astrocyte activation marker, glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), at the tumor edge indicated the involvement of astrocyte activation on the development of peripheral hypoxia. Peripheral hypoxia was a specific trait of orthotopic brain tumors at tumor edge, regardless of tumor origin. The hypoxic cells were resistant to the therapy, regardless of their location. Surviving cells, particularly those at the hypoxic region of tumor edge, are likely the cause of tumor recurrence after the therapy.

Although drug testing on three-dimensional (3D) cultured cells may provide a more accurate prediction of drug efficacy, it is relatively costly and time-consuming to perform compared with conventional 2D cultures due to the thick z-axis of the 3D models. In this study, we have presented a microfluidic platform with integrated pneumatic valves for producing a thin-gel 3D cell culture-based combinatorial drug screening array (3D-μCDS array). The multilayer architecture and microfluidic layout has a smaller device footprint than a single-layer microfluidic channel arrangement, making it well suited to scaling up for high-throughput combinatorial drug screening on 3D cell model. We performed 8 × 8 combination drug screening experiments with the device using two anti-cancer drugs (doxorubicin and paclitaxel) on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines for demonstration. Our results indicate that our 3D-μCDS array device allows the successful screening of multiple drug combinations while reducing the operation time and the number of sample/reagents required, making it an ideal tool for general combinatorial drug screening, as well as for applications using valuable tissues and clinical samples. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",3D cell culture; Combinatorial drug screening; High-throughput; Microfluidic array; Thin gel,"Body fluids; Cell culture; Cells; Diseases; Drug products; Microfluidics; Multilayers; Network architecture; Screening; Software architecture; 3-D cell culture; Drug screening; High throughput; MCF-7 breast cancer cells; Microfluidic array; Microfluidic platforms; Multi-layer architectures; Threedimensional (3-d); 3D modeling; collagen; animal; cell culture technique; chemistry; combinatorial chemistry; devices; diffusion; equipment design; extracellular matrix; fluorescence; gel; high throughput screening; human; IC50; microfluidics; preclinical study; procedures; rat; tumor cell culture; Animals; Cell Culture Techniques; Collagen; Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques; Diffusion; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Equipment Design; Extracellular Matrix; Fluorescence; Gels; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Microfluidics; Rats; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-85067373727

Lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) are subtypes of NSCLC. We usually regard them as different disease due to their unique molecular characteristics, distinct cells of origin and dissimilar clinical response. However, the differences of genetic and epigenetic progression mechanism between LADC and LSCC are complicated to analyze. Therefore, we applied systems biology approaches and big databases mining to construct genetic and epigenetic networks (GENs) with next-generation sequencing data of LADC and LSCC. In order to obtain the real GENs, system identification and system order detection are conducted on gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) for each stage of LADC and LSCC. The core GENs were extracted via principal network projection (PNP). Based on the ranking of projection values, we got the core pathways in respect of KEGG pathway. Compared with the core pathways, we found significant differences between microenvironments, dysregulations of miRNAs, epigenetic modifications on certain signaling transduction proteins and target genes in each stage of LADC and LSCC. Finally, we proposed six genetic and epigenetic multiple-molecule drugs to target essential biomarkers in each progression stage of LADC and LSCC, respectively. ? 2019 Impact Journals LLC.

Our recent study demonstrated that ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPIA), a key regulator of the PPP, regulates hepatoma cell proliferation and colony formation. Our studies in zebrafish reveal that RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and β-catenin signaling. To further investigate RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis, two independent lines of transgenic zebrafish expressing human RPIA in the liver were generated. These studies reveal that RPIA overexpression triggers lipogenic factor/enzyme expression, steatosis, fibrosis and proliferation of the liver. In addition, the severity of fibrosis and the extent of proliferation are positively correlated with RPIA expression levels. Furthermore, RPIA-mediated induction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires the ERK and β-catenin signaling pathway but is not dependent upon transaldolase levels. Our study presents a mechanism for RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis and suggests that RPIA represents a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).",,beta catenin; isomerase; mitogen activated protein kinase; ribose 5 phosphate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; enzyme activation; fatty liver; human; human cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transgenic zebrafish; xenotransplantation,2-s2.0-85066817959

To ensure that this approach is successful, safe and efficient gene delivery methods for stem cell engineering must be developed. Methods: In this study, a magnetic ternary nanohybrid (MTN) system comprising biodegradable cationic materials, nucleic acids, and hyaluronic acid-decorated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles was proposed to construct stem cells expressing the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) via magnetic force and receptor dual targeting. Results: The CD44/magnetic force-mediated enhanced cellular uptake of MTNs by human mesenchymal cells (hMSCs) was confirmed in vitro. Highly efficient transfection was attained using MTNs without having any detrimental effect on the tumor migration and penetration capabilities of hMSCs. TRAIL expressed by the MTN-transfected hMSCs displayed strong anticancer effects through the activation of caspase-3 apoptotic signaling. The MTN-transfected hMSCs can be clearly imaged using magnetic resonance imaging techniques in vivo. In an orthotopic xenograft cancer model, MTN-transfected TRAIL-expressing hMSCs significantly suppressed the progression of human glioma (U87MG) and prolonged the survival of the animal. Conclusions: These findings suggest the considerable potential of utilizing MTNs for effectively constructing tumor toxic agent-expressing stem cells for treating malignant cancers. ?

Today, no widely accepted assessment protocols of haptic function are in clinical use. This is primarily due to the scarcity of fast, objective measures capable of characterizing mild to severe forms of haptic dysfunction with appropriate resolution. This study introduces a novel curvature-perception assessment system called the Minnesota Haptic Function Test? that seeks to overcome the shortcomings of current clinical assessments. Aims: The purpose of this study was threefold: (1) apply the test to a sample of young healthy adults to establish test-specific adult norms for haptic sensitivity and acuity; (2) establish the reliability of this instrument; (3) demonstrate clinical efficacy in a limited sample of cancer survivors who may exhibit haptic dysfunction due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Method: Participants manually explored two curved surfaces successively and made verbal judgments about their curvature. A Bayesian-based adaptive algorithm selected presented stimulus pairs based on a subject's previous responses, which ensured fast convergence toward a threshold. Haptic sensitivity was assessed by obtaining detection thresholds in 26 adults (19-34 years). Haptic acuity was assessed by obtaining just-noticeable-difference thresholds in a second sample of 28 adults (19-25 years). Nine cancer survivors (18-25 years) with suspected peripheral neuropathy completed the acuity assessment. Test-retest reliability of the algorithm was calculated. Results: First, the test yielded values that are consistent with those reported in the literature. Mean detection threshold for curvature of the healthy adults was 0.782 (SD ± 0.320 m -1 ). The corresponding mean discrimination threshold was 1.030 (SD ± 0.462 m -1 ). Second, test-retest reliability of the algorithm was assessed in a simulation, yielding an average correlation between repeated simulated thresholds of r = 0.93. Third, the test documented that 86% of the cancer survivors had acuity thresholds above the 75th percentile of the normative cohort, and 29% had thresholds above the normal range, indicating that the instrument can detect and differentiate between unaffected perception, and mild or more severe forms of haptic loss. Conclusion: We here provide evidence that this new method to assess haptic perception of curvature is valid, reliable, and clinically practicable. ? 2019 Holst-Wolf, Tseng and Konczak.",Active touch; Human; Perception; Proprioception; Somatosensation; Tactile,,2-s2.0-85065156510

Methods and Results-This was a prospective, observational study comprising 1193 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome. The patients were stratified into 4 body mass index categories, and their mortality rates were compared using time-dependent Cox regression analysis using normal weight (body mass index, 18.5-23.9) as the reference. Subsequently, the influence of antidiabetic therapies on the association between BMI and mortality were analyzed. Seventy-four patients (6.2%) died over 2 years of follow-up. The mortality rate was lowest in the class I obese group (3.35%) and highest in the normal-weight group (9.67%). After adjusting for covariates, class I obesity paradoxically remained significantly protective against mortality compared with normal weight (hazard ratio, 0.141; P=0.049); interaction term analysis showed that insulin therapy influenced this “obesity paradox” (P=0.045). When the patients were stratified by insulin use, the protective effect of obesity disappeared in the insulin-treated patients but persisted in the non-insulin-treated patients. Conclusions-In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome, the relationship between body mass index and mortality rate is U-shaped, with class I obesity representing the nadir and normal weight the peak. The protective effect of obesity disappeared in patients treated with insulin. ? 2019 The Authors.",Acute coronary syndrome; Insulin; Mortality; Obesity paradox; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; insulin sensitizing agent; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; sulfonylurea; acute coronary syndrome; adult; adverse outcome; aged; all cause mortality; Article; body mass; body weight; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; drug use; female; follow up; human; insulin treatment; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; treatment response,2-s2.0-85063712170

Moreover, A. oxyphylla is effective for cognitive function improvement and nerve regeneration. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuronal inflammatory autoimmune disease that commonly affects young adults in high-latitude regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of A. oxyphylla in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model, which is an extensively used model for human MS. The ethanolic extract of A. oxyphylla fruit (AO-1) was orally administered to EAE mice. Our results showed AO-1 significantly reduced EAE symptoms. Histopathological analysis showed AO-1 reduced demyelination, inflammation, gliosis, and axonal swelling in the spinal cord. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) studies revealed that the infiltration of CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and CD11b+ monocytes into the spinal cord decreased in the AO-1-treated group. Mechanistically, the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, Th17 transcription factor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγt), and inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-17 were reduced in the spinal cords of mice treated with AO-1. The expression levels of T-bet and RORγt were also lowered in the spleens of those mice. Further in vitro study showed AO-1 inhibited production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor- from MOG35-55-peptide-stimulated splenocytes. One component isolated from AO-1, yakuchinone A, inhibited IL-17 production in vitro and reduced EAE symptoms in the mice. Collectively, our results indicate that AO-1 ameliorated the severity of EAE in mice and may involve the regulation of Th1/Th17 response. A. oxyphylla warrants further investigation, particularly regarding its clinical benefits for MS. ? 2019 Kuo-Kuei Huang et al.",,Alpinia oxyphylla extract; antiinflammatory agent; CD11b antigen; CD4 antigen; CD8 antigen; gamma interferon; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; plant extract; retinoic acid receptor gamma; transcription factor T bet; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; Alpinia; Alpinia oxyphylla; animal experiment; animal model; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; demyelination; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; female; gliosis; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; inflammation; molecular weight; monocyte; mouse; multiple sclerosis; nerve fiber degeneration; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; regulatory mechanism; spinal cord; spleen cell; T lymphocyte activation; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; ultra performance liquid chromatography; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85063531894

A microfluidic chip featuring a HA × NA array was consequently developed herein for diagnosis and subtyping of InfA viruses via the use of glycan-coated magnetic beads followed by reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Up to 12 InfA subtypes were simultaneously detected in an automated fashion in less than 100 minutes on this microfluidic platform, representing a significant improvement in analysis speed compared to benchtop RT-PCR and chip-based microarray systems. The limits of detection of the RT-PCR assays ranged from 40 to 3000 copy numbers for the different subtypes of InfA viruses, around two orders of magnitude higher than in previous studies using microfluidic technologies. In summary, the array-type microfluidic chip system provides a rapid, sensitive, and fully automated approach for detection and multiple subtyping of InfA. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,glycan; microsphere; polysaccharide; Article; controlled study; Influenza A virus; limit of detection; microarray analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; velocity; virus detection; chemistry; devices; equipment design; genetics; Influenza A virus; isolation and purification; lab on a chip; magnet; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; system analysis; time factor; Equipment Design; Influenza A virus; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Magnets; Microspheres; Polysaccharides; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Systems Integration; Time Factors,2-s2.0-85063502837

Although a process known as ""systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment"" (SELEX) has been used to generate aptamer-based cancer biomarkers, this approach is complicated, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. An automated microfluidic system was consequently developed herein to screen ovarian cancer-specific aptamers via on-chip SELEX with clinical cancer tissue samples. The integrated microfluidic system consisted of an integrated microfluidic chip, a temperature control module equipped with 12 thermoelectric coolers, and a flow control module for controlling 36 electromagnetic valves such that the entire, tissue-based SELEX process could be fully automated and carried out within 15 h. Highly specific ovarian cancer aptamers with high affinity (dissociation constant of 129 nM) to their cellular targets were screened with this system. Given the comparable specificity to their much more expensive antibody counterparts, these aptamers, when used in conjunction with the developed microfluidic system, may be used to diagnose ovarian cancer in its earliest stages. ? 2019 Author(s).",,Automation; Biomarkers; Dissociation; Fluidic devices; Microfluidics; Thermoelectric equipment; Tissue; Cancer biomarkers; Dissociation constant; Electromagnetic valves; Integrated microfluidic chips; Integrated microfluidic systems; Micro fluidic system; Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichments; Thermoelectric cooler; Diseases,2-s2.0-85062269397

Detecting and enumerating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with colorectal cancer emerged as an important prognostic tool which provides a direct estimate of metastatic potential. Improving the turnaround time and decreasing sample volume is critical for incorporating this liquid biopsy tool into routine practice. The objective of the current study was to validate the clinical feasibility of a self-assembled cell array (SACA) chip, a CTC counting platform with less than 4 h turnaround time, in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancers. In total, 179 patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancers from a single institute were enrolled. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule positive (EpCAM(+)), cluster of differentiation 45 negative (CD45(-)) cells were isolated and enumerated from 2 mL of peripheral vein blood (PB) and inferior mesenteric vein blood (IMV) samples obtained during surgery. We found that the CTC count in PB but not IMV correlates with disease stages. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not lead to decreased CTC count in both types of blood samples. With cutoffs of four CTCs per 2 mL of blood, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of 5 ng/mL, patients with non-metastatic disease were more likely to experience recurrence if they had high PB CTC count and high serum CEA concentration (odds ratio, 8.9). Our study demonstrates the feasibility of enumerating CTCs with a SACA chip in patients with colorectal cancer. ? 2019 by the authors.

However, the existing methods for CTC detection are relatively time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a new microfluidic platform integrated with field-effect transistors (FETs) and chambers for the trapping of CTCs was developed. This novel design could not only trap CTCs from whole blood samples, but also enumerate them via FET sensing of CTC-specific aptamer-CTC complexes. The FET output signal was experimentally found to increase with the increasing number of captured CTCs. More importantly, the enumeration of spiked CTCs in blood samples could be achieved in accordance with the signals measured on the FET devices. We therefore believe that this automated system could be a useful tool for enumeration of CTCs. ?

Photo-activated external stimuli such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) also ensure adequate drug delivery in a precise temporal and spatial manner. However, current ROS-responsive drug delivery systems usually require tedious synthetic procedures. A facile one-pot approach has been reported herein, to obtain self-assembled polymeric nanocarriers (NCs) for simultaneous paclitaxel (PTX)- and Rose Bengal (RB)-loading to achieve combined chemo-photodynamic therapy and controlled drug release in responsive to a light-induced ROS stimulus. To encapsulate these hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, chitosan (CTS), branched polyethylenimine (bPEI) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were selected and fabricated into nanoblended matrices through an oil-in-water emulsion method. The amphiphilic properties of CTS permit simultaneous entrapment of PTX and RB, while the encapsulation efficiency of RB was further improved by increasing the amount of short-chain bPEI. During the one-step assembly process, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was also added to condense the cationic tripolymer mixtures into more stable nanocarriers (BNCs). Hyaluronic acid (HA) was subsequently grafted onto the surface of BNCs through electrostatic interaction, leading to the formation of HA-BSA/CTS/PVA/bPEI-blended nanocarriers (HBNCs) to achieve an efficient prostate-cancer-cell uptake. Importantly, in response to external light irradiation, HBNCs become destabilized owing to the RB-mediated photodynamic action. It allows an on-demand dual-payload release to evoke a simultaneous photodynamic and chemo treatment for cancer cell eradication. Thus, HBNCs present a new promising approach that exhibits a specific vulnerability to RB-induced photosensitization. The consequent dual-cargo release is also expected to successfully combat cancer through a synergistic anti-tumor effect. ? 2019 Chang, del Valle, Yeh, He and Huang.",Chemotherapy; Combined therapy; Nanocarrier; Photodynamic thearpy; ROS-responsive,,2-s2.0-85061180412

To tackle this problem, cyber-physical digital microfluidic biochips with integrated sensors have been proposed and have attracted attention recently. In order to fully utilize the sensors for detection, the reusability of sensors should be taken into consideration during the module placement stage of cyber-physical DMFBs synthesis flow. Moreover, excessive actuation of electrodes may cause reliability degradation and this issuse should also be taken care of during module placement stage. In order to deal with the aforementioned problems, this paper presents the first co-optimization method for both module and sensor placement.

CD24 depletion inhibited primary tumor growth and lymph node and lung metastasis and reduced the number of blood and lymphatic vessels in the tumor microenvironment. CD24 knockdown impaired EGFR/Met-mediated signaling and reduced lymphangiogenesis- and angiogenesis-related molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factors A and C, by promoting EGFR and Met protein instability via the lysosomal degradation pathway. CD24 monoclonal antibody treatment reduced lung metastasis and prolonged the survival in a lung metastasis mouse model. Clinical analyses revealed that the CD24 high /MET high ""double-positive"" signature identified a subset of TNBC patients with worst outcomes.

Materials and methods: Hydrophobic AuNRs were synthesized by the hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB)-mediated seed growth method, and then, they received two-step surface modifications of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dodecane. The AuNR/DOX/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocomplexes were prepared by emulsifying DOX, AuNR, and PLGA into aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution by sonication. Human serum albumin (HSA) was used to coat the nanocomplexes to afford HSA/AuNR/DOX–PLGA (HADP). Size and surface potential of the HADP nanocomplexes were determined by using a Zetasizer. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of the HADP were analyzed by using MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. In vitro anticancer effects of the HADP were studied on various cancer cell lines. To assess the therapeutic efficacy, CT26 tumor-bearing mice were intravenously administered with HADP nanocomplexes and laser treatments, followed by monitoring of the tumor growth and body weight. Results: Size and surface potential of the HADP nanocomplexes were 245.8 nm and-8.6 mV, respectively. Strong photothermal effects were verified on the AuNR-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) in vitro. Rapid and repeated drug release from the HADP nanocomplexes was successfully achieved by near-infrared (NIR) irradiations. HSA significantly promoted cellular uptake of the HADP nanocomplexes to murine colon cancer cells as demonstrated by cell imaging and flow cytometric studies. By combining photothermal and chemotherapy, the HADP nanocomplexes exhibited strong synergistic anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo.

In the present study, we investigated whether or not MA affects immune responses in a leukemia mouse model. Materials and Methods: WEHI-3 cells were intraperitonealIy (i.p.) injected into normal BALB/c mice to develop leukemia. Mice were then treated by i.p. injection with MA at different doses (0, 8, 16 and 32 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. After treatment, all animals were weighed and blood, liver and spleen tissues were weighed. Blood or spleen both were used for determination of cell markers or phagocytosis, natural killer (NK) cell activities and T- and B-cell proliferation, respectively, by using a flow cytometric assay. Results: MA did not significantly affect body, liver, and spleen weights. However, MA increased markers of T-cells (at 16 mg/kg treatment) and monocytes (at 32 mg/kg treatment), but reduced B-cell markers (at 8 mg/kg treatment); MA did not significantly affect cell marker of macrophages. Furthermore, MA increased phagocytosis by macrophages from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peritoneal cavity at 32 mg/kg treatment and increased NK cell activity at target cell:splenocyte ratio of 25:1 but did not affect B- and T-cell proliferation. Conclusion: MA increased immune responses by enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and NK cell activities in leukemic mice. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

However, the photo-triggered siRNA release was 78% within 1 h and was higher than 91% after 24 h. The remarkable contrast between the stability and release efficiency of these siRNA-condensed micelleplexes before and after photo-irradiation has been rationalized by the light- and pH-induced structural transitions of the triblock copolymer micelles.

The obtained DOX/ICG-loaded PNAs were characterized by a compact γ-PGA/DOX complexes-encapsulated PLGA-rich core covered with the co-assembly of amphiphilic D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)] (DSPE-PEG) and ICG molecules. The robust cargo-loaded PNAs not only promoted the photo-stability of ICG in PBS, but also reduced ICG leakage from PNAs. With the milieu pH being altered from 7.4 to 5.0, the massive disruption of ionic DOX/γ-GA complexes and PLGA degradation considerably accelerated DOX release from payload-containing PNAs. The results of in vitro cellular uptake revealed that the DOX/ICG-loaded PNAs appreciably enhanced the cellular uptake of payloads by HeLa cells. Notably, through the intracellular acid-triggered rapid DOX release combined with the ICG-based NIR-activated hyperthermia and singlet oxygen generation, the combination therapy of DOX/ICG-loaded PNAs can use lower dosage of drugs to effectively inhibit proliferation of HeLa cells compared to the chemo or photothermal treatment alone, thus showing the great potential to improve efficacy of cancer treatment. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Amphiphilic graft copolymers; Intracellular drug delivery; NIR-activated photothermal treatment; pH-triggered DOX release; Polymeric nanoassemblies,Amino acids; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Drug dosage; Gas generators; Hyperthermia therapy; Infrared devices; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylenes; Targeted drug delivery; Amphiphilic graft copolymers; Combination therapy; Intracellular drug delivery; Nano-assemblies; Photo-thermal; Photothermal effects; Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid; Singlet oxygen generation; Lanthanum compounds,2-s2.0-85057265888

The crucial part of this study was investigating an approach to employ the Gafchromic film dosimeter placed inside a PMMA phantom irradiated by a BNCT beam. The spatial distribution of neutron dose of the film was determined using measurements and Monte Carlo calculations. By employing the present approach, the two-dimensional distributions of the neutron dose component of the film at specific depths in the phantom were successfully obtained. The determined neutron dose profiles were in good agreement with the calculated ones. This study also confirmed the finding that the film dosimeter is sensitive to thermal neutrons by comparing the depth-capture-reaction-rate and depth-dose distributions. Results of this work not only proved the feasibility of using the proposed method for the QA measurement of beam delivery but also revealed the advantages of easy-handling and remarkable spatial resolution of the film dosimeter when applied to BNCT fields.

Most tumors progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and develop the neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype under androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The molecular basis for NE transdifferentiation after ADT remains incompletely understood. Herein, we show that an immunocyte expression protein, ZBTB46, induces inflammatory response gene expression and contributes to NE differentiation of prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated a molecular mechanism whereby ZBTB46 can be regulated by the androgen-responsive gene, SPDEF, and is associated with NE prostate cancer (NEPC) differentiation. In addition, ZBTB46 acts as a transcriptional coactivator that binds to the promoter of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) and transcriptionally regulated PTGS1 levels. Overexpression of ZBTB46 decreases the sensitivity of the combination of enzalutamide and a PTGS1 inhibitor; however, knockdown of ZBTB46 sensitizes the PTGS1 inhibitor and reduces tumor malignancy. ZBTB46 is inversely correlated with SPDEF and is increased in higher tumor grades and small-cell NE prostate cancer (SCNC) patients, which are positively associated with PTGS1. Our findings suggest that the induction of ZBTB46 results in increased PTGS1 expression, which is associated with NEPC progression and linked to the dysregulation of the AR-SPDEF pathway. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC); PTGS1; SPDEF; ZBTB46,"membrane protein; prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 1; unclassified drug; androgen receptor; androgen receptor antagonist; AR protein, human; cyclooxygenase 1; PTGS1 protein, human; SPDEF protein, human; transcription factor; transcription factor Ets; Zbtb46 protein, human; analysis of variance; androgen deprivation therapy; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; carcinogenicity; cell differentiation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; colony formation; controlled study; cytokine production; human; human cell; human tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; prostate cancer; protein binding; protein expression; signal transduction; tissue microarray; transcription regulation; ZBTB46 PTGS1 signaling; animal; biosynthesis; cell differentiation; genetics; metabolism; neuroendocrine tumor; nude mouse; pathology; prostate tumor; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Androgen Receptor Antagonists; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclooxygenase 1; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Prostatic Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets; Receptors, Androgen; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-85054904049

Research question: The aim of the study was to investigate if changes in the symmetry of the perturbations affect patterns of muscle activity during gait initiation. Methods: Eleven young health participants were instructed to stand on the force platform and wait for the instruction of taking a right step, left step or stand still while experiencing a pendulum perturbation applied to the back of both shoulders (symmetric), back of the right shoulder (asymmetric) or no perturbations. Bilateral electromyographic activity (EMG) of dorsal and ventral muscles, moments of the pendulum release and perturbation impact, center of pressure (COP) displacements and pelvic movements were recorded and analyzed before and after the onset of the perturbation. Results: Taking the right/left step in presence of symmetric perturbation did not affect the temporal sequence of COP and pelvic movements. The onset of COP and pelvic movement occurred before the perturbation impact at the shoulder levels. The factors of step and perturbation did not significantly affect integrals of bilateral muscles at the pendulum release. After the pendulum release, ventral and dorsal EMG integrals of the trunk, thigh, and shank segments increased or decreased corresponding to the swing and stance leg. Changes in muscle activities were also associated with the symmetric or asymmetric perturbations before and after the perturbation impact. Significance: The outcome of the study provides information about strategies used to coordinate the activity of muscles while body perturbations are induced during gait initiation. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Balance control; Gait initiation; Muscle coordination; Symmetric and asymmetric perturbation,"adult; article; clinical article; coordination; female; gait; human; human experiment; male; muscle function; shoulder; standing; thigh; trunk; accelerometry; body equilibrium; electromyography; gait; normal human; physiology; procedures; skeletal muscle; young adult; Accelerometry; Adult; Electromyography; Female; Gait; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Postural Balance; Torso; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85054080735

P-113 is a clinically active histidine-rich antimicrobial peptide. Nal-P-113, a β-naphthylalanine-substituted P-113, is salt-resistant but has limited LPS neutralizing activity. We suspected the size and shape of the non-natural bulky amino acid may affect its LPS neutralizing activity. Herein, antimicrobial, LPS neutralizing, and antiproteolytic effects of phenylalanine- (Phe-P-113), β-naphthylalanine- (Nal-P-113), β-diphenylalanine- (Dip-P-113), and β-(4,4′-biphenyl)alanine- (Bip-P-113) substituted P-113 were studied. Experiments: Structure-activity relationships of P-113, Phe-P-113, Nal-P-113, Dip-P-113, and Bip-P-113 were evaluated using antimicrobial activity assays, serum proteolytic assays, peptide-induced permeabilization of large unilamellar vesicles, zeta potential measurements, dynamic light scattering measurement of LPS aggregation, and Limulus amebocyte lysate assays for measuring LPS neutralization. In vitro and in vivo LPS neutralizing activities were further confirmed by LPS-induced inflammation inhibition in an endotoxemia mouse model. Findings: Bip-P-113 and Dip-P-113 had the longest and widest non-nature amino acids, respectively. Bip-P-113 enhanced salt resistance, serum proteolytic stability, peptide-induced permeabilization, zeta potential measurements, LPS aggregation, and in vitro and in vivo LPS neutralizing activities.

Aptamers generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) processes have been shown to be superior to conventional antibody-based cardiac biomarker detection. However, SELEX is a complicated, lengthy procedure requiring multiple rounds of extraction/amplification and well-trained personnel. To circumvent such issue, we designed an automated, miniaturized SELEX platform for the screening of aptamers towards three protein biomarkers associated with CVDs: N-terminal pro-peptide of B-type natriuretic peptide, human cardiac troponin I, and fibrinogen. The developed microfluidic platform was equipped with microfluidic devices capable of sample transport and mixing along with an on-chip nucleic acid amplification module such that the entire screening process (5 rounds of selection in 8 h.) could be performed consecutively on a single chip while consuming only 35 ?L of reagents in each cycle. This system may therefore serve as a promising, sensitive, cost-effective platform for the selection of aptamers specific for CVD biomarkers. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Biomarkers; Fibrinogen; Human cardiac troponin I; Microfluidics; NT-proBNP; SELEX,"Chemical detection; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Microfluidics; Nucleic acids; Peptides; Screening; B-type natriuretic peptide; Cardiac troponin I; Fibrinogen; Integrated microfluidics; Microfluidic platforms; NT-proBNP; SELEX; Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichments; Biomarkers; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; aptamer; biological marker; fibrinogen; human cardiac troponin I; troponin I; unclassified drug; aptamer; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; fibrinogen; peptide fragment; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76); troponin I; Article; automation; binding affinity; cardiovascular disease; combinatorial chemistry; microfluidics; nucleic acid amplification; screening; systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment; cardiovascular disease; chemistry; devices; equipment design; genetic procedures; human; lab on a chip; systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment aptamer technique; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Biomarkers; Biosensing Techniques; Cardiovascular Diseases; Equipment Design; Fibrinogen; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Peptide Fragments; SELEX Aptamer Technique; Troponin I",2-s2.0-85053807161

Multi-drug combinations cannot be practically elucidated using conventional devices owing to structural limitations or operational complexity. 3D printing has recently attracted attention as a way to fabricate complicated and interconnected microfluidic channels, which is of design flexibility. Here, an easy-to-use, high-throughput, multi-drug combinations 3D printed microfluidic chips were brought forward. 36 discrete concentration combinations have been generated by repeated splitting-and-mixing of four inlet drugs in interconnected network channels, which are used to determine the optimal concentration of inhibition of cancer cells survival.

A total of 393 undergraduates from Taiwan completed the measures regarding one-dimensional CSW, two-dimensional CSW, and depression. After dividing CSW of seven classic domains into two dimensions of positive and negative CSW, the results of confirmatory factor analyses showed that the two-dimensional CSW model had better model fit than the one-dimensional model in all domains. Furthermore, relative to using one-dimensional CSW as a predictor of depression, the variance accounted for largely increased when positive and negative CSW entered simultaneously in the regression equation. The results suggest that CSW on positive and negative events should be seen as two dimensions and this perspective may largely increase the explanatory power of CSW in explaining mental health. ? 2018 Liu and Huang.",Contingencies of self-worth; Contingent self-esteem; Depression; Negative contingencies of self-worth; Positive contingencies of self-worth,,2-s2.0-85057824743

Metal-binding sites in proteins have been identified as primary targets for lead substitution resulting in malfunction of the host protein. Although Pb 2+ is known to be a potent competitor of Ca 2+ in protein binding sites, why/how Pb 2+ can compete with Ca 2+ in proteins remains unclear, raising multiple outstanding questions, including the following: (1) What are the physicochemical factors governing the competition between Pb 2+ and Ca 2+ ? (2) Which Ca 2+ -binding sites in terms of the structure, composition, overall charge, flexibility, and solvent exposure are the most likely targets for Pb 2+ attack? Using density functional theory combined with polarizable continuum model calculations, we address these questions by studying the thermodynamic outcome of the competition between Pb 2+ and Ca 2+ in various model Ca 2+ -binding sites, including those modeling voltage-gated calcium channel selectivity filters and EF-hand and non-EF-hand Ca 2+ -binding sites. The results, which are in good agreement with experiment, reveal that the metal site's flexibility and number of amino acid ligands dictate the outcome of the competition between Pb 2+ and Ca 2+ : If the Ca 2+ -binding site is relatively rigid and crowded with protein ligands, then Pb 2+ , upon binding, preserves the native metal-binding site geometry and at low concentrations, can act as an activator of the host protein. If the Ca 2+ -binding site is flexible and consists of only a few protein ligands, then Pb 2+ can displace Ca 2+ and deform the native metal-binding site geometry, resulting in protein malfunction. ?

However, this categorization lacks quantitative measurements. The purpose of the study was to determine quantitative measurements of the sonograms via image analysis. Methods: Infants younger than 12 months of age suspected of having congenital muscular torticollis were included. Intraclass correlation coefficient estimates for interobserver reliability and a simple regression analysis for criterion validity were calculated. Spearman correlation analysis was then performed. The analyzed parameters included cervical passive range of motion for lateral flexion and rotation, area, brightness, max/min Feret's diameters, and muscular width/thickness. Results: Of the 29 (4.0 ± 2.6 months) screened infants, 13 (1.9 ± 1.7 months) were included. Nine were male, and 4 were female. Seven infants with mass were ultrasonographically classified into type I, and the other six infants were classified into type II. The affected/unaffected side ratios of cervical passive range of motion for lateral flexion and rotation were 0.92 ± 0.13 and 0.88 ± 0.16, respectively. The parameters measured on the sonograms were reliable, and the max/min Feret's diameters were valid measurements. The affected/unaffected side ratio of cervical passive range of motion for rotation significantly correlated with the affected/unaffected side ratios of the sternocleidomastoid muscle sonogram on area (r = ?0.62, p = 0.03) and min Feret's diameter (r = ?0.69, p = 0.01). Conclusions: The area and min Feret's diameter were efficacious parameters for image analysis on sternocleidomastoid sonograms, and the min Feret's diameter would be more suitable than thickness for measuring the thickening SCM in transverse view. A healthy control group, more data and follow-up would be needed to confirm the changes on the SCM sonograms for clinical decision. ? 2018 Chang Gung University",Cervical passive range of motion; Congenital muscular torticollis; Sonography; Sternocleidomastoid,"Article; brightness; clinical article; cross-sectional study; echography; female; Feret diameter; human; image analysis; image segmentation; infant; joint mobility; male; muscle thickness; musculoskeletal system parameters; neck tumor; passive movement; quantitative analysis; range of motion; rotation; sternocleidomastoid muscle; torticollis; echography; joint characteristics and functions; neck; neck muscle; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; regression analysis; torticollis; upper limb; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Neck; Neck Muscles; Range of Motion, Articular; Regression Analysis; Torticollis; Ultrasonography; Upper Extremity",2-s2.0-85059462937

The bioassay results demonstrated that the three isolates reduced the viability of various cancer cells, with EP being highest in human lung cancer cell line A549 cells. EP induced caspase-dependent apoptosis through mitochondrial damage in A549 cells. Additionally, EP-induced ROS generation and apoptosis were attenuated by ROS-generating enzymes inhibitors and antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, indicated that ROS played an important role in EP-mediated apoptosis in A549 cells. Furthermore, it was observed that EP induced ROS-dependent autophagy, which attenuated apoptosis in A549 cells. On the other hand, EP reduced the LPS/ATP-induced proliferation and migration of A549 cells through attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Additionally, EP showed synergistic cytotoxic effect with antitumor drug Sorafenib in A549 cell viability inhibition.

Thus, a tumor mass is composed of genetically divergent cell subclones. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS), mathematical models have been recently developed to decompose tumor subclonal architecture from a collective genome sequencing data. Most of the methods focused on single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). However, somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) also play critical roles in carcinogenesis. Therefore, further modeling subclonal CNAs composition would hold the promise to improve the analysis of tumor heterogeneity and cancer evolution. To address this issue, we developed a two-way mixture Poisson model, named CloneDeMix for the deconvolution of read-depth information. It can infer the subclonal copy number, mutational cellular prevalence (MCP), subclone composition, and the order in which mutations occurred in the evolutionary hierarchy. The performance of CloneDeMix was systematically assessed in simulations. As a result, the accuracy of CNA inference was nearly 93% and the MCP was also accurately restored. Furthermore, we also demonstrated its applicability using head and neck cancer samples from TCGA. Our results inform about the extent of subclonal CNA diversity, and a group of candidate genes that probably initiate lymph node metastasis during tumor evolution was also discovered. Most importantly, these driver genes are located at 11q13.3 which is highly susceptible to copy number change in head and neck cancer genomes. This study successfully estimates subclonal CNAs and exhibit the evolutionary relationships of mutation events. By doing so, we can track tumor heterogeneity and identify crucial mutations during evolution process. Hence, it facilitates not only understanding the cancer development but finding potential therapeutic targets. Briefly, this framework has implications for improved modeling of tumor evolution and the importance of inclusion of subclonal CNAs. ? 2018 Tai et al.

However, how these stem cell factors crosstalk with cytokine signaling to promote malignancy in endometrial carcinoma is still elusive. Here we report that the expression of SOX2 and MYC, but not that of OCT4 and NANOG, correlate with poor histological differentiation and prognosis, while SOX2 expression is negatively associated with MYC level. We found that SOX2-high endometrial carcinoma cells possessed a higher colony-forming ability than their SOX2-low counterparts, and knockdown of SOX2 attenuated the colony-forming ability. We observed that SOX2 regulated EGFR expression in a SOX2–EGFR positive feedback loop. EGF stimulation induced SOX2 expression and promoted migration of endometrial carcinoma cells, whereas TGF-β stimulation inhibited SOX2 expression and attenuated the colony-forming ability. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that SOX2 expression correlated with lymph node infiltration of endometrial carcinoma.

Since the P. falciparum’s survival in humans depends on its ability to degrade human’s haemoglobin, stoppage or hindrance of FP2 has antimalarial effects. Therefore, we studied the atomic details of how E64 approaches, binds to, and inhibits FP2. We found that E64 (1) gradually approaches FP2 by first interacting with FP2’s D170 and Q171 or N81, N77, and K76; (2) binds FP2 tightly (ΔGbinding = ?12.2 ± 1.1 kJ/mol); and (3) persistently blocks access to FP2’s catalytic residues regardless of whether or not E64 has already been able to form a covalent bond with FP2’s C42. Furthermore, the results suggest that S41, D234, D170, N38, N173, and L172 (which are located in or near the FP2’s catalytic site’s binding pocket) contribute the most towards the favourable binding of E64 to FP2. Their in silico mutations adversely affect E64-FP2 binding affinity with D234L/A, N173L/A, W43F/A, D234L/A, H174F/A, and N38L/A having the most significant adverse effects on E64-FP2 binding and interactions. The findings presented in this article, which has antimalarial implications, suggest that hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions play important roles in E64-FP2 binding, and that a potential FP2-blocking E64-based/E64-like antimalarial drug should be capable of being both hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor, and/or have the ability to favourably interact with polar amino acids (such as S41, S149, N38, N173, N77, Q171) and with charged amino acids (such as D234, D170, H174) of FP2. The abilities to favourably interact with ASN, ASP, and SER appears to be important characteristics that such potential drug should have. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"antimalarial agent; cysteine proteinase; cysteine proteinase inhibitor; epoxide; falcipain 2; protein binding; biocatalysis; chemistry; computer simulation; drug design; enzymology; human; malaria falciparum; metabolism; molecular dynamics; physiology; Plasmodium falciparum; protein conformation; Antimalarials; Biocatalysis; Computer Simulation; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Drug Design; Epoxy Compounds; Humans; Malaria, Falciparum; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Plasmodium falciparum; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation",2-s2.0-85056077095

To develop a convenient biomonitoring tool for the detection of DLCs in the environment, we generated a transgenic line—Tg(cyp1a-12DRE:EGFP)—with a zebrafish cyp1a promoter recombined with multiple dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) that drive EGFP expression. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced EGFP expression was observed in the head cartilage (most sensitive), gut, otic vesicle, pectoral fin bud and eye of larvae. The lowest observed effect concentration of TCDD was estimated to be approximately 1 ng/L. Compared with existing zebrafish lines, our transgenic fish displayed comparable or even higher detection sensitivity to DLCs and could serve as an improved and rapid assay in an in vivo context. The Tg(cyp1a-12DRE:EGFP) transgenic zebrafish line also had higher stability for inducing EGFP expression (nearly 100% of our zebrafish induced EGFP at approximately 1 ng/L TCDD) than other lines. In addition, Tg(cyp1a-12DRE:EGFP) zebrafish could serve as a convenient and straightforward tool to assess potential cranial malformations and related health effects. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",cyp1a promoter; Danio rerio; DLCs; TCDD; Transgenic fish,"2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; cytochrome P450 1A; enhanced green fluorescent protein; dioxin; biomonitoring; cyprinid; dioxin; dose-response relationship; model; TCDD; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cyp1a gene; DNA responsive element; female; in vivo study; intestine; male; nonhuman; pectoral fin; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein stability; skull malformation; transgenic zebrafish; animal; bioassay; cell line; environmental monitoring; genetics; metabolism; procedures; toxicity; transgenic animal; water pollutant; zebra fish; Danio rerio; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Biological Assay; Cell Line; Dioxins; Environmental Monitoring; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-85055908155

Despite the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which amplifies the accumulation of nanoparticles at the site of a tumor, tumor heterogeneity caused by the dense extracellular matrix of growing cancer cells and the interstitial fluid pressure from abnormal angiogenesis in the tumor inhibit drug/particle penetration, leading to inhomogeneous and limited treatments. Therefore, nanoparticles for penetrated delivery should be designed with different strategies to enhance efficacy. Many strategies were developed to overcome the obstacles in cancer therapy, and they can be divided into three main parts: size changeability, ligand functionalization, and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. This review summarizes the results of ameliorated tumor penetration approaches and amplified therapeutic efficacy in nanomedicines. As the references reveal, further study needs to be conducted with comprehensive strategies with broad applicability and potential translational development. ? 2018 by the authors.

For example, the application of electrocardiography (ECG) in adult zebrafish has emerged as an important tool for cardiac pathophysiology, toxicity, and chemical screen studies. However, few laboratories are able to perform such functional analyses due to the high cost and limited availability of a convenient in vivo ECG recording system. In this study, an inexpensive ECG recording platform and operation protocol that has been optimized for adult zebrafish ECG research was developed. The core hardware includes integration of a ready-to-use portable ECG kit with a set of custom-made needle electrode probes. A combined anesthetic formula of MS-222 and isoflurane was first tested to determine the optimal assay conditions to minimize the interference to zebrafish cardiac physiology under sedation. For demonstration, we treated wild-type zebrafish with different pharmacological agents known to affect cardiac rhythms in humans. Conserved electrophysiological responses to these drugs were induced in adult zebrafish and recorded in real time. This economic ECG platform has the potential to facilitate teaching and training in cardiac electrophysiology with adult zebrafish and to promote future translational applications in cardiovascular medicine. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"animal; cardiovascular system; devices; diagnostic imaging; disease model; drug effect; electrocardiography; heart; heart disease; heart electrophysiology; human; physiology; preclinical study; procedures; zebra fish; Animals; Cardiac Electrophysiology; Cardiovascular System; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Electrocardiography; Heart; Heart Diseases; Humans; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-85055614379

Although thousands of AirBoxes have been deployed across Taiwan to give a broader coverage, they are mostly located in big cities and their measurements are less accurate. In this paper, we apply a robust kriging method that provides a smoothly varied real-time PM2.5 concentration map and its associated standard error map. In addition, we develop a novel spatio-temporal control chart that monitors anomalous measurements by utilizing neighboring AirBox information. Our method automatically adapts to different neighboring structures at different AirBox locations without the need to specify a neighborhood range.

These limitations include difficulties in precise tumor delineation to enable complete resection, inflammation and malignancy differentiation, and stage determination. The resolution of these problems depends on the surgeon’s ability and experience with available technology for visualization and resection.

Myb1 regulates the expression of ap65-1 gene that encodes for a disease causing cytoadherence enzyme. Here, we determined the crystal structures of TvCyP1 and its complex with the minimum TvCyP1-binding sequence of Myb1 (Myb1104-111), where TvCyP1 formed a homodimer, unlike other single domain cyclophilins. In the complex structure, one Myb1104-111 peptide was bound to each TvCyP1 protomer, with G106-P107 and Y105 fitting well into the active site and auxiliary S2 pocket, respectively. NMR data further showed that TvCyP1 can catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of P107 in Myb1104-111. Interestingly, in the well-folded Myb1 protein (Myb135-141), the minimum binding sequence adopted a different conformation from that of unstructured Myb1104-111 peptide, that could make P107 binding to the active site of TvCyP1 difficult. However, NMR studies showed that similar to Myb1104-111 peptide, Myb135-141 also interacted with the active site of TvCyP1 and the dynamics of the Myb135-141 residues near P107 was reduced upon interaction.

Primary GSCs from cancerous and adjacent normal tissues were generated from gastric cancer patients, and monocyte-derived DCs were obtained from healthy individuals. Levels of cytokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured by ELISA, and C-type lectin expression in GSCs was assessed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In a trans-well co-culture system, significantly upregulated DC-derived IL-23 expression was found when DCs were co-cultured with Hp-infected GSCs (Hp-GSCs). Further, PGE2 from Hp-GSCs was discovered to possess the priming effect, which could be inhibited by anti-COLEC12 (Collectin subfamily member 12) Abs, COLEC12 knockdown or when alpha3-fucosyltransferase-null (futB; HP0651) strain of Hp was used.

The structure of the apo PWWP domain comprises mainly four β-strands and two α-helices. The PWWP domain undergoes domain swapping to dramatically transform its secondary structures, altering the overall conformation from monomeric globular folding into an extended dimeric structure upon DNA binding. The flexible loop2, as a hinge loop with the partially built structure in the apo PWWP domain, notably refolds into a visible and stable α-helix in the DNA complex.

TP4 treatment in A549 cells was found to disrupt the microtubule network in cells, and mutation of the essential TP4 residues prevented microtubule depolymerization in vitro. Importantly, the TP4 mutants also showed decreased cytotoxicity in A549 cells, suggesting that microtubule disruption is a major mechanistic component of TP4-mediated death in lung carcinoma cells. ? 2018 by the authors.",Antimicrobial peptide (AMP); Microtubule; Tilapia piscidin 4 (TP4),"alpha tubulin; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; tilapia piscidin 4; unclassified drug; antimicrobial cationic peptide; antineoplastic agent; fish protein; tubulin; tubulin modulator; A-549 cell line; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell disruption; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug protein binding; drug synthesis; human; in vitro study; microtubule; microtubule assembly; molecular docking; Oreochromis niloticus; target cell; animal; chemistry; cichlid; drug effect; drug screening; isolation and purification; metabolism; microtubule; A549 Cells; Animals; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Antineoplastic Agents; Cichlids; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Fish Proteins; Humans; Microtubules; Molecular Docking Simulation; Tubulin; Tubulin Modulators",2-s2.0-85057112335

This study aims to develop a 2-in-1 paper-based analytical device to detect the concentrations of paraquat and creatinine in human serum, which can help clinicians diagnose patients with paraquat poisoning in a more rapid and geographically unrestricted manner. The procedure involves fabrication of a paper-based analytical device, i.e., printing of design on a filter paper, heating of wax-printed micro zone plates so as molten wax diffusing into and completely through the paper to the other side, forming hydrophobic boundaries that could act as detection zones for the paraquat colorimetric assay, and finally analysis using ImageJ software. The paper employed a colorimetric sodium dithionite assay to indicate the paraquat level in a buffer or human serum system in less than 10 min. In this study, colorimetric changes into blue color could be observed by the naked eye. By curve fitting models of sodium dithionite in normal human serum, we evaluated the serum paraquat levels for five paraquat patients. In the sodium dithionate assay, the measured serum paraquat concentrations in patients 1-5 were 22.59, 5.99, 26.52, 35.19 and 25.00 ppm, respectively. On the other hand, by curve fitting models of the creatinine assay in normal human serum, the measured serum creatinine concentrations were 16.10, 12.92, 13.82, 13.58 and 12.20 ppm, respectively. We found that the analytical performance of this device can compete with the standard of Clinical Laboratory of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, with a less complicated sample preparation process and more rapid results. In conclusion, this 2-in-1 paper-based analytical device has the advantage of being simple and cheap, enabling rapid detection of paraquat intoxication as well as assessment of renal prognosis. ? 2018 by the authors.",Creatinine; Paper-based analytical device; Paraquat,Analytic equipment; Body fluids; Color; Colorimetric analysis; Colorimetry; Curve fitting; Diagnosis; Sodium; Analytical performance; Colorimetric assays; Creatinine; Creatinine concentration; Curve fitting model; Paper-based analytical devices; Paraquat; Simultaneous determinations; Herbicides,2-s2.0-85057018344

Here, we investigated whether placenta-derived MSCs (P-MSCs) are a superior cellular vector for systemic targeting of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), with an imaging modality to real-time monitor the trafficking P-MSCs to glioblastoma sites. Results demonstrated that P-MSCs had greater migratory activity towards GSCs and across blood–brain barrier compared with bone marrow-derived MSCs, and this activity was enhanced by hypoxia precondition. Chemokine ligand 5 was identified as a chemoattractant responsible for the glioblastoma tropism of P-MSCs. Polyethylene glycol-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide (PEG–SPIO) was synthesized for cellular labelling and imaging P-MSCs, displaying high cellular uptake and no cytotoxic effect on P-MSCs cell proliferation or stemness property. The homing effects of intravenously administered PEG–SPIO-labelled P-MSCs towards intracerebral GSCs were able to be detected in mice models through T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study suggests the possibility of innovative systemic P-MSC-based cell therapy for aggressive GSCs, developing a state-of-the-art theranostic technique for real-time tracking of therapeutic P-MSCs tumor infiltration through cellular MRI. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cellular MRI; Glioblastoma stem-like cells; mesenchymal stem cell tumor-homing; placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells; polyethylene glycol–coated superparamagnetic iron oxide,"Antenna lobes; Brain; Cell proliferation; Cytotoxicity; Flowcharting; Iron oxides; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mammals; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylenes; Stem cells; Superparamagnetism; Tumors; Cellular mris; Chemokine ligands; Glioblastomas; Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); Mesenchymal stem cell; Real time monitors; Real time tracking; Superparamagnetic iron oxides; Cell culture; macrogol; RANTES; superparamagnetic iron oxide; contrast medium; macrogol; magnetite nanoparticle; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioluminescence; blood brain barrier; cancer stem cell; cell homing; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell therapy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; glioblastoma; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; synthesis; theranostic nanomedicine; tropism; tumor microenvironment; animal; Bagg albino mouse; brain tumor; cell tracking; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; female; mesenchymal stem cell; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; placenta; pregnancy; procedures; tumor cell line; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Tracking; Contrast Media; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Placenta; Polyethylene Glycols; Pregnancy",2-s2.0-85053270919

Herein, we introduce the V2O5 nanosheets (NS) as a novel nanozyme to biomimic the oxidase activity toward the rapid detection of glutathione. The 5–6 layered V2O5 NS with 300–600 nm in size is successfully fabricated by ultra-sonication assisted exfoliation of bulk V2O5 using N, N-dimethyl formamide as the intercalation reagent. The sensing mechanism involves the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by V2O5 NS with the concomitant increase in absorption intensity. Upon introduction of glutathione, the oxidized TMB is converted back to its original form and results in the simultaneous decrease in peak intensity at 650 nm. The sensor exhibits a good linear response to glutathione in the range of 10–500 nM with a limit of detection of 2.4 nM. Moreover, the V2O5-TMB sensor exhibits a good selectivity and high speci?city, which makes the detection of glutathione applicable in diluted human serum samples. Since no functionalization of the V2O5 NS is required, this sensing system can open a new avenue to serve as an efficiently biomimic oxidase for glutathione detection in biological fluid samples. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB); Biomimic oxidase activity; Glutathione; Nanozyme; V2O5 nanosheets","Amides; Body fluids; Nanosheets; Vanadium pentoxide; Absorption intensity; Glutathiones; N ,N-Dimethylformamide; Nanomolar detection; Nanozyme; Oxidase activity; Sensitive measurement; Tetramethylbenzidine; Peptides",2-s2.0-85049758137

Event-related potentials were recorded and compared at the first, fourth, seventh, and eighth time. It was found that multiple repetitions attenuated the N400 effect to almost nonexistent and that the follow-up semantic integration reinitiating sentence did not recover N400 amplitude.

In search of a new sensing system, here, we have reported a two-way-detection method for Dengue virus (DENV) serotype identification along with DNA quantification by using a new class of nanocomposite of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) and nitrogen, sulfur codoped graphene quantum dots (N,S-GQDs). The N,S-GQDs@AuNP has been used for serotype detection via a simple fluorescence technique using four dye-combined probe DNAs which is further validated by confocal microscopy. The quantification of the DNA has been measured by the differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) technique using methyelene blue as a redox indicator. Results obtained in this study, clearly demonstrate that the N,S-GQDs@AuNP can efficiently detect the four serotypes of DENV individually in the concentration range of 10 -14 to 10 -6 M with the LOD of 9.4 fM. In addition, to confirm its applicability in long chained complex DNA system, the sensor was also applied to the clinically isolated DENV DNA and showed satisfactory performances for serotype identification as well as quantification.

Modeling core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with neutrino transport in three dimensions (3D) requires tremendous computing resources and some level of approximation. We present a first comparison study of core-collapse SNe in 3D with different physics approximations and hydrodynamics codes. Aims. The objective of this work is to assess the impact of the hydrodynamics code, approximations for the neutrino, gravity treatments, and rotation on the simulation of core-collapse SNe in 3D. Methods. We use four different hydrodynamics codes in this work (ELEPHANT, FLASH, fGR1, and SPHYNX) in combination with two different neutrino treatments, the isotropic diffusion source approximation (IDSA) and two-moment M1, and three different gravity treatments (Newtonian, 1D General Relativity correction, and full General Relativity). Additional parameters discussed in this study are the inclusion of neutrino-electron scattering via a parametrized deleptonization and the influence of rotation. Results. The four codes compared in this work include Eulerian and fully Lagrangian (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) codes for the first time. They show agreement in the overall evolution of the collapse phase and early post-bounce within the range of 10% (20% in some cases). The comparison of the different neutrino treatments highlights the need to further investigate the antineutrino luminosities in IDSA, which tend to be relatively high. We also demonstrate the requirement for a more detailed heavy-lepton neutrino leakage. When comparing with a full General Relativity code, including an M1 transport method, we confirm the influence of neutrino-electron scattering during the collapse phase, which is adequately captured by the parametrized deleptonization scheme. Also, the effective general relativistic potential reproduces the overall dynamic evolution correctly in all Newtonian codes. Additionally, we verify that rotation aids the shock expansion and estimate the overall angular momentum losses for each code in rotating scenarios. ? 2018 ESO.",Hydrodynamics; Supernovae: General,Electron scattering; Hydrodynamics; Neutrons; Relativity; Supernovae; Angular momentum loss; Core collapse supernovae; General Relativity; Hydrodynamics codes; Isotropic diffusion; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Supernovae: general; Three dimensional code; Codes (symbols),2-s2.0-85056748667

Due to their special physical, chemical, and photoelectric properties, liquid crystals are often applied in the displays of portable consumer devices because they can solve the problems of heavy weights and large sizes in traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. Virtual reality (VR) is a computer technology to create an immersive environment for simulating the real world through one's sense organs. The user can see and hear as if situated in the real world, and even interact with virtual objects or other people manifested by avatars to experience lifelike feelings in the virtual environments. In this study, a virtual laboratory is developed for learning the photoelectric effect of liquid crystal displays (LCD). The users can operate the LCD device by changing the electric field to control the direction of crystal alignment. They can also manipulate a marquee on the LCD to move the text from the left (or right) to the opposite direction, and use LCD shuttle glasses to view stereo images to understand its operating principle. A teaching experiment has been conducted to investigate the learning effectiveness of the virtual laboratory in comparison with that of using traditional teaching aids.

The Integrated Model of Health Literacy (IMHL), defined as the personal, situational, and societal/environmental factors that predict the level of HL that can influence health outcomes, incorporates the concepts, determinants, and consequences of HL. Objective The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms and completeness of the IMHL in patients with breast cancer. Methods Five hundred eleven Taiwanese patients were prospectively recruited. We conducted structural equation modeling to confirm and modify the predictive pathways linking the HL-related factors in the IMHL. Results Results on a total of 511 breast cancer patients showed good model-data fit. An alternative model revealed better fit with 2 pathways added from cancer stage to self-rated health and from cancer duration to shared decision making. Both the original model and alternative model modification revealed that only personal determinants (age, education, cancer stage, and duration) and not situational determinants (marital status) or social/environmental determinants (residence and occupation) could significantly predict the 3 domains of HL. Theorized consequences of HL were significantly influenced by HL in both models. Conclusions Our results partially support the relationships proposed in the IMHL for patients with breast cancer as only personal determinants significantly predicted HL. Implications for Practice Understanding the predictive pathways of the integrated HL model could help clinicians to tailor HL interventions using a patient's personal determinants to facilitate participation in decision making and promote health for breast cancer patients. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, current manual interpretation suffers from drawbacks of time consuming and interpreter idiosyncrasy. Artificial intelligence (AI), with the expertise in assisting repetitive or complex analysis, represents a potential solution for these drawbacks. Methods: From 2009 to 2016, 5333 MFC data from 1742 AML or MDS patients were collected. The 287 MFC data at post-induction were selected as the outcome set for clinical outcome validation. The rest were 4:1 randomized into the training set (n = 4039) and the validation set (n = 1007). AI algorithm learned a multi-dimensional MFC phenotype from the training set and input it to support vector machine (SVM) classifier after Gaussian mixture model (GMM) modeling, and the performance was evaluated in The validation set. Findings: Promising accuracies (84·6% to 92·4%) and AUCs (0·921–0·950) were achieved by the developed algorithms. Interestingly, the algorithm from even one testing tube achieved similar performance. The clinical significance was validated in the outcome set, and normal MFC interpreted by the AI predicted better progression-free survival (10·9 vs 4·9 months, p < 0·0001) and overall survival (13·6 vs 6·5 months, p < 0·0001) for AML. Interpretation: Through large-scaled clinical validation, we showed that AI algorithms can produce efficient and clinically-relevant MFC analysis. This approach also possesses a great advantage of the ability to integrate other clinical tests.

The islet accessory cells (or components) of neurovascular tissues include the endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, neurons (nerve fibers), and glia. Research results derived from experimental diabetes and islet transplantation indicate that the accessory cells are reactive in islet injury and can affect islet function and homeostasis in situ or in an ectopic environment. Recent Findings: Recent advances in cell labeling and tissue imaging have enabled investigation of islet accessory cells to gain insights into their network structures, functions, and remodeling in disease. Summary: It has become clear that in diabetes, the islet neurovascular tissues are not just bystanders damaged in neuropathy and vascular complications; rather, they participate in islet remodeling in response to changes in the microenvironment. Because of the fundamental differences between humans and animal models in neuroinsular cytoarchitecture and cell proliferation, examination of islet accessory cells in clinical specimens and donor pancreases warrants further attention. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Autonomic nervous system; Diabetes; Endothelial cell; Glial cell; Islet transplantation; Pericyte,accessory cell; cell function; glia cell; homeostasis; human; innervation; nerve cell; nerve fiber; nonhuman; pancreas islet; pancreas islet transplantation; pericyte; Review; Schwann cell; vascular endothelial cell; animal; cytology; endothelium cell; glia; pancreas islet; Animals; Endothelial Cells; Homeostasis; Humans; Islets of Langerhans; Islets of Langerhans Transplantation; Neuroglia; Pericytes,2-s2.0-85054149046

AR plays an important role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the role of AR in PCa metastasis is not fully understood. To investigate the role of AR in PCa metastasis, we examined AR expression level in primary and metastatic PCa by analyzing gene array data of 378 primary prostate tumors and 120 metastatic prostate tumors from Oncomine, as well as carrying out immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of 56 prostate cancer samples. Expression of mRNA and protein of AR as well as its target gene prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was much higher in metastatic prostate tumors than in primary prostate tumors. Knockdown of AR with siRNA or treating with anti-androgen Casodex reduced migration and invasion ability of C4-2B PCa cells. Knockdown of AR increased protein expression of E-cadherin and AR coregulator KAT5 but reduced expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins Slug, Snail, MMP-2, vimentin, and β-catenin. Knockdown of KAT5 increased migration of C4-2B cells, whereas overexpression of KAT5 suppressed cell migration. KAT5 knockdown rescues the suppressive effect of AR knockdown on migration of C4-2B cells. Gene expression level of AR and KAT5 showed a negative correlation. PCa patients with higher AR expression or lower KAT5 expression correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival. Our study suggested that elevation of AR expression and AR signaling in prostate tumors promotes PCa metastasis by induction of EMT and reduction of KAT5. ? 2018 The Authors.

Exogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donors such as diallyl trisulfide (DATS) have been used as anti-inflammatory mediators. However, an ideal method of administering DATS has yet to be established owing to its poor water solubility. Herein, a self-spray coating system that is derived from a DATS-loaded capsule with foaming capability (CAP-w-FC) is proposed for treating colitis. Following the rectal administration of CAP-w-FC into rats bearing colitis and its subsequent dissolution in the intestinal fluid, a spray coating system is self-assembled in situ. This system greatly promotes the dissolution of the poorly water-soluble DATS by producing nano-scaled micellar particles that are sprayed onto the large luminal surface of the colorectal tract. Following the internalization of the micellar particles by colon epithelial cells, their loaded DATS reacts with intracellular glutathione to yield H2S. This exogenous H2S then diffuses through plasma membranes to carry out its biological functions, including suppressing the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the adhesion of macrophages on the vascular endothelium, and repairing colonic inflamed tissues. Analytical results demonstrate that this self-spray coating system may be used as a unique drug delivery technique for covering the large colorectal surface to treat IBD. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Anti-Inflammatory mediator; Drug delivery; Functional material; Hydrogen sulfide; Inflammatory bowel disease,"Cell membranes; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Dissolution; Drug delivery; Functional materials; Hydrogen sulfide; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Targeted drug delivery; Anti-inflammatories; Biological functions; Delivery techniques; Diallyl trisulfides; Inflammatory bowel disease; Inflammatory disorders; Pro-inflammatory cytokines; Vascular endothelium; Coatings; diallyl trisulfide; glutathione; hydrogen sulfide; allyl compound; antiinflammatory agent; drug carrier; hydrogen sulfide; sulfide; water; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell adhesion; cell membrane; colon epithelium; controlled study; dissolution; epithelium cell; human; human cell; inflammatory bowel disease; macrophage; material coating; micelle; nanotechnology; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; solubility; vascular endothelium; animal; chemistry; colon; drug delivery system; drug effect; inflammatory bowel disease; mouse; pathology; RAW 264.7 cell line; rectum; solubility; Wistar rat; Allyl Compounds; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Colon; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; Hydrogen Sulfide; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Mice; Micelles; Rats, Wistar; RAW 264.7 Cells; Rectum; Solubility; Sulfides; Water",2-s2.0-85053221647

Its high aggressiveness and deep-seated brain lesion make it a great challenge to develop a non-invasive, precise and effective treatment approach. Here, we report a multifunctional theranostic agent that can integrate imaging and therapy into a single nano-platform for imaging-guided sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The SDT agents were fabricated by encapsulation of sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) chelating with manganese ions into nanoliposomes (DVDMS-Mn-LPs). DVDMS-Mn-LPs are physiologically stable and biologically compatible, and they can produce singlet oxygen upon ultrasound irradiation to kill cancer cells. Both cell and animal studies demonstrated that SDT with DVDMS-Mn-LPs can significantly improve the antitumour growth efficiency even in the presence of skull. In addition, DVDMS-Mn-LPs are good for MR and fluorescence imaging. Thus, DVDMS-Mn-LPs reported here may provide a promising strategy for imaging-guided modality for glioma treatment. ? 2018 The Authors.

In this paper, we propose a self-powered active disinfection system controlled by human motions. The system is mainly composed of a multilayered triboelectric nanogenerator (m-TENG) for the harvesting of biomechanical energy and conductive fabrics as electrodes for the wearable disinfection system. The working principle of the system is based on hybrid effects of H2O2 production and electroporation, which provide good disinfection performance toward gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). In addition, we also demonstrate that the presence of gold-coated tellurium nanowires (Au-Te NWs) on the fabrics increased the strength of local electric field and enhanced the system's disinfection performance. With the help of Au-Te NWs, the disinfection activities of the system reach values of more than 87% and 96% against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively, when the m-TENG was operated at a frequency of 1 Hz for 60 min. Furthermore, the disinfection activity can be strengthened by increasing the operation frequency or electric output of the m-TENG. Alternatively, the generated electricity can be stored in a capacitor to achieve rapid disinfection via an instantaneous discharging process. Because of the fiber-based structure in the disinfection device and the shoe-embedded design of the m-TENG, our proposed self-powered active disinfection system can be easily integrated into commercial textiles to fabricate smart clothes to combat pathogenic bacteria. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Disinfection; Electroporation; Nanogenerator; Self-powered system; Tellurium nanowire,Electric fields; Escherichia coli; Gold coatings; Gold compounds; Hosiery manufacture; Nanogenerators; Nanowires; Shoe manufacture; Tellurium compounds; Disinfection systems; Electroporation; Escherichia coli (E. coli); Local electric field; Nanogenerator; Self-powered systems; Staphylococcus aureus; Tellurium nanowires; Disinfection,2-s2.0-85051826492

Nonetheless, many patients develop early occlusion after angioplasty. Thus, we investigated the role of thrombophilia in access occlusion within 30?days of angioplasty. Materials and Methods: This case–control study included patients who underwent PTA for dialysis vascular access dysfunction. Patients who experienced occlusion within 30?days of angioplasty were included in the case group and those without occlusion for at least 30?days after angioplasty were included in the control group. All patients were tested for protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibodies. Results: From February to October 2015, 462 patients underwent PTA for dialysis vascular access dysfunction. Forty-one patients (8.9%) had early occlusion within 30?days of angioplasty. The case group had more graft accesses (73 vs. 31%, P < 0.001) and thrombotic occlusions (67 vs. 15%, P < 0.001). A higher incidence of protein C (10 vs. 2%), protein S (15 vs. 5%), and antithrombin III (10 vs. 2%) deficiency and elevated anticardiolipin antibody (22 vs. 10%) levels were observed in the case group. Overall, 26 patients (63%) in the case group had at least one thrombophilic factor, compared with 15 patients (37%) in the control group (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.004; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.223–7.380; P = 0.027). After adjustment for confounding factors, the association between thrombophilic factors and early occlusion remained (adjusted OR, 3.806; 95% CI, 1.018–14.220; P = 0.047).

This study demonstrated 77 protein features that were significantly changed in protein expression and revealed evodiamine-induced cytotoxicity in thyroid cancer cells involves dysregulation of protein folding, cytoskeleton, cytoskeleton regulation and transcription control.

In this work, nanocomposites of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and Fe3O4 with conjugation of lectin protein, concanavalin A, to form GQD-ConA@Fe3O4 nanocomposites are developed for both detection of cancer cell and release of drugs to HeLa cells. The GQD-ConA@Fe3O4 nanocomposites deposited on Pt electrode can detect cancerous HeLa cells over normal endothelial cells with a dynamic linear range of 5 × 102 to 1 × 105 cells mL?1 with a detection limit of 273 cell mL?1. The GQD-ConA@Fe3O4 also can serve as nanocarriers for loading and delivering doxorubicin (Dox). The in vitro cell images show that the Dox concentration in HeLa cells is enhanced more than double in the presence of external magnetic field due to the incorporation of Fe3O4 in the nanocarrier. The cytotoxicity assay indicates that the susceptibility of cancerous HeLa cells to Dox is 13% higher than that of normal cells, confirming the selective role of ConA in nanocarriers. Results clearly indicate the GQD-ConA@Fe3O4 nanocomposites as a promising material for cancer cell detection and targeted Dox release toward HeLa cells which can serve as the multifunctional platform for novel cancer cell diagnostic and therapeutic applications. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Biosensing; Cancerous cells; Doxorubicin; Electrochemical detection; Multifunctional nanocomposites,Chemical detection; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Endothelial cells; Image enhancement; Iron oxides; Lanthanum compounds; Magnetite; Nanocomposites; Proteins; Semiconductor quantum dots; Biosensing; Cancerous cells; Doxorubicin; ELectrochemical detection; Multifunctional nanocomposites; Targeted drug delivery; concanavalin A; doxorubicin; graphene; graphene quantum dot concanavalin A iron oxide nanocomposite; iron oxide; lectin; nanocarrier; nanocomposite; quantum dot; unclassified drug; concanavalin A; doxorubicin; graphite; magnetite; nanocomposite; platinum; quantum dot; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer cell; cancer diagnosis; concentration (parameters); conjugation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug release; drug targeting; drug uptake; endothelium cell; HeLa cell line; in vitro study; limit of detection; magnetic field; priority journal; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; electrode; human; neoplasm; Cell Survival; Concanavalin A; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Electrodes; Endothelial Cells; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Graphite; HeLa Cells; Humans; Limit of Detection; Nanocomposites; Neoplasms; Platinum; Quantum Dots,2-s2.0-85046167997

Binding of GDNF to GFRA1 triggers RET signaling leading to ER phosphorylation and estrogen-independent transcriptional activation of ER-dependent genes. Both GFRA1 and RET are membrane proteins which are N-glycosylated but no O-linked sialylation site on GFRA1 or RET has been reported. We found GFRA1 to be a substrate of ST3GAL1-mediated O-linked sialylation, which is crucial to GDNF-induced signaling in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Silencing ST3GAL1 in breast cancer cells reduced GDNF-induced phosphorylation of RET, AKT and ERα as well as GDNF-mediated cell proliferation. Moreover, GDNF induced transcription of ST3GAL1, revealing a positive feedback loop regulating ST3GAL1 and GDNF/GFRA1/RET signaling in breast cancers. Finally, we demonstrated ST3GAL1 knockdown augments anti-cancer efficacy of inhibitors of RET and/or ER. Moreover, high expression of ST3GAL1 was associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with late stage breast cancer and high expression of both ST3GAL1 and GFRA1 adversely impacted outcome in those with high grade tumors. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",GFRA1; Glycosylation; RET; Sialyltransferase,"estrogen receptor alpha; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor receptor; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha 1; protein kinase B; protein Ret; sialyltransferase; ST3 beta galactoside alpha 2,3 sialyltransferase 1; unclassified drug; vandetanib; beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase; GFRA1 protein, human; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor receptor; protein Ret; sialyltransferase; Akt signaling; Article; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer staging; cell proliferation; clinical outcome; controlled study; enzyme substrate; human; human cell; human tissue; positive feedback; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; sialylation; signal transduction; breast tumor; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; Kaplan Meier method; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; pathology; physiological feedback; RNA interference; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Feedback, Physiological; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; MCF-7 Cells; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret; RNA Interference; Sialyltransferases; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85050677260

Using music to induce emotional responses from subjects to better facilitate human behavior shaping have been effective across domains of health, education, and retail. Computationally model the musically-induced emotion provides necessary content-based analytics for large-scale and wide-applicability of such human-centered applications. In this work, we propose a relationship neural network architecture to learn to regress the induced emotion attributes with an auxiliary task of genre classification. Our proposed Genre-Affect Relationship Network with homoscedastic uncertainty weighting embeds the relationship between affect and genre as tensor normal prior within task-specific layers; the architecture is optimized further by incorporating task-specific uncertainty. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-art 0.564 average Pearson correlation computed over nine induced emotion ratings in the Emotify database. Furthermore, we provide an analysis to understand the relationship between the induced emotions of these musical pieces and their associated genres. ? 2018 IEEE.",homoscedastic uncertainty; induced emotion; multi-task learning; music; relationship network,Behavioral research; Correlation methods; homoscedastic uncertainty; induced emotion; Multitask learning; music; Relationship networks; Network architecture,2-s2.0-85061443853

To mimic barrier-tissue microenvironment, a porous membrane that can approach the stiffness of physiological basement membranes is required. While several biocompatible membranes with micrometer range thickness (10 μm) and a stiffness less than polystyrene (3 GPa) or polyethylene (PET, 2 GPa), have been developed, there has been little effort to optimize the process to enable rapid and reproducible pore production in these membranes. Here, we investigate the use of laser irradiation with femtosecond (fs) pulses because the combination of high-precision and cold-ablation causes minimal damage to polymeric membranes. This process enables automated, high-throughput and reproducible fabrication of thin, microporous membranes that can be utilized to culture cells at air-liquid interface (ALI), a unique culture technique that simulates the tissue-barrier microenvironment. We show the optimization of laser parameters on a thin polyurethane membrane and patterned pores with an average diameter of 5 μm. Tissue was cultured at ALI for 28 days to demonstrate the membrane's utility in constructing a tissue barrier model. These results confirm the utilization of fs laser machining as a viable method for creating a porous barrier substrate in tissue engineering platforms.

Here, we developed an automated multiplex transmissive surface plasmon resonance (t-SPR) platform with the use of a capped gold nanoslit integrated microfluidic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. The automated platform was custom designed to allow the analysis of spectral measurements using wavelength shift (dλ), intensity (dI) and novel area change (dA) for surface binding reactions. A simple and compact nanostructure based biosensor was fabricated with multiplex real-time detection capabilities. The sensitivity and specificity of the microfluidic device was demonstrated through the use of functionalised AuNPs for target molecule isolation and signal enhancement in combination with probes on the CG nanoslit surface.

However, vector vaccines typically express HA transiently within the cells. Conversely, nanoparticles encapsulating and releasing antigens slowly in vivo potentiate humoral and cellular immune responses, hence underscoring the benefits of long-term antigen release for potent vaccine efficacy. Baculovirus (BV) is a non-pathogenic insect virus capable of transducing mammalian and avian cells and holds promise as a vaccine vector. Here we constructed a hybrid BV (Bac-FCsHW) harboring an Frt sites-flanking gene cassette expressing a fusion HA protein composed of the HA ectodomain and a GCN4 pII peptide to facilitate trimerization. Bac-FCsHW transduction of cells enabled expression and secretion of HA trimers. Co-transduction of mammalian cells with Bac-FCsHW and Bac-FLPo expressing FLPo recombinase led to FLPo recognition of Frt sites, excision and formation of episomal DNA minicircles that encompassed the HA expression cassette. Such FLPo/Frt-mediated minicircle formation remarkably prolonged and enhanced the expression of secreted HA to at least 28 days. Intramuscular co-injection of Bac-FLPo and Bac-FCsHW into BALB/c mice significantly potentiated the humoral and cellular immune responses when compared with the control groups expressing native intracellular HA, either for a short-term or long-term. These data demonstrated that BV-mediated prolonged expression and release of HA substantiated the vaccine efficacy and implicated the potentials of the FLPo/Frt-based hybrid BV vector as a new AIV vaccine platform. ? 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers",Baculovirus; DNA minicircle; Hemagglutinin secretion; Influenza vaccine; Prolonged expression; Vaccine efficacy,Antigens; Bacteriophages; Cells; Cytology; Health risks; Immune system; Mammals; Physiology; Vectors; Baculovirus; Hemagglutinin secretion; Influenza vaccines; Prolonged expression; Vaccine efficacies; Vaccines,2-s2.0-85048883761

A variety of techniques exist to extract the fMCG signal with the demand for non-invasively obtained fetal cardiac information. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comparative study published in the field as to how the various extraction algorithms perform. We perform a comparative study of the ability of five methods to extract the fMCG using real biomagnetic signals, two of those methods are applied to real fMCG data for the first time. Biomagnetic signals were recorded and processed with each of the five methods to obtain fMCG. The R peaks of the fMCG traces were obtained via a peak-detection algorithm. From whole recording for each method, the fetal heart rate (FHR) was calculated and used to perform FHR variability (FHRV) analysis. Additionally, we calculated durations from the PQRST complex from time-averaged data during sinus rhythm. The five methods recovered the fMCG signals, but two of them were able to extract cleaner fMCG and the morphology was observed from the continuous data. The time-averaged data showed very similar morphologies between methods, but two of them displayed a signal amplitude reduction on the R-waves and T-waves. Values of PQRST durations, FHR and FHRV were in the range of previous fetal cardiac studies. We have compared five methods for fMCG extraction and showed their ability to perform fMCG analysis. ? 2018, Biomedical Engineering Society.",Cardiac time intervals; Fetal magnetocardiography; Signal processing; Variability analysis,"Electrophysiology; Extraction; Heart; Magnetostatics; Comparative studies; Congenital heart disease; Extraction algorithms; Fetal magnetocardiography; Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG); Reliable measurement; Time interval; Variability analysis; Signal processing; algorithm; Article; clinical article; comparative study; congenital heart disease; fetus electrocardiography; fetus heart rate; gestational age; heart rate variability; human; magnetocardiography; pregnant woman; priority journal; R wave amplitude; signal noise ratio; signal processing; sinus rhythm; T wave amplitude; action potential; female; fetus heart; fetus heart rate; magnetocardiography; pathophysiology; predictive value; pregnancy; prenatal diagnosis; procedures; reproducibility; signal processing; time factor; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Female; Fetal Heart; Gestational Age; Heart Rate, Fetal; Humans; Magnetocardiography; Predictive Value of Tests; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85052190986

However, there are many unresolved issues associated with their development, including monitoring and controlling oxygen, immune responses, and the optimization of glucose, all of which need to be monitored and controlled to produce an efficient and viable artificial organ that can become integrated in the patient and maintain homeostasis. This research focused on monitoring the oxygen concentration, specifically achieving this kinetically as the oxygen gradient in an artificial pancreas made of alginate spheres containing islet cells. Functional nanoparticles (NPs) for measuring the oxygen gradient in different hydrogel cellular environments using fluorescence-based (F) microscopy were developed and tested. By the ester bond, a linker Pluronic F127 was conjugated with a carboxylic acid-modified polystyrene NP (510 nm). A hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction between the commercially available oxygen-sensitive fluorophore and F127 results in fluorescence-based nano-oxygen particles (FNOPs). The in-house synthesized FNOP was calibrated inside electrosprayed alginate-filled hydrogels and demonstrated a good broad dynamic range (2.73-22.23) mg/L as well as a resolution of -0.01 mg/L with an accuracy of ±4%.

To improve therapeutic efficacy, chemotherapy is frequently adopted as the adjuvant treatment in combination with radiotherapy. In this work, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery system was developed to synergistically enhance the antitumor efficacy of radiotherapy by local ROS-activated chemotherapy, taking advantages of the enhanced concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor during X-ray irradiation and/or reoxygenation after X-ray irradiation. The ROS-responsive polymers, poly(thiodiethylene adipate) (PSDEA) and PEG-PSDEA-PEG, were synthesized and employed as the major components assembling in aqueous phase into polymer NPs in which an anticancer camptothecin analogue, SN38, was encapsulated. The drug-loaded NPs underwent structural change including swelling and partial dissociation in response to the ROS activation by virtue of the oxidation of the nonpolar sulfide residues in NPs into the polar sulfoxide units, thus leading to significant drug unloading. The in vitro performance of the chemotherapy from the X-ray irradiation preactivated NPs against BNL 1MEA.7R.1 murine carcinoma cells showed comparable cytotoxicity to free drug and appreciably enhanced effect on killing cancer cells while the X-ray irradiation being incorporated into the treatment. The in vivo tumor growth was fully inhibited with the mice receiving the local dual modality treatment of X-ray irradiation together with SN38-loaded NPs administered by intratumoral injection. The comparable efficacy of the local combinational treatment of X-ray irradiation with SN38-loaded NPs to free SN38/irradiation dual treatment corroborated the effectiveness of ROS-mediated drug release from the irradiated NPs at tumor site. The IHC examination of tumor tissues confirmed the significant reduction of VEGFA and CD31 expression with the tumor receiving the local dual treatment developed in this work, thus accounting for the absence of tumor regrowth compared to other single modality treatment. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemotherapy; Drug products; Irradiation; Nanoparticles; Polymers; Radiation; Radiotherapy; Sulfur compounds; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Unloading; X rays; Anti-tumor efficacy; Clinical treatments; Drug delivery system; Intratumoral injection; Partial dissociation; Polymeric nanoparticles; Reactive oxygen species; Therapeutic efficacy; Controlled drug delivery; firtecan; nanocarrier; nanoparticle; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; poly(thiodiethylene adipate); polymer; reactive oxygen metabolite; sulfide; sulfoxide; unclassified drug; vasculotropin A; adipic acid derivative; antineoplastic agent; irinotecan; macrogol; nanoparticle; reactive oxygen metabolite; safrole; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; aqueous solution; Article; biodegradability; BNL 1ME A.7R.1 cell line; cancer chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cancer radiotherapy; cell killing; cell viability; controlled drug release; cytotoxicity; dispersity; dissociation; down regulation; drug accumulation; drug delivery system; freeze drying; hydrophobicity; IC50; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cancer; male; micelle; molecular weight; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; particle size; photoactivation; photodynamic therapy; polymerization; priority journal; reoxygenation; single drug dose; X irradiation; analogs and derivatives; animal; Bagg albino mouse; chemistry; chemoradiotherapy; drug release; experimental neoplasm; metabolism; procedures; radiation response; tumor cell line; X ray; Adipates; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemoradiotherapy; Drug Liberation; Irinotecan; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms, Experimental; Polyethylene Glycols; Reactive Oxygen Species; Safrole; X-Rays",2-s2.0-85050718029

However, in vivo BV administration inevitably results in BV entry into non-HCC normal cells, leaky anticancer gene expression and possible toxicity. To improve the safety, we employed synthetic biology to engineer BV for transgene expression regulation. We first uncovered that miR-196a and miR-126 are exclusively expressed in HCC and normal cells, respectively, which allowed us to engineer a sensor based on distinct miRNA expression signature. We next assembled a synthetic switch by coupling the miRNA sensor and RNA binding protein L7Ae for translational repression, and incorporated the entire device into a single BV. The recombinant BV efficiently entered HCC and normal cells and enabled cis-acting transgene expression control, by turning OFF transgene expression in normal cells while switching ON transgene expression in HCC cells. Using pro-apoptotic hBax as the transgene, the switch-based BV selectively killed HCC cells in separate culture and mixed culture of HCC and normal cells.

The predominant mechanism underlying MDR is an increase in the activity of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent drug efflux transporters. Sulbactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor, is generally combined with β-lactam antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. However, sulbactam alone can be used to treat Acinetobacter baumannii infections because it inhibits the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. This is the first study to report the effects of sulbactam on mammalian cells. Methods: We used the breast cancer cell lines as a model system to determine whether sulbactam affects cancer cells. The cell viabilities in the present of doxorubicin with or without sulbactam were measured by MTT assay. Protein identities and the changes in protein expression levels in the cells after sulbactam and doxorubicin treatment were determined using LC-MS/MS. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) was used to analyze the change in mRNA expression levels of ABC transporters after treatment of doxorubicin with or without sulbactam. The efflux of doxorubicin was measures by the doxorubicin efflux assay. Results: MTT assay revealed that sulbactam enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in breast cancer cells. The results of proteomics showed that ABC transporter proteins and proteins associated with the process of transcription and initiation of translation were reduced. The mRNA expression levels of ABC transporters were also decreased when treated with doxorubicin and sulbactam. The doxorubicin efflux assay showed that sulbactam treatment inhibited doxorubicin efflux. Conclusions: The combination of sulbactam and doxorubicin enhances the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in the breast cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of ABC transporter proteins and proteins associated with the process of transcription and initiation of translation, and blocking the efflux of doxorubicin. Co-treatment of doxorubicin and sulbactam can be used in breast cancer treatment to decrease the prescribed dose of doxorubicin to avoid the adverse effects of doxorubicin. ? 2018 The Author(s).",ABC transporters; Breast cancer; Doxorubicin; Inhibitors; Proteomics; Sulbactam,ABC transporter B5; breast cancer resistance protein; doxorubicin; multidrug resistance associated protein 1; multidrug resistance associated protein 2; multidrug resistance associated protein 3; multidrug resistance associated protein 4; multidrug resistance protein 1; multidrug resistance protein 5; sulbactam; verapamil; ABCB1 gene; ABCB10 gene; ABCB5 gene; ABCB8 gene; ABCC1 gene; ABCC10 gene; ABCC2 gene; ABCC3 gene; ABCC4 gene; ABCC5 gene; ABCG2 gene; Article; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; dose response; down regulation; drug effect; drug potentiation; drug retention; drug sensitivity; gene; gene expression; genetic transcription; human; human cell; IC50; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; MTT assay; protein expression; proteomics; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; translation initiation; upregulation,2-s2.0-85052962183

There is consequently an urgent need for early-stage detection of OvCa, which requires affinity reagent biomarkers for OvCa. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and phage display technology are two powerful technologies for identifying affinity reagent biomarkers. However, the benchtop protocols for both screening technologies are relatively lengthy and require well-trained personnel. We therefore developed a novel, integrated microfluidic system capable of automating SELEX and phage display technology. Instead of using cancer cell lines, it is the first work which used tissue slides as screening targets, which possess more complicated and uncovered information for affinity reagents to recognize. This allowed for the identification of aptamer (nucleic acid) and peptide probes specific to OvCa cells and tissues. Furthermore, this developed system could be readily modified to uncover affinity reagents for diagnostics or even target therapy of other cancer cell types in the future. ? 2018 Author(s).",,Biomarkers; Cell culture; Cells; Diagnosis; Display devices; Microfluidics; Nucleic acids; Screening; Tissue; Affinity reagents; Cancer cell lines; Integrated microfluidic systems; Microfluidic platforms; Phage display technology; Screening targets; Screening technology; Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichments; Diseases,2-s2.0-85054543075

Natural products are always promising resources for discovery of anticancer drugs. Lauryl gallate (LG) is one of the derivatives of gallic acid, widely present in plants, that has been shown to induce anticancer activities in many human cancer cell lines; however, it has not been studied in human glioma cell lines. Thus, the effects of LG on human glioblastoma U87 cells were investigated in the present in vitro study. Materials and Methods: Cell morphology and viability were examined by phase-contrast microscopy. Annexin V/Propidium iodide (PI) double staining were performed and assayed by flow cytometry to confirm that viable cell number reduction was due to the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, U87 cells were exposed to LG in various concentrations and were analyzed by caspase activity assay. To further confirm that LG induced apoptotic cell death, the expression of apoptosisassociated proteins in LG-treated U87 cells was tested by western blot. Results: LG induced morphological changes and decreased viability in U87 cells. Annexin V/PI double staining revealed that LG induced apoptotic cell death in U87 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The increased activities of caspase-2, -3, -8 and -9 demonstrated that LG induced U87 cell apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway. In terms of molecular level, LG increased proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak and decreased anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in U87 cells. Furthermore, LG also suppressed the expression of p-Akt, Pak1, Hif-1α and Hif-2α, β-catenin and Tcf-1 in U87 cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that LG induced apoptotic cell death via the caspasedependent pathway in U87 cells. ? 2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

However, finding an effective therapy group is very challenging, since there are three crucial criteria that should be carefully considered simultaneously: 1) avoidance of isolation and loneliness; 2) unfamiliarity of patients; and 3) size of the therapy group. Manual selection of therapy group members, which is the common approach for most psychiatrists and mental health professionals today, may incur human bias and is very time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a new research problem, namely, Unfamiliarity-Aware Therapy Group Selection with Noah's Ark Principle (UTNA) for automatic selections of therapy group members from the social network while addressing the three crucial criteria mentioned above. In this paper, we first analyze the NP-hardness and inapproximability of the UTNA problem. Then, we consider a special case of UTNA on trees, namely, Tree-based UTNA, and propose a linear-time dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal solution. We then design an efficient algorithm, Effective Therapy Group Discovery, to select suitable members efficiently and effectively for the general UTNA problem. We invite 10 psychiatrists and clinical psychologists to conduct an expert study for validating our problem formulation, where all experts agree that our problem formulation is helpful for them, and the groups selected by our proposed approach are better than or similar to their manual configurations. In addition, we also conduct extensive experiments on three real data sets. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform other baselines in both efficiency and solution quality. ? 2014 IEEE.",Algorithm design; group formation; Noah's ark principle; social networks,Dynamic programming; Social networking (online); Trees (mathematics); Algorithm design; Automatic selection; Clinical interventions; Effective therapy; Group formations; Inapproximability; Noah's ark principle; Problem formulation; Patient treatment,2-s2.0-85051738528

In assessing UV-induced photobiological damage, we investigated dose-dependent effects of UVB irradiation on human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). Our study implemented survival and apoptosis assays and revealed an unexpected dose response wherein higher UVB-dosage induced higher viability. Established inhibitors, such as AKT? (LY294002), PKC? (G?6976, and Rottlerin), ERK? (PD98059), P38 MAPK? (SB203580), and JNK? (SP600125), were assessed to investigate UV-induced apoptotic pathways. Despite unobvious contributions of known signaling pathways in dose-response mediation, microarray analysis identified transcriptional expression of UVB-response genes related to the respiratory-chain. Observed correlation of ROS-production with UVB irradiation potentiated ROS as the underlying mechanism for observed dose responses.

Neurons are highly energy demanding and require sufficient mitochondria to support cellular activities. In response to stimuli, mitochondria undergo fusion/fission cycles to adapt to environment. It is thus logical to hypothesize that the plasticity of mitochondrial dynamics is required for neuronal regeneration. In this study, we examined the role of mitochondrial dynamics during regeneration of rat hippocampal neurons. Quantitative analysis showed that injury induced mitochondrial fission. As mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, we tested the possibility that the mitochondrial therapy may promote neuronal regeneration. Supplying freshly isolated mitochondria to the injured hippocampal neurons not only significantly increased neurite re-growth but also restored membrane potential of injured hippocampal neurons. Together, our findings support the importance of mitochondrial dynamics during regeneration of injured hippocampal neurons and highlight the therapeutic prospect of mitochondria to the injured central nervous system. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Brain injury; Mitochondrial morphogenesis; Neuronal regeneration,"Drp1 protein; guanosine triphosphatase; hydrolase inhibitor; mdivi 1; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; brain nerve cell; cell maturation; cell membrane potential; cell therapy; controlled study; embryo; hippocampus; in vitro study; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrial respiration; mitochondrion; nerve cell lesion; nerve regeneration; neurite outgrowth; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rat; animal; biological therapy; C57BL mouse; cell culture; complication; cytology; degenerative disease; disease model; hippocampus; human; injuries; metabolism; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrion; mouse; nerve cell; pathology; physiology; primary cell culture; procedures; regeneration; Sprague Dawley rat; transplantation; traumatic brain injury; Animals; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Hippocampus; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neurons; Primary Cell Culture; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Regeneration",2-s2.0-85049617768

Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods such as analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) were applied to evaluate the importance of error factors. Results showed that decision errors, crew resource management, inadequate supervision, and resource management were the important human error factors related to ED adverse events.

Additionally, some covariates could be measured with errors. In some applications, an instrumental variable is observed in a subsample, namely a calibration sample, which can be applied for bias correction. In this article, we develop two non-parametric correction approaches to simultaneously correct for the informative censoring and measurement errors in the analysis of multivariate recurrent event data. A shared frailty model is adopted to characterize the informative censoring and dependence among different types of recurrent events. To adjust for measurement errors, a non-parametric correction method using the calibration sample only is proposed. In the second approach, the information from the whole cohort is incorporated by the generalized method of moments. The proposed methods do not require the Poisson-type assumption for the multivariate recurrent event process and the distributional assumption for the frailty. Moreover, we do not need to impose any distributional assumption on the underlying covariates and measurement error. Both methods perform well, but the second approach improves efficiency.

In HNSCC patients, the median pre-CRT and post-CRT sMICA levels were 43.1 pg/mL and 65.3 pg/ mL, respectively, while the median pre-CRT and post-CRT TGF-β1 levels were 57.7 ng/mL and 36.0 ng/mL, respectively. After CRT, 19 patients (63.3%) exhibited persistently elevated sMICA, six patients (20.0%) exhibited persistently elevated TGF-β1, and five patients (16.7%) exhibited persistently elevated sMICA and TGF-β1. Patients with persistently elevated sMICA and TGF-β1 after CRT experienced an earlier tumor progression (p = 0.030), and poor overall survival (p = 0.010). Our results suggest that HNSCC patients who exhibit persistently elevated sMICA and TGF-β1 levels after CRT are at higher risk of tumor progression or death. ? 2018 Chen et al.

Herein, the oral delivery of insulin gene is reported by a nonviral vector comprising a copolymer with a high degree of substitution of branched polyethylenimine on chitosan (CS-g-bPEI). Protecting the plasmid from gastric acidic degradation and facilitating transport across the gut epithelium, the CS-g-bPEI/insulin plasmid DNA nanoparticles (NPs) can achieve systemic transgene expression for days. A single dose of orally administered NPs (600 ?g plasmid insulin (pINS)) to diabetic mice can protect the animals from hyperglycemia for more than 10 d. Three repeated administrations spaced over a 10 d interval produce similar glucose-lowering results with no hepatotoxicity detected. Positron-emission-tomography and computed-tomography images also confirm the glucose utilization by muscle cells. While this work suggests the feasibility of basal therapy for diabetes mellitus, its significance lies in the demonstration of a nonviral oral gene delivery system that can impact chronic protein replacement therapy and DNA vaccination. ? 2018 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: The hydrogel properties, in vitro drug release characteristics, and in vivo scintigraphy imaging attributes were investigated. Results: The gelation time of the hydrogels can be controlled to be within 5 min. Results from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic mechanical analysis showed that a covalent cross-linking reaction between chitosan and genipin occurred and that the hydrogel's mechanical strength and chemical stability were improved. In vitro drug release studies showed that the hydrogel can prolong the release of doxorubicin by several weeks (51.5%±5.3% at 21 days). In addition, in vivo scintigraphy results suggested high retention rates (43.1%±1.0% at 48 h) of the radiopharmaceutical compound at the tumor injection site.

Despite current antiviral therapies that successfully reduce the viral load in patients with chronic hepatitis B, persistent hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) remains a risk factor for HCC. To explore whether intrahepatic viral antigens contribute directly to hepatocarcinogenesis, we monitored the mitotic progression of HBV-positive cells. Cytokinesis failure was increased in HBV-positive HepG2.2.15 and 1.3ES2 cells, as well as in HuH-7 cells transfected with a wild-type or X-deficient HBV construct, but not in cells transfected with an HBsAg-deficient construct. We show that expression of viral large surface antigen (LHBS) was sufficient to induce cytokinesis failure of immortalized hepatocytes. Premitotic defects with DNA damage and G 2 /M checkpoint attenuation preceded cytokinesis in LHBS-positive cells, and ultimately resulted in hyperploidy. Inhibition of polo-like kinase-1 (Plk1) not only restored the G 2 /M checkpoint in these cells, but also suppressed LHBS-mediated in vivo tumourigenesis. Finally, a positive correlation between intrahepatic LHBS expression and hepatocyte hyperploidy was detected in &gt;70% of patients with chronic hepatitis B. We conclude that HBV LHBS provokes hyperploidy by inducing DNA damage and upregulation of Plk1; the former results in atypical chromatin structures, and the latter attenuates the function of the G 2 /M DNA damage checkpoint. Our data uncover a mechanism by which genomic integrity of hepatocytes is disrupted by viral LHBS. These findings highlight the role of intrahepatic surface antigen as an oncogenic risk factor in the development of HCC. Copyright ? 2018 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Various forms of treatment can be indicated, and nonpharmacological treatment is also an available option for the management of KOA individuals. For instance, auriculotherapy (AT) is one possible procedure associated with the Traditional Chinese Medicine for dealing with KOA. It is believed that the concentration of certain biomarkers could be altered in individuals with KOA after AT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of AT on plasma concentration of biomarkers in KOA individuals. This intervention is a controlled trial. Twenty-one subjects were grouped in two groups and submitted to AT with the stimulation of the Shen Men, kidney, and knee points in the treatment group or different points in the control group, once a week for 5 weeks. Blood was collected before the beginning of protocols and a week after the last session. Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Wilcoxon tests were performed, and a p ? 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Hematological parameters did not show any significant variation between the control group and treated group. Concerning the biochemical parameters, a significant reduction of direct bilirubin (from 43.31 ± 22.10 to 21.21 ± 5.30 μmol/L, p = 0.003), aspartate aminotransferase (from 0.48 ± 0.16 to 0.38 ± 0.09 μKat/L, p = 0.010), and triglycerides (from 7.04 ± 2.90 to 5.45 ± 2.57 mmol/L, p = 0.008) in the treated group was obtained. In conclusion, the analysis of results suggests that AT might be a useful intervention for the management of KOA individuals. ? 2018",auriculotherapy; bilirubin; biomarkers; knee osteoarthritis,"alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; bilirubin glucuronide; biological marker; C reactive protein; calcium; creatine kinase; creatinine; gama glutamil transpeptidase; globulin; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; protein; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; urea; uric acid; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; biological marker; acupuncture; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; hematological parameters; human; knee osteoarthritis; male; priority journal; prospective study; protein blood level; therapy effect; blood; clinical trial; knee; knee osteoarthritis; middle aged; pain; pathophysiology; Adult; Aged; Auriculotherapy; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Pain",2-s2.0-85049311452

It has been reported that the protective effect of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) against cerebral I/R injury can be significantly improved by its combination with ultrasound exposure. However, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the synergistic protective effect remain unclear. In the present work, the damage induced by I/R injury was modeled by glutamate-induced toxicity to pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The ultrasound-enhanced protective effect of TMP was systemically investigated by measuring variations in cell viability, cell migration and levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, the oxidative stress-related protein glutathione, apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-8, -9 and -3), as well as expression of related genes (hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, p53, murine double minute2). The results suggest that the ultrasound-enhanced protective effect of TMP against cerebral I/R injury might act via the reactive oxygen species/hypoxia-inducible factor-1a signaling pathway, and an appropriate ultrasound intensity should be selected to achieve an optimal synergistic neuroprotective effect. ? 2018 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology",Cerebral ischemia/Reperfusion injury; Neuroprotective effect; Signaling pathways; Tetramethylpyrazine; Ultrasound-mediated sonoporation,"Cell death; Gene expression; Oxygen; Pigments; Proteins; Thermomechanical pulping process; Ultrasonics; Cerebral ischemia; Neuroprotective effects; Signaling pathways; Sonoporation; Tetramethylpyrazine; Signaling; caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; glutathione disulfide; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; protein p53; reactive oxygen metabolite; tetramethylpyrazine; Hif1a protein, mouse; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; neuroprotective agent; pyrazine derivative; tetramethylpyrazine; vasodilator agent; apoptosis; Article; Bax gene; Bcl 2 gene; brain ischemia; cell damage; cell growth; cell membrane; cell migration; cell size; cell structure; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; drug efficacy; flow cytometry; gene; gene expression; growth inhibition; human; human cell; in vitro study; neuroprotection; oxidative stress; PC12 cell line; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein expression; scanning electron microscopy; ultrasound therapy; animal; brain ischemia; cell culture; cell survival; metabolism; rat; reperfusion injury; signal transduction; ultrasound; Animals; Brain Ischemia; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Flow Cytometry; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; In Vitro Techniques; Neuroprotective Agents; Oxidative Stress; PC12 Cells; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pyrazines; Rats; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reperfusion Injury; Signal Transduction; Ultrasonic Waves; Vasodilator Agents",2-s2.0-85048834796

However, the constraints on the harsh operation environment and ineffective response to instantly reflect the physical status remain critical challenges. Herein, we develop a chitosan-based triboelectric nanogenerator (C-TENG) to harvest biomechanical energy from human motions, in which a nanostructured chitosan-glycerol film is utilized to promote the commercial textile into a multi-functional textile based on its transparency, flexibility, biocompatibility and adaptability to commercial fabrics. The output characteristics of the as-fabricated C-TENG are notably stable under various humidity conditions, distinguishing them from conventional TENGs. As the relative humidity (RH) changes from 20% to 80%, the electric output of the C-TENG remains unchanged, in contrast to the performance degradation observed for conventional TENGs. Moreover, the C-TENG can be further developed into various kinds of self-powered healthcare sensors for humidity, sweat, and gait phase detection. More importantly, the designed humidity sensor based on the C-TENG exhibits a promising advancement in sensitivity compared with conventional TENG-based humidity sensors.

However, the therapeutic response is limited to certain patient populations, and immunotoxicity as well as autoimmunity have compromised the therapeutic benefits.

IO@FuDex3 can repair the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment by reinvigorating tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, while targeting the nanomedicine via magnetic navigation to the tumour to minimize off-target effects. Treatment that combines IO@FuDex3 and magnetic navigation reduces the occurrence of adverse events and extends the median survival from 32 to 63 days with less than 1 per cent dose compared with soluble anti-PD-L1. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of integrating anti-PD-L1 and T-cell activators as a form of inherently therapeutic nanomedicine to augment the therapeutic index of combination checkpoint immunotherapy. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"Drug products; Medical nanotechnology; Nanoparticles; T-cells; Tumors; Immunomodulators; Magnetic nano-particles; Magnetic navigation; Median survival; Microenvironments; Patient population; Therapeutic benefits; Therapeutic index; Nanomagnetics; antineoplastic agent; CD28 antigen; CD3 antibody; fucoidan dextran superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; immunological antineoplastic agent; magnetic nanoparticle; programmed death 1 ligand 1 inhibitor; unclassified drug; fucoidin; immunologic factor; magnetite nanoparticle; polysaccharide; 4T1 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; breast cancer; cancer immunotherapy; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; drug conjugation; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug safety; drug selectivity; drug synthesis; drug targeting; female; human; immunomodulation; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nanomedicine; nonhuman; priority journal; survival time; T lymphocyte activation; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; animal; drug delivery system; drug effect; immunology; immunotherapy; neoplasm; pathology; procedures; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Immunotherapy; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Mice; Nanomedicine; Neoplasms; Polysaccharides; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85046887475

Purpose: To investigate the susceptibility of reconstructing color-coded iodine concentration maps on the basis of quantitative calibrations of the iodine concentration and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in DE-CEDM applications. Material and Methods: A custom-made phantom filled with iodine concentrations in the range of 0.1–10 mg/cm2 was used in calibrations. All DE images were acquired using the GE Senographe Essential system. From DE subtraction images, the image contrast and CNR were obtained, and the quantitative relationship between these two metrics and the iodine concentration at each phantom thickness was investigated. The quantitative CNR calibration curves were applied to reconstruct color-coded iodine maps on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Results: Both the mean contrast and mean CNR increased linearly with the iodine concentration. The iodine concentration estimated from the iodine map reconstructed from quantitative CNR calibrations was highly consistent with the desired iodine concentration (R2= 0.989), and smaller relative errors (in the range of 3.0–19.5%) were observed with iodine concentrations not less than 1 mg/cm2. Conclusion: An iodine concentration map could be reconstructed based on the linear relationship between the CNR and iodine concentration. From the color-coded iodine concentration map, the contrast medium enhancement phenomenon could be further estimated quantitatively, and tumor enhancement patterns could be easily observed. ? 2017, The Foundation Acta Radiologica.",contrast medium; contrast-enhanced digital mammography; Dual energy; iodine concentration,"Color; Contrast media; Mammography; Phantoms; Pixels; Tumors; Contrast medium; Contrast to noise ratio; Digital mammography; Dual energy; Iodine concentration; Linear relationships; Quantitative calibrations; Tumor angiogenesis; Iodine; iodine; contrast medium; iodine; adult; Article; breast cancer; calibration; clinical article; concentration response; contrast to noise ratio; digital mammography; dual energy contrast enhanced digital mammography; female; human; image analysis; image quality; image reconstruction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; tumor vascularization; breast tumor; evaluation study; image enhancement; imaging phantom; mammography; procedures; radiography; Adult; Breast Neoplasms; Contrast Media; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Humans; Iodine; Mammography; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiography, Dual-Energy Scanned Projection",2-s2.0-85044263434

Materials and Methods: A thoracic phantom with calcium inserts of known densities was scanned with filtered back projection (FBP) and AIDR 3D algorithms in small- and medium-sized phantoms. Twenty-four patients underwent two consecutive scans of CACS with FBP and AIDR 3D algorithms. The absolute Agatston score, Agatston score risk, volume score, and Agatston score percentile-based risk were compared, and concordance coefficients and agreement plots were made. Results: Agatston and volume scores were significantly different between the phantom sizes (P <.01). There were no significant differences in the Agatston scores between FBP and AIDR 3D for the medium phantoms (P =.25). In the patients, there were no significant differences in Agatston and volume scores between FBP and AIDR 3D (P =.06 and P =.09, respectively). The correlation coefficients of Agatston and volume scores with AIDR 3D were excellent compared to those of FBP. There were no significant differences in Agatston score risk and Agatston score percentile-based risk between FBP and AIDR 3D (P =.74 and P = 1, respectively). There was mean dose reduction of 57.8% ± 18.6% for AIDR 3D. Conclusion: The absolute Agatston score differed between FBP and AIDR 3D reconstructions. However, the cardiac risk categorizations of the two methods were comparable. An integrated AIDR 3D algorithm with automatic tube current modulation enables radiation dose savings at a consistent noise level without sacrificing CACS. ? 2018 The Association of University Radiologists",Agatston score; Cardiac CT; coronary calcium scan; iterative reconstruction; radiation dose,"adult; Agatston score; aged; Article; clinical article; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery calcium score; female; human; male; priority journal; radiation dose; radiation dose reduction; algorithm; blood vessel calcification; comparative study; coronary artery disease; coronary blood vessel; diagnostic imaging; image processing; imaging phantom; middle aged; procedures; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography; calcium; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Calcium; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiation Dosage; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Vascular Calcification",2-s2.0-85040972721

The present study aims to investigate the immunoenhancing activity of galactomannan isolated from A. cinnamomea. The cold water-soluble polysaccharide (galactomannan-repeated; MW>70 kDa; named ACP) of A. cinnamomea was isolated, and immunostimulatory properties were studied through different immune cell models including mouse macrophages and human dendritic cells. Through Toll-like receptor 4, ACP stimulated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in J774A.1 mouse macrophages, mouse peritoneal macrophages and human dendritic cells. It was further identified that ACP elicited its immunostimulatory activity through protein kinase C-α (PKC-α) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, ACP exerted the endotoxin tolerance-like effect through NF-κB inhibition. These findings demonstrate the potential of A. cinnamomea galactomannan as an immunostimulator or an adjuvant in immunotherapy and vaccination. ?

Tau protein undergoes a plethora of intra-molecular modifications and some altered forms promote the production of toxic oligomeric tau and paired helical filaments, and through which further assemble into neurofibrillary tangles, also known as tauopathy. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances of the tauopathy research, primarily focusing on its association with the early axonal manifestation of axonal transport defect, axonal mitochondrial stress, autophagic vesicle accumulation and the proceeding of axon destruction, and the pathogenic Tau spreading across the synapse. Two alternative strategies either by targeting tau protein itself or by improving the age-related physiological decline are currently racing to find the hopeful treatment for tauopathy.

Predictors included fruits and vegetables consumption, types of cooking oil, staple foods, and meat. The mean age of the study sample was around 85?years. Approximately 56% of respondents consumed fresh vegetables daily. A majority of seniors consumed rice as their staple food. Only 14% of seniors consumed fresh fruits daily. Most seniors consumed meat weekly or more frequently.

We identified an Aspergillus flavus-induced NBS-LRR gene, AhRAF4, using a microarray-based approach. By comparison of 23 sequences from three species using phytogenetics, protein secondary structure and three-dimensional structural analyses, AhRAF4 was revealed to be derived from Arachis duranensis by recombination, and has newly evolved into a family of several members, characterised by duplications and point mutations. However, the members of the family descended from A.?ipaensis were lost following tetraploidisation. AhRAF4 was slightly up-regulated by low temperature, drought, salicylic acid and ethylene, but down-regulated by methyl jasmonate. The distinct responses upon As.?flavus inoculation and the differential reactions between resistant and susceptible varieties indicate that AhRAF4 might play a role in defence responses. Temporal and spatial expression and the phenotype of transformed protoplasts suggest that AhRAF4 may also be associated with pericarp development.

Ultrasound parametric imaging, which is based on statistical models, assesses fatty liver changes, using quantitative visualization of hepatic-steatosis–caused variations in the statistical properties of backscattered signals. One constraint with using statistical models in ultrasound imaging is that ultrasound data must conform to the distribution employed. Small-window entropy imaging was recently proposed as a non–model-based parametric imaging technique with physical meanings of backscattered statistics. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using small-window entropy imaging in the assessment of fatty liver disease and evaluated its performance through comparisons with parametric imaging based on the Nakagami distribution model (currently the most frequently used statistical model). Liver donors (n = 53) and patients (n = 142) were recruited to evaluate hepatic fat fractions (HFFs), using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and to evaluate the stages of fatty liver disease (normal, mild, moderate and severe), using liver biopsy with histopathology. Livers were scanned using a 3-MHz ultrasound to construct B-mode, small-window entropy and Nakagami images to correlate with HFF analyses and fatty liver stages. The diagnostic values of the imaging methods were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. The results demonstrated that the entropy value obtained using small-window entropy imaging correlated well with log10(HFF), with a correlation coefficient r = 0.74, which was higher than those obtained for the B-scan and Nakagami images. Moreover, small-window entropy imaging also resulted in the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.80 for stages equal to or more severe than mild; 0.90 for equal to or more severe than moderate; 0.89 for severe), which indicated that non–model-based entropy imaging—using the small-window technique—performs more favorably than other techniques in fatty liver assessment. ? 2018 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology",Entropy imaging; Fatty liver; Hepatic steatosis; Ultrasound,"Chemical sensors; Diagnosis; Entropy; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Statistics; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonics; Backscattered statistics; Correlation coefficient; Fatty liver; Hepatic steatosis; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Quantitative visualization; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Statistical properties; Diseases; area under the curve; Article; B scan; clinical evaluation; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic value; disease classification; disease severity; entropy; fatty liver; feasibility study; hepatic fat fraction; histopathology; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; liver donor; major clinical study; mathematical analysis; Nakagami distribution model; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; organ donor; parametric imaging; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; small window entropy imaging; statistical model; ultrasound; adult; aged; diagnostic imaging; echography; female; image processing; liver; male; middle aged; nonalcoholic fatty liver; procedures; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Aged; Entropy; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Prospective Studies; Taiwan; Ultrasonography; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85044773517

An increasing number of social network mental disorders (SNMDs), such as Cyber-Relationship Addiction, Information Overload, and Net Compulsion, have been recently noted. Symptoms of these mental disorders are usually observed passively today, resulting in delayed clinical intervention. In this paper, we argue that mining online social behavior provides an opportunity to actively identify SNMDs at an early stage. It is challenging to detect SNMDs because the mental status cannot be directly observed from online social activity logs. Our approach, new and innovative to the practice of SNMD detection, does not rely on self-revealing of those mental factors via questionnaires in Psychology. Instead, we propose a machine learning framework, namely, Social Network Mental Disorder Detection (SNMDD), that exploits features extracted from social network data to accurately identify potential cases of SNMDs. We also exploit multi-source learning in SNMDD and propose a new SNMD-based Tensor Model (STM) to improve the accuracy.

However, in view of their minute variations in concentration, short lifetimes, and limited ranges of action, in situ generation of ROS with specific manipulations should be more effective for ROS-responsive drug delivery. Here we present a new delivery nanoplatform for photodynamic therapy (PDT) with on-demand drug release regulated by light irradiation. Rose bengal (RB) molecules, which exhibit a high yield of ROS generation, were encapsulated in a mixture of chitosan (CTS), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and branched polyethylenimine (bPEI) with hydrophobic iron oxide nanoparticles through an oil-in-water emulsion method. The as-prepared magnetic nanoclusters (MNCs) with a tripolymer coating displayed high water dispersibility, efficient cellular uptake, and the cationic groups of CTS and bPEI were effective for RB loading through electrostatic interaction. The encapsulation efficiency of RB in MNCs could be further improved by increasing the amount of short bPEI chains. During the photodynamic process, controlled release of the host molecules (i.e., RB) or guest molecules (i.e., paclitaxel) from the bPEI-based nanoplatform was achieved simultaneously through a photooxidation action sensitized by RB. This approach promises specific payload release and highly effective PDT or PDT combined therapy in various cancer cell lines including breast (MCF-7 and multidrug resistant MCF-7 subline), SKOV-3 ovarian, and Tramp-C1 prostate. In in vivo xenograft studies, the nanoengineered light-switchable carrier also greatly augments its PDT efficacy against multidrug resistant MCF-7/MDR tumor as compared with free drugs. All the above findings suggest that the substantial effects of enhanced drug distribution for efficient cancer therapy was achieved with this smart nanocarrier capable of on demand drug release and delivery, thus exerting its therapeutic activity to a greater extent. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",Controlled drug release; Multidrug resistance; Photodynamic therapy; Photosensitized oxidation; Stimuli-responsive polymer,"Cell culture; Diseases; Dyes; Emulsification; Emulsions; Encapsulation; Enzyme inhibition; Hydrogels; Iron oxides; Molecules; Oncology; Photodynamic therapy; Photooxidation; Plastic coatings; Targeted drug delivery; Controlled drug release; Encapsulation efficiency; Iron oxide nanoparticle; Oil-in-water emulsions; Photodynamic therapy (PDT); Photosensitized oxidation; Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Reactive oxygen species; Controlled drug delivery; nanoparticle; rose bengal; drug delivery system; drug release; human; male; photochemotherapy; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Humans; Male; Nanoparticles; Photochemotherapy; Rose Bengal",2-s2.0-85048136874

For example, the latest 3D xPoint memory could be a kind of NVRAM with much longer life expectancy than NAND .ash and could ease the possible endurance issue. When NVRAM is considered as both main memory and storage in mobile computing systems, existing page cache mechanisms introduce too many unnecessary data movements between main memory and storage. To resolve this issue, we propose the concept of ""union page cache,"" which jointly manages data of the page cache in both main memory and storage. To realize this concept, a partial page cache strategy is designed to consider both main memory and storage as its management space and to eliminate unnecessary data movements between main memory and storage without sacri.cing the data consistency of .le systems.

Locally recurrent HN cancer after full-dose irradiation poses a therapeutic challenge, and boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) may be a solution that could provide durable local control with tolerable toxicity. The Tsing-Hua Open Pool Reactor (THOR) at National Tsing-Hua University in Hsin-Chu, provides a high-quality epithermal neutron source for basic and clinical BNCT research. Our first clinical trial, entitled ""A phase I/II trial of boron neutron capture therapy for recurrent head and neck cancer at THOR"", was carried out between 2010 and 2013. A total of 17 patients with 23 recurrent HN tumors who had received high-dose photon irradiation were enrolled in the study. The fructose complex of L-boronophenylalanine was used as a boron carrier, and a two-fraction BNCT treatment regimen at 28-day intervals was used for each patient. Toxicity was acceptable, and although the response rate was high (12/17), re-recurrence within or near the radiation site was common. To obtain better local control, another clinical trial entitled ""A phase I/II trial of boron neutron capture therapy combined with image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) for locally recurrent HN cancer"" was initiated in 2014. The first administration of BNCT was performed according to our previous protocol, and IG-IMRT was initiated 28?days after BNCT. As of May 2017, seven patients have been treated with this combination. The treatment-related toxicity was similar to that previously observed with two BNCT applications.

Improving the binding affinity of Ank GAG 1D4 would potentially enhance the Ank GAG 1D4-mediated antiviral activity. Objective: To augment the affinity of Ank GAG 1D4 scaffold towards its CA target, through computational predictions and experimental designs. Method: Three dimensional structure of the binary complex formed by Ank GAG 1D4 docked to the CA was used as a model for van der Waals (vdW) binding energy calculation. The results generated a simple guideline to select the amino acids for modifications. Following the predictions, modified Ank GAG 1D4 proteins were produced and further evaluated for their CA-binding activity, using ELISA-modified method and bio-layer interferometry (BLI). Results: Tyrosine at position 56 (Y56) in Ank GAG 1D4 was experimentally identified as the most critical residue for CA binding. Rational substitutions of this residue diminished the binding affinity. However, vdW calculation preconized to substitute serine for tyrosine at position 45. Remarkably, the affinity for the viral CA was significantly enhanced in Ank GAG 1D4-S45Y mutant, with no alteration of the target specificity. Conclusions: The S-to-Y mutation at position 45, based on the prediction of interacting amino acids and on vdW binding energy calculation, resulted in a significant enhancement of the affinity of Ank GAG 1D4 ankyrin for its CA target. Ank GAG 1D4-S45Y mutant represented the starting point for further construction of variants with even higher affinity towards the viral CA, and higher therapeutic potential in the future. ? 2018, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

In this study, the transketolase (TKT) expression correlated with tumor size in the 4T1/BALB/c syngeneic model. In addition, TKT expression was higher in lymph node metastases compared with primary tumor or normal tissues of patients, and high TKT levels were associated with poor survival. Depletion of TKT or addition of alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) enhanced the levels of tumor suppressors succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase (FH), decreasing oncometabolites succinate and fumarate, and further stabilizing HIF prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) and decreasing HIF1a, ultimately suppressing breast cancer metastasis.

Furthermore, oxythiamine treatment led to increased levels of aKG in TNBC cells. Together, our study has identified a novel TKT-mediated aKG signaling pathway that regulates breast cancer oncogenesis and can be exploited as a modality for improving therapy. Significance: These findings uncover the clinical significance of TKT in breast cancer progression and metastasis and demonstrate effective therapy by inhibiting TKT or by adding aKG. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"2 oxoglutaric acid; docetaxel; doxorubicin; fumarate hydratase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; hypoxia inducible factor proline dioxygenase; oxythiamine; transketolase; 2 oxoglutaric acid; fumarate hydratase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; transketolase; alpha ketoglutarate signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer growth; cancer survival; cell cycle progression; cell death; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; female; glucose metabolism; glycolysis; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; metastasis inhibition; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; protein analysis; protein depletion; protein expression; protein function; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; survival rate; triple negative breast cancer; tumor invasion; tumor volume; Western blotting; animal; Bagg albino mouse; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; physiology; SCID mouse; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Fumarate Hydratase; Glycolysis; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Ketoglutaric Acids; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Metastasis; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Transketolase; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85048040586

Malfunction of the tumor suppressor protein, p53 is a universal hallmark in human cancers. Under normal conditions, p53 is degraded through an ubiquitin-proteosome pathway regulated by its negative regulator, MDM2. In contrast, cellular stress such as DNA damage will activate p53 to carry out DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In this study, we focused on ovarian carcinoma with high EGFR and MDM2 overexpression rate. We assessed the effects of combined inhibition by MDM2 (JNJ-26854165) and EGFR (gefitinib) inhibitors on various ovarian cell lines to determine the importance of these two molecular targets on cell proliferation. We then used a proteomic strategy to investigate the relationship between MDM2 and EGFR inhibition to explore the underlying mechanisms of how their combined signaling blockades work together to exert cooperative inhibition. Our results demonstrated that all four cell lines were sensitive to both individual and combined, MDM2 and EGFR inhibition. The proteomic analysis also showed that gefitinib/JNJ-treated CAOV3 cells exhibited downregulation of proteins involved in nucleotide biosynthesis such as nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NME2). In conclusion, our study showed that the combined treatment with JNJ and gefitinib exerted synergistic inhibition on cell proliferation, thereby suggesting the potential application of combining MDM2 inhibitors with EGFR inhibitors for enhancing efficacy in ovarian cancer treatment. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",DIGE; EGFR; MDM2; Proteomics,"actin; actin, cytoplasmic 1; actin, cytoplasmic 2; acyl coenzyme A; adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; aldehyde reductase; alpha enolase; cofilin 1; elongation factor 1beta; ezrin; gefitinib; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; glycerophosphoinositol inositolphosphodiesterase; inorganic pyrophosphatase; isocitric acid; lipocortin 1; malate dehydrogenase; nucleoside diphosphate kinase; nucleoside diphosphate kinase B; oxidoreductase; phosphoglycerate kinase; phosphoglycerate mutase; phosphoglycerate mutase 1; protein disulfide isomerase; protein MDM2; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase PKM; retinoblastoma binding protein 4; serdemetan; stathmin; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; MDM2 protein, human; protein MDM2; proteome; serdemetan; tryptamine derivative; Article; Caov-3 cell line; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell viability; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; enzyme inhibition; growth inhibition; HEY A8 cell line; IC50; image analysis; immunoblotting; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; ovary carcinoma; OVCAR-3 cell line; priority journal; protein expression; proteomics; two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; antagonists and inhibitors; apoptosis; drug effect; female; human; metabolism; ovary tumor; pathology; proteomics; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Drug Synergism; ErbB Receptors; Female; Gefitinib; Humans; Ovarian Neoplasms; Proteome; Proteomics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2; Tryptamines",2-s2.0-85045439077

Here, we report a novel, flexible and biocompatible triboelectric-piezoelectric-pyroelectric hybrid nanogenerator based on a significantly simplified structure with good transparency which mainly due to high-performance transparent electrodes (TEs). Inspired by gradually optimized leaf venation (LV), silver nanowires were arranged into a LV-like network through a green and cost-effective approach. The unique structure led to an ultra-high transmission up to 99% (at 68.2 Ω sq?1 sheet resistance) and sheet resistances as low as 1.4 Ω sq?1 (with 82% transmission). With 3 effects coupled, the generator can scavenge a maximum open-circuit output voltage of 55 V and 86 V to produce mechanical energy and thermal energy, respectively. In addition, the transparent hybrid nanogenerator can be conformally attached on different parts of body for real-time monitoring of various human vital signs including breath, heartbeat pulse and swallowing. With high transparency, the hybrid nanogenerator can be integrated with a thin liquid crystal film possessing thermochromic properties, potentially as a visualized thermometer for medical diagnostics.

In this research, we have developed a hand-held biosensor system to rapidly screen for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) from a single drop of whole blood. The sensor methodology is based on extended gate design of electrical double layer (EDL) field effect transistor (FET), that can directly detect BNP in whole blood, without extensive sample pre-treatments, thereby eliminating the limitations of charge screening in high ionic strength solutions. A simple sensor array chip is fabricated to integrate with the MOSFET sensor system. Sensing characteristics are elucidated using purified BNP samples in 1 × PBS (with 4% BSA), spiked BNP samples in whole blood and clinical whole blood samples. The blood cells can be gravitationally separated without the use of any external actuation. The sensor exhibits very high sensitivity over wide dynamic range of detection. The sensing characteristics are not adversely affected by the presence of background proteins or blood cells, even without gravitational blood cell separation. Thus, the biosensor system can allow users to perform rapid whole blood diagnostics with minimal user protocols, in 5 min. The features of high sensitivity, cost-effectiveness and convenience of usage empower this technology to revolutionize the mobile diagnostics and healthcare industry. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",BNP; Extended gate EDL FET biosensor; Hand-held device; Heart failure; Whole blood diagnostics,"Biochips; Biosensors; Cardiology; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Drops; Electric field effects; Field effect transistors; Hand held computers; Ionic strength; Risk assessment; Screening; Static random access storage; Blood cell separation; Brain natriuretic peptide; Cardio-vascular disease; Electrical double layers; Hand held device; Heart failure; Sensing characteristics; Whole blood; Blood; brain natriuretic peptide; brain natriuretic peptide; Article; blood analysis; blood cell; blood sampling; cell separation; cost effectiveness analysis; gravity; heart failure; peptide analysis; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; blood; devices; economics; equipment design; evaluation study; genetic procedures; heart failure; human; lab on a chip; limit of detection; point of care testing; sample size; time factor; transistor; Biosensing Techniques; Equipment Design; Heart Failure; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Limit of Detection; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Point-of-Care Testing; Risk Assessment; Sample Size; Time Factors; Transistors, Electronic",2-s2.0-85042371493

Our study proposed to improve the spatial uniformity of the antivascular effect and drug penetration within the tumor core and rim in combination therapies by regulating ultrasound-stimulated microbubble destruction (USMD). Focused ultrasound at 2 MHz and lipid-shell microbubbles (1.12 ± 0.08 μm, mean ± standard deviation) were used to perform USMD. The efficiency of the antivascular effect was evaluated by intravital imaging to determine the optimal USMD parameters. Tumor perfusion and histological alterations in the tumor core and rim were used to analyze the spatial uniformity of the antivascular effect and liposomal-doxorubicin (5 mg/kg) penetration in the combination therapy. Tumor vessels of specific sizes were disrupted by regulating USMD: vessels with sizes of 11 ± 3, 14 ± 5, 19 ± 7, and 23 ± 10 μm were disrupted by stimulation at acoustic pressures of 3, 5, 7, and 9 MPa, respectively (each p &lt; 0.05). The effective treatment time of USMD (at 2 × 107 microbubbles/mouse, 7 MPa, and three cycles) was 60-120 min, which resulted in the disruption of 21-44% of vessels smaller than 50 μm. The reductions in perfusion and vascular density after combination therapy did not differ significantly between the tumor core and rim.

Western fast food and sweetened beverages, two food options associated with chronic diseases and obesity, have played key roles to alter adolescents' dietary patterns. This study aims to examine the association between adolescents' visits to Western fast food restaurants and sweetened beverage consumption. Applying three waves of the China Health and Nutrition Study (CHNS) between 2006 and 2011 (n = 1063), we used generalized Poisson regression (GPR) to investigate the association between adolescents' Western fast food restaurant visits and sweetened beverage consumption, as the popularity of fast food and sweetened beverages has skyrocketed among adolescents in contemporary China. A linear-by-linear association test was used as a trend test to study general patterns between sweetened beverage consumption and Western fast food restaurant visits. We adjusted all models with sweetened beverage consumption frequency, four food preferences (fast food, salty snacks, fruits and vegetables), school status, gross household income, provinces, rural/urban regions, age and gender. From the results of the trend test, frequent sweetened beverage consumption was highly associated with more Western fast food restaurant visits among Chinese adolescents in the three waves (p < 0.001). Furthermore, we observed that adolescents, who had less than monthly sweetened beverage consumption or did not drink them at all, had much less likelihood of visiting Western fast food restaurants (p < 0.05), compared with those daily consumers. Adolescents' sweetened beverage consumption was highly associated with Western fast food restaurant visits in contemporary China. Further actions are needed from the Chinese central government to create a healthier dietary environment for adolescents. ? 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",adolescents; China; sweetened beverage; Western fast food; Westernization,,2-s2.0-85047865605

To increase vaccine yields and reduce the production costs, the bioprocess improvement for EV-A71 vaccine manufacturing is currently being investigated. The parameters that could affect and enhance the production yields of EV-A71 virus growth in the microcarrier bioreactor were investigated. The medium replacement culture strategy included a multi-harvested semi-batch process and perfusion technology and was found to increase the production yields more than 7–14 folds. Based on the western blot and cryo-EM analyses of the EV-A71 virus particles produced from either the multi-harvested semi-batch (MHSBC) or perfusion cultures were found to be similar to those virus particles obtained from the single batch culture.

Similar to BPR1K653, analogs 3b-3h bear alkyl or tertiary amino group at the ortho position of the phenylurea, and showed equal or better inhibition activity for Aurora-B over Aurora-A. Conversely, preferential Aurora-A inhibition activity was observed when the same functional group was moved to the meta position of the phenylurea. Compounds 3m and 3n, both of which harbor a tertiary amino group at the meta position of the phenylurea, showed 10–16 fold inhibition selectivity for Aurora-A over Aurora-B. The in vitro kinase inhibition results were verified by Western blot analysis, and indicated that compounds 3m and 3n were more than 75-fold superior in inhibiting T-loop autophosphorylation of Aurora-A (Thr288), compared to Aurora-B (Thr232) in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. The computational docking analysis suggested that the tertiary amine at the meta position of the phenylurea formed a more stable interaction with residues in the back pocket of Aurora-A than in Aurora-B, a possible explanation for the observed discrepancy in the selectivity. These results support an alternative small molecule design strategy targeting the back pocket of Aurora kinases for selective isoform inhibition. ? 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Anticancer agents; Aurora kinase inhibitor; Docking study,"1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfurol[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [2 ((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl)urea]; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl) 3 phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (2 ethylphenyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (2 isobutylphenyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (2 isopropylphenyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (3 ethylphenyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (3 isobutylphenyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (3 isopropylphenyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (4 ethylphenyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (4 isobutylphenyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (4 isopropylphenyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (4 toly)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (m tolyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 (o tolyl)urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [2 ((4 hydroxypiperidin 1 yl)methyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [2 (piperidin 1 ylmethyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [3 ((4 hydroxypiperidin 1 yl)methyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [3 ((diethylamino)methyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [3 ((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [3 ((ethyl(methyl)amino)methyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [3 (piperidin 1 ylmethyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [4 ((4 hydroxypiperidin 1 yl)methyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [4 ((diethylamino)methyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [4 ((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl]urea; 1 [4 (2 ((5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl] 3 [4 (piperidin 1 ylmethyl)phenyl]urea; antineoplastic agent; aurora kinase inhibitor; bpr 1k 653; n (4 aminophenethyl) 5 chloro 6 phenylfuro[2,3 d]pyrimidin 4 amine; tertiary amine; unclassified drug; aurora A kinase; aurora B kinase; BPR1K653; carbanilamide derivative; fused heterocyclic rings; protein kinase inhibitor; Article; autophosphorylation; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; computational fluid dynamics; controlled study; drug design; drug synthesis; enzyme inhibition; enzyme phosphorylation; female; HCT 116 cell line; HeLa cell line; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; in vitro study; molecular docking; pharmacokinetic parameters; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; structure activity relation; uterine cervix cancer; Western blotting; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; colon tumor; drug design; drug effect; enzymology; metabolism; mitosis; phosphorylation; synthesis; Aurora Kinase A; Aurora Kinase B; Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic; Colonic Neoplasms; Drug Design; HCT116 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Mitosis; Molecular Docking Simulation; Phenylurea Compounds; Phosphorylation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors",2-s2.0-85045234882

We sought to explore whether the current practices of prescribing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for ACS and clinical outcomes have improved over time. Methods: A total of 1534 consecutive diabetic patients with ACS were enrolled between 2013 and 2015 from 27 hospitals in the nationwide registry initiated by the Taiwan Society of Cardiology (the TSOC ACS-DM Registry). Baseline and clinical demographics, treatment, and clinical outcomes were compared to those of 1000 ACS patients with DMrecruited in the Taiwan ACS-full spectrum (ACS-FS) Registry, whichwas performed between 2008 and 2010. Results: Compared to the DMpatients in the Taiwan ACS-FS Registry, even though reperfusion therapy was carried out in significantly fewer patients, the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) rate for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and the prescription rates of GDMT for ACS including P2Y12 inhibitors, renin-angiotensin blockers, beta-blockers, and statins were significantly higher in those in the TSOC ACS-DM Registry. Moreover, significant reductions in 1-year mortality, recurrent nonfatal MI and stroke were observed compared to those of the DM patients in the Taiwan ACS-FS Registry. Multivariate analysis identified reperfusion therapy in combination with GDMT as a strong predictor of better 1-year outcomes [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.54 (0.33-0.89)]. Conclusions: Marked improvements in performing primary PCI for STEMI and prescribing GDMT for ACS were observed over time in Taiwan. This was associated with improved 1-year event-free survival in the diabetic patients with ACS. ? 2018, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

Herein, we analyzed the factors affecting the prognosis of patients who received afatinib as a first-line therapy for advanced EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma in the real-world setting. Patients who received afatinib as a first-line therapy and were reimbursed by the National Health Insurance were recruited in this study. Data on patient characteristics and treatment courses were collected. In total, 259 patients were enrolled (median follow-up, 22.0 months). Of them, 82 (31.7%) were identified to have brain metastases at baseline, which were associated with poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, high incidence of central nervous system progression, and short overall survival. However, the results of our analysis showed that overall survival was not affected by reductions in the afatinib dosage or any upfront local treatments for brain tumors. Multivariate analyses showed that brain metastases at diagnosis and treatment response to afatinib are two important prognostic factors for the overall survival of patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma. ?

The recurrence risk of ASD ranges from 3% to 18.7% for parents having one affected child. As recurrence risk perceptions have important implications for family planning, prenatal preparation, and future children managements, absolute and relative recurrence risk perceptions of having another affected child among Taiwanese parents of children with ASD were assessed. Methods: This study collected quantitative survey data from 415 Taiwanese parents who had one child with ASD. Results: Participants reported their absolute recurrence risk of having another child with ASD was 33.4%. Compared to other parents with normally-developing children, merely 49.8% of participants perceived higher relative recurrence risk. By controlling for the sociodemographic characteristics, participants’ absolute recurrence risk perceptions were significantly predicted by their perceived genetic causes of ASD and family history of ASD. Yet, participants’ relative recurrence risk perceptions were significantly associated with only the perceived genetic etiology. Conclusion: Taiwanese parents of children diagnosed with ASD had an incorrect understanding of their absolute and relative recurrence risks. Practice implications: To facilitate informed decision-making in family planning, healthcare providers should discuss absolute and relative recurrence risks as well as genetic causes of ASD with this particular group. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Autism spectrum disorders; Family history; Genetics; Risk perceptions,"adult; age distribution; anxiety; Article; autism; child; educational status; employment; family history; fear; female; genetic predisposition; genetic risk; guilt; health belief; health survey; human; income; male; marriage; parent; prediction; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; recurrence risk; recurrence risk perception; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; Taiwan; Asian continental ancestry group; attitude to health; autism; child parent relation; genetics; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; recurrent disease; risk; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parents; Recurrence; Risk; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85039797071

For this reason, a novel combination of propidium monoazide (PMA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was reported in this work for fast detection of live TB. Experimental results showed that the PMA-RT-PCR protocol can detect live TB with a detection limit as low as 14 colony formation units (CFU)/reaction by measuring the threshold cycle number (Ct value) in a calibration curve. Furthermore, PMA could be used successfully to distinguish dead TB such that no PCR products could be generated. More importantly, all the procedure could be finished within 2 hours.

However, the expression levels of the IDH protein and their biological function in human breast cancer remain largely unknown. Methods: In this study, the clinical impact of IDH1 expression on the progression and prognosis of breast cancer was evaluated using immunohistochemistry assay (IHC) of the corresponding tumor-adjacent normal, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissues from 309 patients with breast ductal carcinoma. The relationship between microRNA (miRNA) and IDH1 were examined by a bioinformatics approach, western blot and reporter assay. The biological functions of IDH1 were examined in breast cancer cells with IDH1 knockdown, including proliferation, migration and invasion. Results: The present findings revealed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of IDH1 were both significantly lower in breast cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. A low expression level of IDH1 in breast cancer significantly correlated with advanced stage (p = 0.012), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.018), and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.30; p = 0.02). Furthermore, oncogenic miR-32 and miR-92b were identified to suppress IDH1 expression, leading to the inhibition of cell migration and invasion. We further explored whether reduced expression of IDH1 significantly increases snail expression by activating HIFα (hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha) and NFΚB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the combination of low IDH1 and high snail expression could be an independent risk factor for shorter DSS (AHR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.32-4.16; p = 0.004) and shorter disease-free survival (AHR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.39-4.50; p = 0.002) in patients with breast cancer.

The principal effects were local tissue swelling and pain in 173 patients (94.5%), followed by clinically suspected wound infection in 148 (80.9%), skin necrosis in 120 (65.6%), necrotizing soft tissue infection in 77 (42.1%), fever in 59 (32.2%), and gastrointestinal effects in 53 (29%). The median total dose of specific antivenom needed to treat N. atra envenoming was 10 vials. In the envenomed patients, debridement was required in 74 patients (42.8%), fasciotomy/fasciectomy in 46 (26.6%), and finger or toe amputation in seven (4%). The first operation was performed at a median of 3.5 days after the bite. Discussion and conclusions: Based on these typical manifestations, clinical diagnosis of N. atra snakebites may be feasible and practical. In contrast to other snakes of Elapidae family, N. atra bite did not cause serious neurological effects. Early surgical consultation should be obtained because half of the patients underwent surgery due to infectious complications. Acute compartment syndrome was the surgical indication in rare cases; however, overestimation of the incidence may have occurred. This syndrome should be confirmed by serial intracompartmental pressure monitoring instead of only physical examination, and a sufficient dose of antivenom should be given prior to surgical decompression. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",antivenom; envenomation; Naja atra; necrosis; necrotizing soft tissue infection,herbaceous agent; snake venom antiserum; snake venom; venom antiserum; acute disease; adult; allergic reaction; amputation; Article; asymptomatic disease; blister; clinical feature; compartment syndrome; debridement; diarrhea; edema; Enterococcus; fasciotomy; female; fever; finger amputation; human; infectious complication; lymphadenitis; lymphangitis; major clinical study; male; Morganella morganii; multicenter study; Naja atra; nausea; outcome assessment; pain; paresthesia; partial ptosis; ptosis; retrospective study; rhabdomyolysis; skin necrosis; skin sensitivity; snakebite; soft tissue infection; symptomatology; Taiwan; toe amputation; vomiting; weakness; wound infection; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; middle aged; Naja naja; snakebite; Animals; Antivenins; Elapid Venoms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Naja naja; Retrospective Studies; Snake Bites; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85028541998

These important issues prompted us to study caffeine extraction from both the raw and roasted coffee beans of 3 types at different temperatures. A hemispheric model is developed to simulate the extraction process of the caffeine from the coffee beans of hemisphere is proposed. The experimental data are in good agreement with the predicted model. The effective diffusivities of caffeine in both the raw and roasted beans increase with temperature in all 3 types. An incubation period, decreasing with increasing temperature, is observed in all samples studied. Caffeine extraction in roasted beans is more rapid than that for the raw beans and the time difference is significant at low temperatures. In both the raw and roasted samples, caffeine diffusion in the raw beans and the incubation behavior are thermally activated processes. Single activation energies are obtained for diffusion within the extraction temperature range for all beans tested with the exception of one type of the coffee beans, Mandheling, which exhibits 2 activation energies in raw samples. The surface energies of the epidermis of the raw beans and roasted beans obtained from the contact angle measurements are used to interpret the difference of incubation periods. Practical Application: This study has a potential application to the decaffeinated coffee industry.Caffeine affects human physiological health and behavior so that caffeine extraction from coffee beans of different types at different temperatures is important for product refining and customers. ? 2018 Institute of Food Technologists?",coffee; extraction; modeling,caffeine; plant extract; chemistry; Coffea; coffee; cooking; food handling; heat; human; procedures; temperature; Caffeine; Coffea; Coffee; Cooking; Food Handling; Hot Temperature; Humans; Plant Extracts; Temperature,2-s2.0-85044384417

The aim of this study is to elucidate the relationship between EC miR-10a and atherosclerosis and develop a hemodynamics-based strategy for atherosclerosis treatment. Methods: A combination of in vitro flow system and in vivo experimental animals was used to examine the functional roles of EC miR-10a and its clinical applications in atherosclerosis. Results: En face staining showed that EC miR-10a is down-regulated in the inner curvature (OS region) of aortic arch in rats. Co-administration with retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα)- and retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα)-specific agonists rescued EC miR-10a expression in this OS region. These effects of OS and RARα/RXRα-specific agonists on EC miR-10a expression were confirmed by the in vitro flow system, and were modulated by the RARα-histone deacetylases complex, with the consequent modulation in the downstream GATA6/vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 signaling cascade. Animal studies showed that miR-10a levels are decreased in both aortic endothelium of atherosclerotic lesions and blood plasma from apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE?/?) mice. In vivo induction of EC miR-10a by administration of RARα/RXRα-specific agonists protects ApoE?/? mice from atherosclerosis through inhibition of GATA6/VCAM-1 signaling and inflammatory cell infiltration. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that down-regulation of miR-10a in aortic endothelium and blood serum is associated with atherosclerosis, and miR-10a has potential to be developed as diagnostic molecule for atherosclerosis. Moreover, EC miR-10a induction by RARα/RXRα-specific agonists is a potential hemodynamics-based strategy for atherosclerosis treatment. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Atherosclerosis; Endothelial cell; MicroRNA; Retinoic acid receptor; Shear stress,"4 [(5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 5,5,8,8 tetramethyl 2 naphthyl)carboxamido]benzoic acid; apolipoprotein E; cd 3254; dimethyl sulfoxide; histone deacetylase; microRNA; microRNA 10a; protein inhibitor; retinoic acid receptor alpha; retinoid X receptor alpha; retinoid X receptor alpha agonist; transcription factor GATA 6; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; 4 [(5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 5,5,8,8 tetramethyl 2 naphthyl)carboxamido]benzoic acid; benzoic acid; CD 3254; coumaric acid; Gata6 protein, mouse; microRNA; MIRN10 microRNA, human; MIRN10 microRNA, mouse; MIRN10 microRNA, rat; RARA protein, human; Rara protein, mouse; Rara protein, rat; retinoic acid receptor alpha; retinoid X receptor alpha; tetralin derivative; transcription factor GATA 6; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aortic arch; aortic endothelium; Article; atherogenesis; blood chemistry; blood vessel wall; cell infiltration; chromatin immunoprecipitation; complex formation; down regulation; experimental atherosclerosis; gene expression; gene induction; in situ hybridization; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammatory cell; leukocyte adherence; mouse; nonhuman; plasma; priority journal; rat; shear stress; signal transduction; therapy effect; upregulation; vascular endothelial cell; Western diet; agonists; animal; aorta; aortic disease; apolipoprotein E knockout mouse; atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaque; blood flow; cell culture; disease model; drug effect; genetics; hemodynamics; human; mechanical stress; mechanotransduction; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; Animals; Aorta; Aortic Diseases; Atherosclerosis; Benzoates; Cells, Cultured; Coumaric Acids; Disease Models, Animal; GATA6 Transcription Factor; Hemodynamics; Humans; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Mice, Knockout, ApoE; MicroRNAs; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Rats; Regional Blood Flow; Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha; Retinoid X Receptor alpha; Stress, Mechanical; Tetrahydronaphthalenes; Up-Regulation; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1",2-s2.0-85042224951

This enzyme generates proton gradient between cytosol and vacuolar lumen by hydrolysis of a metabolic byproduct, pyrophosphate (PPi). The regulation of V-PPase at protein level has drawn attentions of many workers for decades, but its mechanism is still unclear. In this work, we show that AVP1, the V-PPase from Arabidopsis thaliana, is a target protein for regulatory 14-3-3 proteins at the vacuolar membrane, and all twelve 14-3-3 isoforms were analyzed for their association with AVP1. In the presence of 14-3-3ν, -?, -ο, and -ι, both enzymatic activities and its associated proton pumping of AVP1 were increased. Among these 14-3-3 proteins, 14-3-3?? shows the highest stimulation on coupling efficiency. Furthermore, 14-3-3ν, -?, -ο, and -ι exerted protection of AVP1 against the inhibition of suicidal substrate PPi at high concentration. Moreover, the thermal profile revealed the presence of 14-3-3ο improves the structural stability of AVP1 against high temperature deterioration. Additionally, the 14-3-3 proteins mitigate the inhibition of Na+ to AVP1. Besides, the binding sites/motifs of AVP1 were identified for each 14-3-3 protein. Taken together, a working model was proposed to elucidate the association of 14-3-3 proteins with AVP1 for stimulation of its enzymatic activity. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",14-3-3 Proteins; AVP1; H+-pyrophosphatase; Proton translocation,"inorganic pyrophosphatase; protein 14 3 3; sodium ion; Arabidopsis protein; AVP1 protein, Arabidopsis; inorganic pyrophosphatase; protein 14 3 3; sodium; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; binding site; concentration (parameters); controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme stability; high temperature; inhibition kinetics; low temperature; nonhuman; protein hydrolysis; protein motif; protein protein interaction; regulatory mechanism; structure analysis; suicide substrate; thermal analysis; tonoplast; Arabidopsis; genetics; heat; metabolism; 14-3-3 Proteins; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Hot Temperature; Inorganic Pyrophosphatase; Sodium",2-s2.0-85042075681

This first qualitative study examines attitudes towards PGT for ASD among Taiwanese parents of children with ASD – an elevated risk group for having another affected child, and one that is mostly likely to be impacted by PGT for ASD. Methods: We conducted in-depth, face-to-face, individual, semi-structured interviews with 39 parents of children with ASD from various ASD organizations in Taiwan. Results: Most parents favored PGT for ASD mainly for terminating the affected pregnancy and receiving early intervention and treatment. Less than one-third of participants was against PGT for ASD due to perceived no value for this testing, contradiction with religion and/or personal beliefs, doubt of the test's accuracy, or concerns about the negative consequences of the testing. Conclusion: The majority of Taiwanese parents of children with ASD in this study supported PGT for ASD. Guidelines and regulations should be developed to regulate the provision and quality of this testing.

We examined the effect of a timely thrombectomy approach on vascular access outcomes for dialysis. Methods: A before-and-after study was conducted with patients on hemodialysis who had undergone endovascular thrombectomy. A timely thrombectomy initiative (ie, salvage within 24 hours of thrombosis diagnosis) was started in July 2015 at our institution. Data about thrombectomy procedures, performed within 1 year before and after the initiative was introduced, were abstracted from an electronic database. Immediate outcomes and patency outcomes were compared between the preinitiative (control) and postinitiative (intervention) groups. Results: During the study period, 329 patients were enrolled, including 165 cases before and 164 cases after the initiative. The intervention group had more thrombectomy procedures performed within 24 hours (93% vs 55%; P <.01) and within 48 hours (97% vs 79%; P <.01) than the control group. No between-group differences in procedural success or clinical success rates were found. At 3 months, the intervention group had a higher postintervention primary patency rate than the control group, although this did not reach statistical significance (58% vs 48%; P =.06). After stratification into native or graft accesses, the patency benefit was observed in the native access group (68% vs 50%; P =.03) but not in the graft access group (50% vs 46%; P =.65). After adjusting for potential confounders, timely thrombectomy remained an independent predictor of postintervention primary patency (hazard ratio, 0.449; 95% confidence interval, 0.224-0.900; P =.02) for native dialysis accesses. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a timely thrombectomy approach, in which salvage is attempted within 24 hours of thrombosis diagnosis, improves postintervention primary patency of native but not graft accesses for dialysis. ? 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery",,"acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antithrombocytic agent; clopidogrel; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; aged; arterial embolization; arteriovenous fistula; Article; blood vessel rupture; case control study; controlled study; female; graft patency; hemodialysis; human; major clinical study; male; percutaneous thrombectomy; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; postoperative complication; priority journal; retrospective study; thrombosis; vascular access; arteriovenous shunt; blood vessel transplantation; chi square distribution; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; factual database; graft occlusion; health care quality; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; procedures; program evaluation; proportional hazards model; risk factor; salvage therapy; standards; thrombectomy; thrombosis; time factor; time to treatment; total quality management; treatment outcome; vascular patency; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Chi-Square Distribution; Databases, Factual; Female; Graft Occlusion, Vascular; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Program Evaluation; Proportional Hazards Models; Quality Improvement; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Renal Dialysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Salvage Therapy; Thrombectomy; Thrombosis; Time Factors; Time-to-Treatment; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Patency",2-s2.0-85034983050

The 2 enzymes have been found to interact with Myb transcription factors in the parasite which regulate the iron induced expression of ap65-1 gene leading to cytoadherence of the parasite to human vaginal epithelial cells to cause the disease trichomoniasis.

However, the correlation between the variance in the periodontal microbiome and the prevalence and severity of periodontitis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the subgingival microbiota in Taiwanese individuals with severe chronic periodontitis (SP). Methods: The composition of the subgingival microbiota in healthy and diseased individuals was compared using a 16S rRNA metagenomic approach and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A total of 20 samples, including 10 from healthy individuals and 10 from SP patients, were analyzed. Results: We found high microbial diversity, with an average of 774 classified phylotypes per sample and a total of six bacterial phyla across all samples. Cluster analysis by principal component analysis and heat map showed that the bacterial communities were different in the two groups. Streptococcus dominated across all the healthy samples, whereas Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Treponema were highly abundant across all diseased samples. At least 13 bacterial genera were conserved among all the samples. Only eight genera, including Lautropia, Parvimonas, Actinomyces, Capnocytophaga, Paludibacter, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Corynebacterium, were significantly enriched in the healthy group, and six genera, including Porphyromonas, Treponema, Tannerella, Aggregatibacter, Peptostreptococcus, and Filifactor, were significantly enriched in the diseased group.

These health concerns are related to the rapid growth of the aging population and of the fast-paced industrialized society. Nevertheless, there is little knowledge about food preferences and psychological well-being measurements in contemporary China. Applying the 2011 China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) with a cross-sectional study design (n = 7970), we conducted multinomial logistic regression models to investigate the associations of food preferences, including fast food, salty snacks, fruits, vegetables, and sweetened beverages, with psychological well-being among Chinese middle-aged and older adults (age ? 45). Food preferences are mostly associated with psychological well-being (p < 0.05). However, respondents’ preferences regarding fast food, salty snacks, and sweetened beverages are associated not only with poorer psychological health status, but also with positive psychological well-being. We speculate that Chinese older adults may consume Westernized fast food and salty snacks as pleasure to the palate due to the recent Westernization in modern China.

TRAIL pDNA was encapsulated in a pH stimuli-responsive calcium phosphate (CaP) core, and protamine was added to facilitate nuclear delivery of pDNA. In addition, intracellular release of Ca2+ from the CaP core overcame TRAIL resistance by calcium influx-dependent DR5 up-regulation. TRAIL expression also attenuated fibrosis in liver tissues surrounding HCCs by reverting activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to a quiescent state or by directly inducing apoptosis in activated HSCs.

The objective of the study was to investigate anticipatory (APA) and compensatory (CPA) postural adjustments when pushing an object (that induces self-initiated perturbation) and standing on a sliding board (that induces translational perturbation). Thirteen healthy young participants were instructed to push a handle with both hands while standing on a sliding board that was either free to move in the anterior–posterior direction or stationary. Electromyographic activity (EMG)?of trunk and lower extremity muscles, center of pressure (COP) displacements, and the forces exerted by the hand were recorded and analyzed during the APA and CPA phases. When the sliding board was free to move during pushing (translation perturbation), onsets of activity of ventral leg muscles and COP displacement were delayed as compared to pushing when standing on a stationary board. Moreover, magnitudes of shank muscle activity and the COP displacement were decreased. When pushing heavier weight, magnitudes of muscle activity, COP displacement, and pushing force increased. The magnitude of activity of the shank muscles during the APA and CPA phases in conditions with translational perturbation varied with the magnitude of the pushing weight. The outcome of the study suggests that the central nervous system prioritizes the pushing task while attenuates the source of additional perturbation induced by translation perturbation. These results could be used in the development of balance re-training paradigms involving pushing weight while standing on a sliding surface. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Dual task; Muscle activity; Postural control strategy; Pushing; Translation perturbation,"adult; Article; biceps femoris muscle; biomechanics; body position; center of pressure displacement; central nervous system; comparative study; controlled study; electromyogram; electromyography; female; force; gastrocnemius muscle; hand; human; lateral malleolus; leg muscle; lower limb; male; muscle contraction; musculoskeletal system parameters; normal human; object manipulation; priority journal; pushing an object; rectus femoris muscle; skeletal muscle; sliding board; standing; vertical posture; voluntary movement; biomechanics; body equilibrium; body position; physiology; psychomotor performance; young adult; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Postural Balance; Posture; Psychomotor Performance; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85040084322

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the gradual loss of neural tissue in the central nervous system. Clearly, early diagnosis of the onset of neurodegeneration is vital and beneficial. Current diagnostic methods rely heavily on symptoms or autopsy results, thus overlooking early diagnosis, the only opportunity for amelioration. However, appropriately selected and used biomarker diagnostics provide a solution.

A Tauc plot suggested a wide intrinsic optical band gap of 2.4 eV for a thin film of PbI 2 , while X-ray diffraction revealed that the spin-coated PbI 2 thin film had a hexagonal crystalline structure with preferable orientation along the (001) plane. The effect of the light intensity on the values of V oc and J sc was studied to investigate the charge recombination mechanism of fabricated devices. An efficient bifacial solar cell was prepared featuring a thin Ag film sandwiched between BCP and MoO 3 layers as a transparent rear electrode. The whole device featuring the BCP/Ag/MoO 3 electrode exhibited a maximum transmittance of approximately 60% in the visible region, less than 15% in the UV region, and less than 25% in the NIR region. A power conversion efficiency of 2.19% was achieved for a device featuring an opaque electrode (Ca/Al), while the corresponding device featuring the transparent electrode (BCP/Ag/MoO 3 ) provided values of 0.75% and 0.67% when illuminated from the front and rear, respectively. Thus, wide band gap metal halide materials potentially open up a new path for fabricating efficient and transparent photovoltaic devices having applications as building-integrated smart windows.

However, new generation assays like point-of-care or mobile diagnostics face a myriad of challenges in detecting proteins from whole blood. In this research, we have designed, fabricated, and characterized a portable biomedical sensor for the detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) directly from whole blood, without sample pretreatments. The sensing methodology is based on an extended gate electrical double layer (EDL) gated field effect transistor (FET) biosensor that can offer very high sensitivity, a wide dynamic range, and high selectivity to target analyte. The sensing methodology is not impeded by electrostatic screening and can be applied to all types of FET sensors. A portable biomedical system is designed to carry out the diagnostic assay in a very simple and rapid manner, that allows the user to screen for target protein from a single drop of blood, in 5 min.

Since EGFR antagonists seem ineffective in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we aim to study the role of ETV6 in the development of drug resistance. Methods: Etv6 target gene was validated by ChIP and promoter reporter assays. Correlation of ETV6 and TWIST1 was analyzed in human clinical datasets and tissue samples. Migration, invasion, and metastasis assays were used to measure the cellular responses after perturbation of ETV6 -TWIST1 axis. Proliferation and tumor growth in xenograft model were performed to evaluate the drug sensitivities of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Results: ETV6 inhibits TWIST1 expression and disruption of ETV6 promotes TWIST1-dependent malignant phenotypes. Importantly, ETV6 is required to the anti-proliferation effects of EGFR-TKIs, partly due to the inhibitory function of ETV6 on TWIST1. We also found that EGFR-RAS signaling is tightly controlled by ETV6, supporting its role in TKI sensitivity. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that disruption of ETV6 contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance, which is likely due to derepression of TWIST1 and activation of EGFR-RAS signaling. Our results implicate ETV6 as a potential marker for predicting efficacy of an EGFR-targeted anticancer approach. Combination treatment of TWIST1 inhibitors could sensitize the anti-proliferation effects of EGFR-TKIs. ? 2018 The Author(s).",EGFR; ETV6; TKI; TWIST1,"epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; Ras protein; transcription factor ETV6; Twist related protein 1; epidermal growth factor receptor; protein kinase inhibitor; repressor protein; transcription factor Ets; transcription factor ETV6; Twist related protein 1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer growth; cancer resistance; cancer tissue; cell invasion assay; cell migration assay; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; drug sensitivity; gene disruption; gene function; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; promoter region; prostate cancer; protein analysis; protein expression; protein induction; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; tumor xenograft; animal; drug effect; drug resistance; genetics; metabolism; nude mouse; prostate tumor; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; ErbB Receptors; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Prostatic Neoplasms; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets; Repressor Proteins; Signal Transduction; Twist-Related Protein 1",2-s2.0-85042161048

A self-report, web-based questionnaire was used to evaluate the effects of moxa smoke on acupuncturists. Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between physical symptoms and possible correlative factors. A total of 858 questionnaires were analyzed. The data showed that 42.42% of acupuncturists had been exposed to moxa smoke for 5-10 years. The most frequent symptom was tearing (32.98%) and the least frequent symptom was asthma (5.24%). Logistic regression analysis showed that female acupuncturists were slightly more susceptible to cough and tearing than males (cough: OR: 1.583, 95% CI: 1.079, 2.321, P=0.019; tearing: OR: 1.519, 95% CI: 1.094, 2.108, P=0.013).

The only association between prevalence of symptoms and tobacco use and SHS exposure was that smokers had a lower occurrence of phlegm in the throat (OR: 0.579, 95% CI: 0.392, 0.856, P=0.006). Shortness of breath was less frequent in participants exposed to moxa smoke for more than 5 years (5-10 years: OR: 0.400, 95% CI: 0.204, 0.785, P=0.008; 11-20 years: OR: 0.392, 95% CI: 0.178, 0.864, P=0.02), but a slightly higher incidence of eye itchiness was found in those with over 20 years of moxa exposure (OR: 4.200, 95% CI: 1.344, 3.128, P=0.014). The most frequent symptom of moxa smoke exposure in acupuncturists was tearing. The association of symptoms with age and duration of exposure to moxa smoke were rather complicated; hence, care should be taken in drawing conclusions about the safety of moxa smoke based solely on its potentially harmful ingredients. ? 2018 JTCM.

Elevated keratin-8 (KRT8) protein expression is an established diagnostic cancer biomarker in several epithelial cancers (but not ATC). Several keratins, including KRT8, have been suggested to have a role in cell biology beyond that of structural cytoskeletal proteins. Here, we provide evidence that KRT8 plays a direct role in the growth of ATCs. Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of >5000 patients demonstrates that KRT8 mutation and copy number amplification are frequently evident in epithelial-derived cancers. Carcinomas arising from diverse tissues exhibit KRT8 mRNA and protein overexpression when compared to normal tissue levels. Similarly, in a panel of patient-derived ATC cell lines and patient tumors, KRT8 expression shows a similar pattern. sh-RNA-mediated KRT8 knockdown in these cell lines increases apoptosis, whereas forced overexpression of KRT8 confers resistance to apoptosis under peroxide-induced cell stress conditions. We further show that KRT8 protein binds to annexin A2, a protein known to mediate apoptosis as well as the redox pathway. ? 2018 by the authors.

In this study, a facile one-step strategy based on a similar concept was first developed for the bioprosthesis of a uniform core-shell gold nanorod/serum albumin (NR@SA) nanoplatform. The resultant albumin shell preserved half of its native form, leading to decreased free SA adsorption, and even these adsorbed proteins were close to their native form. This strategy efficiently prevents subsequent adsorption cascades of other proteins and has a remarkable influence on cellular uptake (of macrophages and tumor cells).

Recently, a new formulation of rose bengal (RB) as an intralesional injection has completed clinical trials phase II for PDT treatment of melanoma cancer. However, the inherent unfavorable pharmacological properties of RB hindered its extensive clinical development. With the aim to identify new RB derivatives (RBDs) with enhanced photodynamic and sonodynamic anticancer efficiency, a series of amphiphilic RBDs have been designed, synthesized and biological characterized. Among them, RBD4 significantly improved cellular uptake and enhanced intracellular ROS generation efficiency upon light and ultrasound irradiation, resulting in dramatically improved anticancer potency. Notably, RBD4 has a relative potency similar to sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS), indicating its further potential application for SPDT. ? 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Amphiphilicity; RB derivatives; Sensitizers; Sono-photodynamic therapy,"antineoplastic agent; photosensitizing agent; porphyrin derivative; reactive oxygen metabolite; rose bengal; rose bengal derivative; sinoporphyrin sodium; sodium derivative; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; rose bengal; animal cell; antineoplastic activity; Article; cellular distribution; comparative study; concentration response; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug design; drug potency; drug synthesis; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; IC50; in vitro study; lipophilicity; mouse; nonhuman; photochemistry; photodynamic therapy; quantum yield; ultrasound therapy; animal; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemical phenomena; chemical structure; chemistry; dose response; drug effects; drug screening; Hep-G2 cell line; metabolism; photochemotherapy; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell culture; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Mice; Molecular Structure; Photochemotherapy; Reactive Oxygen Species; Rose Bengal; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-85040046172

We studied functionalized ultrasmall GNPs (1.8 nm diameter) coated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and conjugated with cyclic RGDfK (2.6 nm hydrodynamic diameter) for targeting of alpha(v) beta(3) integrin (αvβ3) in the murine ALTS1C1 glioma cell line. Materials and methods: We investigated the uptake, toxicity and radiosensitivity of GNP–PEG–cRGDfKs in ALTS1C1 cells exposed to protons, kilovoltage photons and megavoltage photons. The in vitro uptake and toxicity of GNPs in the hepatocytes and Kupffer cells were assessed for murine AML12 hepatocyte and RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines. The in vivo biodistribution of GNPs in the ALTS1C1 tumor model was tested using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results: Results indicated GNPs accumulated in the cytoplasm with negligible toxicity for a moderate concentration of GNPs. Observed sensitizer enhancement ratios and dose enhancement factors are 1.21–1.66 and 1.14–1.33, respectively, for all radiations. Conclusion: Ultrasmall GNP–PEG–cRGD can be considered as a radiosensitizer. For radiotherapy applications, the delivery method should be developed to increase the GNP uptake in the tumor and decrease the uptakes in undesirable organs. ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",ALTS1C1; cyclic RGD; GNP; proton therapy; radiosensitization,"beta3 integrin; cyclopeptide; gold nanoparticle; macrogol; radiosensitizing agent; arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid; gold; macrogol; metal nanoparticle; oligopeptide; peptide; proton; radiosensitizing agent; vitronectin receptor; AML12 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cell viability; colony formation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; dosimetry; glioma; immunohistochemistry; Kupffer cell; male; mass spectrometry; megavoltage radiation; mouse; nonhuman; photon therapy; priority journal; proton therapy; radiation exposure; radiosensitization; radiotherapy dosage; RAW 264.7 cell line; transmission electron microscopy; animal; brain tumor; C57BL mouse; chemistry; endocytosis; glioma; metabolism; pathology; photon; radiation tolerance; radiometry; tumor cell line; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Endocytosis; Glioma; Gold; Integrin alphaVbeta3; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Oligopeptides; Peptides; Photons; Polyethylene Glycols; Protons; Radiation Tolerance; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents; Radiometry; RAW 264.7 Cells",2-s2.0-85044284631

S100A1 is a significant mediator during inflammation when Ca2+ binds to its EF-hand motifs. Receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) correspond to 5 domains: The cytoplasmic, transmembrane, C2, C1, and V domains. The V domain of RAGE is one of the most important target proteins for S100A1. It binds to the hydrophobic surface and triggers signaling transduction cascades that induce cell growth, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize the interaction between S100A1 and the RAGE V domain. We found that S100B could interact with S100A1 via NMR 1H-15N HSQC titrations. We used the HADDOCK program to generate the following two binary complexes based on the NMR titration results: S100A1-RAGE V domain and S100A1- S100B. After overlapping these two complex structures, we found that S100B plays a crucial role in blocking the interaction site between RAGE V domain and S100A1.

We studied anticipatory and compensatory postural adjustments people use to maintain balance while standing on an unstable surface and performing voluntary arm movements. Nine healthy participants stood on a sliding board (that was either locked and as such motionless or unlocked and as such free to move in the anterior-posterior direction) and performed fast bilateral arms flexion. Arm acceleration, bilateral electromyographic activity (EMG) of the trunk and lower extremity muscles and center of pressure (COP) displacements were recorded and analyzed within the intervals typical for the anticipatory (APAs) and compensatory (CPAs) postural adjustments. Peaks of acceleration of the arm movements were not different between the locked and unlocked conditions. Larger EMG integrals were seen in the muscles of the lower extremity in both APAs and CPAs when standing on the unlocked sliding board. No significant difference was observed in the trunk muscles. Larger maximum COP displacement was seen when participants stood on the locked board. The results demonstrated that when standing on a free to move sliding board and performing bilateral arm flexion, the central nervous system (CNS) does not slow down the arm movements; instead it modifies activation of the lower extremity muscles. The observed differences in APAs and CPAs between the locked and unlocked conditions suggest that the CNS employs similar strategy while controlling the focal part of the task and adjusts the activity of muscles that are close to the source of instability to control postural task. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Anticipatory; Body instability; Compensatory; Postural control; Sliding board,"adult; anticipatory postural adjustment; arm acceleration; arm movement; Article; body equilibrium; center of pressure displacement; central nervous system function; compensatory postural adjustment; controlled study; electromyography; female; human; human experiment; kinematics; leg muscle; male; mechanics; muscle function; musculoskeletal system parameters; normal human; priority journal; sliding board; standing; task performance; trunk; anticipation; biomechanics; body position; physiology; psychomotor performance; skeletal muscle; Adult; Anticipation, Psychological; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Postural Balance; Posture; Psychomotor Performance",2-s2.0-85040373853

The two proteins have an identical amino acid sequence, except that HDAg-L has a 19-amino-acid extension at the C terminus. The domain spanning amino acid residues 198-210 of the HDAg-L (HDAg-L(198-210)) contains a nuclear export signal (NES), which is important for the nuclear export of HDV ribonucleoprotein to the cytoplasm. In this study, we established a cell permeable TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein using an E. coli protein expression system, to determine its function during HDV infection. The cytotoxicity of the TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein was investigated using an MTT assay, while a GST pull-down assay revealed that the TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein interfered with the interaction between HDAg-L and clathrin heavy chain (CHC). In addition, the cellular distribution of HDAg-L, in the presence of HBsAg, was observed by immunofluorescence staining and the TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein was found to impede the nuclear export of HDAg-L.

However, the correlation between EpCAM and endometrial carcinoma (EC) is not clear. Methods: This study investigated the association between EpCAM and EC. Immunohistochemistry staining and bioinformatics analysis disclosed the clinical importance of low EpCAM expression. The migratory ability of cells expressing low EpCAM levels was studied in transwell invasion assays in vitro and an orthotopic intra-uterine tumor injection model in vivo. The Connectivity MAP was used to identify drugs that effectively inhibit cells with low EpCAM expression. Results: According to immunohistochemistry analysis results, low EpCAM expression was associated with an advanced stage and lymph node metastasis in patients with endometrioid EC, and high EpCAM expression favored survival. EpCAM silencing promoted cell invasion, and EpCAM re-expression in EpCAM-silenced EC cells attenuated their invasiveness. EpCAM suppression in an orthotopic uterine implantation model promoted the lymph node metastasis of EC cells. According to quantitative PCR and promoter reporter analyses, estrogen receptor alpha signaling regulated EpCAM expression by enhancing its promoter activity. As shown in the Connectivity MAP analysis, transamin inhibited the invasiveness of EpCAM-silenced EC cells. Conclusions: The loss of EpCAM may increase the malignancy of EC, and these findings provide new insights into the prognostic role of EpCAM in patients with EC. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Endometrial cancer; EpCAM; ERα; Poor prognosis; Tumor metastasis,"epithelial cell adhesion molecule; estrogen receptor alpha; tranexamic acid; uvomorulin; antifibrinolytic agent; EPCAM protein, human; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; estrogen receptor alpha; tranexamic acid; advanced cancer; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; disease free survival; down regulation; endometrium carcinoma; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene expression regulation; gene silencing; HEC-1-A cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; Ishikawa cell line; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; molecular pathology; mouse; nonhuman; overall survival; priority journal; promoter region; protein function; protein synthesis inhibition; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; RL95-2 cell line; signal transduction; tumor growth; upregulation; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cancer transplantation; disease exacerbation; endometrium tumor; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; nude mouse; physiology; procedures; prognosis; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; xenograft; Animals; Antifibrinolytic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Progression; Down-Regulation; Endometrial Neoplasms; Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Silencing; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Transplantation; Prognosis; Signal Transduction; Tranexamic Acid; Transplantation, Heterologous",2-s2.0-85036547478

Methods: We studied 31 patients with repaired TOF (M/F: 22/9, age: 16.1 ± 6.1 yrs) who had history of cardiac surgery with mean follow-up duration of 12.8 years, and 32 age- and sex-matched normal individuals (M/F: 23/9, age: 16.6 ± 5.1 yrs). All subjects underwent speckle tracking and 3D echocardiography, electrocardiogram, treadmill, and blood sampling for measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Results: Compared to the control group, the TOF group had higher BNP level (31.8 ± 21.4 vs 14.1 ± 12.4 pg/ml, p < 0.01), lower peak oxygen consumption (8.4 ± 1.7 vs 9.9 ± 1.6 ml/kg/min, p < 0.05), and longer QRS duration (126 ± 30 vs 82 ± 9 ms, p < 0.01). Patients with repaired TOF had significantly impaired right ventricle (RV) global and all six regional longitudinal strain and strain rate than normal controls. Left ventricle (LV) global and mainly apical regional longitudinal strain and strain rate were reduced in patients with repaired TOF. There was a significant correlation of global longitudinal strain (r = 0.456, p = 0.01) and global time to peak longitudinal strain (r = 0.484, p < 0.01) between LV and RV in patients with repaired TOF. In terms of 3D echo cardiographic volume data, patients with repaired TOF had lower LV stroke volume index (p < 0.05), but higher RV end diastolic volume index (p < 0.01), RV end systolic volume index (p < 0.01), RV stroke volume index (p < 0.01), and pulmonary regurgitation fraction (p < 0.01) than normal controls. Conclusion: Our results suggest asymptomatic adolescents with repaired TOF had abnormal biventricular myocardial performance, as demonstrated by combined 2D speckle-tracking and 3D echocardiography.

The European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q) is a comprehensive and theory-based measure that captures multiple self-perceived competencies of health literacy and covers a diverse range of health contexts. However, there is no psychometric evidence on the HLS-EU-Q in the stroke population. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the HLS-EU-Q in patients with stroke using Rasch analysis. Methods: We compared the model deviance among the one-domain, three-domain, four-domain, and 12-domain structures using likelihood ratio tests to determine the dimensionality of the HLS-EU-Q. Thereafter, we examined the unidimensionality of each domain, local independence, item fit, response categories, and differential item functioning (DIF) for the best fitting structure. Results: A total of 311 patients with stroke participated in this study. Rasch analysis revealed that the 12-domain HLS-EU-Q demonstrated the best data–model fit. The original 4-point scales showed disordering, which can be corrected by rescaling them as 3-point scales with the two middle categories collapsed. All 47 items in the rescaled HLS-EU-Q fit the 12-domain Rasch model, demonstrated local independence, assessed the 12 unidimensional domains respectively, and had invariant difficulties between different age or education groups of the patients with stroke. Conclusion: We recommend using the 12-domain scores of the rescaled HLS-EU-Q to comprehensively and accurately capture the competencies to access, understand, appraise, and apply health information within the three health contexts of healthcare, disease prevention, and health promotion for patients with stroke. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Article; brain ischemia; education; European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire; female; health care access; health literacy; health promotion; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; Mini Mental State Examination; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; Rasch analysis; stroke patient; aged; attitude to health; cerebrovascular accident; chronic disease; clinical trial; health literacy; interpersonal communication; middle aged; multicenter study; patient education; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; self care; standards; teaching hospital; Aged; Chronic Disease; Communication; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Literacy; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Prospective Studies; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Self-Management; Stroke; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85023746197

However, the physiological role and regulation of GLUT10 in arteries remains unclear. To further understand its physiological roles in major arteries, we examined the regulatory mechanisms of GLUT10 in ASMCs and aortic tissues. Interestingly, we find that targeting of GLUT10 to mitochondria is increased in ASMCs under both stress and aging conditions, which enhances dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) uptake and maintains intracellular ascorbic acid (AA) levels. We further demonstrate that the targeting of GLUT10 to mitochondria is important to maintain redox homeostasis, mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial function in ASMCs. A missense mutation of GLUT10 (Glut10 G128E ) impairs mitochondrial targeting in ASMCs. Consequently, ASMCs isolated from Glut10 G128E mice exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, fragmented mitochondria and impaired mitochondrial function, as well as enhanced cell proliferation and migration. In vivo, mitochondrial structure is altered, and ROS levels are heightened in aortic tissues of Glut10 G128E mice. Furthermore, increased number and disorganization of ASMCs, along with progressive arterial wall remodeling were observed in aortic tissues of Glut10 G128E mice. These defects were coincident with elevated systolic blood pressure in aged Glut10 G128E animals. Our results describe a novel mechanism that GLUT10 targeting to mitochondria under stress and aging condition has a critical role in maintaining AA levels, redox homeostasis and mitochondrial structure and function in ASMCs, which is likely to contribute to the maintenance of healthy vascular tissue. ?

Herein, we have developed a fluorescence turn off-on fluorescence sensing platform by combining nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) with V 2 O 5 nanosheets for the sensitive and selective detection of cysteine in human serum samples. V 2 O 5 nanosheets with 2-4 layers are successfully synthesized via a simple and scalable liquid exfoliation method and then deposited with 2-8 nm of N-GQDs as the fluorescence turn off-on nanoprobe for effective detection of cysteine in human serum samples. The V 2 O 5 nanosheets serve as both fluorescence quencher and cysteine recognizer in the sensing platform. The fluorescence intensity of N-GQDs with quantum yield of 0.34 can be quenched after attachment onto V 2 O 5 nanosheets. The addition of cysteine triggers the reduction of V 2 O 5 to V 4+ as well as the release of N-GQDs within 4 min, resulting in the recovery of fluorescence intensity for the turn off-on detection of cysteine. The sensing platform exhibits a two-stage linear response to cysteine in the concentration range of 0.1-15 and 15-125 μM at pH 6.5, and the limit of detection is 50 nM. The fluorescence response of N-GQD@V 2 O 5 exhibits high selectivity toward cysteine over other 22 electrolytes and biomolecules. Moreover, this promising platform is successfully applied in detection of cysteine in human serum samples with excellent recovery of (95 ± 3.8) - (108 ± 2.4)%.

The remodeling and alterations of extracellular matrices (ECMs) and their composition is the critical step in atherogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of different ECM proteins on the regulation of mechanotransduction in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in response to OSS. Methods: Through the experiments ranging from in vitro cell culture studies on effects of OSS on molecular signaling to in vivo examinations on clinical specimens from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), we elucidated the roles of integrins and different ECMs, i.e., fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LM), in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor (TβR)-mediated Smad2 activation and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in ECs in response to OSS and hence atherogenesis. Results: OSS at 0.5±12 dynes/cm2 induces sustained increases in the association of types I and II TβRs with β1 and β3 integrins in ECs grown on FN, but it only transient increases in ECs grown on LM. OSS induces a sustained activation of Smad2 in ECs on FN, but only a transient activation of Smad2 in ECs on LM. OSS-activation of Smad2 in ECs on FN regulates downstream NF-κB signaling and pro-inflammatory gene expression through the activation of β1 integrin and its association with TβRs. In contrast, OSS induces transient activations of β1 and β3 integrins in ECs on LM, which associate with type I TβR to regulate Smad2 phosphorylation, resulting in transient induction of NF-κB and pro-inflammatory gene expression. In vivo investigations on diseased human coronary arteries from CAD patients revealed that Smad2 is highly activated in ECs of atherosclerotic lesions, which is accompanied by the concomitant increase of FN rather than LM in the EC layer and neointimal region of atherosclerotic lesions. Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of how OSS regulates Smad2 signaling and pro-inflammatory genes through the complex signaling networks of integrins, TβRs, and ECMs, thus illustrating the molecular basis of regional pro-inflammatory activation within disturbed flow regions in the arterial tree. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Endothelial cell; Extracellular matrix; Integrin; Shear stress; Transforming growth factor receptor,"beta1 integrin; beta3 integrin; fibronectin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; integrin; laminin; Smad2 protein; transforming growth factor beta receptor; transforming growth factor beta receptor 1; fibronectin; laminin; scleroprotein; Smad2 protein; SMAD2 protein, human; Article; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; blood flow; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell function; cell growth; controlled study; coronary artery disease; down regulation; extracellular matrix; gene expression; genetic transfection; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; intracellular signaling; mechanotransduction; oscillatory shear stress; priority journal; protein assembly; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis regulation; shear stress; vascular endothelial cell; biomechanics; endothelium cell; genetics; mechanical stress; mechanotransduction; metabolism; physiology; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cells, Cultured; Endothelial Cells; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Fibronectins; Humans; Laminin; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Smad2 Protein; Stress, Mechanical",2-s2.0-85040053979

Mutations in PNPase impair structured RNA transport into mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and disease. PNPase is a trimeric protein with a doughnut-shaped structure hosting a central channel for single-stranded RNA binding and degradation. Here, we show that the disease-linked human PNPase mutants, Q387R and E475G, form dimers, not trimers, and have significantly lower RNA binding and degradation activities compared to wild-type trimeric PNPase. Moreover, S1 domain-truncated PNPase binds single-stranded RNA but not the stem-loop signature motif of imported structured RNA, suggesting that the S1 domain is responsible for binding structured RNAs. We further determined the crystal structure of dimeric PNPase at a resolution of 2.8 ? and, combined with small-angle X-ray scattering, show that the RNA-binding K homology and S1 domains are relatively inaccessible in the dimeric assembly. Taken together, these results show that mutations at the interface of the trimeric PNPase tend to produce a dimeric protein with destructive RNA-binding surfaces, thus impairing both of its RNA import and degradation activities and leading to mitochondria disorders. ?

A detailed investigation of the sensing and selectivity characteristics of ISHEMT is carried out and a theoretical model is proposed for the illustration of the enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. The high field modulated ISHEMT sensor displays very high sensitivity, much beyond the ideal Nernstian slope, offering very low detection limit (10 ?10 M for Pb 2+ and 10? 11 M for Hg 2+ ). The sensing characteristics are not affected by the presence of interfering ions and the selective sensor response has been validated using fixed interference and separate solution methods. These sensor characteristics are superior than the traditional ISE or ISFET sensors, and at par with laboratory standard technologies like ICP-MS.

A well-known example is phase-change memory (PCM) that has much longer life expectancy and faster access performance than NAND flash. When NVRAM is considered as both main memory and storage in battery-powered embedded systems, existing page cache mechanisms have too many unnecessary data movements between main memory and storage. To tackle this issue, we propose the concept of “union page cache”, to jointly manage data of the page cache in both main memory and storage. To realize this concept, we design a partial page cache strategy that considers both main memory and storage as its management space. This strategy can eliminate unnecessary data movements between main memory and storage without sacrificing the data integrity of file systems. A series of experiments was conducted on an embedded platform. The results show that the proposed strategy can improve the file accessing performance up to 85.62% when PCM used as a case study.

There is little knowledge targeting Chinese older adults generally to investigate the associations between SHS exposure experiences during earlier life stages and health-related measurements. Using cross-sectional data from a nationally representative data set, the 2014 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (n = 4,414), multilevel logistic regression models with random effects for Chinese provinces were used for analyses. Two health-related measurements included self-reported health status and life satisfaction. All regression models included the same set of predictors and covariates with socioeconomic factors and basic biological information. Approximately 40% and 47% of older adults reported SHS exposure in childhood and in younger adulthood at home, respectively. Older adults with SHS exposure in childhood had lower odds of reporting better health status, compared with those who did not have such exposure (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.69, 95% CI [0.55, 0.86], p <.01). However, life satisfaction was not associated with any SHS exposure experiences. Policy makers and public health practitioners should continue to investigate the long-term effect of SHS exposure on human health, including older adults. Policy regarding SHS prevention should be enhanced. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",China; health status; life satisfaction; national smoking policy; secondhand smoking,,2-s2.0-85057260005

In this study, we combined high-speed camera imaging and live-cell microscopic imaging to observe the transient dynamics of droplets during ADV and to evaluate the mechanical force on cells. Methods: C6 glioma cells were co-incubated with DiI-labeled droplets (radius: 1.5, 2.25, and 3.0 μm). We used an acousto-optical system for high-speed bright-field (500 kfps) and fluorescence (40 kfps) microscopic imaging in order to visualize the dynamics of droplets under ultrasound excitation (frequency = 5 MHz, pressure = 5-8 MPa, cycle number = 3, pulse number = 1). Live-cell microscopic imaging was used to monitor the cell morphology, cell membrane permeabilization, and cell viability by membrane-anchored Lyn-yellow fluorescence protein, propidium Iodide staining, and calcein blue AM staining, respectively. Results: We discovered that the spatial distribution of ADV-induced bioeffects could be mapped to the physical dynamics of droplet vaporization. For droplets with a 1.5 μm radius, the distance threshold for ADV-induced cell death (5.5±1.9 μm) and reversible membrane permeabilization (11.3±3.5 μm) was well correlated with the distance of ADV-bubble pressing downward to the floor (5.7±1.3 μm) and maximum distance of droplet expansion (11.5±2.6 μm), respectively. These distances were enlarged by increasing the droplet sizes and insonation acoustic pressures. The live-cell imaging results show that ADV-bubbles can directly disrupt the cell membrane layer and induce intensive intracellular substance leakage. Further, the droplets shed the payload onto nearby cells during ADV, suggesting ADV could directly induce adjacent cell death by physical force and enhancement of chemotherapy to distant cells. Conclusion: This study provide new insights into the ADV-mediated physicochemical synergic effect for medical applications. ?

sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (“MISEV”) guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these “MISEV2014” guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points. ? 2018, ? 2018 The Author(s).

Obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and kidney disease are known to be associated with a high-fat diet (HFD). Obesity and associated conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), are currently a worldwide health problem. Few prospective pharmaceutical therapies that directly target NAFLD are available at present. A Traditional Chinese Medicine, ginseng-plus-Bai-Hu-Tang (GBHT), is widely used by diabetic patients to control glucose level or thirst. However, whether it has therapeutic effects on fat-induced hepatic steatosis and metabolic syndrome remains unclear. Methods: This study was conducted to examine the therapeutic effect of GBHT on fat-induced obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance in mice. Results: GBHT protected mice against HFD-induced body weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia compared with mice that were not treated. GBHT inhibited the expansion of adipose tissue and adipocyte hypertrophy. No ectopic fat deposition was found in the livers of HFD mice treated with GBHT. In addition, glucose intolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD mice was also improved by GBHT. Conclusion: GBHT prevents changes in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in a HFD mouse model. Our findings provide evidence for the traditional use of GBHT as therapy for the management of metabolic syndrome. ? 2018",diet-induced obesity; ginseng-plus-Bai-Hu-Tang; hepatic steatosis; insulin resistance; Panax ginseng,,2-s2.0-85056832608

In this paper, we developed a wearable device involving multiple leads that monitors cardiac electrical activity using very large-scale integration technology to facilitate long-term activity monitoring. In addition to using limb leads and augmented limb leads for monitoring heart activity, six unipolar chest leads were attached to six positive electrodes and placed on the surface of the chest to record electrical activity of different regions of the heart. The multiple leads lie perpendicular to the frontal plane and were integrated within a single circuit to reduce hardware costs and size of the device. The proposed architecture also allows users to switch between lossless and lossy compression to control the power consumption and bit compression ratio. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was verified by fabricating a chip using 0.18-μm CMOS technology. The proposed architecture core has an operating frequency of 41 MHz and a gate count of 4K. ? 2013 IEEE.",bit compression ratio; Electrocardiogram (ECG); lossless compression algorithm; lossy compression algorithm; multiple leads,Bioinformatics; Computer hardware; Diseases; Electric power utilization; Electrocardiography; Hardware; Monitoring; Switches; Wearable technology; Biomedical monitoring; Compression algorithms; Lossless compression algorithm; Lossy compressions; Multiple leads; Power demands; VLSI circuits,2-s2.0-85056526167

However, the translational evidence of the role of miRNAs in dialysis vascular access is limited. Design, setting, participants, & measurements miRNA expression in tissues was assessed by using venous tissues harvested from ten patients on dialysis who received revision or removal surgery, and ten patients who were predialysis and received creation surgery of arteriovenous fistulas served as controls. To extend these findings, 60 patients who received angioplasty of dialysis access were enrolled and the levels of circulating miRNAs were determined before and 2 days after angioplasty. Clinical follow-up was continued monthly for 6 months. The primary outcome of angioplasty cohort was target lesion restenosis within 6 months after angioplasty. Results In the surgery cohort, the expressions of miR-21, miR-130a, and miR-221 were upregulated in stenotic tissues, whereas those of miR-133 and miR-145 were downregulated. In situ hybridization revealed similar expression patterns of these miRNAs, localized predominantly in the neointima region. Twenty eight patients in the angioplasty cohort developed restenosis within 6 months. The levels of circulating miR-21, miR-130a, miR-221, miR-133, and miR-145 significantly increased 2 days after angioplasty. Kaplan-Meier plots showed that patients with an increase of miR-21 expression level >0.35 have a higher risk of patency loss (hazard ratio, 4.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.68 to 11.7). In a multivariable analysis, postangioplasty increase of miR-21 expression was independently associated with restenosis (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.35 per one unit increase of miR-21 expression level; P=0.001). Conclusions Certain miRNAs are differentially expressed in the stenotic venous segments of dialysis accesses. An increase in blood miR-21 level with angioplasty is associated with a higher risk of restenosis. ? 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; circulating microRNA; microRNA; microRNA 130a; microRNA 145; microRNA 21; microRNA 221; unclassified drug; microRNA; MIRN130 microRNA, human; MIRN133 microRNA, human; MIRN145 microRNA, human; MIRN21 microRNA, human; MIRN221 microRNA, human; adult; angiography; angioplasty; arteriovenous fistula; Article; blood flow velocity; blood pressure monitoring; controlled study; coronary artery disease; dialysis; disease severity; down regulation; dyslipidemia; echography; female; fistulography; follow up; gene expression; hemodialysis; human; human tissue; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; peripheral vascular disease; real time polymerase chain reaction; restenosis; RNA analysis; urea nitrogen blood level; vascular access; venous neointimal hyperplasia; adverse event; aged; arteriovenous shunt; blood; case control study; hyperplasia; metabolism; neointima; pathology; recurrent disease; risk factor; stenosis, occlusion and obstruction; upregulation; vein; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angioplasty; Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical; Case-Control Studies; Constriction, Pathologic; Down-Regulation; Female; Humans; Hyperplasia; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Neointima; Recurrence; Renal Dialysis; Risk Factors; Up-Regulation; Veins",2-s2.0-85056398604

Automatic medical image segmentation is difficult due to the varying image quality among equipment. In this paper, the automatic method employed image multiscale intensity texture analysis and segmentation to solve this problem. In this paper, firstly, SVM is applied to identify common pneumothorax. Features are extracted from lung images with the LBP (local binary pattern). Then, classification of pneumothorax is determined by SVM. Secondly, the proposed automatic pneumothorax detection method is based on multiscale intensity texture segmentation by removing the background and noises in chest images for segmenting abnormal lung regions. The segmentation of abnormal regions is used for texture transformed from computing multiple overlapping blocks. The rib boundaries are identified with Sobel edge detection.

High sensitivity over a wide detection range (0-5 g/L), good selectivity, low-cost fabrication, portability, and simplicity of use are key features of our biosensor. Early diagnosis of heart disease in low-, medium-, and high-risk patients is possible with an assay turn-around time of 5 min and a plasma sample volume of 5-10 μL. High sensitivity and low detection limits (0.5 g/L) are made possible in environments with high salt concentrations because the HEMT sensor design overcomes the charge screening effect associated with a very small Debye length. This biosensor technology demonstrates the potential for development as a point-of-care or homecare diagnostic device for quick and easy assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. ? 2018 MYU K.K.",AlGaN/GaN HEMT biosensor; Aptamer; Cardiovascular disease; Fibrinogen; In vitro diagnostics,Aluminum gallium nitride; Bioassay; Biosensors; Cardiology; Clinical research; Diagnosis; Diseases; Electron mobility; Electrophysiology; Gallium nitride; III-V semiconductors; Risk assessment; AlGaN/GaN HEMTs; Aptamers; Cardio-vascular disease; Fibrinogen; In-vitro diagnostic; High electron mobility transistors,2-s2.0-85055646360

Thus, BNCT remains vulnerable to setup errors and intra-fractional patient motion. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of deviations in positioning on the dose administered by BNCT for brain tumors at the Tsing Hua open-pool reactor (THOR). For these studies, a simulated head model was generated based on computed tomography (CT) images of a patient with a brain tumor. A cylindrical brain tumor 3 cm in diameter and 5 cm in length was modeled at distances of 6.5 cm and 2.5 cm from the posterior scalp of this head model (T6.5cm and T2.5cm, respectively). Radiation doses associated with positioning errors were evaluated for each distance, including left and right shifts, superior and inferior shifts, shifts from the central axis of the beam aperture, and outward shifts from the surface of the beam aperture. Rotational and tilting effects were also evaluated. The dose prescription was 20 Gray-equivalent (Gy-Eq) to 80 % of the tumor. The treatment planning system, NCTPlan, was used to perform dose calculations. The average decreases in mean tumor dose for T6.5cm for the 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm lateral shifts composed by left, right, superior, and inferior sides, were approximately 1 %, 6 %, and 11 %, respectively, compared to the dose administered to the initial tumor position. The decreases in mean tumor dose for T6.5cm were approximately 5 %, 11 %, and 15 % for the 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm outward shifts, respectively. For a superficial tumor at T2.5cm, no significant decrease in average mean tumor dose was observed following lateral shifts of 1 cm. Rotational and tilting up to 15° did not result in significant difference to the tumor dose. Dose differences to the normal tissues as a result of the shifts in positioning were also minimal. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the mean dose administered to tumors at greater depths is potentially more vulnerable to deviations in positioning, and greater shift distances resulted in reduced mean tumor doses at the THOR. Moreover, these data provide an estimation of dose differences that are caused by setup error or intra-fractional motion during BNCT, and these may facilitate more accurate predictions of actual patient dose in future treatments. ? 2018 Jia-Cheng Lee et al.",,"adult; Article; boron neutron capture therapy; brain tumor; cancer patient; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; dosimetry; human; human tissue; male; patient positioning; prescription; radiation dose; tumor volume; boron neutron capture therapy; brain tumor; head; imaging phantom; Monte Carlo method; patient positioning; procedures; radiation response; radiometry; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; Boron Neutron Capture Therapy; Brain Neoplasms; Head; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Patient Positioning; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiometry; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted",2-s2.0-85055566665

Recent reports indicate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD&NASH) and primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PBC&PSC) are significant of HCC. Therefore, understanding the cellular mechanisms of the pathogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis from normal liver cells to HCC through NAFLD&NASH or PBC&PSC is a priority to prevent the progression of liver damage and reduce the risk of further complications. By the genetic and epigenetic data mining and the system identification through next-generation sequencing data and its corresponding DNA methylation profiles of liver cells in normal, NAFLD&NASH, PBC&PSC, and HCC patients, we identified the genome-wide real genetic and epigenetic networks (GENs) of normal, NAFLD&NASH, PBC&PSC, and HCC patients. In order to get valuable insight into these identified genome-wide GENs, we then applied a principal network projection method to extract the corresponding core GENs for normal liver cells, NAFLD&NASH, PBC&PSC, and HCC. By comparing the signal transduction pathways involved in the identified core GENs, we found that the hepatocarcinogenesis through NAFLD&NASH was induced through DNA methylation of HIST2H2BE, HSPB1, RPL30, and ALDOB and the regulation of miR-21 and miR-122, and the hepatocarcinogenesis through PBC&PSC was induced through DNA methylation of RPL23A, HIST2H2BE, TIMP1, IGF2, RPL30, and ALDOB and the regulation of miR-29a, miR-21, and miR-122. The genetic and epigenetic changes in the pathogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis potentially serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.

Here, we aimed to evaluate metastasis-specific markers in oral cancer and to provide comprehensive recognition concerning functional roles of the specific target in oral cancer metastasis. Methods: Lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 1 (LGALS1) was identified by secretomic analysis. LGALS1 expression of patient samples with oral cancer on the tissue microarray were examined by immunochemical (IHC) staining. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of LGALS1 revealed the role of LGALS1 in oral cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Results: LGALS1 was observed to be upregulated in highly invasive oral cancer cells, and elevated LGALS1 expression was correlated with cancer progression and lymph node metastasis in oral cancer tissue specimens. Functionally, silencing LGALS1 resulted in suppressed cell growth, wound healing, cell migration, and cell invasion in oral cancer cells in vitro. Knockdown of LGALS1 in highly invasive oral cancer cells dramatically inhibited lung metastasis in an in vivo mouse model. Mechanistic studies suggested p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, upregulated MMP-9, and mesenchymal phenotypes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in highly invasive oral cancer cells, whereas siRNA against LGALS1 resulted in the inactivation of p38 MAPK pathway, downregulated MMP-9, and EMT inhibition. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that elevated LGALS1 is strongly correlated with oral cancer progression and metastasis, and that it could potentially serve as a prognostic biomarker and an innovative target for oral cancer therapy. ?

Traditional detection methods for CVDs include cardiac computerized tomography scans, electrocardiography, and myocardial perfusion imaging scans. Although diagnosis of CVDs through such bio-imaging techniques is common, these methods are relatively costly and cannot detect CVDs in their earliest stages. In contrast, the levels of certain micro RNA (miRNA) biomarkers extracted from extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the bloodstream have been recognized as promising indicators for early CVD detection. However, detection and quantification of miRNA using existing methods are relatively labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, a new integrated microfluidic system equipped with highly sensitive field-effect transistors (FETs) was capable of performing EV extraction, EV lysis, target miRNA isolation and miRNA detection within 5 h. The limit of detection was within the physiological range (femtomolar) for two targeted miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-126, meaning that this integrated microfluidic system has the potential to be used as a tool for early detection of CVDs. ?

We use a cyclic temperature profile in the InN gas sensor heater, where the temperature varies from 200°C to 0°C and from 0°C to 200°C in increments of 50°C. Therefore, a different current variation response is measured on an InN epilayer for 5 ppm ammonia and 5 ppm acetone gas, respectively, because ammonia and acetone gas behave differently in the cyclic temperature profile. When ammonia and acetone gas are exposed in background air, the variation in the response of the current in different temperature regions is given as 2.5% for acetone gas and 7.85% for ammonia gas between 100°C to 150°C, and 12% for acetone gas and 8.85% for ammonia gas between 150°C to 200°C. Therefore, the temperature region 100°C to 150°C is suitable for selectively sensing ammonia gas for determining liver malfunction.

Its synthesis is catalyzed by a hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase (HIOMT)-like enzyme. However, the exact identity of this HIOMT in human cells remains unclear. Human HIOMT exists in several alternatively spliced isoforms, and we hypothesized that 5-MTP–producing HIOMT is a distinct isoform. Here, we show that human fibroblasts and cancer cells express the HIOMT298 isoform as contrasted with the expression of the HIOMT345 isoform in pineal cells. Sequencing analysis of the cloned isoforms revealed that HIOMT298 is identical to the sequence of a previously reported truncated HIOMT isoform. Of note, HIOMT298 expression was reduced in cancer cells and tissues. Stable transfection of A549 cancer cells with HIOMT298 restored HIOMT expression to normal levels, accompanied by 5-MTP production. Furthermore, HIOMT298 transfection caused a tryptophan-metabolic switch from serotonin to 5-MTP production. To determine the in vivo relevance of this alteration, we compared growth and lung metastasis of HIOMT298-transfected A549 cells with those of vector- or untransfected A549 cells as controls in a murine xenograft model. Of note, the HIOMT298-transfected A549 cells exhibited slower growth and lower metastasis than the controls. Our findings provide insight into the crucial role of HIOMT298 in 5-MTP production in cells and in inhibiting cancer progression and highlight the potential therapeutic value of 5-MTP for managing cancer. ? 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Amino acids; Cell culture; Cloning; Diseases; Metabolism; Molecular biology; Pathology; Restoration; Anti-inflammatories; Cancer progression; Human cancer cells; Murine xenograft model; O-Methyltransferase; Sequencing analysis; Therapeutic values; Tryptophan metabolite; Cells; 5 methoxytryptophan; acetylserotonin methyltransferase; amino acid decarboxylase; antineoplastic agent; hydroxyindole O methyltransferase 298; serotonin; tryptophan; unclassified drug; 5-methoxytryptophan; acetylserotonin methyltransferase; serotonin; tryptophan; A-549 cell line; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer cell; cancer growth; cell level; concentration response; controlled study; fibroblast; genetic transfection; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; lung adenocarcinoma; lung metastasis; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tryptophan metabolism; analogs and derivatives; animal; apoptosis; cell proliferation; drug screening; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; SCID mouse; tumor cell culture; Acetylserotonin O-Methyltransferase; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Proliferation; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, SCID; Serotonin; Tryptophan; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85051066606

Shielding analyses for such an accelerator involve many computational difficulties: source term estimations, complicated geometry modeling, deep-penetration calculations and streaming evaluations. Monte Carlo simulations are considered the most accurate method for complex accelerator shielding analyses, but less-experienced users may find them to be time-consuming and error-prone. Analytical models based on point-source line-of-sight approximation are intuitive and widely used in practice because of their ease of use. However, the accuracies and limitations of simplified models need to be evaluated. In this study, a set of shielding data, including source terms and attenuation lengths for several common targets (copper, iron, graphite, and tissue) and shielding materials (concrete, iron, and lead), were generated by performing Monte Carlo simulations for carbon ions of energies with 400 and 800 MeV. Potential applications and appropriate use of the data set for evaluating dose distributions outside a typical carbon-ion treatment room were demonstrated.

Presently, the radiation dose in CT is determined using the size-specific dose estimate (SSDE). Accurate assessment of individual's body size is essential for dose estimation. In this study, we integrated a somatosensory controller with a CT scanner to measure patient's anterior-posterior diameter (APD) and lateral diameter (LATD) and calculate the corresponding effective diameter (ED). A total of 108 individuals with an average age of 38.6 years were enrolled in this study. Microsoft Kinect was used to acquire the depth image of subjects.

Repressions of miR-331-3p and miR-320a are involved in HIV-1 replication, replicative spread, anti-apoptosis, cell proliferation, and dysregulation of cell cycle control at the integration/replication stage. Repression of miR-341-5p is involved in carcinogenesis at the late stage of HIV-1 infection. Conclusion: By investigating the common core proteins and changes in specific proteins in the PPMI network between the stages of HIV-1 infection, we obtained pathogenic insights into the functional core modules and identified potential drug combinations for treating patients with HIV-1 infection, including thalidomide, oxaprozin, and metformin, at the reverse transcription stage; quercetin, nifedipine, and fenbendazole, at the integration/replication stage; and staurosporine, quercetin, prednisolone, and flufenamic acid, at the late stage. ? 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.",AIDS; HIV; Host-pathogen interaction network; Interspecies protein-protein miRNA interaction network; miRNA; Multiple drug,"ELAV like protein 1; fenbendazole; histone deacetylase 1; metformin; microRNA; nifedipine; oxaprozin; quercetin; thalidomide; viral protein; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; Article; autoimmune disease; DNA methylation; drug binding; drug development; gene activity; gene control; gene expression; gene ontology; histone modification; host pathogen interaction; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; omics; protein protein interaction; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription; RNA sequence; tumor growth; virus replication; algorithm; biology; chemistry; data mining; drug development; drug effect; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunology; metabolism; physiology; procedures; protein analysis; systems biology; theoretical model; virology; Algorithms; Anti-HIV Agents; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Drug Discovery; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Systems Biology",2-s2.0-85047614014

However, this theory in clinical cancer research remains controversial due to the limited number of drugs that specifically inhibit autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. Methods: We screened FDA-approved drugs using a novel platform that integrates computational docking and simulations as well as biochemical and cellular reporter assays to identify potential drugs that inhibit autophagy-required cysteine proteases of the ATG4 family. The effects of ATG4 inhibitors on autophagy and tumor suppression were examined using cell culture and a tumor xenograft mouse model. Results: Tioconazole was found to inhibit activities of ATG4A and ATG4B with an IC50 of 1.3 μM and 1.8 μM, respectively. Further studies based on docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations supported that tioconazole can stably occupy the active site of ATG4 in its open form and transiently interact with the allosteric regulation site in LC3, which explained the experimentally observed obstruction of substrate binding and reduced autophagic flux in cells in the presence of tioconazole. Moreover, tioconazole diminished tumor cell viability and sensitized cancer cells to autophagy-inducing conditions, including starvation and treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Conclusion: Tioconazole inhibited ATG4 and autophagy to enhance chemotherapeutic drug-induced cytotoxicity in cancer cell culture and tumor xenografts. These results suggest that the antifungal drug tioconazole might be repositioned as an anticancer drug or chemosensitizer. ?

The orientation and elevation of the Sun can be calculated by the system according to the user's location and local time to simulate the Sun path. When holding the mobile device toward the sky, the screen will show the virtual Sun at the same position as that of the real Sun. The user can record the Sun path and the data of observation date, time, longitude, and latitude using the celestial hemisphere and the pole shadow on the system. By setting different observation times and locations, it can be seen that the Sun path changes with seasons and latitudes. The system provides contextual awareness of the Sun path concepts, and it can convert the observation data into organized and meaningful astronomical knowledge to enable combination of situated learning with spatial cognition. The system can solve the problem of being not able to record the Sun path due to a bad weather or topographical restrictions, and therefore it is helpful for elementary students when conducting observations. A teaching experiment has been conducted to analyze the learning achievement of students after using the system, and the results show that it is more effective than traditional teaching aids. The questionnaire results also reveal that the system is easy to operate and useful in recording the Sun path data. Therefore, it is an effective tool for astronomy education in elementary schools. ? 2018 Wernhuar Tarng et al.",,Augmented reality; Mobile devices; Students; Teaching; Astronomy educations; Augmented reality technology; Elementary schools; Elementary students; Learning achievement; Observation systems; Three axis accelerometers; Traditional teachings; Data handling,2-s2.0-85045554978

Autophagy is an event occurring in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic LC3 puncta formation is a hallmark of autophagy. Graphene oxide (GO) is a nanomaterial that provokes autophagy in CT26 colon cancer cells and confers antitumor effects. Here we aimed to evaluate whether combined use of GO with CDDP (GO/CDDP) overcomes chemoresistance in different cancer cells and uncover the underlying mechanism. Methods: We treated different cancer cells with GO/CDDP and evaluated the cytotoxicity, death mechanism, autophagy induction and nuclear entry of CDDP. We further knocked down genes essential for autophagic flux and deciphered which step is critical to nuclear import and cell death. Finally, we performed immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence labeling to evaluate the association of LC3 and CDDP. Results: We uncovered that combination of GO and CDDP (GO/CDDP) promoted the killing of not only CT26 cells, but also ovarian, cervical and prostate cancer cells. In the highly chemosensitized Skov-3 cells, GO/CDDP significantly enhanced concurrent nuclear import of CDDP and autophagy marker LC3 and elevated cell necrosis, which required autophagy initiation and progression but did not necessitate late autophagy events (e.g., autophagosome completion and autolysosome formation). The GO/CDDP-elicited nuclear trafficking and cell death also required importin α/β, and LC3 also co-migrated with CDDP and histone H1/H4 into the nucleus. In particular, GO/CDDP triggered histone H4 acetylation in the nucleus, which could decondense the chromosome and enable CDDP to more effectively access chromosomal DNA to trigger cell death. Conclusion: These findings shed light on the mechanisms of GO/CDDP-induced chemosensitization and implicate the potential applications of GO/CDDP to treat multiple cancers. ?

Drug therapy is used as an auxiliary treatment method in severe chronic periodontitis, aggressive periodontitis, and periodontitis-associated systemic disease. Nal-P-113, a modified antimicrobial peptide, specifically replaces the histidine residues of P-113 with the bulky amino acid β-naphthylalanine, and our previous studies have verified that this novel peptide is not toxic to the human body within a certain concentration range. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Nal-P-113 on periodontal pathogens and periodontal status in clinical studies. In a split-mouth clinical trial, the pocket depth and bleeding index values tended to decrease in the experimental group compared with those in the control group. SEM results verified that Nal-P-113 restrained the maturation of plaque. Based on real-time polymerase chain reaction, the levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus gordonii, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque were decreased when the subjects were given Nal-P-113. Bacterial growth curve analysis and a biofilm susceptibility assay verified that Nal-P-113 at a concentration of 20 μg/mL restrained the growth of S. gordonii, F. nucleatum, and P. gingivalis and biofilm formation. Therefore, Nal-P-113 effectively reduces periodontal pathogens and ameliorates periodontal status. ? 2018 Hongyan Wang et al.",,nal p 113; placebo; polypeptide antibiotic agent; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; beta alanine; beta-naphthylalanine; peptide; adult; aggressive periodontitis; alveolar bone loss; Article; bacterial growth; chronic periodontitis; clinical article; colony forming unit; comparative study; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; follow up; Fusobacterium nucleatum; gingivitis; human; male; nonhuman; periodontal disease; Porphyromonas gingivalis; randomized controlled trial; real time polymerase chain reaction; scanning electron microscopy; Streptococcus gordonii; systemic disease; treatment duration; Treponema denticola; analogs and derivatives; biofilm; chemistry; drug effect; gingiva; inflammation; microbiology; middle aged; pathogenicity; pathology; periodontal disease; periodontal pocket; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; beta-Alanine; Biofilms; Female; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Gingiva; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; Peptides; Periodontal Diseases; Periodontal Pocket; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Streptococcus gordonii; Treponema denticola,2-s2.0-85045026398

Moreover, we have successfully removed lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) associated with hG31P in the expression with Escherichia coli. In this paper, we have used hG31P as a novel fusion protein for the expression and purification of P-113. The purity of the expressed P-113 is more than 95% and the yield is 4 mg P-113 per liter of E. coli cell culture in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. The antimicrobial activity of the purified P-113 was tested. Furthermore, we used circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study the structural properties of P-113. Our results indicate that using hG31P as a fusion protein to obtain large quantities of P-113 is feasible and is easy to scale up for commercial production.

Deregulation of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA) in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is known to promote tumorigenesis in liver, lung, and breast tissues. Yet, the molecular mechanism of RPIA-mediated colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. Our study demonstrates a noncanonical function of RPIA in CRC. Data from the mRNAs of 80 patients’ CRC tissues and paired nontumor tissues and protein levels, as well as a CRC tissue array, indicate RPIA is significantly elevated in CRC. RPIA modulates cell proliferation and oncogenicity via activation of β-catenin in colon cancer cell lines. Unlike its role in PPP in which RPIA functions within the cytosol, RPIA enters the nucleus to form a complex with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and β-catenin. This association protects β-catenin by preventing its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation. The C-terminus of RPIA (amino acids 290 to 311), a region distinct from its enzymatic domain, is necessary for RPIA-mediated tumorigenesis. Consistent with results in vitro, RPIA increases the expression of β-catenin and its target genes, and induces tumorigenesis in gut-specific promotor-carrying RPIA transgenic zebrafish. Together, we demonstrate a novel function of RPIA in CRC formation in which RPIA enters the nucleus and stabilizes β-catenin activity and suggests that RPIA might be a biomarker for targeted therapy and prognosis. ? 2018 Chou et al.",,"beta catenin; messenger RNA; ribose 5 phosphate isomerase A; tumor protein; unclassified drug; beta catenin; isomerase; messenger RNA; ribosephosphate isomerase; adult; animal experiment; Article; cancer growth; cancer staging; carboxy terminal sequence; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; colon cancer cell line; colon polyposis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; cytosol; down regulation; enzyme structure; gene targeting; human; human tissue; in vitro study; major clinical study; nonhuman; pentose phosphate cycle; protein analysis; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; tumor promotion; upregulation; aged; animal; cell transformation; colorectal tumor; female; genetics; male; metabolism; middle aged; phosphorylation; physiology; promoter region; protein domain; transgenic animal; tumor cell line; ubiquitination; zebra fish; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli; Adult; Aged; Aldose-Ketose Isomerases; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; beta Catenin; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Nucleus; Cell Proliferation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phosphorylation; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Domains; RNA, Messenger; Ubiquitination; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-85041710224

Herein we investigated whether chronic hyperuricemia could impede blood flow recovery in response to tissue ischemia by suppression of EPC. Methods: Human EPC were isolated and cultured in a high-level uric acid medium for functional testing. Cell proliferation, nitric oxide (NO) production and apoptosis assay were examined. A chronic hyperuricemia mouse model was established by potassium oxonate treatment and/or a high-level uric acid diet to evaluate the actions of chronic hyperuricemia on ischemia-induced blood flow recovery. After 4 weeks of drug treatment, hindlimb ischemia surgery was performed in the control and hyperuricemia mice. Blood flow recovery was followed up every week before and after ischemic surgery using a laser Doppler Perfusion Imager System. The circulating EPC number in the peripheral blood was determined by flow cytometry (Sca-1+/Flk-1+). Results: Incubation with a high-level uric acid medium (10 mg/dL) significantly suppressed EPC proliferation, reduced NO production, and lessened phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. Moreover, EPC treated with high-level uric acid increased reactive oxygen species production, promoted cellular apoptosis and senescence, and also inhibited EPC tube formation. Four weeks after hindlimb ischemia surgery, the chronic hyperuricemia mice had significantly reduced tissue reperfusion, EPC mobilization, and impaired neovascularization in the ischemic hindlimbs compared with the control mice. Conclusions: Chronic hyperuricemia impaired blood flow recovery and EPC mobilization in response to tissue ischemia, and these effects could have occurred through suppression of EPC. ?

This article reviews current diagnostic methods and makes suggestions for future development. In the case of paraquat intoxication, it is characterized by multi-organ failure, causing substantial mortality and morbidity. Early diagnosis may save the life of a paraquat intoxication patient. Conventional paraquat intoxication diagnostic methods, such as symptom review and urine sodium dithionite assay, are time-consuming and impractical in resource-scarce areas where most intoxication cases occur. Several experimental and clinical studies have shown the potential of portable Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), paper-based devices, and machine learning for paraquat intoxication diagnosis. Portable SERS and new SERS substrates maintain the sensitivity of SERS while being less costly and more convenient than conventional SERS. Paper-based devices provide the advantages of price and portability. Machine learning algorithms can be implemented as a mobile phone application and facilitate diagnosis in resource-limited areas. Although these methods have not yet met all features of an ideal diagnostic method, the combination and development of these methods offer much promise. ? 2018 Author(s).",,Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Herbicides; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Raman scattering; Surface scattering; Current diagnostics; Diagnostic methods; Early diagnosis; Mobile phone applications; Paper based devices; Point-of-care testing; Sodium dithionite; Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); Substrates,2-s2.0-85040921845

However, the molecular events underlying leukemia development are not well understood. In our recent study, we have demonstrated that calcium ionophore and phorbol ester force the differentiation of T lymphoblastic leukemia. The event involves a newly identified IκBα/WWOX/ERK signaling, in which WWOX is Ser14 phosphorylated. Additional evidence also reveals that pS14-WWOX is involved in enhancing cancer progression and metastasis and facilitating neurodegeneration. In this mini-review, we update the current knowledge for the functional roles of WWOX under physiological and pathological settings, and provide new insights regarding pS14-WWOX in T leukemia cell maturation, and switching the anticancer pY33-WWOX to pS14-WWOX for cancer promotion and disease progression. Impact statement: WWOX was originally designated as a tumor suppressor. However, human newborns deficient in WWOX do not spontaneously develop tumors. Activated WWOX with Tyr33 phosphorylation is present in normal tissues and organs. However, when pY33-WWOX is overly induced under stress conditions, it becomes apoptotic to eliminate damaged cells. Notably, WWOX with Ser14 phosphorylation is upregulated in the lesions of cancer, as well as in the brain hippocampus and cortex with Alzheimer’s disease. Suppression of pS14-WWOX by Zfra reduces cancer growth and mitigates Alzheimer’s disease progression, suggesting that pS14-WWOX facilitates disease progression. pS14-WWOX can be regarded as a marker of disease progression. ? 2018, ? 2018 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.",apoptosis; bubbling cell death; cancer; neurodegeneration; phosphorylation; WWOX,"amyloid precursor protein; androgen; beta catenin; CD4 antigen; CD8 antigen; estrogen; ethylnitrosourea; Hermes antigen; hyaluronic acid; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 2 receptor alpha; mitogen activated protein kinase; n benzyl n methylnitrosamine; oxidoreductase; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; protein SH3; scatter factor; serine; Smad4 protein; small interfering RNA; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2; tumor suppressor protein; unclassified drug; wwox; tumor suppressor protein; WW domain containing oxidoreductase; WWOX protein, human; Alzheimer disease; ataxia telangiectasia; atrophy; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell survival; disease course; DNA sequence; down regulation; dwarfism; epigenetics; epilepsy; Epstein Barr virus; gene; gene mutation; gene overexpression; granulocyte; hematologic malignancy; hematopoiesis; HTLV-1 infection; human; hypocapnia; leukopenia; macrophage; metastasis; natural killer T cell; nerve degeneration; neuroblastoma; nonhuman; papillary carcinoma; prostate cancer; protein aggregation; protein expression; protein motif; protein phosphorylation; Review; signal transduction; T cell leukemia; traumatic brain injury; ubiquitination; upregulation; Wwox gene; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; animal; gene expression regulation; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; protein processing; Animals; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Phosphorylation; Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; WW Domain-Containing Oxidoreductase",2-s2.0-85040836592

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the weekend effect on the mortality of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Methods. The review protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number: CRD42017073313) and was written according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. We conducted a search of the PUBMED, COCHRANE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases from inception to August 2017. All observational studies comparing mortality between UGIB patients with weekend versus weekday admissions were included. Articles that were published only in abstract form or not published in a peer-reviewed journal were excluded. The quality of articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We pooled results from the articles using random-effect models. Heterogeneity was evaluated by the chi-square-based Q-test and I2 test. To address heterogeneity, we performed sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Potential publication bias was assessed via funnel plot. Results. Eighteen observational cohort studies involving 1,232,083 study patients were included. Weekend admission was associated with significantly higher 30-day or in-hospital mortality in all studies (OR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.07-1.17], P < 0:00001). Increased in-hospital mortality was also associated with weekend admission (OR=1.12, 95% CI [1.08-1.17], P < 0:00001).Nosignificant difference in in-hospital mortality was observed between patients admitted with variceal bleeding during the weekend or on weekdays (OR=0.99, 95% CI [0.91-1.08], P =0:82); however, weekend admission was associated with a 15% increase in in-hospital mortality for patients with non-variceal bleeding (OR = 1.15, 95% CI [1.09-1.21], P < 0:00001). The time to endoscopy for weekday admission was significantly less than that obtained for weekend admission (MD = -2.50, 95% CI [-4.08--0.92], P = 0:002). Conclusions. The weekend effect is associated with increased mortality of UGIB patients, particularly in non-variceal bleeding. The timing of endoscopic intervention might be a factor that influences mortality of UGIB patients. ? 2018 Shih et al.",Endoscopic intervention; Meta-analysis; Mortality; Systematic review; Upper gastrointestinal bleeding; Weekend effect,Article; endoscopy; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; meta analysis; systematic review; upper gastrointestinal bleeding; weekday admission,2-s2.0-85040635257

As angiogenic sprouting involves endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), we are intrigued to know whether OPN exerts an effect on EndoMT. Clinically, we indeed detected EndoMT-derived cells next to OPN-expressing cells in colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, we treated OPN to primary cultures of endothelial cells to investigate the EndoMT-inducing activity and the underlying mechanisms. Integrin αVβ3 rather than CD44 is involved in OPNinduced EndoMT. OPN-integrin αVβ3 engagement induces HIF-1α expression through a PI3K/Akt/TSC2-mediated and mTORC1-dependent protein synthesis pathway, which in turn trans-activates TCF12 gene expression. TCF12 further interacts with EZH2 and histone deacetylases to transcriptionally repress VE-cadherin gene and thus facilitates EndoMT. Like cancer-associated fibroblasts, EndoMT-derived cells promote tumor growth and metastasis by secreting certain proteins. Secreted HSP90α is a candidate suggested by microwestern array assay, and is herein verified to induce stemness properties in colorectal cancer cells.

In HCC patients, sorafenib-a multikinase inhibitor drug-has been reported to exert anti-fibrotic activity. However, incomplete inhibition of RAF activity by sorafenib may also induce paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in malignant cells. The consequence of this effect in non-malignant disease (hepatic fibrosis) remains unknown. This study aimed to examine the effects of sorafenib on activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and develop effective therapeutic approaches to treat liver fibrosis and prevent cancer development. Methods: We first examined the effects of sorafenib in combination with MEK inhibitors on fibrosis pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo. To improve the bioavailability and absorption by activated HSCs, we developed CXCR4-targeted nanoparticles (NPs) to co-deliver sorafenib and a MEK inhibitor to mice with liver damage. Results: We found that sorafenib induced MAPK activation in HSCs, and promoted their myofibroblast differentiation. Combining sorafenib with a MEK inhibitor suppressed both paradoxical MAPK activation and HSC activation in vitro, and alleviated liver fibrosis in a CCl4-induced murine model of liver damage. Furthermore, treatment with sorafenib/MEK inhibitor-loaded CXCR4-targeted NPs significantly suppressed hepatic fibrosis progression and further prevented fibrosis-associated HCC development and liver metastasis. Conclusions: Our results show that combined delivery of sorafenib and a MEK inhibitor via CXCR4-targeted NPs can prevent activation of ERK in activated HSCs and has anti-fibrotic effects in the CCl4-induced murine model. Targeting HSCs represents a promising strategy to prevent the development and progression of fibrosis-associated HCC. ?

In this study, a high correlation with in-vivo and in-vitro neutralization assays was established using the immunoreactive peptides identi?ed from short-chain neurotoxin and cytotoxin A3. These peptides contain conserved residues associated with toxin activities and a competition assay indicated that these peptides could speci?cally block the antibody binding to toxin and affect the neutralization potency of antivenom. Moreover, the titers of peptide-speci?c antibody in antivenoms or mouse antisera were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) simultaneously, and the results indicated that Taiwanese bivalent antivenom (BAV) and Vietnamese snake antivenom-Naja (SAV-Naja) exhibited superior neutralization potency against the lethal effect of short-chain neurotoxin (sNTX) and cytotoxicity of cardiotoxin/cytotoxin (CTX), respectively.

In this study, we developed a novel multifunctional tactile sensor to mimic human skin with high force sensitivity, high flexibility, and temperature measurable performance. The unique geometry of the interlocked structures enabled differentiation between different mechanical stimuli, including pressure, bending and torsion forces. The substrate was flexible because of the material properties of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer. The top electrode and bottom electrode layers were interlocked by high-aspect-ratio zinc oxide nanorods (NRs), which were grown vertically on the PDMS surface, providing high sensitivity for the measurement of contact force and environmental temperature. Moreover, the sensor was applied for measuring and monitoring arterial pulse pressure. Thus, we successfully fabricated a 3 × 3 sensor array with multiple functions, which were verified through experiments.

Since prevalent EV-A71 subgenotypes change, developing bivalent vaccines composed of the epidemic EV-A71 subgenotype and CV-A16 is desirable. Virus-like particles (VLPs) of enteroviruses can be produced by co-expressing P1 polyprotein and 3CD protease and are promising vaccine platforms, but VLP production and purification issues are rarely addressed. To produce VLPs of different enterovirus subtypes as vaccines, we exploited the flashBAC GOLD? system to generate 4 baculoviruses expressing P1 and 3CD derived from different prevalent enterovirus subtypes (EV-A71 C2, C4 and B5 and CV-A16). By fine-tuning the strategies to infect High Five? cells, we achieved high level production of VLPs derived from EV-A71 C2, C4, B5 and CV-A16, reaching 195, 85, 157 and 173 mg/L, respectively. We further purified and characterized these 4 subtypes of VLPs. Immunization of mice with VLPs of subtypes that were predominantly prevalent over the last decade (C4 and CV-A16), alone or in combination, successfully induced humoral and cellular immune responses.

Instances of microcephaly and central nervous system malformations continue to increase in ZIKV outbreak regions. ZIKV is a small enveloped positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. High-resolution ZIKV structures recently identified by cryo-electron microscopy indicate that the overall ZIKV structure is similar to those of other flaviviruses. With its compact surface, ZIKV is more thermally stable than the dengue virus (DENV). ZIKV E proteins have a characteristic “herringbone” structure with a single glycosylation site. The ZIKV E protein, the major protein involved in receptor binding and fusion, is formed as a head-to-tail dimer on the surfaces of viral particles. The E monomer consists of three distinct domains: DI, DII, and DIII. The finger-like DII contains a fusion loop (FL) that is inserted into the host cell endosomal membrane during pH-dependent conformational changes that drive fusion. Quaternary E:E dimer epitopes located at the interaction site of prM and E dimers can be further divided into two dimer epitopes. To date, more than 50 ZIKV vaccine candidates are now in various stages of research and development. Candidate ZIKV vaccines that are currently in phase I/II clinical trials include inactivated whole viruses, recombinant measles viral vector-based vaccines, DNA and mRNA vaccines, and a mosquito salivary peptide vaccine. Stabilized forms of ZIKV E:E dimer proteins have been successfully obtained either by introducing additional inter-subunit disulfide bond(s) in DII or via the direct assembly of E:E dimer proteins by immobilization with monomeric E proteins. The VLP-based approach is another alternative method for presenting native E:E dimer antigens among the vaccine components. Several forms of ZIKV VLPs have been reported featuring the co-expression of the prM-E, prM-E-NS1, C-prM-E, and NS2B/NS3 viral genes in human cells. To minimize the effect of the cross-reactive ADE-facilitating antibodies between ZIKV and DENV, several novel mutations have been reported either in or near the FL of DII or DIII to dampen the production of cross-reactive antibodies. Future ZIKV vaccine design efforts should be focused on eliciting improved neutralizing antibodies with a reduced level of cross-reactivity to confer sterilizing immunity. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Cross reactivity; Structure biology; Vaccine; Zika virus,"Antibodies; Covalent bonds; Electron microscopes; Epitopes; Gene expression; Nucleic acids; Proteins; Vaccines; Viruses; Central nervous systems; Conformational change; Cross reactivity; Cryo-electron microscopy; Glycosylation sites; Neutralizing antibodies; Research and development; Vaccine development; Dimers; antibody; cell; disease vector; immobilization; measles; mosquito; nervous system; peptide; protein; vaccine; virus; Zika virus disease; Brazil; Dengue virus; Flaviviridae; Flavivirus; RNA viruses; Zika virus; DNA vaccine; viral protein; virus antibody; virus vaccine; chemistry; genetics; human; immunology; molecular model; ultrastructure; virology; Zika fever; Zika virus; Antibodies, Viral; Humans; Models, Molecular; Vaccines, DNA; Viral Proteins; Viral Vaccines; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection",2-s2.0-85029505824

However, to date, acquiring the pancreatic tissue map to study the neural network remains a challenging task as there is a lack of feasible approaches for large-scale tissue analysis at the organ level. Here, we have developed 3-dimensional (3D) panoramic histology to characterise the pancreatic neuro-insular network in young mice. Methods: Pancreases harvested from young wild-type B6 mice (3 and 8?weeks old) and db/db mice (3?weeks old; db/db vs db/+) were used to develop 3D panoramic histology. Transparent pancreases were prepared by optical clearing to enable deep-tissue, tile-scanning microscopy for qualitative and quantitative analyses of islets and the pancreatic tissue network in space. Results: 3D panoramic histology reveals the pancreatic neurovascular network and the coupling of ganglionic and islet populations via the network. This integration is identified in both 3- and 8-week-old mice, featuring the peri-arteriolar neuro-insular network and islet–ganglionic aggregation. In weaning hyperphagic db/db mice, the 3D image data identifies the associated increases in weight, adipose tissue attached to the pancreas, density of large islets (major axis >?150?μm) and pancreatic sympathetic innervation compared with db/+ mice. Conclusions/interpretation: Our work provides insight into the neuro-insular integration at the organ level and demonstrates a new approach for investigating previously unknown details of the pancreatic tissue network in health and disease. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",3D histology; Ganglion; Insulin; Islet; Neural network; Obesity; Sympathetic nerve,insulin; vesicular acetylcholine transporter; insulin; animal tissue; Article; autonomic innervation; controlled study; fluorescence imaging; ganglion; histology; insula; mouse; nerve cell network; nerve plexus; neuro insular network; nonhuman; pancreas; panoramic radiography; priority journal; sympathetic innervation; sympathetic nerve; weaning; animal; body weight; ganglion cyst; metabolism; nerve cell network; obesity; pancreas; physiology; Animals; Body Weight; Ganglion Cysts; Insulin; Mice; Nerve Net; Obesity; Pancreas,2-s2.0-85028775704

To characterise the neuro-insular network and the intra-pancreatic ganglia in a clinically related setting, we examined human pancreases in health and with fatty infiltration via 3-dimensional (3D) histology and compared the human pancreatic microenvironment with its counterpart in mice. Methods: Human pancreatic specimens from individuals with normal BMI, high BMI (??25) and type 2 diabetes were used to investigate the neuro-insular network. Transparent specimens were prepared by tissue clearing for transmitted light and deep-tissue fluorescence imaging to simultaneously visualise infiltrated adipocytes, islets and neurovascular networks. Results: High-definition images of human islets reveal that both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves enter the islet core and reside in the immediate microenvironment of islet cells. Around the islets, the neuro-insular network is visualised with 3D histology to identify the intra-pancreatic ganglia (peri-lobular and intra-parenchymal ganglia) and the islet–ganglionic association. In humans, but not in mice, pancreatic fatty infiltration (BMI dependent) features adipocytes infiltrating into the parenchyma and accumulating in the peri-lobular space, in which the peri-lobular ganglia also reside. We identified the formation of adipose–ganglionic complexes in the peri-lobular space and enlargement of ganglia around adipocytes. In the specimen from the individual with type 2 diabetes, an increase in the number of nerve projections from the intra-parenchymal ganglia is associated with severe fatty infiltration. Conclusions/interpretation: We present new perspectives of human pancreas and islet innervation via 3D histology. Our results strongly suggest that fatty infiltration in the human pancreas creates a neurotrophic microenvironment and promotes remodelling of pancreatic innervation. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Adipocyte; Autonomic innervation; BMI; Fatty infiltration; Human islet; Obesity; Pancreatic ganglia; Sympathetic nerve; Type 2 diabetes,"adipocyte; adult; animal tissue; Article; body mass; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; female; fluorescence imaging; ganglion; human; human cell; human tissue; insula; intra pancreatic ganglion; mouse; nerve cell network; nerve projection; neuroendocrine system; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas disease; pancreas function; pancreas islet; pancreas islet cell; pancreas tissue; pancreatic fatty infiltration; pancreatic neuro insular network; parasympathetic innervation; parasympathetic nerve; priority journal; sympathetic nerve; adrenergic system; animal; metabolism; obesity; pancreas; Adipocytes; Animals; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Islets of Langerhans; Mice; Obesity; Pancreas; Sympathetic Nervous System",2-s2.0-85028766310

Methods: We recruited 47 rTOF patients and 38 age-matched normal volunteers. Tissue phase mapping (TPM) was performed for evaluating the LV myocardial velocity in longitudinal, radial, and circumferential (Vz, Vr, and V?) directions in basal, middle, and apical slices. The V? peak-to-peak (PTP) during systolic phases, the rotation angle of each slice, and V? inconsistency were computed for evaluating LV twist function and V? dyssynchrony. Results: As compared to the controls, the rTOF patients presented decreased RV ejection fraction (RVEF) (p = 0.002) and preserved global LV ejection fraction (LVEF). They also demonstrated decreased systolic and diastolic Vz in several LV segments and higher diastolic Vr in the septum (all p < 0.05). A lower V? PTP, higher V? inconsistency, and reduced peak net rotation angle (all p < 0.05) were observed. The aforementioned indices demonstrated an altered LV twist function in rTOF patients in an early disease stage. Conclusions: MR TPM could provide information about early abnormalities of LV regional motion and twist function in rTOF patients with preserved LV global function. Key points: ? Patients with rTOF presented significantly reduced systolic and diastolic Vz in the LV. ? rTOF patients demonstrated significantly increased diastolic Vr in the septum. ?

Most of the virtual screening methods in flaviviral drug discovery suffer from a low hit rate, strain-specific efficacy differences, and susceptibility to resistance. It is because they often fail to capture the key pharmacological features of the target active site critical for protein function inhibition. So in our current work, for the flaviviral NS3 protease, we summarized the pharmacophore features at the protease active site as anchors (subsite-moiety interactions). Results: For each of the four flaviviral NS3 proteases (i.e., HCV, DENV, WNV, and JEV), the anchors were obtained and summarized into 'Pharmacophore anchor (PA) models'. To capture the conserved pharmacophore anchors across these proteases, were merged the four PA models. We identified five consensus core anchors (CEH1, CH3, CH7, CV1, CV3) in all PA models, represented as the ""Core pharmacophore anchor (CPA) model"" and also identified specific anchors unique to the PA models. Our PA/CPA models complied with 89 known NS3 protease inhibitors. Furthermore, we proposed an integrated anchor-based screening method using the anchors from our models for discovering inhibitors. This method was applied on the DENV NS3 protease to screen FDA drugs discovering boceprevir, telaprevir and asunaprevir as promising anti-DENV candidates. Experimental testing against DV2-NGC virus by in-vitro plaque assays showed that asunaprevir and telaprevir inhibited viral replication with EC50 values of 10.4 μM &amp; 24.5 μM respectively. The structure-anchor-activity relationships (SAAR) showed that our PA/CPA model anchors explained the observed in-vitro activities of the candidates. Also, we observed that the CEH1 anchor engagement was critical for the activities of telaprevir and asunaprevir while the extent of inhibitor anchor occupation guided their efficacies. Conclusion: These results validate our NS3 protease PA/CPA models, anchors and the integrated anchor-based screening method to be useful in inhibitor discovery and lead optimization, thus accelerating flaviviral drug discovery. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Core and specific anchors; DENV NS3 protease; Flaviviral NS3 proteases; Integrated anchor-based virtual screening; Pharmacophore anchor models,Diagnosis; Drug products; Enzyme activity; Enzyme inhibition; Pharmacodynamics; Strain rate; Viruses; Anchor models; DENV NS3 protease; Experimental testing; Flaviviral NS3 proteases; NS3 protease inhibitors; Screening methods; Viral replication; Virtual Screening; Anchors; peptide hydrolase; chemistry; Dengue virus; drug repositioning; Flavivirus; genetics; human; immunology; procedures; Dengue Virus; Drug Repositioning; Flavivirus; Humans; Peptide Hydrolases,2-s2.0-85039750598

Even though dysregulations of histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to promote cancer cells survival, the role of different HDACs in the induction of hormone therapy resistance in ER+ breast cancer remains unclear. Survivin is a well-known pro-tumor survival molecule and miR-125a-5p is a recently discovered tumor suppressor. In this study, we found that ER+, hormone-independent, tamoxifen-resistant MCF7-TamC3 cells exhibit increased expression of HDAC2, HDAC5, and survivin, but show decreased expression of miR-125a-5p, as compared to the parental tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells. Molecular down-regulations of HDAC2, HDAC5, and survivin, and ectopic over-expression of miR-125a-5p, increased the sensitivity of MCF7-TamC3 cells to estrogen deprivation and restored the sensitivity to tamoxifen. The same treatments also further increased the sensitivity to estrogen-deprivation in the ER+ hormone-dependent ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells in vitro. Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of expression cohorts of breast tumor showed that high HDAC2 and survivin, and low miR-125a-5p, expression levels correlate with poor relapse-free survival in endocrine therapy and tamoxifen-treated ER+ breast cancer patients. Further molecular analysis revealed that HDAC2 and HDAC5 positively modulates the expression of survivin, and negatively regulates the expression miR-125a-5p, in ER+ MCF7, MCF7-TamC3, and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. These findings indicate that dysregulations of HDAC2 and HDAC5 promote the development of hormone independency and tamoxifen resistance in ERC breast cancer cells in part through expression regulation of survivin and miR-125a-5p. ? 2017 Huang, Tsai, Chen, Kuo, Kuo, Lee, Chen, Wu, Chuang, Cheng, Lin, Leung, Chang and Cheung.",Breast cancer; HDAC2; HDAC5; Hormone independent; MiR-125a-5p; Survivin,histone deacetylase 2; histone deacetylase 5; microRNA; microRNA 125a 5p; protein p53; survivin; tamoxifen; transcription factor Sp1; unclassified drug; Article; cancer hormone therapy; cancer resistance; cancer survival; controlled study; down regulation; drug sensitivity; ectopic expression; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; gene expression; gene overexpression; human; human cell; in vitro study; MCF-7 cell line; protein expression; recurrence free survival; upregulation; ZR-75 cell line,2-s2.0-85037735803

The activity of human Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase remains active and acts as an effector of checkpoint under replication stress. However, the downstream targets of Cdc7-Dbf4 contributed to checkpoint regulation and replication stress-support function in cancer are not fully identified. In this work, we showed that aberrant Cdc7-Dbf4 induces DNA lesions that activate ATM/ATR-mediated checkpoint and homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair. Using a phosphoproteome approach, we identified HSP90-S164 as a target of Cdc7-Dbf4 in vitro and in vivo. The phosphorylation of HSP90-S164 by Cdc7-Dbf4 is required for the stability of HSP90-HCLK2-MRN complex and the function of ATM/ATR signaling cascade and HR DNA repair. In clinically, the phosphorylation of HSP90-S164 indeed is increased in oral cancer patients. Our results indicate that aberrant Cdc7-Dbf4 enhances replication stress tolerance by rewiring ATR/ATM mediated HR repair through HSP90-S164 phosphorylation and by promoting recovery from replication stress.

Here we aimed to exploit adipose-derived stem cells from ovariectomized rats (OVX-ASCs) for bone healing. We unraveled that OVX-ASCs highly expressed miR-214 and identified 2 miR-214 targets: CTNNB1 (β-catenin) and TAB2. We demonstrated that miR-214 targeting of these two genes blocked the Wnt pathway, led to preferable adipogenesis and hindered osteogenesis. As a result, OVX-ASCs implantation into OVX rats failed to heal critical-size metaphyseal bone defects. We further engineered the OVX-ASCs with a novel Cre/loxP-based hybrid baculovirus vector that conferred prolonged expression of miR-214 sponge. Gene delivery for miR-214 sponge expression successfully downregulated miR-214 levels, activated the Wnt pathway, upregulated osteogenic factors β-catenin/Runx2, downregulated adipogenic factors PPAR-γ and C/EBP-α, shifted the differentiation propensity towards osteogenic lineage, enhanced the osteogenesis of co-cultured OVX-BMSCs, elevated BMP7/osteoprotegerin secretion and hindered exosomal miR-214/osteopontin release. Consequently, implanting the miR-214 sponge-expressing OVX-ASCs tremendously improved bone healing in OVX rats. Co-expression of miR-214 sponge and BMP2 further synergized the OVX-ASCs-mediated bone regeneration in OVX rats. This study implicates the potential of suppressing miR-214 by baculovirus-mediated gene delivery in osteoporotic ASCs for regenerative medicine. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"Bmp7 protein, rat; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; microRNA; Mirn214 microRNA,rat; osteogenic protein 1; osteopontin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; adipose tissue; animal; Baculoviridae; bone regeneration; cell culture; cell differentiation; cytology; female; genetics; human; mesenchymal stem cell; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; metabolism; postmenopause osteoporosis; procedures; rat; RNAi therapeutics; Sf9 cell line; Spodoptera; Sprague Dawley rat; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Baculoviridae; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7; Bone Regeneration; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Female; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; MicroRNAs; Osteopontin; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; PPAR gamma; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNAi Therapeutics; Sf9 Cells; Spodoptera",2-s2.0-85035104973

However, the precise mechanism of regulation and activity in tumors is not well known. We focused on CXCR3-A conformation and on the mechanisms controlling its activity and trafficking and investigated the role of CXCR3/LRP1 cross talk in tumor cell invasion. Here we report that agonist stimulation induces an anisotropic response with conformational changes of CXCR3-A along its longitudinal axis. CXCR3-A is internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles and recycled by retrograde trafficking. We demonstrate that CXCR3-A interacts with LRP1. Silencing of LRP1 leads to an increase in the magnitude of ligand-induced conformational change with CXCR3-A focalized at the cell membrane, leading to a sustained receptor activity and an increase in tumor cell migration. This was validated in patient-derived glioma cells and patient samples. Our study defines LRP1 as a regulator of CXCR3, which may have important consequences for tumor biology. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"beta arrestin; chemokine receptor CXCL4L1; chemokine receptor CXCR3; G protein coupled receptor; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; guanine nucleotide binding protein; ligand; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; small interfering RNA; syntaxin; unclassified drug; vimentin; chemokine receptor CXCR3; CXCR3 protein, human; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein; LRP1 protein, human; protein binding; brain; cancer; cells and cell components; enzyme activity; gene expression; ligand; tumor; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anisotropy; Article; biological activity; cell invasion; cell membrane; cell migration; cell stimulation; clathrin-coated vesicle; conformational transition; controlled study; embryo; enzyme activity; gene silencing; glioma; glioma cell; glioma cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; ligand binding; male; mouse; nonhuman; plasmon waveguide resonance; protein conformation; protein expression; protein function; protein interaction; regulatory mechanism; surface plasmon resonance; tumor cell; tumor invasion; animal; brain tumor; cell motion; chick embryo; gene expression regulation; genetics; glioblastoma; HEK293 cell line; knockout mouse; metabolism; multicellular spheroid; pathology; physiology; protein transport; tumor cell culture; tumor invasion; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Membrane; Cell Movement; Chick Embryo; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glioblastoma; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Receptors, CXCR3; Spheroids, Cellular; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-85034580147

The membranes were fabricated using spin coating technique on silicon substrates and were mounted on a frame for ease of device integration and handling. The membranes were characterized for their optical and elastic properties and compatibility with cell/tissue culture. It was possible to apply up to 10 kilopascal (kPa) pressure to perform cyclic stretch on 4?mm-diameter membranes for a period of 2?weeks at 0.2 hertz (Hz) frequency without mechanical failure. Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cells were cultured on the apical side of the PU membrane.

Recently, we found that NRF2 was overexpressed in a KB-derived drug-resistant cancer cell panel. In this panel, KB-7D cells, which show acquired resistance to topoisomerase II (Top II) poisons, exhibited the highest NRF2 activation. To investigate whether NRF2 directly contributed to acquired resistance against Top II poisons, we manipulated NRF2 by genetic and pharmacological approaches. The result demonstrated that silencing of NRF2 by RNA interference increased the sensitivity and treatment with NRF2 activator decreased the sensitivity of KB and KB-7D cells toward Top II poisons. Further, increased B-Raf–mediated NRF2 gene transcription and HATs–mediated NRF2 protein acetylation activated NRF2 signaling in KB-7D cells. Moreover, increased binding of NRF2 to an ARE in the promoter of ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1) directly contributed to Top II poison resistance. In addition, activation of NRF2 increased glutathione level and antioxidant capacity in KB-7D cells compared with that in KB cells; moreover, high glutathione level provided survival advantage to KB-7D cells. Our study is the first to show that aberrant NRF2 activation is via increased B-Raf–mediated NRF2 gene transcription and HATs–mediated NRF2 protein acetylation, which increases the acquired resistance and promote the survival of Top II poison-resistant cancer cells. Importantly, NRF2 downstream effectors ABCC1 and glutathione directly contribute to acquired resistance and survival, respectively. These results suggest that blockade of NRF2 signaling may enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce the survival of Top II poison-refractory tumors in clinical. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",ABCC1; Acquired resistance; Glutathione; NRF2; Topoisomerase II poisons,"B Raf kinase; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing); doxorubicin; etoposide; glutathione; histone acetyltransferase; multidrug resistance associated protein 1; RNA; transcription factor Nrf2; antineoplastic agent; B Raf kinase; BRAF protein, human; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing); doxorubicin; etoposide; glutathione; histone acetyltransferase; multidrug resistance associated protein; multidrug resistance-associated protein 1; NFE2L2 protein, human; small interfering RNA; transcription factor Nrf2; Article; cancer cell; cell survival; controlled study; drug resistance; gene silencing; genetic transcription; human; human cell; NRF2 gene; priority journal; protein acetylation; RNA interference; signal transduction; acetylation; antagonists and inhibitors; apoptosis; cell survival; drug effect; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; HeLa cell line; metabolism; promoter region; Acetylation; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Survival; DNA Topoisomerases, Type II; Doxorubicin; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Etoposide; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glutathione; HeLa Cells; Histone Acetyltransferases; Humans; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Transcription, Genetic",2-s2.0-85032692153

CISD2 was known to have aberrant expression in several types of human cancers. However, its relation with lung cancer is still not clear. In this study we found CISD2 mRNA was significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) samples, compared with their adjacent normal counterparts, and was correlated with tumor stage, grade, and prognosis based on analysis of clinical specimens-derived expression data in public domain and our validation assay. Cell based assay indicated that CISD2 expression regulated accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), polarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as cell viability, apoptosis, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity. In addition, CISD2 expression was found significantly correlated with stress response/redox signaling genes such as EGR1 and GPX3, while such correlations were also found valid in many public domain data. Taken together, upregulation of CISD2 is involved in an increased antioxidant capacity in response to elevated ROS levels during the formation and progression of lung ADC.

As the number of CTCs in patients is quite low, the present study aims towards a gentler diagnostic procedure so as not to lose too many CTCs during the sample preparation process. Hence, a Three-Dimensional Microwell dialysis (3D-μDialysis) chip was designed in this study to perform gentle fluorescence-removal process by using dialysis-type flow processes without centrifuging. This leads to a minimum manual handling of CTCs obtained in our study without any contamination. In addition, a rapid staining process which necessitates only about half the time of conventional techniques (35 minutes instead of 90 minutes) is being illustrated by the employment of dialysis process (by dynamically removing water and waste at once) instead of only static diffusion (by statically removing only waste by diffusion). Staining efficiency of our technique is improved over conventional staining because of the flow rate in 3D-μDialysis staining.

A549 human non-small lung cancer cells were treated with various local anaesthetics including ropivacaine, lidocaine, levobupivacaine and bupivacaine. Cell barrier property was assessed using an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of treated cells was studied by immunofluorescence staining. In vitro and in vivo cancer cell dissemination were investigated.Gene expression microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (qrt-PCR) assays were used to identify the genes responsible for levobupivacaine-mediated cancer cell dissemination.The results illustrated that only levobupivacaine induced EMT in the treated cells and also caused the dissemination of cancer cells in vitro. In addition, after intravenous injection, levobupivacaine encouraged cancer cell dissemination in vivo. Gene expression microarray, qrt-PCR and immunoblotting revealed that after levobupivacaine treatment, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)- 2α gene was upregulated in cancer cells.

There are several existing methods for diagnosis of CCA, though they are generally expensive, laborious, and suffer from low detection rates. Herein we first developed a means of partially purifying human bile for consequent injection into a microfluidic chip. Then, the novel microfluidic system, which featured 1) a cell capture module, 2) an immunofluorescence (IF) staining module featuring two CCA-specific biomarkers, and 3) an optical detection module for visualization of antibody probes bound to these CCA marker proteins, was used to detect bile duct cancer cells within partially purified bile samples. As a proof of concept, CCA cells were successfully captured and identified from CCA cell cultures, blood samples inoculated with CCA cells, and clinical bile specimens. In 7.5 ml of bile, this system could detect >2, 0, and 1 positive cells in advanced stage patients, healthy patients, and chemotherapy-treated patients, respectively. In conclusion, our microfluidic system could be a promising tool for detection of cancer cells in bile, even at the earliest stages of CCA when cancer cells are at low densities relative to the total population of epithelial cells. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"tumor marker; bile; bile duct carcinoma; blood; chemistry; early cancer diagnosis; fluorescent antibody technique; genetics; human; isolation and purification; lab on a chip; pathology; procedures; tumor cell line; Bile; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Cholangiocarcinoma; Early Detection of Cancer; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices",2-s2.0-85021672182

A viable biological organism should maintain in non-equilibrium states. How protein aggregate and why biological organisms can maintain in non-equilibrium states are not well understood. As a first step to understand such complex systems problems, we consider simple model systems containing polymer chains and solvent particles. The strength of the spring to connect two neighboring monomers in a polymer chain is controlled by a parameter s with s → ∞ for rigid-bond. The strengths of bending and torsion angle dependent interactions are controlled by a parameter s A with s A → -∞ corresponding to no bending and torsion angle dependent interactions. We find that for very small s A , polymer chains tend to aggregate spontaneously and the trend is independent of the strength of spring. For strong springs, the speed distribution of monomers in the parallel (along the direction of the spring to connect two neighboring monomers) and perpendicular directions have different effective temperatures and such systems are in non-equilibrium states. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85020433581

In healthy individuals, C. albicans represents a harmless commensal organism, but infections can be life threatening in immunocompromised patients. The complete genome sequence of C. albicans is extremely useful for identifying genes that may be potential drug targets and important for pathogenic virulence. However, there are still many uncharacterized genes in the Candida genome database. In this study, we investigated C. albicans Hom6, the functions of which remain undetermined experimentally. Methods HOM6-deleted and HOM6-reintegrated mutant strains were constructed. The mutant strains were compared with wild-type in their growth in various media and enzyme activity. Effects of HOM6 deletion on translation were further investigated by cell susceptibility to hygromycin B or cycloheximide, as well as by polysome profiling, and cell adhesion to polystyrene was also determined. Results C. albicans Hom6 exhibits homoserine dehydrogenase activity and is involved in the biosynthesis of methionine and threonine. HOM6 deletion caused translational arrest in cells grown under amino acid starvation conditions. Additionally, Hom6 protein was found in both cytosolic and cell-wall fractions of cultured cells. Furthermore, HOM6 deletion reduced C. albicans cell adhesion to polystyrene, which is a common plastic used in many medical devices. Conclusion Given that there is no Hom6 homologue in mammalian cells, our results provided an important foundation for future development of new antifungal drugs. ? 2016",Candida albicans; cell adhesion; Hom6; homoserine dehydrogenase; protein synthesis,"cycloheximide; homoserine dehydrogenase; hygromycin B; methionine; polystyrene; protein Hom6; threonine; unclassified drug; antifungal agent; fungal protein; homoserine dehydrogenase; methionine; polystyrene derivative; threonine; amino acid analysis; amino acid sequence; Article; Candida albicans; cell adhesion; cell cycle arrest; controlled study; enzyme activity; fungal strain; fungus growth; gene construct; gene deletion; nonhuman; polysome; protein function; protein synthesis; sequence alignment; biosynthesis; Candida albicans; cell adhesion; enzymology; fungal genome; genetics; human; metabolism; Amino Acid Sequence; Antifungal Agents; Candida albicans; Cell Adhesion; Fungal Proteins; Gene Deletion; Genome, Fungal; Homoserine Dehydrogenase; Humans; Methionine; Polystyrenes; Sequence Alignment; Threonine",2-s2.0-84963692174

As an alternative candidate target for therapy, here we identified an oncogene, ROS1, as an important driver for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) metastasis. Among tumors from 188 oral cancer patients, upregulated ROS1 expression strongly correlated with metastasis to lung and lymph nodes. Mechanistic studies uncover that the activated ROS1 results from highly expressed ROS1 gene instead of gene rearrangement, a phenomenon distinct from other cancers. Our data further reveal a novel mechanism that reduced histone methyltransferase EZH2 leads to a lower trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 suppressive modification, relaxes chromatin, and promotes the accessibility of the transcription factor STAT1 to the enhancer and the intron regions of ROS1 target genes, CXCL1 and GLI1, for upregulating their expressions.

Here we report a tumor-suppressive mode of action for growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) and an unusual mechanism of its inactivation in TNBC. GDF11 promotes an epithelial, anti-invasive phenotype in 3D triple-negative cultures and intraductal xenografts by sustaining expression of E-cadherin and inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2). Surprisingly, clinical TNBCs retain the GDF11 locus and expression of the protein itself. GDF11 bioactivity is instead lost because of deficiencies in its convertase, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5), causing inactive GDF11 precursor to accumulate intracellularly. PCSK5 reconstitution mobilizes the latent TNBC reservoir of GDF11 in vitro and suppresses triple-negative mammary cancer metastasis to the lung of syngeneic hosts. Intracellular GDF11 retention adds to the concept of tumor-suppressor inactivation and reveals a cell-biological vulnerability for TNBCs lacking therapeutically actionable mutations. Tumor suppressors are frequently inactivated by mutation, deletion, or silencing of the encoding gene. Bajikar et al. identify a tumor-suppressive role for growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) in triple-negative breast cancer and find GDF11 function is lost in this context through deficient protein maturation, causing intracellular accumulation of inactive pro-GDF11 precursor. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",scRNA-seq; stochastic profiling; systems biology; transforming growth factor-β,"growth differentiation factor; growth differentiation factor 11; inhibitor of differentiation 2; messenger RNA; myostatin; Smad4 protein; subtilisin; subtilisin kexin type 5; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; bone morphogenetic protein; cadherin; GDF11 protein, human; growth differentiation factor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; breast epithelium cell; cancer genetics; cell adhesion; cell maturation; cell structure; controlled study; female; gene inactivation; human; human tissue; immunofluorescence; immunoreactivity; in vitro study; metastasis; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; protein processing; RNA sequence; transcriptomics; triple negative breast cancer; tumor spheroid; unfolded protein response; animal; cell motion; cell proliferation; genetics; metabolism; mouse; physiology; triple negative breast cancer; tumor cell line; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Cadherins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Female; Growth Differentiation Factors; Humans; Mice; Phenotype; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85034106738

However, the AR is a key factor in luminal epithelium differentiation and was shown to have a role as a tumor suppressor. Thus, its inhibition may activate oncogenic pathways that contribute to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Herein, we report a novel tumor promoter, ZBTB46, which is negatively regulated by AR signaling via microRNA (miR)-1-mediated downregulation. ZBTB46 is associated with malignant prostate cancer and is essential for metastasis. Its overexpression can overcome the antitumor effects of miR-1 and promote androgen-independent proliferation. We demonstrated that ZBTB46 can transcriptionally regulate SNAI1, a key epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) driver, which could contribute to induction of the EMT after androgen-deprivation therapy and metastasis. Our findings are supportive of the model that disruption of AR's function may predispose prostate cancer to progress to metastatic CRPC. ? 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Our study of patients at three clinical sites showed increased serum miR-92a level with decreased kidney function. In cultured ECs, human CKD serum or uremic toxins (such as indoxyl sulfate), compared with non-CKDserum, induced the levels ofmiR-92a and suppressedthe expression ofmiR-92a targets, includingkey endothelial-protectivemolecules.The antioxidantN-acetylcysteine inhibited these vasculopathic properties.

However, the different compositions and mechanical properties of cartilage and subchondral bone show the complexity of this tissue interface, making it challenging for the design and fabrication of osteochondral graft substitute. In this study, a bilayer scaffold is developed to promote the regeneration of osteochondral tissue within a single integrated construct. It has the capacity to serve as a gene delivery platform to promote transfection of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and the functional osteochondral tissues formation. For the subchondral bone layer, the bone matrix with organic (type I collagen, Col) and inorganic (hydroxyapatite, Hap) composite scaffold has been developed through mineralization of hydroxyapatite nanocrystals oriented growth on collagen fibrils. We also prepare multi-shell nanoparticles in different layers with a calcium phosphate core and DNA/calcium phosphate shells conjugated with polyethyleneimine to act as non-viral vectors for delivery of plasmid DNA encoding BMP2 and TGF-β3, respectively. Microbial transglutaminase is used as a cross-linking agent to crosslink the bilayer scaffold. The ability of this scaffold to act as a gene-activated matrix is demonstrated with successful transfection efficiency. The results show that the sustained release of plasmids from gene-activated matrix can promote prolonged transgene expression and stimulate hMSCs differentiation into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages by spatial and temporal control within the bilayer composite scaffold. This improved delivery method may enhance the functionalized composite graft to accelerate healing process for osteochondral tissue regeneration.

The results show that the sustained release of plasmids including TGF-beta and BMP-2 from GAM could promote prolonged transgene expression and stimulate hMSCs differentiation into the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages by spatial control manner.

Methods The infrastructure of the proposed model comprises three domains: 1) the health measurement data warehouse (HMDW) for the case study repository, 2) the self-developed modules of online health risk information statistics (HRIStat) for cloud computing, and 3) the prototype of a Web-based process automation system in statistics (PASIS) for the health risk assessment of case studies with subject-enabled evaluation. The system design employed freeware including Java applications, MySQL, and R packages to drive a health risk expert system (HRES). In the design, the HRIStat modules enforce the typical analytics methods for biomedical statistics, and the PASIS interfaces enable process automation of the HRES for cloud computing. The Web-based model supports both modes, step-by-step analysis and auto-computing process, respectively for preliminary evaluation and real time computation. Results The proposed model was evaluated by computing prior researches in relation to the epidemiological measurement of diseases that were caused by either heavy metal exposures in the environment or clinical complications in hospital. The simulation validity was approved by the commercial statistics software. The model was installed in a stand-alone computer and in a cloud-server workstation to verify computing performance for a data amount of more than 230 K sets.

Twelve healthy participants stood on a sliding board (that was either locked and as such motionless or unlocked and as such free to move in the anterior–posterior direction). The body perturbations were applied either to the shoulders (by a pendulum impact) or the feet (by the movement of the sliding board). Electromyographic activity (EMG) of the trunk and lower extremity muscles was recorded. Latencies, integrals of EMG and muscle co-contraction (C) and reciprocal (R) activation indices were calculated and analyzed within the intervals typical for the APAs and CPAs. Higher EMG integrals were seen in the APAs phase when perturbation was applied to the shoulders. Reciprocal activation of muscles was seen in the APAs phase in the shoulders perturbation?condition, while co-contraction was seen in the feet perturbation?condition. Co-contraction was observed within the CPA phase in both experimental conditions. Higher C values were found in the feet perturbation condition in the CPA phase. The results suggest that different motor control strategies are employed by the central nervous system when encounter perturbations of similar magnitude but applied to different parts of the body. The outcome highlights the importance of investigation of the role of the point of application of the perturbation. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Anticipatory; Compensatory; Muscle activation; Perturbation; Point of application; Postural control,"acceleration; adult; Article; body position; comparative study; controlled study; electromyogram; electromyography; female; foot; human; human experiment; latent period; leg muscle; male; motor control; muscle contraction; neuromuscular function; normal human; point of application of perturbation; priority journal; shoulder; trunk; vertical posture; biomechanics; body equilibrium; physiology; skeletal muscle; young adult; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Postural Balance; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85028331898

They exhibit reduced synthesis and levels of circulating hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is an ephemeral gaseous molecule. Physiologically, H2S is an endogenous gasotransmitter with multiple biological functions. An emulsion method is utilized to prepare a microparticle system that comprises phase-change materials with a nearly constant temperature of phase transitions to encapsulate sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a highly water-labile H2S donor. An emulsion technique that can minimize the loss of water-labile active compounds during emulsification must be developed. The as-prepared microparticles (NaHS@MPs) provide an in situ depot for the sustained release of exogenous H2S under physiological conditions. The sustained release of H2S promotes several cell behaviors, including epidermal/endothelial cell proliferation and migration, as well as angiogenesis, by extending the activation of cellular ERK1/2 and p38, accelerating the healing of full-thickness wounds in diabetic mice. These experimental results reveal the strong potential of NaHS@MPs for the sustained release of H2S for the treatment of diabetic wounds. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Angiogenesis; Drug delivery; Gasotransmitter; Hydrogen sulfide; Refractory wound,"gasotransmitter; hydrogen sulfide; microsphere; angiogenesis; animal; cell motion; cell proliferation; drug effect; experimental diabetes mellitus; human; mouse; pathology; umbilical vein endothelial cell; wound healing; Animals; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Gasotransmitters; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Hydrogen Sulfide; Mice; Microspheres; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Wound Healing",2-s2.0-85027991216

The present study used a head-and-neck RANDO phantom to simulate the clinical conditions of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and compare the radiation doses between VMAT and IMRT. Three types of planning target volume (PTV) profiles were targeted by reducing the PTV surface margin by 0, 3, and 5 mm. An optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter was used to measure the surface doses. The results revealed that VMAT provided on average 16.8–13.8% lower surface doses within the PTV target areas than IMRT. When the PTV margin was reduced by 0 mm, the surface doses for IMRT reached their maximum value, accounting for 75.1% of its prescribed dose (Dp); however, the Dp value of VMAT was only 61.1%. When the PTV margin was reduced by 3 or 5 mm, the surface doses decreased considerably. The observed surface doses were insufficient when the tumours invaded the body surface; however, VMAT exerted larger skin-sparing effects than IMRT when the tumours away from the skin. These results suggest that the skin doses for these two techniques are insufficient for surface tumours. Notably, VMAT can provide lower skin doses for deep tumours. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Dosimetry; Intensity-modulated radiotherapy; Optically stimulated luminescence; Volumetric-modulated arc therapy,Diseases; Dosimeters; Dosimetry; Luminescence; Tumors; Head-and-neck cancer; Intensity-modulated radiotherapy; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Optically stimulated luminescence; Optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters; Planning target volumes; Stimulated luminescence; Volumetric modulated arc therapy; Radiotherapy; Article; body surface; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; dosimeter; intensity modulated radiation therapy; intermethod comparison; nasopharynx carcinoma; optical stimulated luminescence dosimeter; radiation dose; radiology phantom; radiotherapy planning system; simulation; volumetric modulated arc therapy,2-s2.0-85011311196

Many countries are paying substantial attention to carbon emissions to improve air quality and public health. The largest source of carbon emissions from human activities in some countries in Europe and elsewhere is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation. The prices of fuel and carbon emissions can influence each other. Owing to the importance of carbon emissions and their connection to fossil fuels, and the possibility of [1] Granger (1980) causality in spot and futures prices, returns, and volatility of carbon emissions, crude oil and coal have recently become very important research topics. For the USA, daily spot and futures prices are available for crude oil and coal, but there are no daily futures prices for carbon emissions. For the European Union (EU), there are no daily spot prices for coal or carbon emissions, but there are daily futures prices for crude oil, coal and carbon emissions. For this reason, daily prices will be used to analyse Granger causality and volatility spillovers in spot and futures prices of carbon emissions, crude oil, and coal. As the estimators are based on quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLE) under the incorrect assumption of a normal distribution, we modify the likelihood ratio (LR) test to a quasi-likelihood ratio test (QLR) to test the multivariate conditional volatility Diagonal BEKK model, which estimates and tests volatility spillovers, and has valid regularity conditions and asymptotic properties, against the alternative Full BEKK model, which also estimates volatility spillovers, but has valid regularity conditions and asymptotic properties only under the null hypothesis of zero off-diagonal elements. Dynamic hedging strategies by using optimal hedge ratios are suggested to analyse market fluctuations in the spot and futures returns and volatility of carbon emissions, crude oil, and coal prices. ? 2017 by the authors.",Carbon emissions; Coal; Crude oil; Diagonal BEKK; Dynamic hedging; Fossil fuels; Full BEKK; Granger causality; Green energy; Low carbon targets; Quasi likelihood ratio (QLR) test; Spot and futures prices; Volatility spillovers,air quality; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; coal; crude oil; emission control; environmental economics; European Union; fossil fuel; future prospect; Granger causality test; greenhouse gas; human activity; oil spill; price dynamics; volatilization; Europe; United States,2-s2.0-85030479747

An optimal response to BNCT depends critically on the time point of maximal 10B accumulation and highest tumor to normal ratio (T/N) for performing the neutron irradiation. The aggressive cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) representing a liver cancer that overexpresses COX-2 enzyme is aimed to be targeted by COX-2 selective boron carrier, fenbufen boronopinacol (FBPin). Two main works were performed including: 1) chemical synthesis of FBPin as the boron carrier and 2) radiochemical labeling with F-18 to provide the radiofluoro congener, m-[18F]fluorofenbufen ester boronopinacol (m-[18F]FFBPin), to assess the binding affinity, cellular accumulation level and distribution profile in CCA rats. FBPin was prepared from bromofenbufen via 3 steps with 82% yield. The binding assay employed [18F]FFBPin to compete FBPin for binding to COX-1 (IC50 = 0.91 ± 0.68 μM) and COX-2 (IC50 = 0.33 ± 0.24 μM). [18F]FFBPin-derived 60-min dynamic PET scans predict the 10B-accumulation of 0.8–1.2 ppm in liver and 1.2–1.8 ppm in tumor and tumor to normal ratio = 1.38 ± 0.12. BNCT was performed 40–55 min post intravenous administration of FBPin (20–30 mg) in the CCA rats. CCA rats treated with BNCT display more tumor reduction than that by NCT with respect of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy glucose uptake in the tumor region of interest, 20.83 ± 3.00% (n = 12) vs. 12.83 ± 3.79% (n = 10), P = 0.05. The visualizing agent [18F]FFBPin resembles FBPin to generate the time-dependent boron concentration profile. Optimal neutron irradiation period is thus determinable for BNCT. A boron-substituted agent based on COX-2-binding features has been prepared.

By utilizing the surface plasmon resonance effect, we were able to monitor changes in the color of a gold nanoparticle colloid based on the effects of single-stranded DNA probe molecules hybridizing with targeted double-stranded TB DNA. The hybridization event changes the surface charge density of the nanoparticles, causing them to aggregate to various degrees, which modifies the color of the solution in a manner that can be readily measured to determine the concentration of the targeted DNA analyte. In order to adapt this TB diagnosis method to resource-limited settings, we extended this label-free oligonucleotide and unmodified gold nanoparticle solution-based technique to a paper-based system that can be measured using a smartphone to obtain rapid parallel colorimetric results with low reagent consumption and without the need for sophisticated analytical equipment. In this study, we investigated various assay conditions, including the denaturing temperature and time, different oligonucleotide probe sequences, as well as the ratio of single stranded probe and double stranded target DNA. After optimizing these variables, we were able to achieve a detection limit of 1.95 × 10-2 ng/mL for TB DNA. Furthermore, multiple tests could be performed simultaneously with a 60 min turnaround time. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",biosensor; colorimetric assay; gold nanoparticles; paper-based analytical device; tuberculosis diagnosis,Analytic equipment; Bioassay; Biosensors; Color; Colorimetry; DNA; DNA sequences; Fiber optic sensors; Metal nanoparticles; Oligonucleotides; Paper; Probes; Surface plasmon resonance; Colorimetric assays; Colorimetric sensing; Nanoparticle colloids; Oligonucleotide probes; Paper-based analytical devices; Surface plasmon resonance effects; Tuberculosis diagnosis; Unmodified gold nanoparticles; Gold nanoparticles,2-s2.0-85029807374

While there is a growing interest in the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to address clinical problems, the use of deep-learning in healthcare have just gained attention recently. Deep learning, such as deep neural network (DNN), has achieved impressive results in the areas of speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing in recent years. However, deep learning is often difficult to comprehend due to the complexities in its framework. Furthermore, this method has not yet been demonstrated to achieve a better performance comparing to other conventional ML algorithms in disease prediction tasks using EMCs. In this study, we utilize a large population-based EMC database of around 800,000 patients to compare DNN with three other ML approaches for predicting 5-year stroke occurrence. The result shows that DNN and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) can result in similarly high prediction accuracies that are better compared to logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches. Meanwhile, DNN achieves optimal results by using lesser amounts of patient data when comparing to GBDT method. ? 2017 IEEE.",,"algorithm; artificial neural network; cerebrovascular accident; comparative study; factual database; human; machine learning; support vector machine; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks (Computer); Stroke; Support Vector Machine",2-s2.0-85032220809

To date, in addition to pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and neurosurgical therapies, gene delivery has emerged as a potential therapeutic modality for PD. Effective targeted gene delivery is complicated in that gene vectors cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus clinical tests must rely on invasive intracerebral gene vector injection. Burst low-pressure focused ultrasound exposure with microbubbles has been demonstrated to noninvasively target and temporally open the BBB, opening new opportunities to transport large molecule substances into the brain for central nervous system (CNS) disease treatment, and raising the potential for noninvasive gene delivery for PD treatment.

The main pathologic feature of AxD is the presence of Rosenthal fibers (RFs), homogeneous eosinophilic inclusions found in astrocytes. Because of difficulties in procuring patient' CNS tissues and the presence of RFs in other pathologic conditions, there is a need to develop an in vivo assay that can determine whether a mutation in the GFAP results in aggregation and is thus disease-causing. Methods: We found a GFAP mutation (c.382G>A, p.Asp128Asn) in a 68-year-old man with slowly progressive gait disturbance with tendency to fall. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with AxD based on clinical and radiological findings. To develop a vertebrate model to assess the aggregation tendency of GFAP, we expressed several previously reported mutant GFAPs and p.Asp128Asn GFAP in zebrafish embryos. Results: The most common GFAP mutations in AxD, p.Arg79Cys, p.Arg79His, p.Arg239Cys and p.Arg239His, and p.Asp128Asn induced a significantly higher number of GFAP aggregates in zebrafish embryos than wild-type GFAP. Conclusions: The p.Asp128Asn GFAP mutation is likely to be a disease-causing mutation. Although it needs to be tested more extensively in larger case series, the zebrafish assay system presented here would help clinicians determine whether GFAP mutations identified in putative AxD patients are disease-causing. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Alexander disease; Astrocyte; GFAP; Glial fibrillary acidic protein; Leukodystrophy; Rosenthal fibers; Zebrafish,glial fibrillary acidic protein; glial fibrillary acidic protein; aged; Alexander disease; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; ataxia; brain atrophy; brain damage; case report; clinical article; controlled study; dysarthria; dysphagia; dysphonia; embryo; fall risk; gait disorder; gene mutation; GFAP gene; human; human cell; hypertension; male; neuroimaging; neurologic examination; nonhuman; nystagmus; onset age; protein aggregation; radiological procedures; zebra fish; Alexander disease; animal; astrocyte; genetics; metabolism; mutation; Aged; Alexander Disease; Animals; Astrocytes; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Humans; Male; Mutation; Zebrafish,2-s2.0-85028938611

Inhibition of atrial fibrosis might be a plausible approach for AF prevention and therapy. This study is designed to evaluate the potential role of CD44, a membrane receptor known to regulate fibrosis, and its related signaling in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrosis and AF. Treatment of cultured rat atrial fibroblasts with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β, a key mediator of atrial fibrosis) led to a higher expression of hyaluronan (HA), CD44, STAT3, and collagen (a principal marker of fibrosis) than that of ventricular fibroblasts. In vivo, TGF-β transgenic mice and AF patients exhibited a greater expression of HA, CD44, STAT3, and collagen in their atria than wild-type mice and sinus rhythm subjects, respectively. Treating TGF-β transgenic mice with an anti-CD44 blocking antibody resulted in a lower expression of STAT3 and collagen in their atria than those with control IgG antibody. Programmed stimulation triggered less AF episodes in TGF-β transgenic mice treated with anti-CD44 blocking antibody than in those with control IgG. Blocking CD44 signaling with anti-CD44 antibody and mutated CD44 plasmids attenuated TGF-β-induced STAT3 activation and collagen expression in cultured atrial fibroblasts. Deletion and mutational analysis of the collagen promoter along with chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that STAT3 served as a vital transcription factor in collagen expression. TGF-β-mediated HA/CD44/STAT3 pathway plays a crucial role in the development of atrial fibrosis and AF. Blocking CD44-dependent signaling may be a feasible way for AF management. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Atrial fibrillation; Atrial fibrosis; CD44; Hyaluronan; Transforming growth factor-β,"collagen; Hermes antigen; immunoglobulin G; STAT3 protein; transforming growth factor beta; CD44 protein, human; Cd44 protein, mouse; collagen type 1; hyaluronic acid; hyaluronic acid binding protein; STAT3 protein; STAT3 protein, human; Stat3 protein, mouse; Stat3 protein, rat; TGFB1 protein, human; transforming growth factor beta1; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; atrial fibrillation; atrial fibrosis; chromatin immunoprecipitation; clinical article; controlled study; gain of function mutation; gene deletion; gene overexpression; heart fibroblast; heart muscle fibrosis; human; human tissue; in vivo study; loss of function mutation; male; mutational analysis; nonhuman; pathogenesis; promoter region; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; rat; signal transduction; transgenic mouse; wild type; animal; atrial fibrillation; cell culture; DBA mouse; disease model; fibroblast; fibrosis; genetics; heart atrium; heart atrium remodeling; heart rate; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; Wistar rat; Animals; Atrial Fibrillation; Atrial Remodeling; Cells, Cultured; Collagen Type I; Disease Models, Animal; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis; Heart Atria; Heart Rate; Hyaluronan Receptors; Hyaluronic Acid; Male; Mice, Inbred DBA; Mice, Transgenic; Rats, Wistar; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Transforming Growth Factor beta1",2-s2.0-85029182482

However, its biofunction as chemoprevention activity is seldom addressed. Herein, we aimed to characterize the anti-androgen-insensitive-prostate-cancer (anti-AIPC) bioactive compounds of Luobuma, and to investigate the associated molecular mechanisms. Activity-guided-fractionation (antioxidative activity and cell survivability) of Luobuma ethanolic extracts was performed to isolate and characterize the major bioactive compounds using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC), Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Plant sterols (lupeol, stigamasterol and β-sitosterol) and polyphenolics (isorhamnetin, kaempferol, and quercetin) were identified. Lupeol, a triterpene found in the fraction (F8) eluted by 10% ethyl acetate/90% hexane and accounted for 19.3% (w/w) of F8, inhibited the proliferation of PC3 cells. Both lupeol and F8 induced G2/M arrest, inhibition of β-catenin signaling, regulation of apoptotic signal molecules (cytochrome c, Bcl-2, P53, and caspase 3 and 8), and suppression DNA repair enzyme expression (Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG)). To our knowledge, our study is the first report that lupeol inhibited the expression of UNG to elicit the cytotoxicity against androgen-insensitive-prostate-cancer cells.

Therefore, we developed an integrated microfluidic system which could automatically perform selections of biomarkers and affinity reagents using phage display techniques. The experimental results showed that the selection of phage-displayed peptides bound to CCA cells was successfully demonstrated on the integrated microfluidic system using fewer reagents, samples and less time (5.25?h per biopanning round, and continuously performed for only 4 panning rounds). Three oligopeptides were screened, and their specificity and affinity toward CCA cells were characterized. Furthermore, comparing to conventional EpiEnrich beads for cancer cell capture, the screened CCA-specific peptides showed relatively low capture rate over control normal cells.

Method Fruits were purchased from supermarkets and washed with buffer. The pellets were re-suspended in medium after centrifugation. The cell suspensions were plated onto CHROMagar Candida medium. Yeasts were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing and their drug susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution assay. Results Of 184 isolates, comprised of 55 species, from 22 different types of fruits, 29 species, including Candida famata, Candida fermentati, Candida guilliermondii, Candida intermedia, Candida krusei, Candida orthopsilosis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida pelliculosa, Candida tropicalis, and others have been reported to cause diseases in humans. In addition to C. krusei, intrinsically resistant to fluconazole, all Rhodotorula and Rhodosporidium species were resistant to fluconazole. One each of C. tropicalis isolate was belonged to diploid sequence type (DST)149 and DST225, genotypes also detected in isolates from humans. Furthermore, the DST225 isolate was less susceptible to azole drugs. The susceptibilities to azole drugs for clinical and agricultural usage were associated to each other. Conclusion It is important to be aware of the existence of pathogenic yeasts, especially drug-resistant ones, on the fruit surfaces, a potential route for pathogenic yeasts to be transmitted to humans. ? 2017",Drug susceptibility; Environment; Fruit; Pathogenic yeast; Yeast diversity,"fluconazole; ribosome DNA; triadimenol; antifungal agent; fluconazole; pyrrole derivative; antifungal susceptibility; Article; broth dilution; Candida famata; Candida fermentati; Candida intermedia; Candida orthopsilosis; Candida parapsilosis; Candida tropicalis; cell suspension; controlled study; culture medium; DNA sequence; fruit; fungus identification; fungus transmission; genotype; Meyerozyma guilliermondii; nonhuman; Pichia kudriavzevii; Rhodosporidium; Rhodotorula; surface property; Wickerhamomyces anomalus; yeast; antifungal resistance; Candida; candidiasis; drug effects; fruit; genetics; human; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; pathogenicity; transmission; Antifungal Agents; Azoles; Candida; Candida tropicalis; Candidiasis; Drug Resistance, Fungal; Fluconazole; Fruit; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Sequence Analysis, DNA",2-s2.0-85021436644

Nal-P-113, a novel antimicrobial peptide whose histidine residues are replaced by the bulky amino acids β-naphthylalanine, causes the antimicrobial peptide to retain its bactericidal activity even in physiological environments. This study evaluated the effect of the novel antimicrobial peptide Nal-P-113 in a rat periodontitis model and the mechanisms of action of Nal-P-113 for suppressing periodontitis. Methods: Periodontitis was induced in mandibular first molars in rats receiving a ligature and infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis. Animals were randomly divided into six groups: a, P. gingivalis W83 alone; b, P. gingivalis W83 with 6.25 μg/mL of Nal-P-113; c, P. gingivalis W83 with 25 μg/mL of Nal-P-113; d, P. gingivalis W83 with 100 μg/mL of Nal-P-113; e, P. gingivalis W83 with 400 μg/mL of Nal-P-113; and f, control without P. gingivalis W83 or Nal-P-113. Morphometric analysis was used to evaluate alveolar bone loss. Microbiological assessment of the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis and total bacteria was performed using absolute quantitative real-time PCR and scanning electron microscopy. Gingival tissue was collected for western blot and immunohistochemical assays of IL-1β and TNF-α levels. Results: Alveolar bone loss was inhibited by 100 μg/mL or 400 μg/mL of Nal-P-113 compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Lower amounts of P. gingivalis and total bacteria were found in groups d and e compared with group a (P < 0.05). A decrease in the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α was detected in group d and group e compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The amount of P. gingivalis was positively correlated with IL-1β and TNF-α expression in periodontal tissue (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Nal-P-113 exhibited protective effects on Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced periodontitis in rats by limiting the amount of bacteria and modulating IL-1β and TNF-α production. The use of Nal-P-113 in vivo might serve as a beneficial preventive or therapeutic approach for periodontitis. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Alveolar bone loss; Animal model; Antimicrobial peptide; Inflammatory response; Periodontitis; Porphyromonas gingivalis,"cytokine; interleukin 1beta; nalp 113; polypeptide antibiotic agent; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; interleukin 1beta; peptide; tumor necrosis factor; alveolar bone loss; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterial growth; controlled study; cytokine production; immunohistochemistry; immunomodulation; male; microbiological examination; molar tooth; morphometry; nonhuman; periodontitis; Porphyromonas gingivalis; protein expression; quantitative analysis; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; scanning electron microscopy; Western blotting; animal; disease model; drug effects; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; metabolism; microbiology; periodontitis; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Interleukin-1beta; Male; Peptides; Periodontitis; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85028454998

In prostate cancer cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of TGFBI. ADT, AR antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of TGFBI suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate tumor growth and brain and bone metastasis in xenograft models, extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI.

In this work, the safety and efficacy of an SDS-containing bubble carrier system that is developed from an orally administered enteric-coated capsule are evaluated. The bubble carriers comprise diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) dianhydride, sodium bicarbonate (SBC), SDS, and insulin. Upon exposure to the intestinal fluid, DTPA dianhydride hydrolyzes to yield acids, and SBC rapidly reacts with these acids to generate CO2, producing bubble carriers, each containing a self-assembling water film. The hydrophilic insulin is entrapped in the self-assembled water film, which is stabilized by SDS. The SDS in the bubble carrier system can act as a dissolution enhancer in the dispersion of insulin molecules, as a surfactant that stabilizes the bubble carriers, as a protease inhibitor that protects the protein drug, and as a permeation enhancer that augments its oral bioavailability. Hence, a significant increase in the plasma insulin level and an excellent blood glucose-lowering response in diabetic rats are effectively achieved. Moreover, the enhancement of epithelial permeation by this SDS-containing formulation does not promote the absorption of intestinal endotoxins. The above facts indicate that the bubble carrier system that is stabilized by SDS can be used as a safe and potent carrier in the oral delivery of therapeutic proteins. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Blood glucose-lowering effect; Diabetes mellitus; Endotoxin; Oral protein delivery; Permeability enhancer,"Biochemistry; Blood; Carbon dioxide; Enzyme inhibition; Glucose; Insulin; Proteins; Sodium; Sodium bicarbonate; Sodium sulfate; Blood glucose; Diabetes mellitus; Endotoxin; Enteric-coated capsules; Epithelial permeability; Oral bioavailabilities; Oral protein delivery; Plasma insulin levels; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; bicarbonate; dodecyl sulfate sodium; endotoxin; glucose; insulin; pentetic acid; protein; trypsin; antidiabetic agent; bicarbonate; dodecyl sulfate sodium; drug carrier; insulin; pentetic acid; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; area under the curve; Article; bubble carrier system; confocal laser scanning microscopy; drug delivery system; drug transport; enzymatic degradation; ex vivo study; fluorescence imaging; glucose blood level; high performance liquid chromatography; histopathology; hydrolysis; hydrophilicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; insulin blood level; intestine fluid; maximum plasma concentration; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; surface tension; therapy effect; time to maximum plasma concentration; analysis; animal; blood; Caco-2 cell line; chemistry; experimental diabetes mellitus; human; oral drug administration; Wistar rat; Administration, Oral; Animals; Blood Glucose; Caco-2 Cells; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Drug Carriers; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Pentetic Acid; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Sodium Bicarbonate; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; Trypsin",2-s2.0-85008233732

A main reason for this is the presence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) or blood–tumor barrier (BTB), preventing liposomal drugs from crossing at a therapeutically meaningful level. Focused ultrasound (FUS) in conjunction with microbubbles (MBs) has been suggested in many studies to be an effective approach to increase the BBB or BTB permeability. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of enhancing the delivery of PTX-LIPO in intracranial glioblastoma-bearing nude mice using pulsed low-intensity FUS exposure in the presence of MBs. Our results showed that the delivery efficiency of PTX-LIPO could be effectively improved in terms of the penetration of both the BBB in vitro and BTB in vivo by pulsed FUS sonication with a 10 ms pulse length and 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency at 0.64 MPa peak-rarefactional pressure in the presence of MBs. Quantitative analysis showed that a 2-fold higher drug concentration had accumulated in the glioblastoma 3 h after FUS treatment, with 7.20±1.18 μg PTX per g glioma tissue. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging analysis illustrated that the intracranial glioblastoma progression in nude mice treated with PTX-LIPO delivered via FUS with MBs was suppressed consistently for 4 weeks compared to the untreated group. The medium survival time of these tumor-bearing nude mice was significantly prolonged by 20.8%, compared to the untreated nude mice. Immunohistochemical analysis further confirmed the antiproliferation effect and cell apoptosis induction. Our study demonstrated that noninvasive low-intensity FUS with MBs can be used as an effective approach to deliver PTX-LIPO in order to improve their chemotherapy efficacy toward glioblastoma. ? 2017 Shen et al.",Blood-brain barrier; Focused ultrasound; Microbubbles; Paclitaxel liposomes,"liposome; paclitaxel; antineoplastic agent; liposome; paclitaxel; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; blood brain barrier; blood umor barrier; cancer survival; concentration response; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug distribution; echography; feasibility study; frequency modulation; glioblastoma; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; microbubble; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nude mouse; permeability barrier; quantitative analysis; survival time; animal; brain tumor; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; drug delivery system; drug effects; drug screening; echography; glioblastoma; human; procedures; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain Neoplasms; Drug Delivery Systems; Glioblastoma; Humans; Liposomes; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mice, Nude; Microbubbles; Paclitaxel; Ultrasonography; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85027366271

In severe cases, C. difficile infection (CDI) can cause toxic megacolon, intestinal perforation, and death. The intestinal epithelium is the first tissue encountered in the adhesion and colonization of C. difficile, and serves as a physical defense barrier against infection. Despite the well-characterized cytotoxicity, few studies have investigated the genome-wide interplay between host cells and C. difficile. The aim of this study is to investigate the genetic-and-epigenetic molecular mechanisms between human colorectal epithelial Caco-2 cells and C. difficile during the early (0-60 min) and late stages (30-120 min) of infection. To investigate the cross-talk mechanisms during the progression of infection, we introduced a systems biology approach using big data mining, dynamic network modeling,a genome-wide data identification method, system order detection scheme, and principal network projection method (PNP). We focused on the construction of genome-wide genetic-and-epigenetic interspecies networks (GEINs) and subsequent extraction of host-pathogen core networks (HPNs) to investigate the progression of underlying host/pathogen genetic-and-epigenetic mechanisms from the early to late stages of CDI. Based on our results, we suggest that the cell-wall proteins CD2787 and CD0237, which both play an important role in cell adhesion and pathogen defense mechanisms, can be considered as potential drug targets. In addition, the crucial proteins employed by C. difficile for sporulation, including CD1214, CD2629, and CD2643, can also be considered as potential drug targets since spore-mediated re-infection is a critical issue. ? 2017 Li, Su and Chen.",Caco-2 cells; Clostridium difficile; Clostridium difficile infection; Cross-talk molecular mechanism; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; Genetic-and-epigenetic interspecies network; Reactive oxygen species,acyltransferase; cell membrane protein; fibronectin; growth factor receptor bound protein 2; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 8; leucine rich repeat kinase 2; membrane cofactor protein; methyltransferase; p21 activated kinase 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; Rho guanine nucleotide binding protein; transcription factor Rel; transcription factor YY1; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; bacterial colonization; bacterium adherence; cell adhesion; cell damage; Clostridium difficile infection; controlled study; cytotoxicity; data mining; defense mechanism; DNA damage response; endoplasmic reticulum stress; epigenetics; genome-wide association study; host pathogen interaction; human; human cell; immune response; inflammation; mathematical model; microarray analysis; molecular interaction; principal network projection; protein expression; protein folding; protein homeostasis; protein interaction; real time polymerase chain reaction; transcription regulation,2-s2.0-85026756724

Here, we demonstrated that the loss of Drosophila Vps35 (dVps35) affects synaptic vesicle recycling, dopaminergic synaptic release and sleep behavior associated with dopaminergic activity, which is rescued by the expression of wild-type dVps35 but not the PD-associated mutant dVps35 D647N. Drosophila LRRK2 dLRRK together with Rab5 and Rab11 is also implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling, and the manipulation of these activities improves the Vps35 synaptic phenotypes. These findings indicate that defects of synaptic vesicle recycling in which two late-onset PD genes, Vps35 and LRRK2, are involved could be key aspects of PD etiology. ?

Here, we investigated the driver gene mutation–independent mechanism for cetuximab resistance in HNSCC. Experimental Design: We used the in vitro-selected and in vivo-selected cetuximab-resistant sublines of HNSCC cell lines for investigating the mechanism of acquired resistance to cetuximab. Zebrafish model was applied for evaluating the synergistic effect of combinatory drugs for overcoming cetuximab resistance. Results: The cetuximab-resistant HNSCC cells undergo a Snail-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, Snail induces the expression of lymphotoxin-b (LTb), a TNF superfamily protein that activates NF-kB, and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), an arginine methyltransferase that methylates EGFR. LTb interacts with methylated EGFR to promote its ligand-binding ability and dimerization. Furthermore, LTb activates the NF-kB pathway through a LTb receptor–independent mechanism. Combination of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a NF-kB inhibitor effectively suppressed cetuximab-resistant HNSCC and interfering with the EGFR–LTb interaction reverses resistance. Conclusions: Our findings elucidate the mechanism of driver gene mutations–independent mechanism of acquired resistance to cetuximab in HNSCC and also provide potential strategies for combating cetuximab resistance. ?2017 AACR.",,"afatinib; bortezomib; cetuximab; epidermal growth factor receptor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lymphotoxin beta; parthenolide; protein arginine methyltransferase; tumor necrosis factor; cetuximab; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; LTB protein, human; lymphotoxin beta; PRMT1 protein, human; protein arginine methyltransferase; protein kinase inhibitor; repressor protein; snail-1 protein, zebrafish; transcription factor Snail; zebrafish protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; dimerization; drug potentiation; embryo; enzyme activation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene mutation; head and neck cancer; head and neck cancer cell line; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; ligand binding; major clinical study; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; snail; zebra fish; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; disease model; drug effect; drug resistance; drug screening; genetics; head and neck tumor; mouse; mutation; pathology; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cetuximab; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Lymphotoxin-beta; Mice; Mutation; NF-kappa B; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Repressor Proteins; Snail Family Transcription Factors; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-85027147569

The signaling pathways mediated by these receptors are the dominant drivers of cell proliferation and survival in most human breast cancers. One of the most frequently overactivated pathways in breast cancer is the AKT signaling cascade. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) acts as a switch to turn off signal transduction in the AKT pathway; however, it is frequently inactivated in many cancers by phosphorylation of Tyr-307 to form phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (p-PP2A). This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of p-PP2A and phospho-AKT (p-AKT) expression in 672 patients with breast cancer during a 15-year follow-up. The breast tissue microarray was evaluated for p-PP2A and p-AKT expression using IHC staining and scores. Analysis of IHC staining results revealed that p-PP2A expression was positively correlated with HER2, Ki-67, and p-AKT overexpression (P?<?.001, P?=?.003, and P?=?.001, respectively). At the time of diagnosis, breast cancer patients with higher p-PP2A expression had significantly shorter 15-year OS than patients with lower p-PP2A expression did (P?=?.017). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high p-PP2A expression was an independent prognostic factor for shorter OS (hazard ratio, 1.741; P?=?.012). Our data revealed that high p-PP2A expression is positively associated with HER2, Ki-67, and p-AKT expression. High p-PP2A expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer, especially in patients with TNBC. ? 2017",Breast cancer; HER2; Ki-67; p-AKT; PP2A,"epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; Ki 67 antigen; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A; progesterone receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; Ki 67 antigen; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2; protein kinase B; tumor marker; adult; age; Article; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; clinical outcome; disease severity; female; follow up; gene overexpression; human; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; middle aged; overall survival; prediction; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; tissue microarray; aged; Breast Neoplasms; chi square distribution; enzymology; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; multivariate analysis; pathology; phosphorylation; proportional hazards model; register; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; upregulation; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Ki-67 Antigen; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Phosphorylation; Proportional Hazards Models; Protein Phosphatase 2; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Receptor, ErbB-2; Registries; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Tissue Array Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85026888741

Uromodulin is a protein with a renal protective effect, and may be subject to glycation. The implications of uromodulin glycation and AGEs in the urine are not understood. Here, immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified glycated uromodulin (glcUMOD) in the urine of 62.5% of patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), 20.0% of patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD), and no DM patients with normal renal function or healthy control participants; a finding replicated in a larger cohort of 84 patients with CKD in a case-control study (35 with DM, 49 without). Uromodulin forms high molecular weight polymers that associate with microvesicles and exosomes. Differential centrifugation identified uromodulin in the supernatant, microvesicles, and exosomes of the urine of healthy participants, but only in the supernatant of samples from patients with DKD, suggesting that glycation influences uromodulin function. Finally, the diagnostic and prognostic utility of measuring urinary glcUMOD concentration was examined. Urinary glcUMOD concentration was substantially higher in DKD patients than non-diabetic CKD patients. Urinary glcUMOD concentration predicted DKD status, particularly in patients with CKD stages 1-3a aged < 65 years and with urine glcUMOD concentration ?9,000 arbitrary units (AU). Urinary uromodulin is apparently glycated in DKD and forms AGEs, and glcUMOD may serve as a biomarker for DKD. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"biological marker; Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein; advanced glycation end product; biological marker; Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein; adult; aged; Article; case control study; centrifugation; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; disease severity; exosome; female; glycation; human; immunoprecipitation; kidney function; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; male; membrane microparticle; molecular weight; priority journal; urine level; diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; metabolism; middle aged; procedures; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; severity of illness index; urine; Aged; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Nephropathies; Female; Glycosylation End Products, Advanced; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Uromodulin",2-s2.0-85023613070

The purpose of this study is to develop biodegradable nanoparticles composed of natural polypeptides and calcium phosphate (CaP) with sequential pH-responsivity to tumor microenvironments for active targeted drug delivery. Two different amphiphilic copolymers, poly(ethylene glycol) 3400 -aconityl linkage-poly(L-glutamic acid) 15 -poly(L-histidine) 10 -poly(L-leucine) 10 and LyP1-poly(ethylene glycol) 1100 -poly(L-glutamic acid) 15 -poly(L-histidine) 10 -poly(L-leucine) 10 , were exploited to self-assemble into micelles in aqueous phase. The bio-stable nanoparticles provide three distinct functional domains: the anionic PGlu shell for CaP mineralization, the protonation of PHis segment for facilitating anticancer drug release at target site, and the hydrophobic core of PLeu for encapsulation of anticancer drugs. Furthermore, the hydrated PEG outer corona is used for prolonging circulation time, while the active targeting ligand, LyP-1, is served to bind to breast cancer cells and lymphatic endothelial cells in tumor for inhibiting metastasis. Mineralized DOX-loaded nanoparticles (M-DOX NPs) efficiently prevent the drug leakage at physiological pH value and facilitate the encapsulated drug release at acidic condition when compared to DOX-loaded nanoparticles (DOX NPs). M-DOX NPs with LyP-1 targeting ligand effectively accumulated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The inhibition effect on cell proliferation also enhances with time, illustrating the prominent anti-tumor efficacy. Moreover, the in vitro metastatic inhibition model shows the profound inhibition effect of inhibitory nanoparticles. In brief, this self-assembling peptide-based drug delivery nanocarrier with multifunctionality and programmable pH-sensitivity is of great promise and potential for anti-cancer therapy. Statement of Significance This tailored-design polypeptide-based nanoparticles with self-assembling and programmable stimulus-responsive properties enable to 1) have stable pH in physiological value with a low level of drug loss and effectively release the encapsulated drug with pH variations according to the tumor microenvironment, 2) enhance targeting ability to hard-to-treat breast cancer cells and activate endothelial cells (tumor region), 3) significantly inhibit the growth and prevent from malignant metastasis of cancer cells in consonance with promising anti-tumor efficacy, and 4) make tumors stick to localized position so that these confined solid tumors can be more accessible by different treatment modalities.

In this work, CRP-specific aptamers with high sensitivity and specificity and fieldeffect- transistor (FET) devices were used to recognize and detect CRP by using an integrated microfluidic system automatically while consuming less volumes of reagents and samples (about 5 μm). In order to package the FET device into the microfluidic chip, a new method to prevent liquid leakage was proposed. Sensitive detection of CRP has been demonstrated on the developed microfluidic system. It is the first time that aptamer-FET assays could be realized on an integrated microfluidic system.

The present study aimed to investigate the anti-small cell lung cancer (SCLC) effects of MeCDDA in vitro and in vivo, as well as to elucidate its underlying mechanism. Our results indicated that H1688 and H146 cells show relevant sensitivity to MeCDDA, and the exposure to MeCDDA in SCLC cells caused dose-dependent growth inhibitory responses. In addition, MeCDDA treatment promoted cell apoptosis and increased the activities of caspases in H1688 cells, reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential and stimulating the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Along with the increase in Bax expression and reduction in Bcl-2, the MeCDDA treatment also significantly decreased Akt and mTOR phosphorylation. Finally, MeCDDA treatment in the mouse xenograft model of H1688 cells exhibited significant inhibition of tumor growth, corroborating MeCDDA as a potential pre-clinical candidate for the treatment of SCLC. Overall, our results demonstrate that the cytotoxic effects of MeCDDA towards H1688 and H146 cells, possibly through the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, merit further studies for its possible clinical application in chemotherapy. ?2017 by the authors.

This disease is characterized by the accumulation of cytoplasmic protein aggregates, known as Rosenthal fibers. Antibodies specific to GFAP could provide invaluable tools to facilitate studies of the normal biology of GFAP and to elucidate the pathologic role of this IF protein in disease. While a large number of antibodies to GFAP are available, few if any of them have defined epitopes. Here we described the characterization of a panel of commonly used anti-GFAP antibodies, which recognized epitopes at regions extending across the rod domain of GFAP. We show that all of the antibodies are useful for immunoblotting and immunostaining, and identify a subset that preferentially recognized human GFAP. Using these antibodies, we demonstrate the presence of biochemically modified forms of GFAP in brains of human AxD patients and mouse AxD models. These data suggest that this panel of anti-GFAP antibodies will be useful for studies of animal and cell-based models of AxD and related diseases in which cytoskeletal defects associated with GFAP modifications occur. ? 2017 Lin et al.

In this study, we created two mutants, chicken interleukin-1 beta (ChIL-1β) Q19A and R140A, which exhibited significantly increased in vivo biological activity compared with wild-type ChIL-1β. The potential mucosal adjuvant activity of the mutants Q19A and R140A was evaluated in chickens through the intranasal coadministration of a single dose of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine with Q19A or R140A. Compared with chickens vaccinated with only the NDV vaccine or the NDV vaccine plus wild-type recombinant ChIL-1β, chickens vaccinated with Q19A or R140A had significantly increased serum hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers and anti-NDV-specific IgA antibody levels 1 week later, a high amount of interferon-γ secretion from splenocytes, and increased secretory IgA accumulated in nasal tissues. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations of the mutant R140A bound to its receptor (IL-1RI) and receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) were more energetically favorable than the analogous wild-type ternary complex resulting in a decreased energy, which may stabilize the R140A/IL-1RI/IL-1RAcP complex. In conclusion, the mutants Q19A and R140A are effective adjuvants that accelerate and enhance chicken mucosal immunity when co-administered with one dose of the NDV vaccine. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Interleukin-1 beta; Molecular dynamics simulations; Mucosal immunity; Vaccine adjuvant,"gamma interferon; hemagglutination inhibiting antibody; immunoglobulin A antibody; immunological adjuvant; interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein; interleukin 1beta; Newcastle disease vaccine; secretory immunoglobulin; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin A; immunological adjuvant; interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein; interleukin 1 receptor type I; interleukin 1beta; virus antibody; virus vaccine; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; antibody blood level; antibody titer; Article; biological activity; circular dichroism; controlled study; cytokine release; experimental chicken; in vivo study; molecular dynamics; mucosal immunity; nonhuman; priority journal; single drug dose; spleen cell; vaccination; X ray crystallography; amino acid sequence; animal; chicken; immunology; mucosal immunity; Newcastle disease; Newcastle disease virus; procedures; vaccination; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Chickens; Immunity, Mucosal; Immunoglobulin A; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein; Interleukin-1beta; Newcastle Disease; Newcastle disease virus; Receptors, Interleukin-1 Type I; Vaccination; Viral Vaccines",2-s2.0-85019375042

Whilst the binding sites for desmin on CRYAB have been determined, desmin epitopes responsible for CRYAB binding and also the parameters that determine CRYAB binding to desmin filaments are unknown. Using a combination of co-sedimentation centrifugation, viscometric assays and electron microscopy of negatively stained filaments to analyse the in vitro assembly of desmin filaments, we show that the binding of CRYAB to desmin is subject to its assembly status, to the subunit organization within filaments formed and to the integrity of the C-terminal tail domain of desmin. Our in vitro studies using a rapid assembly protocol, C-terminally truncated desmin and two disease-causing mutants (I451M and R454W) suggest that CRYAB is a sensor for the surface topology of the desmin filament. Our data also suggest that CRYAB performs an assembly chaperone role because the assembling filaments have different CRYAB-binding properties during the maturation process.

Because it has the power to affect human emotion, music has gained a place in work environments and in sports training as a way to enhance the performance of particular tasks. Studies have shown that office workers perform certain jobs better and joggers run longer distances when listening to music. However, a personalized music system which can automatically recommend songs according to user’s physiological response remains absent. Therefore, this study aims to establish an intelligent music selection system for individual users to enhance their learning performance. We first created an emotional music database using data analytics classifications. During testing, innovative wearable sensing devices were used to detect heart rate variability (HRV) in experiments, which subsequently guided music selection. User emotions were then analyzed and appropriate songs were selected by using the proposed application software (App). Machine learning was used to record user preference, ensuring accurate and precise classification. Significant results generated through experimental validation indicate that this system generates high satisfaction levels, does not increase mental workload, and improves users’ performance.

Another recombinant protein rDA27(aa 33-84) that removes the GAGs-binding sequences was also used for comparison. Three types of A27-coated FNDs were generated, including rA27(aa 21-84)-FND, rDA27(aa 33-84)-FND, and hybrid rA27(aa 21-84)/rDA27(aa 33-84)-FND.

The nanoaircraft is composed of ultrasmall GQDs (less than 5 nm) functionalized with a pH-sensitive polymer that demonstrates an aggregation transition at weak acidity of tumor environment but is stable at physiological pH with stealth function. A size conversion of the SCNA at the tumor site is further actuated by near-infrared irradiation, which disassembles 150 nm of SCNA into 5 nm of doxorubicin (DOX)/GQD like a bomb-loaded jet, facilitating the penetration into the deep tumor tissue. At the tumor, the penetrated DOX/GQD can infect neighboring cancer cells for repeated cell killing.

Approved drugs–imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib–target the ATP-binding site of Abl kinase. Even though these drugs are initially effective, long-term usefulness is limited by the development of resistance. To overcome this problem, targeting the allosteric site of Abl kinase, which is remote from the ATP-binding site is found to be a useful strategy. In this study, structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods were applied to narrow down possible drugs (from DrugBank database) that could target the allosteric site of Abl kinase. Detailed investigations of the selected drugs in the allosteric site of Abl kinase, using molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics simulation shows that gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor approved for the treatment of lung cancer, could bind effectively to the allosteric site of Bcr-Abl. More interestingly, gefitinib was found to enhance the ability of imatinib to bind at the ATP-binding site of Bcr-Abl kinase. Based on the in silico findings, gefitinib was tested in combination with imatinib in K562 CML cell line using MTT cell proliferation assay and found to have a synergistic antiproliferative activity. Further detailed mechanistic study could help to unravel the full potential of imatinib–gefitinib combination for the treatment of CML. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",allosteric inhibitor; Bcr-Abl inhibitor; chronic myeloid leukemia; drug repurposing; molecular dynamics simulation; steered molecular dynamics simulation; virtual screening,"Abelson kinase; antileukemic agent; BCR ABL protein; gefitinib; gnf 2; imatinib; leflunomide; pioglitazone; pranlukast; sorafenib; teriflunomide; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; dasatinib; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; imatinib; protein binding; protein kinase inhibitor; quinazoline derivative; allosteric site; antiproliferative activity; Article; binding site; chronic myeloid leukemia; computer model; drug database; drug potentiation; drug repositioning; drug screening; in vitro study; molecular dynamics; MTT assay; pharmacophore; priority journal; allosteric site; alpha helix; antagonists and inhibitors; beta sheet; cell proliferation; chemical database; chemistry; drug combination; drug effects; drug resistance; enzyme active site; human; K-562 cell line; metabolism; protein domain; thermodynamics; Allosteric Site; Antineoplastic Agents; Binding Sites; Catalytic Domain; Cell Proliferation; Dasatinib; Databases, Chemical; Drug Combinations; Drug Repositioning; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Drug Synergism; Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl; Humans; Imatinib Mesylate; K562 Cells; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical; Protein Conformation, beta-Strand; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Quinazolines; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Thermodynamics",2-s2.0-84976394385

Non-viral gene delivery using ultrasound-targeted microbubbles (MBs) oscillation via the systematic transvascular route is attractive, but there is currently no high-yielding and targeted gene expression method. In this study, we developed a non-viral and angiogenesis-targeting gene delivery approach for efficient brain tumor gene therapy without brain damage. We developed a VEGFR2-targeted and cationic microbubbles (VCMBs) gene vector for use with transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) exposure to allow transient gene delivery. The system was tested in a brain tumor model using the firefly luciferase gene and herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (pHSV-TK/GCV) with VCMBs under FUS exposure for transgene expression and anti-tumor effect. In vitro data showed that VCMBs have a high DNA-loading efficiency and high affinity for cancer cells. In vivo data confirmed that this technique enhanced gene delivery into tumor tissues without affecting normal brain tissues. The VCMBs group resulted in higher luciferase expression (3.8 fold) relative to the CMBs group (1.9 fold), and the direct injection group. The tumor volume on day 25 was significantly smaller in rats treated with the pHSV-TK/GCV system using VCMBs under FUS (9.7 ± 5.2 mm3) than in the direct injection group (40.1 ± 4.3 mm3). We demonstrated the successful use of DNA-loaded VCMBs and FUS for non-viral, non-invasive and targeted gene delivery to brain tumors. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Angiogenesis-targeting; Blood-brain barrier; HSV-TK/GCV system; Non-viral gene delivery; Ultrasound,"Blood; Brain; Direct injection; Diseases; Gene expression; Gene transfer; Genes; Histology; Tissue; Tumors; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonics; Viruses; Angiogenesis targeting; Blood-brain barrier; Herpes simplex virus type 1; HSV-TK/GCV system; Luciferase expression; Non-viral gene delivery; Targeted gene delivery; Targeted microbubbles; Gene therapy; luciferase; vasculotropin receptor; DNA; firefly luciferase; Kdr protein, rat; vasculotropin receptor 2; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; blood brain barrier; brain tissue; brain tumor; cancer gene therapy; cell membrane permeability; controlled study; echography; exposure; gene targeting; gene therapy; gene vector; genetic transfection; glioma; glioma cell; human; human tissue; in vivo study; microbubble; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein stability; protein targeting; rat; tumor gene; tumor growth; animal; brain tumor; gene therapy; genetics; glioma; neovascularization (pathology); Sprague Dawley rat; ultrasound; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; DNA; Genetic Therapy; Glioma; Luciferases, Firefly; Microbubbles; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Ultrasonic Waves; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2",2-s2.0-85018831528

We study a specific structure of the fitness landscape: One of the intermediate mutations on the mutation path results in either a large fitness value (climbing up a fitness hill) or a low fitness value (crossing a fitness canyon), the rest of the mutations besides the last one are neutral, and the last sequence has much higher fitness than any intermediate sequence. We derive analytical formulas for the first arrival time of the mutant with two point mutations. For the first arrival problem for the further mutants in the case of canyon crossing, we analytically deduce how the mean first arrival time scales with the population size and fitness difference. The location of the canyon on the path of sequences has a crucial role. If the canyon is at the beginning of the path, then it significantly prolongs the first arrival time; otherwise it just slightly changes it. Furthermore, the fitness hill at the beginning of the path strongly prolongs the arrival time period; however, the hill located near the end of the path shortens it. We optimize the first arrival time by applying a nonzero selection to the intermediate sequences. We extend our results and provide a scaling for the valley crossing time via the depth of the canyon and population size in the case of a fitness canyon at the first position. Our approach is useful for understanding some complex evolution systems, e.g., the evolution of cancer. ? 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Population statistics; Analytical formulas; Complex evolutions; Finite population; Fitness difference; Fitness landscape; Fitness values; Population sizes; Wright-Fisher models; Computer integrated manufacturing; biological model; computer simulation; evolution; mutation; reproductive fitness; time factor; Biological Evolution; Computer Simulation; Genetic Fitness; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85020735394

In experiments about call block probabilities (CBP), this study simulated two cases that are the situations of the whole day and traffic accident. The simulation results show that all CBPs in the scenario of whole day are less than 21.5% by using the proposed mechanism, which is better than using the static channel allocation (SCA) mechanism. Moreover, all CBPs in the scenario of traffic accidents are less than 16.5% by using the proposed mechanism, which is better than using the SCA mechanism. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can decrease the number of CBPs effectively. ? 2017 by the authors.

Since the tumor infiltrates the brain stem, surgical removal is often impossible. For conventional radiotherapy, the dose constraint of the brain stem impedes attempts at further dose escalation. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), a targeted radiotherapy, carries the potential to selectively irradiate tumors with an adequate dose while sparing adjacent normal tissue. In this study, 12 consecutive patients treated with conventional radiotherapy in our institute were reviewed to evaluate the feasibility of BNCT. NCTPlan Ver. 1.1.44 was used for dose calculations. Compared with two and three fields, the average maximal dose to the normal brain may be lowered to 7.35 ± 0.72 Gy-Eq by four-field irradiation. The mean ratio of minimal dose to clinical target volume and maximal dose to normal tissue was 2.41 ± 0.26 by four-field irradiation. A therapeutic benefit may be expected with multi-field boron neutron capture therapy to treat diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma without craniotomy, while the maximal dose to the normal brain would be minimized by using the four-field setting. ? 2017 Lee et al.

Phenotypic alteration in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been linked to the TKI resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. However, the mechanism underlying this resistance remains unclear. Here we report that high expression of a neuroendocrine factor termed VGF induces the transcription factor TWIST1 to facilitate TKI resistance, EMT, and cancer dissemination in a subset of lung adenocarcinoma cells. VGF silencing resensitized EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cells to TKI. Conversely, overexpression of VGF in sensitive cells conferred resistance to TKIs and induced EMT, increasing migratory and invasive behaviors. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association of VGF expression with advanced tumor grade and poor survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. In a mouse xenograft model of lung adenocarcinoma, suppressing VGF expression was sufficient to attenuate tumor growth. Overall, our findings show how VGF can confer TKI resistance and trigger EMT, suggesting its potential utility as a biomarker and therapeutic target in lung adenocarcinoma. ?2017 AACR.",,"afatinib; doxycycline; erlotinib; gefitinib; nerve growth factor; osimertinib; rociletinib; transcription factor Twist; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor; adenocarcinoma cell line; advanced cancer; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer grading; cancer survival; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer cell line; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; protein function; tumor growth; VGF gene; adenocarcinoma; animal; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; nude mouse; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Nude; Mutation; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85020838533

Methods: Healthy patients visiting an eye clinic at a county hospital were recruited. All participants underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations, and their retinas were scanned using 3D OCT-1000. In total, 223 patients with 446 eyes were included. The mean age and AL were 42.07 ± 13.16 (21-76) years and 25.38 ± 1.73 (21.19-30.37) mm, respectively. Results: The average RNFL thickness decreased by 2.71 μm for every 10-year increase in age (P < 0.001). Age-related RNFL thinning was more significant in participants older than 41 years (-0.24μm/year; P = 0.015). The earliest sector showing a significant decline in RNFL thickness was after 35 years of age (-0.70μm/year; P = 0.011) at the superior quadrant and at the 1-2 o'clock hour (-1.42μm/year; P = 0.009). Meanwhile, the maximal rate of age-associated RNFL decay was observed in these two regions as well. The reduction of RNFL with age progression did not differ in eyes with long AL (> 27 mm; -0.16μm/year) or those with short AL (< 25 mm; -0.22μm/year). For every 1-mm-greater AL, RNFL was thinner by 1.78 μm (P < 0.001). The inferior quadrant showed the greatest tendency of RNFL decline with longer AL (4.46 μm/mm; P < 0.001). Conclusions: The factors of age and AL should be considered when interpreting the results. Significantly age-associated RNFL thinning was found in participants older than 41 years. Reduction of RNFL thickness with increasing age was not affected by AL. Topographic variations in RNFL thinning were observed in that the maximal decline of RNFL thickness with advancing age at the superior quadrant whereas with elongation of AL at the inferior quadrant. ? 2017 Peng et al.

CXCL8 binds to its CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) for recruiting neutrophil infiltration and initiates tissue inflammation. Therefore, we explored the effect of CXCR1 and CXCR2 inhibition on DN. This was achieved by CXCL8(3-72)K11R/G31P (G31P), an antagonist of CXCL8 that has exhibited therapeutic efficacy in inflammatory diseases and malignancies. In this study, we found that renal leukocyte accumulation and rapid increases of CXCL8 occurred in high-fat diet/streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. G31P effectively reduced urine volume, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine clearance rate in mice with diabetes. In addition, renal histopathologic changes including mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, and extracellular matrix deposition were partially moderated in G31P-treated diabetic mice. Furthermore, G31P attenuated renal inflammation and renal fibrosis of diabetic mice by inhibiting proinflammatory and profibrotic elements. G31P also inhibited high glucose-induced inflammatory and fibrotic factor upregulation in human renal mesangial cells. At the molecular level, G31P inhibited activation of CXCR1/2 downstream signaling JAK2/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results suggest blockade of CXCR1/2 by G31P could confer renoprotective effects that offer potential therapeutic opportunities in DN.

Higher BPA exposure levels have been found in patients with endometrial hyperplasia that is one of risk factors of endometrial cancer (EC). Aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation has been observed in the development of cancer. Thus, this study investigated whether BPA exposure can disrupt miRNA regulation and its gene expression regarding to EC carcinogenic progress. Microarray experiments of miRNA and mRNA were performed in human endometrial cancer RL95-2 cells with treatment of low-to-moderate (10, 103 and 105?nM) BPA to explore the aberrant genes corresponding to human EC progression. According to the analysis of KEGG pathway and Cytoscape gene network, this study identified that BPA exposure reduced miR-149 expression to down-regulate DNA repair gene ARF6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6) and tumor protein p53 (TP53), and up-regulate CCNE2 (cyclin E2) potentially to interrupt cell cycle. BPA also increased miR-107 to suppress hedgehog signaling factors, suppressor of fused homolog (SUFU) and GLI family zinc finger 3 (GLI3) to activate hedgehog signaling for cell proliferation underlying carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the BPA-induced cell proliferation was attenuated by transfection with miR-149 mimic and miR-107 inhibitor. These findings provided an insight into potential epigenetic mechanism of BPA exposure on the risk of endometrial carcinogenesis. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bisphenol A; Carcinogenesis; Endometrial cancer; Gene network; Hedgehog signaling; MicroRNA,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 6; cyclin E; cyclin E2; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 107; microRNA 149; protein p53; transcription factor Gli3; tumor protein; unclassified drug; zinc finger protein; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; endocrine disruptor; messenger RNA; microRNA; phenol derivative; Article; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cell cycle; cell proliferation; controlled study; DNA microarray; DNA repair; drug exposure; endometrium cancer; endometrium cell; epigenetics; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; mRNA expression assay; transcriptomics; upregulation; cell survival; drug effects; endometrium tumor; female; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; tumor cell line; Benzhydryl Compounds; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Endocrine Disruptors; Endometrial Neoplasms; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; MicroRNAs; Phenols; RNA, Messenger",2-s2.0-85014772974

However, owing to the existence of blood-brain barrier (BBB), the tumor accumulation and therapeutic efficacy of clinical therapeutics is still of great concerns. To this end, we present herein a prominent therapeutic strategy adopting adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) capable of carrying nanotherapeutic payloads selectively toward brain tumors for thermo/chemotherapy. The nanoparticle (NP) payload was obtained from co-assembly of poly(γ-glutamic acid-co-distearyl γ-glutamate) with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), paclitaxel (PTX), and oleic acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs in aqueous solution. The particle size and drug loading content were ca 110 nm and 8.4 wt%, respectively. After being engulfed by ADSCs, the nanotherapeutics was found rather harmless to cellular hosts at a PTX concentration of 30 μM over 48 h in the absence of pertinent stimulus. Nevertheless, the ADSC-based approach combined with high frequency magnetic field exhibits a sound therapeutic performance with a 4-fold increase in therapeutic index on brain astrocytoma (ALTS1C1)-bearing mice (C57BL/6 J) as compared to the typical chemotherapy using a current first-line chemodrug, temozolomide. Immunohistochemical examination of brain tumor sections confirms the successful cellular transport and pronounced cytotoxic action of therapeutics against tumor cells in vivo. This work demonstrates the promise of ADSC-mediated chemo/thermal therapy against brain tumors. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Adipose-derived stem cells; Cell-based delivery; Chemo/thermal therapy; Glioblastoma multiforme; Therapeutic nanoparticles,"Amino acids; Brain; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Iron oxides; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Solutions; Stem cells; Tumors; Adipose derived stem cells; Cell-based; Chemo/thermal therapy; Glioblastoma multiforme; High-frequency magnetic field; Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid; Superparamagnetic iron oxides; Therapeutic efficacy; Targeted drug delivery; nanocarrier; oleic acid; paclitaxel; polyglactin; polyglutamic acid; superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; temozolomide; virus large T antigen; antineoplastic agent; dacarbazine; drug carrier; lactic acid; magnetite nanoparticle; paclitaxel; polyglycolic acid; polylactic acid-polyglycolic acid copolymer; temozolomide; adipose derived stem cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; astrocytoma; brain tumor; cancer chemotherapy; cancer gene therapy; cancer inhibition; cell based gene therapy; controlled study; culture medium; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug release; dual modality therapy; glioblastoma; glioblastoma multiforme cell line; human; human cell; hyperthermia; magnetic field; median survival time; molecularly targeted therapy; mouse; nanotechnology; nonhuman; priority journal; SV40-transformed cell line; treatment outcome; adipocyte; analogs and derivatives; animal; blood brain barrier; brain tumor; C57BL mouse; cell motion; cell survival; chemistry; cytology; glioblastoma; male; metabolism; particle size; permeability; physiology; stem cell; surface property; tissue distribution; transport at the cellular level; tumor cell line; Adipocytes; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Biological Transport; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Survival; Dacarbazine; Drug Carriers; Drug Liberation; Glioblastoma; Humans; Lactic Acid; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Oleic Acid; Paclitaxel; Particle Size; Permeability; Polyglutamic Acid; Polyglycolic Acid; Stem Cells; Surface Properties; Tissue Distribution",2-s2.0-85018845473

Mutated EGFR has become as an important therapeutic target in lung cancer, whereas targeted treatment is not available for wild-type EGFR or its ligands. In this study, we found that heparin-binding (HB)-EGF, a member of the EGF family, was highly expressed in a subset of lung cancer, proliferation of which was dependent on HB-EGF signaling. Silencing of HB-EGF with RNA interference inhibited cell cycle progression in lung cancer cells. We observed that, upon HB-EGF induction, CITED4 was induced through a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent pathway, regulating cell proliferation. CITED4 interacted with MYC and potentiated MYC-mediated transactivation of the CCND1 promoter, leading to cell cycle progression. Correlation analysis revealed that HB-EGF and CITED4 were significantly positively associated in primary lung tumors, and expression of HB-EGF predicted a poor survival outcome in patients. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of HB-EGF with CRM197 significantly attenuated tumor cell growth. Thus, CITED4 functions as a molecular switch in HB-EGF-induced growth control, and HB-EGF provides a novel therapeutic target for lung cancer intervention. ? 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Herein, a stereocontrolled and highly convergent method to synthesize a non-reducing-end inter-S-glycosidic variant of the GD3 antigen (S-linked α(2→8) GD3) that is resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis is reported. The key steps in the synthesis are a regio- and stereoselective α(2→3) sialylation of a lactoside acceptor with a C8-iodide-derivatized sialyl donor and an anomeric S-alkylation, which enable stereoselective construction of a terminal S-linked α(2→8) disialyl residue. The sulfhydryl-reactive maleimide group was used as the linker for the well-defined conjugation of these antigens to the immunogenic protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Groups of mice were immunized with the GD3–KLH and S-linked GD3–KLH glycoconjugates in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant. Microarray analysis of the sera showed the promise of the S-linked GD3–KLH vaccine: it stimulated a high immunoglobulin G response against S-linked GD3 and cross-reactivity with the O-linked GD3 antigen was low. The activity of the S-linked GD3–KLH vaccine was comparable to that of the O-linked GD3–KLH vaccine, which highlighted the effectiveness of generating glycoconjugate vaccines and immunotherapies by relatively simple means. ? 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The therapeutic effects of GdIONP-mediated hyperthermia alone or in combination with radiotherapy (RT) were also evaluated. A significant increase in the tumour growth time was observed following the treatment of thermotherapy (TT) only group (2.5?days), radiation therapy only group (4.5?days), and the combined radio-thermotherapy group (10?days). Immunohistochemical staining revealed a reduced hypoxia region with vascular disruption and extensive tumour necrosis following the combined radio-thermotherapy. These results indicate that GdIONP-mediated hyperthermia can improve the efficacy of RT by its dual functions in high temperature (temperature greater than 45?°C)-mediated thermal ablation and mild-temperature hyperthermia (MTH) (temperature between 39 and 42?°C)-mediated reoxygenation. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group",magnetic field hyperthermia; Nanoparticle; radiotherapy; thermal ablation; tumour therapy,"gadolinium; magnetite nanoparticle; animal; C57BL mouse; hypoxia; magnetic field; male; multimodality cancer therapy; pathology; prostate tumor; thermotherapy; tumor cell line; tumor volume; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Combined Modality Therapy; Gadolinium; Hyperthermia, Induced; Hypoxia; Magnetic Fields; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Prostatic Neoplasms; Tumor Burden",2-s2.0-85018317476

The most abundant Aβ forms are Aβ40 and Aβ42 comprising, respectively, 40 and 42 residues. Recent experiments showed that the triple Gly33Val-Val36Pro-Gly38Val (VPV) mutation causes Aβ42 to become ""super-Aβ42"" with elevated aggregation rates and toxicity. Upon VPV mutation, oligomerization pathways of Aβ40 become similar to those of the Aβ42 wild type. It was hypothesized that the super behavior of Aβ42 occurs due to an enhanced content of the β-turn and β-hairpin, centered at residues 36-37, and the similarity in oligomerization pathways of Aβ40-VPV and Aβ42-WT comes from the increased β-turn population. As this is based on simulation of the truncated fragments, this hypothesis may not be valid for the full-length case, motivating us to perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for full-length Aβ sequences. We showed that the results obtained for truncated peptides fall short in explaining the similarity of self-assembly pathways of Aβ40-VPV and Aβ42-WT. Instead, we propose that the similarity is due to not only increased β-turn population but also due to the elevated β-structure of the entire sequence. Similar to VPV, the Gly33Val-Val36Asn-Gly38Leu mutation enhances the β-structure and the C-terminal β-turn making the behavior of Aβ40 similar to that of Aβ42-WT. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Molecular dynamics; Neurodegenerative diseases; Oligomerization; Oligomers; Peptides; Self assembly; Aggregation rate; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid betas; Beta-hairpin; C terminus; Molecular dynamics simulations; Molecular simulations; Wild types; Proteins; amyloid beta protein; chemistry; genetics; human; molecular dynamics; mutation; protein conformation; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Humans; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Mutation; Protein Conformation,2-s2.0-85020226786

This observed neuronal homeostasis is maintained by new neurons formed in vivo from dividing precursor cells that are located within myenteric ganglia and express both Nestin and p75NTR, but not the pan-glial marker Sox10.

The relatively high mortality rate has been a serious issue accordingly. We herein reported a diagnosis method by using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) which have been extensively explored as a potential tool for diagnostics and prognostics of ovarian cancers. Nonetheless, the detection of CTCs still remains a challenge because of the difficulty in isolating them from whole blood samples since they are shed into the vasculature from primary tumors and circulate irregularly in the bloodstream in extremely low concentrations. In this work, we reported a new, integrated microfluidic system capable of (1) red blood cells lysis, (2) white blood cell (WBC) depletion via a negative selection process, and (3) capture of target cancer cells from whole blood samples using aptamer-binding technology. Furthermore, this is the first time that an aptamer was used to capture ovarian cancer cells owing to its high affinity. The new microfluidic chip could efficiently perform the entire process in one hour without human intervention at a high recovery rate and a low false positive detection rate when compared with antibody-based systems. A high recovery rate for the isolation of CTCs within a short period of time has been reported when compared to the traditional negative or positive selection approach by using traditional antibody biomarkers. More importantly, ""false positive"" results from WBCs could be significantly alleviated due to the high specificity of the cancer cell-specific aptamers.

Various methods have been developed to diagnose osteoporosis by measuring bone mineral density (BMD) of patients. However, BMDs from these methods were not equivalent and were incomparable. In addition, partial volume effect introduces errors in estimating bone volume from computed tomography (CT) images using image segmentation. In this study, a two-compartment model (TCM) was proposed to calculate bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and BMD from CT images. The TCM considers bones to be composed of two sub-materials. Various equivalent BV/TV and BMD can be calculated by applying corresponding sub-material pairs in the TCM. In contrast to image segmentation, the TCM prevented the influence of the partial volume effect by calculating the volume percentage of sub-material in each image voxel. Validations of the TCM were performed using bone-equivalent uniform phantoms, a 3D-printed trabecular-structural phantom, a temporal bone flap, and abdominal CT images. By using the TCM, the calculated BV/TVs of the uniform phantoms were within percent errors of ±2%; the percent errors of the structural volumes with various CT slice thickness were below 9%; the volume of the temporal bone flap was close to that from micro-CT images with a percent error of 4.1%.

Cancer stem cells are considered to be one of the main mechanisms for chemoresistance, as well as metastasis and recurrent disease. To explore the stemness characteristics of ovarian cancer stem cells, we successfully enriched ovarian cancer stem-like cells from an established ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV-I6) and a fresh ovarian tumor-derived cell line (OVS1). These ovarian cancer stem-like cells possess important cancer stemness characteristics including sphere-forming and self-renewing abilities, expressing important ovarian cancer stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, as well as increased drug resistance and potent tumorigenicity. Microarray analysis of OVS1-derived sphere cells revealed increased expression of amphiregulin (AREG) and decreased expression of its conserved regulatory microRNA, miR-34c-5p, when compared with the OVS1 parental cells. Overexpression of AREG and decreased miR-34c-5p expression in SKOV-I6 and OVS1 sphere cells were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Luciferase reporter assay and mutant analysis confirmed that AREG is a direct target of miR-34c-5p. Furthermore, AREG-mediated increase of sphere formation, drug resistance toward docetaxel and carboplatin, as well as tumorigenicity of SKOV-I6 and OVS1 cells could be abrogated by miR-34c-5p. We further demonstrated that miR-34c-5p inhibited ovarian cancer stemness through downregulation of the AREG-EGFR-ERK pathway. Overexpression of AREG was found to be correlated with advanced ovarian cancer stages and poor prognosis. Taken together, our data suggest that AREG promotes ovarian cancer stemness and drug resistance via the AREG-EGFR-ERK pathway and this is inhibited by miR-34c-5p. Targeting AREG, miR-34c-5p could be a potential strategy for anti-cancer-stem cell therapy in ovarian cancer. ?

This article explores this question by looking at Chinese medicine (CM). The latter has been under pressure from modernization and “scientization” for a century, and the dynamics of these pressures have been explored “symmetrically” within STS and related disciplines. But in this work, CM has been the “the case” and STS theory has held stable. This article uses a CM term, reasoning-as-propensity (shi, 勢), to look at contemporary practices of cancer care in a hospital in Taiwan. It describes how shi (勢) informed the design of a new decoction, Kuan Sin Yin, while also relating to the production of scientific knowledge, biomedical interventions, Buddhist practices, and the patients living with cancer themselves. Does CM’s use of shi (勢) simply confirm the essential and incompatible otherness of CM? Looked at from outside the answer seems to be yes. However, this article explores how STS might change itself—and the theory–practice division in STS—by thinking through shi (勢) in dialogue with its othered object.

In this study, we examined the mutational profiles of 16 triple-negative MPN patients including 7 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 1 primary myelofibrosis and 8 polycythemia vera (PV). Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed using the ACTOnco Comprehensive Cancer Panel (Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel, Life Technologies) to target all coding exons of 409 cancer-related genes. Overall, 30 nonsynonymous somatic mutations were detected in 12 (75%) patients with a range of 1–5 mutations per sample. Notably, one ET patient was found to have JAK2V617F and KITP551L mutations at very low allele frequency. One MPLP70L and 1 MPLM602T mutations were identified each in 1 ET and 1 PV, respectively. Other recurrent mutations were also identified including KMT2C, KMT2D, IRS2, SYNE1, PDE4DIP, SETD2, ATM, TNFAIP3 and CCND2. In addition, germline mutations were also found in some cancer-related genes. Copy number changes were rare in this cohort of TN MPNs.

However, most literature is based on self-reported PA which is limited by recall bias. Light PA is popular among older adults, but a paucity of objective longitudinal data has considered the relationship between light PA and cognitive ability. We examined if a higher level of objectively measured light PA, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), was prospectively associated with better cognitive ability in older adults. Methods A longitudinal study over 22.12 (±?1.46) months including 274 community-dwelling older adults across 14 regions in Taiwan was undertaken. Cognitive ability was obtained using a Chinese version of the Ascertain Dementia 8-item Questionnaire (AD8) and light PA and MVPA captured by 7?days accelerometer positioned on waist. Multivariable negative binomial regression adjusted for confounders were undertaken. Results 274 participants (74.52?years, 45.6% male) attended the follow-up (96.1%). Higher light PA, independent from MVPA, was associated with a reduced rate of decline in cognitive ability (rate ratio 0.75 [0.60–0.92]). MVPA, was also associated with a reduced decline in cognitive ability (rate ratio 0.85 [0.75–0.95]). Light PA was protective of cognitive ability in sensitivity analyses removing participants with activities of daily living difficulties, depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment at baseline. Conclusion Our data suggest that light PA may offer a protective influence of future cognitive ability in community dwelling older adults. The promotion of light PA may be a valuable means to maintain cognitive ability in older age. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Cognition; Cognitive decline; Dementia; Light physical activity; Moderate to vigorous physical activity; Old age; Older adults,"accelerometer; aged; aging; Article; Ascertain Dementia 8 item Questionnaire; cognition; controlled study; daily life activity; depression; descriptive research; female; follow up; human; informed consent; longitudinal study; male; moderate to vigorous physical activity; physical activity; questionnaire; Taiwan; accelerometry; aging; Cognitive Dysfunction; depression; exercise; health status; independent living; multivariate analysis; physiology; psychological rating scale; psychology; regression analysis; very elderly; Accelerometry; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Depression; Exercise; Female; Health Status; Humans; Independent Living; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Regression Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85014750143

One of the immediate cellular responses to DNA damage is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), which mediates DNA repair and enhances cell survival. In this study, we found that oxidative stress (H2O2)-induced PARylation was suppressed by As2O3 exposure in different human cancer cells. Moreover, As2O3 treatment promoted H2O2-induced DNA damage and apoptosis, leading to increased cell death. We found that N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an organic compound derived from maleic acid, could reverse As2O3-mediated effects, thus enhancing PARylation with attenuated cell death and increased cell survival. Pharmacologic inhibition of glutathione with l-buthionine-sulfoximine blocked the antagonistic effect of NEM on As2O3, thereby continuing As2O3-mediated suppression of PARylation and causing DNA damage. Our findings identify NEM as a potential antidote against As2O3-mediated DNA damage in a glutathione-dependent manner. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

While herbal medicines represent an ideal reservoir for drug screenings, here a molecular chaperone GRP78 is demonstrated to serve as a potential target for antiviral drug discovery. Methods: We cloned and expressed a truncated but fully functional form of human GRP78 (hGRP781-508) and used it as a probe for anti-HBV drug screening on herbochips. In vitro cytotoxicity and in vitro anti-HBV activity of the herbal extracts were evaluated by MTT and ELISA assays, respectively. Finally, anti-HBV activity was confirmed by in vivo assay using DHBV DNA levels in DHBV-infected ducklings as a model. Results: Primary screenings using GRP78 on 40 herbochips revealed 11 positives. Four of the positives, namely Dioscorea bulbifera, Lasiosphaera fenzlii, Paeonia suffruticosa and Polygonum cuspidatum were subjected to subsequent assays. None of the above extracts was cytotoxic to AML12 cells, but P. cuspidatum extract (PCE) was found to be cytotoxic to HepG2 2.2.15 cells. Both PCE and P. suffruticosa extract (PSE) suppressed secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2 2.2.15 cells. The anti-HBV activity of PSE was further confirmed in vivo. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that GRP78 is a valid probe for anti-HBV drug screening on herbochips. We have also shown that PSE, while being non-cytotoxic, possesses in vitro and in vivo anti-HBV activities. Taken together, our data suggest that PSE may be a potential anti-HBV agent for therapeutic use. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Anti-HBV; GRP78; Herbochip; Moutan Cortex Radicis; Paeonia suffruticosa; Paeoniaceae,adefovir dipivoxil; antivirus agent; Dioscorea bulbifera extract; glucose regulated protein 78; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; Lasiosphaera fenzlii extract; Paeonia suffruticosa extract; plant extract; Polygonum cuspidatum extract; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiviral activity; Article; comparative study; controlled study; cytotoxicity test; Dioscorea bulbifera; drug identification; drug mechanism; drug potentiation; drug screening; drug targeting; duckling; Hep-G2 cell line; high throughput screening; human; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; MTT assay; nonhuman; Paeonia suffruticosa; Polygonum cuspidatum,2-s2.0-85018482242

We performed a high-throughput screen to identify small molecules targeting a transcriptional network critical for the differentiation of goblet cells in response to allergens. We identified RCM-1, a nontoxic small molecule that inhibited goblet cell metaplasia and excessive mucus production in mice after exposure to allergens. RCM-1 blocked the nuclear localization and increased the proteasomal degradation of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), a transcription factor critical for the differentiation of goblet cells from airway progenitor cells. RCM-1 reduced airway resistance, increased lung compliance, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production in mice exposed to the house dust mite and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which triggers goblet cell metaplasia. In cultured airway epithelial cells and in mice, RCM-1 reduced IL-13 and STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) signaling and prevented the expression of the STAT6 target genes Spdef and Foxa3, which are key transcriptional regulators of goblet cell differentiation. These results suggest that RCM-1 is an inhibitor of goblet cell metaplasia and IL-13 signaling, providing a new therapeutic candidate to treat patients with asthma and other chronic airway diseases. 2017 ?

Further, PM2.5 exposure increased miR-3560 and let-7b-5p in the hippocampus, two proteins that regulate genes Oxct1 and Lin28b that control ketogenesis and glycosylation, and neural cell differentiation, respectively. miR-99b-5p, miR-92b-5p, and miR-99a-5p were decreased, leading to reduced expression of Kbtbd8 and Adam11 which reduced cell mitosis, migration, and differentiation, and inhibited learning abilities and motor coordination of the fetus. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, we reported a novel fabrication method for producing a dual-modality biosensor that can simultaneously detect vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in human serum for early diagnosis of PCa. This biosensor was constructed by coating graphene oxide/ssDNA (GO-ssDNA) on an Au-electrode for VEGF detection, and incorporated with poly-L-lactide nanoparticles (PLLA NPs) for signal amplification and PSA detection. The results showed that this biosensor has wide liner detection ranges (0.05–100 ng/mL for VEGF and 1–100 ng/mL for PSA), as well as high levels of sensitivity and selectivity (i.e., resisting interference from external factors, such as glucose, ascorbic acid human serum protein, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M), and demonstrated a high correlation with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for sample detection in patients.

Inhibition of RAF kinases can induce a dose-dependent ""paradoxical"" upregulation of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in cancer cells. It is unknown whether ""paradoxical"" ERK activation occurs after sorafenib therapy in HCC, and if so, if it impacts the therapeutic efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that RAF inhibition by sorafenib rapidly leads to RAF dimerization and ERK activation in HCCs, which contributes to treatment evasion. The transactivation of RAF dimers and ERK signaling promotes HCC cell survival, prevents apoptosis via downregulation of BIM and achieves immunosuppression by MAPK/NF-kB-dependent activation of PD-L1 gene expression. To overcome treatment evasion and reduce systemic effects, we developed CXCR4-targeted nanoparticles to co-deliver sorafenib with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in HCC. Using this approach, we preferentially and efficiently inactivated RAF/ERK, upregulated BIM and down-regulated PD-L1 expression in HCC, and facilitated intra-tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. These effects resulted in a profound delay in tumor growth. Thus, this nano-delivery strategy to selectively target tumors and prevent the paradoxical ERK activation could increase the feasibility of dual RAF/MEK inhibition to overcome sorafenib treatment escape in HCC. ?

We show that the C-terminal domains protruding outward from the tip of the V-shaped structure is critical for mediating strong RNA binding and is crucial for efficient RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. We also show that RNA remains bound with CshA during ATP hydrolysis cycles and thus bulk RNAs could be unwound and degraded in a processive manner through cooperation between exoribonucleases and CshA.

While aberrant expression of BDNF has been implicated in neurological disorders, the transcriptional regulation of BDNF remains to be elucidated. In response to different stimuli, BDNF expression can be initiated from different promoters. Several studies have suggested that the expression of BDNF is regulated by promoter methylation. An emerging theme points to the possibility that histone modifications at the BDNF promoters may link to the neurological pathology. Thus, understanding the epigenetic regulation at the BDNF promoters will shed light on future therapies for neurological disorders.

In multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis, the patients had a lower slope 5 in the acute stage, which then gradually increased during the follow-up period. The areas under the MSE curves for scale 1 to 5 (area 1-5) and 6 to 20 (area 6-20) were lower throughout the chronic stage. Area 6-20 had the greatest discriminatory power to differentiate the post-MI patients (at 1 year) from the controls.

Hemodialysis (HD) patients have an increased risk of thrombosis. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which function in vascular repair, are deficient in HD patients. Nonetheless, the relationship between EPC deficiency and thrombosis in HD patients is unknown. Methods. From January 2010 to December 2012, circulating levels of EPCs that were positive for CD34 and kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) were measured in 269 HD patients. Patients received prospective follow-ups at 6-month intervals until May 2015. The primary outcome was the composite of HD access thrombosis and systemic vascular thrombosis. Results. There were 141 thrombotic events, 50 systemic vascular thrombotic events and 116 HD access thrombotic events. We found significantly negative associations between CD34+ KDR+tertile and overall thrombotic events (low: 61%; middle: 56%; high: 40%; P = 0.02), systemic vascular thrombotic events (low: 27%; middle: 18%; high: 10%; P = 0.03) and HD access thrombotic events (low: 52%; middle: 46%; high: 36%; P = 0.02). Univariate analysis indicated that systemic vascular thrombotic events were positively associated with age, diabetes, dyslipidemia, vascular disease history, urea clearance, albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP), and negatively associated with CD34+ KDR+cell count. HD access thrombosis was positively associated with vascular disease history and CRP, and negatively associated with CD34+ KDR+cell count. Multivariate analysis indicated that a low CD34+ KDR+cell count was an independent risk factor for both types of thrombosis. Conclusions. Our study of a population of HD patients showed that a low level of circulating EPCs is associated with thrombosis. ? 2016 The Author.",end-stage renal disease; endothelial progenitor cells; hemodialysis; thrombosis,"albumin; C reactive protein; CD34 antigen; urea; vasculotropin receptor 2; C reactive protein; CD34 antigen; vasculotropin receptor 2; aged; Article; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; diabetes mellitus; disease association; dyslipidemia; end stage renal disease; endothelial progenitor cell; female; follow up; hemodialysis; human; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; prospective study; risk factor; treatment outcome; vascular disease; blood; cell count; cytology; endothelial progenitor cell; flow cytometry; hemodialysis; Kidney Failure, Chronic; metabolism; middle aged; multivariate analysis; thrombosis; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antigens, CD34; C-Reactive Protein; Cell Count; Endothelial Progenitor Cells; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prospective Studies; Renal Dialysis; Risk Factors; Thrombosis; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2",2-s2.0-85017227778

However, post-challenge blood sugars frequently decline to below baseline. We hypothesize that this ‘over-shoot’ hypoglycemia results from sustained translation of long-lived transgene message, and that reducing pro-insulin message half-life will ameliorate post-challenge hypoglycemia. Methods: We compared pro-insulin message content and insulin secretion from primary rat hepatocytes expressing insulin from either a standard construct (2xfur), or a construct producing a destabilized pro-insulin message (InsTail), following exposure to stimulating or inhibitory conditions. Results: Hepatocytes transduced with a 2xfur construct accumulated pro-insulin message, and exhibited increased insulin secretion, under conditions that both inhibit or stimulate transcription. By contrast, pro-insulin message content remained stable in InsTail expressing cells, and insulin secretion increased less than 2xfur during prolonged stimulation. During transitions from stimulatory to inhibitory conditions, or vice versa, amounts of pro-insulin message changed more rapidly in InsTail expressing cells than 2xfur expressing cells. Importantly, insulin secretion increased during the transition from stimulation to inhibition in 2xfur expressing cells, although it remained unchanged in InsTail expressing cells. Use of the InsTail destabilized insulin message tended to more rapidly reduce glucose induced glycemic excursions, and limit post-load hypoglycemia in STZ-diabetic mice in vivo.

HP-NAP is also a vaccine candidate, a possible drug target, and a potential diagnostic marker for H. pylori-associated diseases. Previously, we purified recombinant HP-NAP by one-step diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) negative mode chromatography by collecting the unbound fraction at pH 8.0 at 4?C. It remains unclear why HP-NAP does not bind to DEAE resins at the pH above its isoelectric point during the purification. To investigate how pH affects the surface net charge of HP-NAP and its binding to DEAE resins during the purification, recombinant HP-NAP expressed in Escherichia coli was subjected to DEAE negative mode chromatography at pH ranging from 7.0 to 9.0 at 25?C and the surface charge of purified HP-NAP was determined by capillary electrophoresis. A minimal amount of HP-NAP was detected in the elution fraction of DEAE Sepharose resin at pH 8.5, whereas recombinant HP-NAP was detected in the elution fraction of DEAE Sephadex resin only at pH 7.0 and 8.0. The purified recombinant HP-NAP obtained from the unbound fractions was not able to bind to DEAE resins at pH 7.0 to 9.0. In addition, the surface charge of the purified HP-NAP was neutral at pH 7.0 to 8.0 and was either neutral or slightly negative at pH 8.5 and 9.0. However, recombinant HP-NAP purified from gel-filtration chromatography was able to bind to DEAE Sepharose resin at pH 7.0 to 9.0 and DEAE Sephadex resin at pH 7.0. At pH 8.5 and 9.0, only the negatively charged species of HP-NAP were found. Thus, recombinant HP-NAP with different charge status can be differentially purified by DEAE negative mode chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography. Furthermore, the charge distribution on the surface of HP-NAP, the presence of impure proteins, and the overall net charge of the resins all affect the binding of HP-NAP to DEAE resins during the negative purification. ? 2017 Hong et al.

A polyphenol compound, magnolol, was recently proposed as having a potentially restorative effect in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)- or 6-hydroxydopamine-treated animal models. In this study,18 F-FP-(+)-DTBZ PET was used to determine the therapeutic efficacy of magnolol in an MPTP-PD mouse model that was prepared by giving an intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily dose of 25 mg/kg MPTP to male C57BL/6 mice for 5 consecutive days. Twentyminute static18 F-FP-(+)-DTBZ PET scans were performed before MPTP treatment and 5 days after the termination of MPTP treatment to set up the baseline control. Half of the MPTP-treated mice then received a daily dose of magnolol (10 mg/kg dissolved in corn oil, i.p.) for 6 days.18 F-FP-(+)-DTBZ PET imaging was performed the day after the final treatment. All18 F-FP-(+)-DTBZ PET images were analysed and the specific uptake ratio (SUr) was calculated. Ex vivo autoradiography (ARG) and corresponding immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies were conducted to confirm the distribution of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. The striatal SUr ratios of18 F-FP-(+)-DTBZ PET images for the Sham, the MPTP, and the MPTP + Magnolol-treated groups were 1.25 ± 0.05, 0.75 ± 0.06, and 1.00 ± 0.11, respectively (n = 4 for each group). The ex vivo18 F-FP-(+)-DTBZ ARG and IHC results correlated favourably with the PET imaging results.18 F-FP-(+)-DTBZ PET imaging suggested that magnolol post-treatment may reverse the neuronal damage in the MPTP-lesioned PD mice. In vivo imaging of the striatal vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) distribution using18 F-FP-(+)-DTBZ animal PET is a useful method to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic drugs i.e., magnolol, for the management of PD. ? 2017 Weng et al.

In this study an analytical system was constructed for the in?vivo monitoring of mouse tumor extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lactate, and glucose by means of microdialysis (MD) sampling and fluorescence determination in conjunction with a smart sequential enzymatic derivatization scheme—involving a loading sequence of fluorogenic reagent/horseradish peroxidase, microdialysate, lactate oxidase, pyruvate, and glucose oxidase—for step-by-step determination of sampled H2O2, lactate, and glucose in mouse tumor microdialysate. After optimization of the overall experimental parameters, the system's detection limit reached as low as 0.002?mM for H2O2, 0.058?mM for lactate, and 0.055?mM for glucose, based on 3?μL of microdialysate, suggesting great potential for determining tumor extracellular concentrations of lactate and glucose. Spike analyses of offline-collected mouse tumor microdialysate and monitoring of the basal concentrations of mouse tumor extracellular H2O2, lactate, and glucose, as well as those after imparting metabolic disturbance through intra-tumor administration of a glucose solution through a prior-implanted cannula, were conducted to demonstrate the system's applicability. Our results evidently indicate that hyphenation of an MD sampling device with an optimized sequential enzymatic derivatization scheme and a fluorescence spectrometer can be used successfully for multi-analyte monitoring of tumor extracellular metabolites in living animals. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Enzymatic derivatization; Glucose; Hydrogen peroxide; Lactate; Tumor extracellular fluid,Dialysis; Fluorescence; Glucose; Glucose sensors; Hydrogen peroxide; Mammals; Metabolites; Oxidation; Peroxides; Tumors; Derivatizations; Experimental parameters; Extracellular concentration; Extracellular fluid; Extracellular metabolites; Fluorescence determination; Fluorescence spectrometers; Lactate; Glucose oxidase; glucose; glucose oxidase; horseradish peroxidase; hydrogen peroxide; lactate 2 monooxygenase; lactic acid; pyruvic acid; glucose; hydrogen peroxide; lactic acid; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; derivatization; fluorescence analysis; in vivo study; limit of detection; male; microdialysis; mouse; nonhuman; online analysis; priority journal; process optimization; prostate adenocarcinoma; sequential enzymatic derivatization; spectrometer; animal; chemistry; neoplasm; Animals; Glucose; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lactic Acid; Mice; Microdialysis; Neoplasms,2-s2.0-85008163157

ICMs exhibit negligible cytotoxicity in human uterine sarcoma cancer cells by using biodegradable aliphatic polyester as the hydrophobic segments. Relative to free Dox, Dox-loaded ICMs show a reduced cytotoxicity due to the late intracellular release of Dox from ICMs. Overall, ICMs represent a new type of biodegradable cross-linked micelle and can be employed as a promising platform for delivering a broad variety of hydrophobic drugs.

A model system containing peptide, glycan, and lipid was monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the cell-penetrating mechanism. Heparin octasaccharide with dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) lipid micelle was titrated into the GBPECP solution. Our data revealed substantial roles for the charged residues Arg5 and Lys7 in recognizing heparin, whereas Arg3 had less effect. The aromatic residue Trp4 acted as an irreplaceable moiety for membrane insertion, as the replacement of Trp4 with Arg4 abolished cell penetration, although it significantly improved the heparin-binding ability. GBPECP bound either heparin or lipid in the presence or absence of the other ligand indicating that the peptide has two alternative binding sites: Trp4 is responsible for lipid insertion, and Arg5 and Lys7 are for GAG binding. We developed a molecular model showing that the two effects synergistically promote the penetration. The loss of either effect would abolish the penetration. GBPECP has been proven to enter cells through macropinocytosis. The GBPECP treatment inhibited A549 lung cancer cell migration and invasion, implying that the cellular microenvironment would be modulated by GBPECP internalization. The intracellular penetration of GBPECP leading to inhibition of epithelial cell migration and invasion depends on the presence of the tryptophan residue in its sequence compared with similar derivative peptides. Therefore, GBPECP shows substantial potential as a novel delivery therapeutic through rapid and effective internalization and interference with cell mobility. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"arginine; aromatic compound; dodecylphosphorylcholine; eosinophil cationic protein; glycan; glycosaminoglycan peptide; heparin; lipid; lysine; tryptophan; cell penetrating peptide; glycosaminoglycan; heparin; protein binding; tryptophan; A-549 cell line; Article; binding affinity; binding site; cell invasion; cell migration; cell motility; cell permeabilization; controlled study; drug penetration; drug potentiation; drug protein binding; drug uptake; epithelium cell; female; human; human cell; internalization; micelle; molecular model; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pinocytosis; priority journal; animal; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; fluorescence microscopy; metabolism; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; tumor cell line; Animals; Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell-Penetrating Peptides; Glycosaminoglycans; Heparin; Humans; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Protein Binding; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Tryptophan",2-s2.0-85013382622

While multi-lead ECG recordings are often necessary for a proper assessment of cardiac rhythms, they are not always available or practical, for example in fetal ECG applications. Moreover, a wide range of small non-obtrusive single-lead ECG ambulatory monitoring devices are now available, from which heart rate variability (HRV) and other health-related metrics are derived. Proper beat detection and classification of abnormal rhythms is important for reliable HRV assessment and can be challenging in single-lead ECG monitoring devices. In this manuscript, we modelled the heart rate signal as an adaptive non-harmonic model and used the newly developed synchrosqueezing transform (SST) to characterize ECG patterns. We show how the proposed model can be used to enhance heart beat detection and classification between normal and abnormal rhythms. In particular, using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) beat classes, we trained and validated a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on a portion of the annotated beat database using the SST-derived instantaneous phase, the R-peak amplitudes and R-peak to R-peak interval durations, based on a single ECG lead. We obtained sentivities and positive predictive values comparable to other published algorithms using multiple leads and many more features. ? 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",heartbeat classification; instantaneous phase; R-peak detection; synchrosqueezing transform,"algorithm; electrocardiography; heart rate; human; signal processing; Algorithms; Electrocardiography; Heart Rate; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",2-s2.0-85012894273

The GNFs were synthesized in three steps: galvanic replacement, Au deposition, and Ag dealloying, using silver nanospheres (SNP) as the starting material. The morphology and optical properties of the GNFs were dependent on the thickness of the Au coating layer and the degree of Ag dealloying. The optimal GNF exhibited a robust spherical skeleton composed of a few thick rims, but preserved the distinctive LSPR absorbance in the NIR region-even when the Ag content within the skeleton was only 10 wt %, 4-fold lower than that of the GNSs. These GNFs displayed an attractive photothermal conversion ability and great photothermal stability, and could efficiently kill 4T1 cancer cells through light-induced heating. Moreover, the GNFs preserved their morphology and optical properties after incubation in biological media (e.g., saline, serum), whereas the GNSs were unstable under the same conditions because of rapid dissolution of the considerable silver content with the shell. Furthermore, the GNFs had good biocompatibility with normal cells (e.g., NIH-3T3 and hepatocytes; cell viability for both cells: >90%), whereas the GNSs exhibited significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity (e.g., cell viability for hepatocytes at 1.14 nM: ca. 11%), accompanied by the induction of reactive oxygen species. Finally, the GNFs displayed good biocompatibility and biosafety in an in vivo mouse model; in contrast, the accumulation of GNSs caused liver injury and inflammation. Our results suggest that GNFs have great potential to serve as stable, biocompatible NIR-light absorbers for in vivo applications, including cancer detection and combination therapy. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",Biocompatibility; Gold nanoframes; Hollow Au-Ag nanoshells; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Photothermal agents; Physiological stability,Biocompatibility; Cells; Cytology; Diseases; Infrared devices; Medical applications; Musculoskeletal system; Nanoshells; Nanospheres; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Optical properties; Physiology; Plasmons; Silver; Stability; Surface plasmon resonance; Biomedical applications; Galvanic replacements; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Nanoframes; Photo-thermal; Photo-thermal conversions; Photothermal stability; Reactive oxygen species; Gold; gold; nanoshell; silver; animal; cell survival; mouse; surface plasmon resonance; Animals; Cell Survival; Gold; Mice; Nanoshells; Silver; Surface Plasmon Resonance,2-s2.0-85011826521

However, complicated technology, expensive cost, environmental pollution and low-efficient output have limited its development. Herein, based on periodic contact/separation between human skin and the microstructured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, we demonstrate a transparent flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) through a relatively simple, low-cost, environmental-friendly and high-efficient method. For the first time, the natural leaves with rich surface textures were introduced to make microstructures on PDMS films as effective friction surface in the TENG. Furthermore, long silver nanowires (200 ?m in length at least) through novel synthesis were assembled as high-performance electrode, resulting in the entirely flexible and transparent TENG. Owing to the unique design, the transparent flexible TENG was eventually obtained with an enhanced output (Voc=56 V; Isc=3.1 μA) and remarkable transparency (88%). Owing to compelling features of the TENG, a self-powered user-interactive wearable system was successfully established by integrating a flexible electrochromic device (ECD). The remarkable color-tunable ability via mechanical control of our system, highly inspired by chameleons, is potentially useful in military camouflage, monitoring human activity visually, as well as replacing performance of face change in Sichuan Opera. Therefore, this research is a substantial advancement toward the construction of transparent nanogenerator and its multifunctional applications in energy conversation, wearable electronics, healthcare, culture experience, and even environmental protection. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Bio-inspired; Environmental-friendly; Leaf-molded; Silver nanowires; Transparent; Triboelectric generator,Electric equipment protection; Electric resistance measurement; Electrostatic generators; Environmental technology; Microchannels; Microstructure; Nanotechnology; Nanowires; Optoelectronic devices; Polydimethylsiloxane; Silicones; Silver; Triboelectricity; Wearable technology; Bio-inspired; Environmental-friendly; Leaf-molded; Silver nanowires; Transparent; Tribo-electric generator; Flexible electronics,2-s2.0-85007367765

Doxorubicin-loaded NDs (DOX-NDs) with a mean size of 214?nm containing 2.48?mg DOX/mL were used in this study. High-speed images displayed bubble formation and cell debris, demonstrating the reduction in cell viability after ADV. Intravital imaging provided direct visualization of disrupted tumor vessels (vessel size <30?μm), the extravasation distance was 12?μm in the DOX-NDs group and increased over 100?μm in the DOX-NDs?+?US group. Solid tumor perfusion on US imaging was significantly reduced to 23% after DOX-NDs vaporization, but gradually recovered to 41%, especially at the tumor periphery after 24?h. Histological images of the DOX-NDs?+?US group revealed tissue necrosis, a large amount of drug extravasation, vascular disruption, and immune cell infiltration at the tumor center. Tumor sizes decreased 22%, 36%, and 68% for NDs?+?US, DOX-NDs, and DOX-NDs?+?US, respectively, to prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the combination of physical anti-vascular therapy and chemotherapy with DOX-NDs vaporization promotes uniform treatment to improve therapeutic efficacy. Statement of Significance Tumor vasculature plays an important role for tumor cell proliferation by transporting oxygen and nutrients. Previous studies combined anti-vascular therapy and drug release to inhibit tumor growth by ultrasound-stimulated microbubble destruction or acoustic droplet vaporization. Although the efficacy of combined therapy has been demonstrated; the relative spatial distribution of vascular disruption, drug delivery, and accompanied immune responses within solid tumors was not discussed clearly. Herein, our study used drug-loaded nanodroplets to combined physical anti-vascular and chemical therapy. The in vitro cytotoxicity, intravital imaging, and histological assessment were used to evaluate the temporal and spatial cooperation between physical and chemical effect.

To address this challenge, a pH-responsive amphiphilic polymer of polyaniline-conjugated glycol chitosan (PANI-GCS) that can self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) in situ is developed. The PANI-GCS NPs undergo a unique surface charge conversion that is induced by their local pH, favoring bacterium-specific aggregation without direct contact with host cells. Following conjugation onto GCS, the optical-absorbance peak of PANI is red-shifted toward the near-infrared (NIR) region, enabling PANI-GCS NPs to generate a substantial amount of heat, which is emitted to their neighborhood. The local temperature of the NIR-irradiated PANI-GCS NPs is estimated to be approximately 5?°C higher than their ambient tissue temperature, ensuring specific and direct heating of their aggregated bacteria; hence, damage to tissue is reduced and wound healing is accelerated. The above results demonstrate that PANI-GCS NPs are practical for use in the photothermal ablation of focal infections. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Charge conversion; Imaging guiding; pH-responsive nanoparticles; Photothermal therapy; Subcutaneous abscesses,"Ablation; Conjugated polymers; Infrared devices; Nanoparticles; Polyaniline; Tissue; Amphiphilic polymers; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Imaging guiding; Near infrared region; PH-responsive; Photothermal ablation; Photothermal therapy; Subcutaneous abscesses; Bacteria; chitosan; glycol; nanoparticle; polyaniline; nanoparticle; ablation therapy; acidity; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterial viability; bacterium adherence; conjugation; controlled study; Escherichia coli; heating; host cell; infection; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; mouse; nonhuman; photothermal therapy; priority journal; surface charge; temperature sensitivity; tissue injury; wound healing; animal; bacterial infection; bacterial phenomena and functions; Bagg albino mouse; cell survival; chemistry; heat; light; pathology; pH; phototherapy; procedures; radiation response; static electricity; thermotherapy; treatment outcome; Animals; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Cell Survival; Hot Temperature; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hyperthermia, Induced; Light; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Nanoparticles; Phototherapy; Static Electricity; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84998979436

It develops a situationally sample-size-adjusted procedure, called a tightened–normal–tightened (TNT) sampling strategy, on the basis of yield-index (Spk) verification of the production process, whose measurements, garnered from a key quality characteristic with bilateral specification limits, follow a normal distribution. In this paper, we firstly describe the sampling procedure of the Spk - TNT(nT, nN, k) inspection scheme whose sets of parameters include sample sizes for the tightened inspection (nT) and normal inspection (nN), and the critical value (k). Those parameters are determined from the joint solution of two nonlinear inequalities complying with the tolerable vendor's risk, buyer's risk, the desired acceptable quality level (AQL) and limiting quality level (LQL). Then, the proposed Spk - TNT(nT, nN, k) schemes for several inspection standards, widely utilized in practice, are delineated, and their functioning behaviors and propensities are further investigated. Moreover, we compare the Spk - TNT(nT, nN, k) strategy with two unadjusted inspection schemes, Spk-tightened, Spk - T(nT, k), and Spk-normal, Spk - N(nN, k), to illustrate its inspection flexibility and efficiency in real applications. Finally, implementing with a vendor–buyer contract agreement using the Spk - TNT(nT, nN, k) sampling plan, a company inspecting the submitted universal-serial-bus (USB) connectors demonstrates the applicability of our proposed methodologies.

In this study, a new near infrared (NIR)-absorbing nanoagent based on graphene oxide decorated with iron hydroxide/oxide (GO-FeOxH) was developed for light-activated nanomaterial-mediated PDT. This nanocomposite, GO-FeOxH was prepared via the one-step electrooxidation of iron nails in an aqueous GO solution. The as-prepared GO-FeOxH showed a much higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity under NIR light irradiation than GO. Through a variety of spectroscopic analyses, the mechanism involved in the enhancement of ROS activity of GO by FeOxH was systematically investigated. We observed that NIR light irradiation promotes electron transfer from GO to the Fe(iii) of FeOxH and accelerates their reaction with O2, forming superoxide anion radicals, which then undergo a disproportionation reaction to produce H2O2. H2O2 then reacts with Fe(ii) in FeOxH to mediate Fenton reactions, producing amplified hydroxyl radicals. Using in vitro studies, we demonstrated that GO-FeOxH can be used as a NIR activatable PDT nanoagent, providing efficient cancer therapy. ? 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Electron transitions; Electrooxidation; Free radical reactions; Graphene; Infrared devices; Iron; Irradiation; Light; Oxygen; Photodynamic therapy; Spectroscopic analysis; Clinical application; Disproportionation reactions; Near infrared light; Photodynamic therapy (PDT); Reactive oxygen species; Superoxide anion radicals; Tissue penetrations; UV and visible light; Iron oxides,2-s2.0-85011008958

The approach is based on the combination of the measurement of surface dose using TLD and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to estimate the radiopharmaceutical time-activity data. It involves four steps: (1) identify the source organs and outline their contours in computed tomography images; (2) compute the S values on the body surface for each source organ using a MC code; (3) obtain a serial measurement of the dose with numerous TLDs placed on the body surface; (4) solve the dose-activity equation to generate organ cumulative activity for each period of measurement. The activity of each organ at the time of measurement is simply the cumulative activity divided by the timespan between measurements. The usefulness of this method was studied using a MC simulation based on an Oak Ridge National Laboratory mathematical phantom with 18F-FDG filled in six source organs. Numerous TLDs were placed on different locations of the surface and were repeatedly read and replaced. The time-activity curves (TACs) of all organs were successfully reconstructed. Experiments on a physical phantom were also performed. Preliminary results indicate that it is an effective, robust, and simple method for assessing the TAC. The proposed method holds great potential for a range of applications in areas such as targeted radionuclide therapy, pharmaceutical research, and patient-specific dose estimation. ? 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Monte Carlo simulation; thermoluminescent dosimeter; timeactivity curve,"Computerized tomography; Dosimeters; Estimation; Intelligent systems; Patient treatment; Phantoms; Computed tomography images; Mathematical phantoms; Noninvasive measurements; Oak ridge National Laboratory; Pharmaceutical research; Targeted radionuclide therapies; Thermoluminescent dosimeters; Time-activity curves; Monte Carlo methods; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; human; image processing; imaging phantom; Monte Carlo method; positron emission tomography; procedures; thermoluminescence dosimetry; time factor; tissue distribution; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Monte Carlo Method; Phantoms, Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Thermoluminescent Dosimetry; Time Factors; Tissue Distribution",2-s2.0-85012067006

Magnetic imaging of such particles, including nano-particles and clusters, is very important for many fields, especially for medical cancer diagnostics and biophysics applications. For rapid, precise magnetic imaging, we constructed an automatic scanning system, which holds and moves a target sample containing magnetic particles at a given stand-off distance from the FG tips. We show that the device was able to produce clear microscopic magnetic images of 10 μm-size magnetic particles.

This study was carried out to investigate the cytotoxic effects in sinularin-treated human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, HepG2, and to subsequently explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: TheMTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl- tetrazolium bromide) method was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of sinularin on HepG2 and Hep3B cell lines. Furthermore, the cell cycle distribution assay, apoptosis assay, and western blot analysis in vitro were used to explore the possible mechanisms of action. Results: From the results of our study, cell viability was obviously inhibited by sinularin in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, our results suggested that sinularin triggered DNA damage and subsequently induced cell cycle G2/M arrest associated with up-regulation of p-ATM (Ser(1981)), p-Chk2 (Tyr(68)), p-cdc2 (Tyr(15)), and p53 coupled with increased expression of downstream proteins p21 and down-regulation of p-cdc25 (Ser(216)). Moreover, the results of the apoptosis assay and western blot analysis indicated that the cytotoxic activity could be related to mitochondrial apoptosis, characterized by decrease of Bcl-2 expression, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and sequential activation of caspases and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Conclusions: This study reveals for the first time the anti-HCC activities of sinularin, the active compound isolated from the cultured soft coral Sinularia flexibilis.

However, the few studies that have been conducted on this relationship have reported inconsistent results, especially regarding Taiwanese students. We conducted this cross-sectional study to investigate the association of school environment and after-school physical activity with health-related physical fitness in Taiwanese adolescents. Data were drawn from a national survey conducted by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan in 2008 of health-related physical fitness measurements among junior high school students (649,442 total) in grades seven to nine. School environment (level of urbanization, school size, presence of sports field or gymnasium) and after-school physical activity were assessed for their association with adolescents’ physical fitness measurements (body mass index (BMI), bent-leg sit-ups, 800-/1600-m run, sit-and-reach, standing long jump). Urban boys and girls perform significantly better in muscle strength and endurance, cardiorespiratory endurance, flexibility, and explosive power; girls from rural areas exhibited significantly worse scores in body composition. Boys from large-size schools performed the worst in cardiorespiratory endurance, flexibility, and explosive power; whereas girls from large-size schools performed the worst in muscle strength, muscle endurance, and explosive power, but had the best score for body composition. However, the differences in body composition of boys from large-, medium-, and small- size schools did not reach a statistically significant level. Adolescents of both genders in schools with a sports field or gymnasium exhibited significantly better in muscle strength and endurance, cardiorespiratory endurance, and explosive power. Boys in schools with a sports field or gymnasium had significantly better body composition; girls in schools with sports field or gymnasium differed significantly in flexibility. Adolescents of both genders who participated in physical activity after school had significantly better body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, and flexibility. Boys who participated in physical activity after school significantly differed in explosive power, whereas girls who participated in physical activity after school exhibited significantly better flexibility. Thus, the current study demonstrated that some factors, including urbanization (school location in rural or urban areas), school size, school facility provision (school with or without sports fields or gymnasiums), and after-school physical activity participation are more important than others in shaping adolescents’ physical fitness in Taiwan; meanwhile, these association patterns differed by gender. ? 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Adolescent; After-school physical activity; Health-related physical fitness; School environment,adolescence; health education; physical activity; student; survey; adolescent; body composition; body mass; child; cross-sectional study; education; female; fitness; gender; girl; high school student; human; human experiment; leg; male; muscle exercise; muscle strength; physical activity; rural area; sport; Taiwanese; urban area; urbanization; exercise; fitness; health promotion; physiology; procedures; psychology; rural population; school; school health service; student; Taiwan; Taiwan; Adolescent; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Physical Fitness; Rural Population; School Health Services; Schools; Students; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85009965899

Vascular disease in CKD differs clinically and pathobiologically from that in patients with normal renal function. Besides the traditional risk factors, retention of uremic toxins contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular disease in patients with CKD. Indoxyl sulfate is a protein-bound uremic toxin and is inefficiently removed by conventional dialysis. Accumulating evidence suggests that indoxyl sulfate is a vascular toxin involved in atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, vascular calcification and vascular repair. Clinically, indoxyl sulfate is associated with total and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD. Recent studies have indicated that in addition to coronary and cerebral arteries, indoxyl sulfate plays a role in peripheral artery disease (PAD) and dialysis graft thrombosis. Emerging evidence suggests that indoxyl sulfate is implicated via novel mechanisms, including progenitor cell-related neovascularization and tissue factor-related hypercoagulability. These findings raise the possibility that strategies targeting serum indoxyl sulfate may have the potential to improve the outcomes of PAD and dialysis vascular access in patients with CKD. ? 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Chronic kidney disease; Dialysis vascular access; Indoxyl sulfate; Peripheral artery disease; Thrombosis; Uremic toxin,"indican; uremic toxin; indican; angiogenesis; angioplasty; atherosclerosis; blood vessel calcification; cardiovascular mortality; cell migration; cell proliferation; chronic kidney failure; endothelial progenitor cell; hemodialysis; human; human cell; leukocyte; peripheral occlusive artery disease; postoperative thrombosis; Review; smooth muscle cell; vascular surgery; angioplasty; animal; blood clotting; blood vessel transplantation; Graft Occlusion, Vascular; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); pathology; Peripheral Arterial Disease; prognosis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; risk factor; thrombosis; Angioplasty; Animals; Blood Coagulation; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Endothelial Progenitor Cells; Graft Occlusion, Vascular; Humans; Indican; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Prognosis; Renal Dialysis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Thrombosis",2-s2.0-85010431391

In animal studies, upregulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 has been shown in venous segments of arteriovenous fistula. We, therefore, aimed to investigate serial changes in circulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of dialysis arteriovenous fistulas and its relation to restenosis. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Fifty-nine patients with dysfunctional arteriovenous fistulas that were referred for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were enrolled prospectively between January of 2010 and July of 2012. Three of them were excluded due to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty failure or acute infection. Blood was sampled from arteriovenous fistulas at baseline, 2 days, 2 weeks, and 3 months after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Clinical follow-up was continued monthly for 3 months. Angiographic follow-up was arranged at the end of 3 months. Seventeen patients without significant stenosis were enrolled as the control group. Results Fifty-six patients completed clinical follow-up. Significant increases in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were observed at 2 days and 2 weeks (both P<0.001) after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Twenty-three (41%) patients had symptomatic restenosis. The restenosis group had a higher percentage change in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels at 2 days (median =47%; interquartile range, 27%–65% versus median =17%; interquartile range, 10%–25%; P<0.001) after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty compared with the patent group. Fifty-two patients completed angiographic follow-up. A positive correlation between relative luminal loss and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 increase at 2 days after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was found (r=0.53; P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, postangioplasty monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 increase at 2 days was an independent predictor of restenosis. Using receiver operator characteristic analysis, >25% postangioplasty increase of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was significantly associated with restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (hazard ratio, 5.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.81 to 15.8). Conclusions Circulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels were elevated 2 days and 2 weeks after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.

We compared the baby sling with front-worn harness carrier in terms of the physiological responses of the baby caregiver. Ten females (aged 23–32?years) and 10 males (aged 23–35?years) were recruited to participate in this study. Each subject was asked to carry two different weight baby dummies (7 and 10?kg) using three different baby carriers. The electromyography (EMG), shoulder tactile pressure, skin temperatures as well as heart rate were measured during baby carrying. The traditional baby sling and the two front-worn harness carriers showed little differences in EMG activities, shoulder tactile pressure and exercise intensity. Carrying two different weighted baby dummies caused significant differences in EMG and shoulder tactile pressure. Based on the findings of this study, recommendations about the improved baby carrier design are proposed. Practitioner Summary: This study compared traditional sling and front-worn harness baby carriers using caregivers’ physiological responses including electromyography, shoulder tactile pressure, skin temperature and heart rate. Differences found between the carriers provide valuable information for baby carrier design and recommendations for the baby-carrying task. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",baby carrier; Consumer ergonomics; health care ergonomics; physiology; user testing,Electromyography; Heart; Physiological models; Physiology; Slings; baby carrier; Carrier design; Exercise intensity; Health care ergonomics; Physiological response; Skin temperatures; Tactile pressure; User testing; Ergonomics; adult; caregiver; clinical article; controlled study; disease carrier; electromyography; exercise intensity; female; heart rate; human; infant; male; physician; shoulder; skin temperature; back muscle; bioengineering; biomechanics; equipment design; heart rate; infant equipment; pressure; rectus abdominis muscle; skin temperature; young adult; Adult; Back Muscles; Biomechanical Phenomena; Electromyography; Equipment Design; Female; Heart Rate; Human Engineering; Humans; Infant; Infant Equipment; Male; Pressure; Rectus Abdominis; Skin Temperature; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84964088653

To date, no drug has been approved to inhibit P-gp and restore chemotherapy efficacy. Moreover, majority of the reported inhibitors have high molecular weight and complex structures, making it difficult to understand the basic structural requirement for P-gp inhibition. In this study, two structurally simple, low molecular weight piperine analogs Pip1 and Pip2 were designed and found to better interact with P-gp than piperine in silico. A one step, acid-amine coupling reaction between piperic acid and 6,7-dimethoxytetrahydroisoquinoline or 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethylamine afforded Pip1 and Pip2, respectively. In vitro testing in drug resistant P-gp overexpressing KB (cervical) and SW480 (colon) cancer cells showed that both analogs, when co-administered with vincristine, colchicine or paclitaxel were able to reverse the resistance. Moreover, accumulation of P-gp substrate (rhodamine 123) in the resistant cells, a result of alteration of the P-gp efflux, was also observed. These investigations suggest that the natural product analog – Pip1 ((2E,4E)-5-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-1-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1 H)-yl)penta-2,4-dien-1-one) – is superior to piperine and could inhibit P-gp function. Further studies are required to explore the full potential of Pip1 in treating drug resistant cancer. ?

In microfluidic devices, it is difficult to solve dead zone problems and observe dynamic cell-cell interactions. We have created a stable and static culture μ-environment which can enhance NK cell activities. In addition, OET is used to solve dead zone problems by manipulating a single cell into four-leaf-clover-shaped (FLCS) microwells made of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) through optofluidic maskless lithography, causing direct cell-cell contact. Our design reconstructed an in vitro human immune system for the study of dynamic immunological response. When the NK cells came into contact with the target cells in the μ-environment LabChip, we observed that the target cells showed apoptotic characteristics (i.e. cell shrinkage and blebbing within 2 h and then die within 3 h). In addition, our μ-environment LabChip demonstrated higher NK cell activity compared with conventional analysis. We have created an innovative cancer immunotherapy μ-environment LabChip to provide a stable and static μ-environment for cell-cell interaction study.

Methods: In this review, we briefly describe the status of ultrasound microbubbles in clinical practice and then discuss the development of targeted microbubbles. Finally, we consider novel strategies for the use of microbubbles in cancer therapy. Results: Many different kinds of microbubbles are emerged.

This cell-line also expressed a high level of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). This study aimed to verify the role of MMP2 in brain tumour progression. Methods: ALTS1C1 and MMP2 knockdown (MMP2kd) cells were inoculated intracranially, and tumour microenvironment was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining. Results: MMP2 expression was co-localised with CD31-positive cells at invading the tumour front and correlated with an invasive marker GLUT-1. The suppression of MMP2 expression prolonged the survival of tumour-bearing mice associated with tumours having smoother tumour margins, decreased Ki67-proliferating index, and down-regulated GLUT-1 antigen. Although the reduction of MMP2 expression did not alter the vessel density in comparison to parental ALTS1C1 tumours, vessels in MMP2kd tumours were less functional, as evidenced by the low ratio of pericyte coverage and reduction in Hoechst33342 dye perfusion. Conclusions: This study illustrated that tumour-derived MMP2 has at least two roles in tumour malignancy; to enhance tumour invasiveness by degrading the extracellular matrix and to enhance tumour growth by promoting vessel maturation and function. ?

Agrifood and grocer organizations, in concert with some farming groups, have been the primary designers of this new food regulatory regime. These groups have established alliances that compete with national regulators in complex ways. This article analyzes the relationship between public and private sources of food safety regulation by examining standards adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, a food safety organization jointly run by the Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization and GlobalG.A.P., a farm assurance program created in the late 1990s by supermarket chains and their major suppliers which has now expanded into a global certifying coalition. While Codex standards are adopted, often as written, by national food safety regulators who are principal drivers of the standard setting process, customers for agricultural products in many countries now demand evidence of GlobalG.A.P. certification as a prerequisite for doing business This article tests not only the durability and strength of private sector standard setting in the food safety system, but also the desirability of that system as an alternative to formal, governmental processes embodied, for our purposes, in the standards adopted by Codex. In many cases, official standards and GlobalG.A.P. standards clash in ways that implicate not only food safety but the flow of agricultural products in the global trading system. The article analyzes current weaknesses in both regimes and possibilities for change that will better reconcile the two competing systems. ?2017 Food and Drug Law Institute.",,"article; certification; driver; drug efficacy; drug safety; food safety; human; private sector; world health organization; agriculture; food industry; food poisoning; government; international cooperation; law; standards; Agriculture; Food Industry; Food Safety; Foodborne Diseases; Government Agencies; Humans; International Agencies; Legislation, Food",2-s2.0-85038130120

The conclusion of the U.S.-China Food Safety Agreement (""the Agreement"") has allowed FDA to strengthen regulatory cooperation with its Chinese counterpart in various aspects. The Agreement also paves the way for the implementation of the new regulatory tools incorporated in FSMA, especially in the cross-border context. However, both the Agreement and FSMA have certain crucial limitations that may create future hurdles to effective implementation in the U.S.- China cooperation. This paper therefore endeavors to first examine China's governance challenges over food safety, with a focus on the 2009 Food Safety Law, the 2015 Amendment, and the fundamental problem of ""thin"" rule of law. This paper moves to analyze the U.S.-China Food Safety Agreement, reviewing the agreement's strengths and weaknesses. It further assesses FSMA's innovative institutional design to regulate imported food products and its limitations. However, both the U.S.-China Food Safety Agreement and FSMA arguably create a regulatory dilemma for FDA when addressing imported food safety, due to structural mismatch between the broad scope of power granted to FDA and the long chain of power outsourcing to governments or private companies as primary ""regulators."" Neither the Agreement nor FSMA give FDA adequate capacity to closely oversee such ""agents"" along the chain of power outsourcing. Framing the U.S.-China food safety cooperation as a multilayer structure that ""outsources power"" to ""import safety,"" this paper concludes by stressing the need for a robust accountability and effective mechanism for U.S.- China food safety cooperation. ? 2017 Food and Drug Law Institute.

LXRs play essential roles in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. We examined the effects of T0901317, a potent LXR agonist, on angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Treatment with T0901317 inhibited the tube formation and migration of HUVECs and reduced the in vivo angiogenesis, as determined by chorioallantoic membrane assay. T0901317 stimulated gene and protein expression of LXR target gene apolipoprotein D (ApoD). Overexpression of ApoD suppressed the tube formation of HUVECs. ApoD interacted with scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1), while knockdown of SR-B1 blocked suppressive effects of T0901317 on HUVEC migration. T0901317 treatment or overexpression of ApoD lessened expression of proteins regulating angiogenesis, including phospho–eNOS S1177, phospho–Akt T308, phospho–Akt S473, eNOS, mammalian target of rapamycin, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, IL-8, RhoB, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, -9, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1.

In this work, we demonstrated the aqueous synthesis of Gd3+-doped CuInS2/ZnS (CIGS/ZnS) quaternary quantum dots (q-dots), which combine the functions of fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging, via a microwave method. To enhance the tumor-targeting ability, 3-aminophenyl-boronic acid (APBA) and folic acid (FA) moieties were conjugated with the CIGS/ZnS q-dots, and act as dual-targeting ligands to generate CIGS/ZnS@FA/APBA q-dots. In vitro fluorescence imaging and cellular internalization of such q-dots were scrutinized with confocal microscopy, as well as magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed specifically targeted in vitro delivery into HeLa cells containing abundant sialic acid and overexpression of folate receptors on the cell surfaces. As compared to CdTe quantum dots, the formed CIGS/ZnS@FA/APBA q-dots displayed lower in vitro cytotoxicity for both HeLa and HepG2 cells according to the MTT assay. The results also showed that these q-dots neither induce any noticeable abnormalities, nor affect the survival or hatching rate in the embryonic and larval development of zebrafish.

With the advent of the data age, people's lives are closely related to it. Therefore, it is important to use these data for analysis to get effective conclusions. Through the data analysis method, we can analyze the results to do effective decisions-making and applications, more applicable to the interface design. Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides the communicated interface between brain and machines such as computers. It's a technique that the users allowed to interact directly with the machine by using brainwave. The technology includes brainwave (EEG) acquisition, feature extraction and translation algorithm. The researches of BCIs since the 1970s began, the most successful case was Jacques Vidal used brainwave signals to stimulate the visual response and controlled the cursor to take the maze of BCI. Nowadays, it has begun to use in medical aids, and improve the inconvenient situation in daily life. However, the applications in ""personalized"" BCIs are not popular in our life and less of a data validation to support the user-centric design process to provide. Therefore, this study firstly took the mobile application program of the Lego robot designed by the function as an example.Then used the data of the initial test which was assisted by the Data Analysis Method (DAM). The decision made by DAM was to redesign a data-oriented demonstration and user-centered design process (DAUCD). The Lego robot was integrated hardware and software to develop the learnable and personalized BCI. For usability test, we applied the Lego robots to demonstrate the redesign prototype to conduct the usability test. This study not only designed a personalized BCI but also developed a new data-oriented UCD design process.

Whether these germline variations are associated with MPNs in Taiwanese population is obscure. Here we aimed to evaluate the association of five germline variations (JAK2 46/1 haplotype tagged by rs12343867, JAK2 intron 8 rs12339666, TERT rs2736100, HBS1L-MYB rs9376092 and MECOM rs2201862) and the risk of MPNs in Taiwanese population. A total of 178 MPN patients (109 essential thrombocythemia, 54 polycythemia vera and 15 primary myelofibrosis) were enrolled into this study. The information of 17033 control subjects was obtained from Taiwan Biobank database. The JAK2 46/1 haplotype, JAK2 rs12339666 and TERT rs2736100 were significantly associated with Taiwanese MPNs (P = 3.6x10-19, 1.9x10-19 and 3.1x10-6, respectively), and JAK2V617F-positive MPNs (n=121) (P = 5.6x10-21, 4.4x10-21 and 8.6x10-7, respectively). In JAK2V617F-negative cases (n=55), only the JAK2 46/1 haplotype and JAK2 rs12339666 remained statistically significant (P= 0.009 and 0.007, respectively). When stratified by disease subtypes, the JAK2 46/1 haplotype and JAK2 rs12339666 were significantly associated with all three MPN subtypes, but TERT rs2736100 was only associated with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. We did not find any association of these five SNPs with CALR mutations in our cohort. Furthermore, the risk alleles of MECOM rs2201862 and HBS1L-MYB rs9376092 were demonstrated to be negatively associated with the risk of developing polycythemia vera. In conclusion, germline variations at JAK2 (both the 46/1 haplotype and rs12339666) and TERT rs2736100 were associated with MPNs in Taiwanese population. ?

Protein database searches revealed the presence of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) harboring one FxxFY motif. RIPK1 interacted directly with AR and suppressed AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Domain mapping experiments showed that the FxxFY motif in RIPK1 is critical for interactions with AR and the death domain of RIPK1 plays a crucial role in its inhibitory effect on transactivation. In terms of tissue expression, RIPK1 levels were markedly higher in benign prostate hyperplasia and non-cancerous tissue regions relative to the tumor area. With the aid of computer modeling for screening of chemicals targeting activation function 2 (AF-2) of AR, we identified oxadiazole derivatives as good candidates and subsequently generated a small library of these compounds. A number of candidates could effectively suppress AR transactivation and AR-related functions in vitro and in vivo with tolerable toxicity via inhibiting AR-peptide, AR-coregulator and AR N-C interactions. Combination of these chemicals with antiandrogen had an additive suppressive effect on AR transcriptional activity.

This can facilitate the micro-ellipsometry imaging experiment when an incident angle of light is at a large angle, while the detection camera is placed at the upright position. The micro-ellipsometry images for s- and p-polarized reflectance and their phase difference (Rs, Rp, and Δ) was taken by a modified Optrel MULTISKOP system with rotating compensator configuration for various angles of incidence and wavelengths ranging from 450nm to 750nm.

We can further increase the magnification and the numerical aperture by using a substrate collocated with a homemade acrylic resin lens, and the pixel size can be reduced to 50 nm. Based on the above, we study the optical properties of metallic/dielectric nanostructures and nearby biological systems including bacteria, and cancer cells via an imaging micro-ellipsometer combined with detailed theoretical modeling.

OBJECTIVE: To assist the operators, a monitoring-aid system (MAS), that applies four quality control chart methods, was proposed and evaluated. METHODS: Two types of MAS, namely, text and graph marks, were proposed and compared with the original display. To validate the proposed MAS, 17 professional engineers and operators were invited to join an experiment. Two different system states, normal and abnormal, were simulated. The operators were asked to manipulate the system, monitor the critical parameters, search for operational procedures, and deal with other secondary tasks. The primary and secondary task performance and heart rate were measured. After each task was conducted, three subjective rating questionnaires, namely, mental workload, situation awareness, and preference ratings, were implemented for the proposed MAS and the original system. RESULTS: With the assistance of the MAS, the alarm detection rate, secondary task performance, and subjective mental workload demonstrate significant improvements. The proposed MAS helps the operators monitor critical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the MAS should be considered for implementation with the control panel to increase the safety of NPPs. Furthermore, the MAS could reduce the mental workload might decrease the health hazard of the operators. ? 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Especially, air pollution causes great damage to human health. In this work, we build a framework for finding the correlations between air pollution and cancer diseases. This framework consists of a data access flow and a data analytics flow. The data access flow is designed to process raw data and to make the data able to be accessed by APIs. The cancer statistics is then mapped to air pollution data through temporal and spatial information. The analytics flow is used to find insights, based on the data exploration and data classification methods. The data exploration methods use statistics, clustering, and a series of mining techniques to interpret data. Then, the data mining methods are applied to find the relationships between air quality and cancer diseases by viewing air pollution indicators and cancer statistics as features and labels, respectively. The experiment results show that NO and NO2 air pollutants have a significant influence on the breast cancer, and the lung cancer is significantly influenced by NO2, NO, PM10 and O3, which are consistent with those from traditional statistical methods. Moreover, our results also cover the research results from several other studies. The proposed framework is flexible and can be applied to other applications with spatiotemporal data. ?

Effects of chronic exposure to hyperglycemia or AGEs on the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes remain unclear. We examined the chronic effect of AGEs and high glucose on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells by culturing 3T3-L1 cells in the presence of AGEs or 25 mM glucose for 1 month. Chronic incubation of 3T3-L1 cells with AGEs or high glucose blocked their differentiation into mature adipocytes as evidenced by reduced levels of adipocyte markers such as accumulated oil droplets, GPDH, aP2, adiponectin and of adipogenesis regulators PPARγ and C/EBPα. Levels or activities of Src, PDK1, Akt, and NF-κB were higher in AGEs- and high glucose-treated cells than those in 3T3-L1 cells. Levels of Bcl-2 were elevated in AGEs- and high glucose-treated cells, and were attenuated by inhibitors of PI3-kinase, Akt and NF-κB. Moreover, adipogenesis was attenuated in 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing Bcl-2 or YAP. These results suggest that chronic AGEs and high glucose treatments up-regulate Bcl-2 and YAP via the Akt-NF-κB pathway and impair adipogenesis. ?

We used an eye-tracking system to record the viewing time of feedback, and then asked the participants to recall and recognize the feedback. Overall, the results show that (a) participants would view negative feedback longer and recognize better than positive feedback so the resolution model was supported, and (b) outcome status would not influence the processing and recall of feedback because participants would view or recognize more of negative feedback regardless of high or low score outcome situations .

FUTs are involved in various biological processes including cell adhesion and tumor progression. The fucosyltransferase-2 gene (FUT2) encodes alpha (1,2) fucosyltransferase, which is responsible for the addition of the alpha (1,2)-linkage of fucose to glycans. Aberrant fucosylation occurs frequently during the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the association of FUT2 polymorphisms with HCC development has not been studied. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of FUT2 polymorphisms with demographic, etiological, and clinical characteristics and with susceptibility to HCC. In this study, a total of 339 patients and 720 controls were recruited. The genotypes of FUT2 at four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs281377, rs1047781, rs601338, and rs602662) were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction from these samples. Compared with the wild-type genotype at SNP rs1047781, which is homozygous for nucleotides AA, at least one polymorphic T allele (AT or TT) displayed significant association with clinical stage (p = 0.048) and tumor size (p = 0.022).

Here we have demonstrated a rapid, facile, environmentally friendly, and organic solvent-free method for the synthesis of a gold/gadolinium-doped carbon quantum dot (Au/GdC) nanocomposite for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photothermal ablation (PTA) therapy. The gadolinium-doped carbon quantum dots (Gd@CQDs) were synthesized using a one-pot, microwave-assisted method, and used as reducing and stabilizing agents to both form the Au/GdC nanocomposite and prevent its agglomeration. Formation of the Au/GdC nanocomposite is achieved by simple mixing of Gd@CQDs and a gold precursor, without the addition of any other reducing agents, surface passivating agents, surfactants, or organic solvents. The Au/GdC nanocomposite shows paramagnetism, surface plasma resonance in the near infrared region (NIR), and excellent photostability. Furthermore, it provides high longitudinal relaxivity (r1 = 13.95 mM-1 s-1), indicating its potential for use as a T1 contrast agent in MRI. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies using HeLa cells and zebrafish embryos as cancer and animal cell models, respectively, confirmed the low toxicity and excellent biocompatibility of the Au/GdC nanocomposite. Notably, our results demonstrate the ability of the Au/GdC nanocomposite to efficiently destroy cancer cells using PTA.

However, premature payload leakage may impair the host cells, often leading to inadequate in vivo investigations or therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, a nanoplatform that provides a high drug-loading capacity and the precise control of drug release is required. In the present study, a robust one-step synthesis of a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded gold nanorod/albumin core-shell nanoplatform (NR@DOX:SA) was designed for effective macrophage-mediated delivery to demonstrate how nanoparticle-loaded macrophages improve photothermal/chemodrug distribution and retention ability to achieve enhanced antitumor effects. The serum albumin shell of these nanoagents served as a drug reservoir to delay the intracellular DOX release and drug-related toxicity that impairs the host cell carriers. Near-infrared laser irradiation enabled on-demand payload release to destroy neighboring tumor cells. A series of in vivo quantitative analyses demonstrated that the nanoengineered macrophages delivered the nanodrugs through tumor-tropic migration to tumor tissues, resulting in the twice homogenous and efficient photothermal activations of drug release to treat prostate cancer. By contrast, localized pristine NR@DOX:SAs exhibit limited photothermal drug delivery that further reduces their retention ability and therapeutic efficacy after second combinational treatment, leading to a failure of cancer therapy.

To date, no NECC cell-based model is available, which hinders the development of new therapeutic strategies for NECC. In this study, we derived a new NECC cell line from an ex vivo biopsy and used it to explore novel drug combination approach for NECC. Results: The stable HM-1 cell line displayed high expression levels of the neuroendocrine marker, synaptophysin. HM-1 cell transplantation could induce tumor growth in nude mice. As expected, the combination of etoposide and cisplatin synergistically inhibited HM-1 cell proliferation. Strikingly, when etoposide and cisplatin were combined with PI3K inhibitor BEZ235, the growth of HM-1 cells was significantly reduced. Taken together, the data implied the combination of etoposide and cisplatin with BEZ235 not only inhibited HM-1 cell proliferation but also increased cell apoptosis. Materials and Methods: A NECC tissue sample from a 75-year-old female patient was processed to derive a primary cell line annotated as HM-1. The features of HM-1 were analyzed to establish its characteristic profile. Next, HM-1 was treated with PI3K inhibitors, BKM120 and/or BEZ235, in combination with two well-known genotoxic drugs, etoposide and/or cisplatin, to evaluate which combination could serve as a more effective treatment approach. Their inhibiting effects on HM-1 were evaluated by cell viability, apoptosis, and target kinase expression. Conclusions: The newly established NECC cell line HM-1 could serve as a cell-based model for NECC research. The synergistic drug combination of PI3K inhibitor with genotoxic drugs might become a potential new treatment strategy against NECC. ?

The plastic substrates were then engraved as the shape of a micro SD card, followed by capping capillary channel for guiding fluids.

The sensor chip can be inserted into a micro SD card socket, which is connected to a circuit designed for reading out the electrical signals of the sensor. The circuit is controlled by an application software in a laptop. A new methodology was developed to directly detect proteins in high ionic strength solution, such as in 1XPBS or serum, avoiding complicated washing process, leading to less automatics for sample pre-treatment and simpler system and operation. It turns out that the system can be small, cheap, and user-friendly for lay-persons. CRP is demonstrated to be directly detected in human serum with the new methodology.

The novel HEMT sensors using AlGaN/GaN can perform high sensitivity and great specificity in DNA sequences testing. The detection limit can be down to the 1fM and the specificity measurement can identify the signals between two DNA sequences with six-base mismatch. Furthermore, the mechanism of the sensor structure has also been studied. Since the structure of the device has the separation between source drain channel and gate electrode, the comparison with different electrode area and gap distance has been done as well. With repeating electrical measurement confirming, the reusability can also be seen after the 95°C dehybridization process.

In addition, we also showed that when connecting the as-prepared carbon fiber fabrics to a triboelectric nanogenerator, a self-powered antibacterial system was constructed.

The key working mechanism for this method to achieve the critical therapeutic selectivity however remains unclear. In this study, we proposed and demonstrated for the first time the critical role played by catalase in realizing the therapeutic selectivity for the heterogeneous Fenton reaction-driven cancer cell treatment. The heterogeneous Fenton reaction, with the lattice ferric ions of the solid catalyst capable of converting H2O2 to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, can effectively eradicate cancer cells. In this study, SnFe2O4 nanocrystals, a recently discovered outstanding heterogeneous Fenton catalyst, were applied for selective killing of lung cancer cells. The SnFe2O4 nanocrystals, internalized into the cancer cells, can effectively convert endogenous H2O2 into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals to invoke an intensive cytotoxic effect on the cancer cells. On the other hand, catalase, present at a significantly higher concentration in normal cells than in cancer cells, remarkably can impede the apoptotic cell death induced by the internalized SnFe2O4 nanocrystals. According to the results obtained from the in vitro cytotoxicity study, the relevant oxidative attacks were effectively suppressed by the presence of normal physiological levels of catalase. The SnFe2O4 nanocrystals were thus proved to effect apoptotic cancer cell death through the heterogeneous Fenton reaction and were benign to cells possessing normal physiological levels of catalase. The catalase modulation of the involved heterogeneous Fenton reaction plays the key role in achieving selective cancer cell eradication for the hetero eneous Fenton reaction-driven cancer cell treatment. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",Catalase modulation; Heterogeneous Fenton reaction; Hydrogen peroxide; Hydroxyl radicals; Lung cancer cell; Selective cancer therapy; SnFe2O4,Biological organs; Catalysts; Cell death; Chemical reactions; Cytology; Cytotoxicity; Diseases; Hydrogen peroxide; Iron compounds; Modulation; Nanocrystals; Oxidation; Physiology; Tin compounds; Cancer therapy; Heterogeneous fenton; Hydroxyl radicals; Lung cancer cells; SnFe2O4; Cells; catalase; ferric ion; hydrogen peroxide; hydroxyl radical; metal nanoparticle; tin; human; lung tumor; metabolism; Catalase; Ferric Compounds; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydroxyl Radical; Lung Neoplasms; Metal Nanoparticles; Tin,2-s2.0-85021418622

So far, gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) is the most commonly applied surrogate agent for predicting drug distribution through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, Gd-DTPA provides only a short observation duration, and concurrent infusion provides an indirect measure of the exact drug distribution. In this study, we propose using microbubbles as a contrast agent for MRI monitoring, and evaluate their use as a drug-carrying vehicle to directly monitor the infused drug. Results show that microbubbles can provide excellent detectability through MRI relaxometry and accurately represent drug distribution during CED infusion. Compared with the short halflife of Gd-DTPA (1-2 hours), microbubbles allow an extended observation period of up to 12 hours. Moreover, microbubbles provide a sufficiently high drug payload, and glioma mice that underwent a CED infusion of microbubbles carrying doxorubicin presented considerable tumor growth suppression and a significantly improved survival rate.

Demographic data, treatment, and outcome of patients with and without respiratory failure were compared. In this study, 20.5% patients had bites without noticeable signs or symptoms of significant envenoming, 27.3% developed respiratory failure, and 27.3% experienced general pain. Bivalent specific antivenom for B. multicinctus and N. atra was administered in all envenomed cases. Respiratory failure occurred 1.5-6.5 hours post-bite and general pain occurred 1-12 hours post-bite. Specific antivenom for B. multicinctus and N. atra at the recommended dose (i.e., 2-4 vials) might not effectively prevent respiratory failure and pain. Respiratory failure, general pain, and autonomic effects after B. multicinctus bite were probably caused, at least partly, by β-bungarotoxin. Although general weakness, ptosis, dysarthria, and dilated pupils were significantly associated with respiratory failure, their predictive value could not be accurately determined in such a retrospective study. Due to the rapid onset of respiratory failure, every suspected envenomed case thus should be closely monitored in the first few hours. We recommend the initial administration of four vials of antivenom in all envenomation cases, and a subsequent four vials be considered if the patient's condition is deteriorating.

Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, follow-up period and hematological parameters confirmed that increased activated B cells were universally present in JAK2-mutated, CALR-mutated and triplenegative ET patients when compared to healthy adults. JAK2- and CALR-mutated ET have significantly higher fraction of B cells with TLR4 expression when compared to triple-negative ET (p=0.019 and 0.02, respectively).

We investigated the role of α2,3-sialyltransferase type I (ST3GalI) by analyzing human ovarian cancer datasets and human EOC tissue arrays. We found that high expression of ST3GalI was associated with advanced stage EOC. Transwell migration and cell invasion assays showed that high ST3GalI expression enhanced migration of EOC cells. We also observed that there was a linear relation between ST3GalI expression and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in EOC patients, and that high ST3GalI expression blocked the effect of EGFR inhibitors. Co- Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that ST3GalI and EGFR were present in the same protein complex. Inhibition of ST3GalI using a competitive inhibitor, Soyasaponin I (SsaI), inhibited tumor cell migration and dissemination in the in vivo mouse model with transplanted MOSEC cells. Further, SsaI synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor effects of EGFR inhibitor on EOC cells. Our study demonstrates that ST3GalI regulates ovarian cancer cell migration and peritoneal dissemination via EGFR signaling. This suggests α2,3-linked sialylation inhibitors in combination with EGFR inhibitors could be effective agents for the treatment of EOC.","Epidermal growth factor receptor; Epithelial ovarian cancer; Soyasaponin I; α2,3-sialyltransferases type I","alpha2,3 sialyltransferase type I; dovitinib; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; lapatinib; oncoprotein; soyasaponin I; unclassified drug; vandetanib; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cell invasion assay; cell migration; controlled study; down regulation; drug potentiation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; ovarian cancer cell line; ovary cancer; peritoneum metastasis; protein expression; protein function; regulatory mechanism; sialylation; signal transduction",2-s2.0-85018419443

The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), while aiming to address the issue through various regulatory measures, has created many friction points with other treaty regimes – international trade, intellectual property, and investment. In particular, the tension between the FCTC and the World Trade Organization (WTO) has received much scholar attention. However, the existing literature focuses largely on reconciling public health measures and WTO rules applicable to legal trade in tobacco products. An equally important issue has been left out – illicit trade. Illegally manufactured, distributed, and sold tobacco amounts to 650 billion cigarettes annually – over 12% of the global total. Illicit tobacco trade has exacerbated the tobacco epidemic and undermined the effectiveness of price and tax measures. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (Protocol) was adopted under the FCTC to strengthen supply chain controls, establish legal liabilities, and facilitate international cooperation. However, issues such as supply chain complexity, surreptitious nature, and industry involvement have been overlooked in the negotiation stage. This article therefore examines such factors in depth and identifies two missing governance tools – a notification system and a whistleblower mechanism – to close the loophole, facilitate implementation, and strengthen the global regulatory strategy. ? 2017 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",,developing world; international trade; policy implementation; regulatory framework; strategic approach; tobacco; trade performance; trade policy; World Trade Organization; Nicotiana tabacum,2-s2.0-85017560775

RNA-containing EV are in the limelight for their capacity to communicate genetically encoded messages to other cells, their suitability as candidate biomarkers for diseases, and their use as therapeutic agents. Although EV-RNA has attracted enormous interest from basic researchers, clinicians, and industry, we currently have limited knowledge on which mechanisms drive and regulate RNA incorporation into EV and on how RNAencoded messages affect signalling processes in EV-targeted cells. Moreover, EV-RNA research faces various technical challenges, such as standardisation of EV isolationmethods, optimisation of methodologies to isolate and characteriseminute quantities of RNA found in EV, and development of approaches to demonstrate functional transfer of EV-RNA in vivo. These topics were discussed at the 2015 EV-RNA workshop of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles. This position paper was written by the participants of the workshop not only to give an overview of the current state of knowledge in the field, but also to clarify that our incomplete knowledge - of the nature of EV(-RNA)s and of how to effectively and reliably study them - currently prohibits the implementation of gold standards in EV-RNA research. In addition, this paper creates awareness of possibilities and limitations of currently used strategies to investigate EV-RNA and calls for caution in interpretation of the obtained data. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Exosomes; Extracellular vesicles; Function; MRNA; Non-coding RNA; Quantification; RNA binding proteins; Sorting,argonaute 2 protein; dicer; extracellular vesicle RNA; fragile X mental retardation syndrome related protein 1; messenger RNA; microRNA; protein TNRC6A; ribosome RNA; RNA; RNA binding protein; unclassified drug; Article; artifact; blood analysis; cell communication; cellular distribution; correct reporting; Cre loxP system; DNA modification; exosome; high throughput sequencing; human; in vitro study; information dissemination; inside extracellular vesicle; intracellular signaling; knowledge exchange; medical research; molecular genetics; multivesicular body; nonhuman; outside extracellular vesicle; particle size; precipitation; process optimization; purification; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; reproducibility; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; RNA fragment; RNA integrity; RNA sequence; RNA stability; RNA translation; RNA transport; sensitivity and specificity; size exclusion chromatography; small extracellular vesicle; standardization; stoichiometry,2-s2.0-85015705673

Currently, sorafenib is the only drug that has been approved by the U.S. FDA for patients with advanced HCC. However, its improvement on patient outcomes is modest, and the median survival time is only prolonged 2-3 months. In addition, the application of sorafenib is limited because of its high cost and severe adverse side-effects. Therefore, developing more effective novel agents and reducing the dosage of sorafenib are urgently needed for HCC therapy. Here, a novel benzimidazole derivative (4a) bearing a pyrolidine side chain (9a) was synthesized. The treatments of compounds 4a, 9a and sorafenib either alone or in combination on the inhibition of liver cancer cells proliferation were measured using alamarBlue cell viability and trypan blue staining assay. Intracellular signaling pathway activities were assessed by Western blot, Q-PCR and IHC staining. The HuH7 xenograft model was used to examine antitumor activity in vivo. Adverse effects (e.g., changes in body weight, serum parameters, liver function and pathology) of mice treated with 9a were also evaluated. Compound 9a significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation compared with 4a. In addition, 9a strongly synergized with a low dose of sorafenib in suppressing HCC cell proliferation. Regarding the activities of the signaling pathways, sorafenib did not suppress AKT signaling; however, 9a inhibited AKT and its downstream phosphorylation of p70S6K. In addition, treatment with either 9a alone or in combination with sorafenib led to the inhibition of JNK phosphorylation. However, there were no effects on the inhibition of apoptosis. The in vivo HuH7 xenograft model showed that the administration of 9a plus a low dose of sorafenib significantly decreased expression of the HCC markers α-fetoprotein, glypican-3 and survivin as well as suppressed tumor growth. Finally, there were no adverse effects in mice treated with 9a. In conclusion, co-treatment with a novel benzimidazole derivative bearing a pyrolidine side chain in combination with a low dose of sorafenib exerted significant antitumor activity in preclinical HCC models, which potentially suggests its use as a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with HCC. ?

Skin cancer is an aggressive human malignancy with increasing incidence worldwide; however, the underlying mechanisms involved in VEGF-C-induced skin cancer stemness and metastasis remain unclear. Here, we report that VEGF-C enhances skin cancer migration, invasion and stemness through Slug up-regulation. Oncomine database analysis indicated that the KRAS/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) pathway and YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1) expression are positively correlated with metastatic skin cancer. We show that VEGF-C triggers the activation of KRAS/MAPK signaling to increase YAP1 and downstream Slug expression, which are suppressed by an anti-VEGFR3 (VEGF receptor 3) peptide, a specific peptide targeting VEGFR3. The VEGF-C-induced migration, invasion and stemness of skin cancer cells are also abrogated by the anti-VEGFR3 peptide.

Polyethylenimine (PEI) has been identified as an efficient non-viral vector for transgene expression. In this study, we created a very high efficient DNA/siRNA co-delivery system by incorporating a negatively-charged poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) into PEI/nucleic acid complexes. Spherical nanoparticles with about 200 nm diameter were formed by mixing PEI/plasmid DNA/siRNA/γ-PGA (dual delivery nanoparticles; DDNPs) with specific ratio (N/P/C ratio) and the particles present positive surface charge under all manufacturing conditions. The gel retardation assay shows both nucleic acids were effectively condensed by PEI, even at low N/P ratios. The PEI-based DDNPs reveal excellent DNA/siRNA transfection efficiency in the human hepatoma cell line (Hep 3B) by simultaneously providing high transgene expression efficiency and high siRNA silencing effect.

However, their correlation with dialysis graft outcomes remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between circulating endothelial progenitor cells and dialysis graft outcomes. Methods: After excluding 14 patients with acute coronary syndrome, decompensated heart failure or graft thrombosis in the prior three months, a total of 120 patients undergoing dialysis who underwent endovascular therapy of dysfunctional dialysis grafts were prospectively enrolled. Blood was sampled from study subjects in the morning of a mid-week non-dialysis day. Surface makers of CD34, KDR, and CD133 were used in combination to determine the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells. All participants were prospectively followed until June 2013. Results: The median follow-up duration was 13 months, within which 62 patients experienced at least one episode of graft thrombosis. Patients with graft thrombosis had lower CD34+KDR+ cell counts compared with patients without graft thrombosis (median 4.5 vs. 8 per 105 mononuclear cells, p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated thrombosis-free survival was lower in the low CD34+KDR+ cell count group (30%) than in the high CD34+KDR+ cell count group (61%; p = 0.007). Univariate analysis showed diabetes, high sensitive C-reactive protein, lesion length and CD34+KDR+ cell counts associated with graft thrombosis. Multivariate analyses confirmed an independent association between low CD34+KDR+ cell counts and graft thrombosis (hazard ratio, 2.52; confidence interval, 1.43-4.44; p = 0.001). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated an independent association between low circulating endothelial progenitor cell counts and dialysis graft thrombosis. ? 2017, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

However, HCV infection and replication are uneven and vary among individual hepatocytes. To investigate the effect of the viral load on host DNA damage, we used an Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein gene (EYFP)-tagged HCV virus to distinguish between HCV intracellular high viral load (HVL) cells and low viral load (LVL) cells. The cell sorting efficiency was confirmed by the high expression of the HCV polyprotein. We found DNA damage γ-H2AX foci in the HVL population. Comet assays demonstrated that HVL was related to the extent of the DNA strand breaks. Surprisingly, the DNA qPCR arrays and western blotting showed that the damage-related genes GPX2, MRE11, phospho-ATM, and OGG1 were significantly up-regulated in LVL cells but inversely down-regulated or consistently expressed in HVL cells. The colony survival assay to examine the repair abilities of these cells in response to irradiation showed that the LVL cells were more resistant to irradiation and had an increased ability to repair radiation-induced damage. This study found that intracellular viral loads drove cellular DNA damage levels but suppressed damage-related gene expression. However, the increase in damage-related gene expression in the LVL cells may be affected by ROS from the HVL cells.

We hence devise a highly efficient organic light-emitting diode which exhibits a color mimicking that of an incandescent bulb, and a 120 lm W-1 at 100 cd m-2 power efficacy, which is 12 times that of an incandescent bulb or 1000 times that of a candle.

There has been a worldwide concern to use photocatalysts to degrade organic pollutants in waste water. However, the requirement of light assistance in degradation process has limited the application of photocatalysts. In this paper, MoS2/PDMS nanocomposite was fabricated in order to overcome this problem. The results showed that MoS2/PDMS nanocomposite can provide a high degradation activity to purify the waste water without light assistance. The MoS2/PDMS nanocomposite preserved an activity of 67% toward dye Rhodamine B degradation even in the fourth cycling test. We found that the high degradation activity of MoS2/PDMS nanocomposite was based on the piezo-catalytic effect of single- and few-layers MoS2 nanoflowers in the nanocomposite. We also demonstrated that MoS2/PDMS nanocomposite was a useful material in the fabrication of nanogenerator to harvest waste water energy. Through the direct coating of MoS2/PDMS nanocomposite on a metal grid, electric outputs of 23?V and 13?mA/m2 can be generated when a water flow (20?mL/s) was passing the nanogenerator. In addition, when coating MoS2/PDMS nanocomposite on a flat electrode and placing it inside a water pipe, the nanogenerator could not only act as the source of electric output, but also as a self-powered sensor to locate the water passage route and/or the contamination areas in the waste water. ? 2016",Energy harvesting; Molybdenum disulfide; Nanomaterials; Piezo-catalytic effect; Self-powered sensor,Coatings; Energy harvesting; Flow of water; Molybdenum compounds; Nanocomposites; Nanostructured materials; Nanotechnology; Organic pollutants; Pollution; Wastewater treatment; Water pipelines; Water pollution; Catalytic effects; Contamination areas; Degradation activity; Degradation process; Electric output; Infectious disease; Molybdenum disulfide; Self-powered; Water treatment,2-s2.0-85003881511

In this work, a bubble-generating liposomal system that can be thermally triggered to liberate its loaded IONPs instantly and precisely in defined cellular organelles is utilized to elucidate the mechanism that is responsible for the contradictory observations concerning IONP toxicity. As-prepared liposomes are internalized by test cells via endocytosis, and these internalized particles follow the endocytotic pathway from the endosomes to the lysosomes. The degradation of IONPs and the consequent release of iron ions depend strongly on the pH of the environment in the cellular organelles from which they are liberated, to which they are exposed, during their intracellular transportation. Higher IONP toxicity is associated with stronger in situ degradation with the release of more iron ions, and the consequent generation of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells. When the amount of ROS formed exceeds what can be scavenged by the intracellular antioxidant systems, the cells experience oxidative stress, which is responsible for the observed cellular organelle-dependent toxicity profiles. Understanding the mechanism that underlies the toxicity of IONPs is critical for designing IONP nanosystems that have a wide range of clinical applications. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",,Diseases; Iron; Liposomes; Metal ions; Metal nanoparticles; Molecular biology; Nanoparticles; Nanosystems; Toxicity; Antioxidant systems; Cancer diagnosis; Cellular organelles; Clinical application; Endocytotic pathway; Iron oxide nanoparticle; Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs); Reactive oxygen species; Iron oxides,2-s2.0-85008497215

Gene selection problem involves reducing irrelevant, redundant and noisy genes and identifying the most distinguished genes to improve the classification accuracy. In this paper, a hybrid filter/wrapper method, known as IG-ISSO is proposed for gene selection problem. In this method, information gain (IG) as a filter is applied to select the most informative genes and an improved simplified swarm optimization (ISSO) is proposed as a gene search engine to guide the search for an optimal gene subset. The support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel serves as a classifier of the IG-ISSO. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method empirically, experiments are examined using ten gene expression datasets, and the corresponding results are compared with up-to-date works. The results of the statistical analysis indicate that the proposed method is better than its competitors. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Feature selection; Gene selection; Information gain; Simplified swarm optimization,Data mining; Feature extraction; Filtration; Genes; Search engines; Support vector machines; Cancer diagnosis; Classification accuracy; Gene Expression Data; Gene expression datasets; Gene selection; Information gain; Informative genes; Simplified swarm optimizations (SSO); Gene expression; Article; classifier; controlled study; experimental study; filter; gene expression; gene identification; genetic database; genetic procedures; genetic screening; improved simplified swarm optimization; intermethod comparison; kernel method; linear system; medical information; priority journal; search engine; statistical analysis; support vector machine,2-s2.0-84994103450

This disease is characterized by excessive accumulation of GFAP, known as Rosenthal fibers, within astrocytes. Abnormal GFAP aggregation also occurs in giant axon neuropathy (GAN), which is caused by recessive mutations in the gene encoding gigaxonin. Given that one of the functions of gigaxonin is to facilitate proteasomal degradation of several IF proteins, we sought to determine whether gigaxonin is involved in the degradation of GFAP. Using a lentiviral transduction system, we demonstrated that gigaxonin levels influence the degradation of GFAP in primary astrocytes and in cell lines that express this IF protein. Gigaxonin was similarly involved in the degradation of some but not all AxD-associated GFAP mutants. In addition, gigaxonin directly bound to GFAP, and inhibition of proteasome reversed the clearance of GFAP in cells achieved by overexpressing gigaxonin. These studies identify gigaxonin as an important factor that targets GFAP for degradation through the proteasome pathway. Our findings provide a critical foundation for future studies aimed at reducing or reversing pathological accumulation of GFAP as a potential therapeutic strategy for AxD and related diseases. ? 2016 Lin, Huang, et al.",,"cell protein; gigaxonin; glial fibrillary acidic protein; proteasome; unclassified drug; cytoskeleton protein; GAN protein, human; glial fibrillary acidic protein; proteasome; adrenal carcinoma cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; astrocyte; cancer cell line; clearance; controlled study; gene mutation; gene overexpression; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence microscopy; Lentivirinae; nonhuman; primary cell; priority journal; protein blood level; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; proteinase inhibition; rat; signal transduction; Alexander disease; cell culture; genetics; giant axonal neuropathy; metabolism; mutation; physiology; protein degradation; Alexander Disease; Astrocytes; Cells, Cultured; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Giant Axonal Neuropathy; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Humans; Mutation; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Proteolysis",2-s2.0-85006437614

The NP delivery system was obtained from assembly of poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-grafted hyaluronic acid (HA-g-PLGA) together with an anticancer drug, SN38, in aqueous phase, followed by implementing the NP surface with a layer of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(histamine methacrylamide) (mPEG-b-PHMA) via hydrophobic association to improve the colloidal stability both in vitro and in vivo. Upon arrival of these PEGylated NPs at the acidic tumor site through the EPR effect, mPEG-b-PHMA became detached from the NP surface by the charge transition of the PHMA blocks from neutral (hydrophobic) to positively charged (hydrophilic) state via acid-induced protonation of their imidazole groups in tumor microenvironment. The exposure of HA shell on the naked NP thus resulted in enhanced uptake of NPs by CD44-expressed tumor cells, including cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Along with the TAMs being further chemotactically recruited by hypoxia cells, the engulfed nanotherapeutics was thus transported into the avascular area in which the anticancer action of chemotherapy occurred by virtue of the drug release alongside PLGA degradation, similar to those arising in other tumor nonhypoxia regions. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Cells; Chemotherapy; Cytology; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Hyaluronic acid; Hydrophobicity; Lactic acid; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Nanoparticles; Anticancer actions; Colloidal Stability; Drug delivery strategies; Hydrophobic association; Nanoparticle (NPs); Poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid); Tumor associated macrophages; Tumor microenvironment; Tumors; firtecan; Hermes antigen; hyaluronic acid; imidazole; irinotecan; nanoparticle; polyglactin; antineoplastic agent; camptothecin; hyaluronic acid; nanoparticle; polyester; polyglycolic acid; polylactide; animal cell; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; degradation; drug selectivity; hypoxic cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; malignant neoplastic disease; mouse; nanopharmaceutics; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; synthesis; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; analogs and derivatives; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; cytology; drug delivery system; drug effects; macrophage; male; pathology; Prostatic Neoplasms; tumor cell culture; tumor microenvironment; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Camptothecin; Cell Survival; Drug Delivery Systems; Hyaluronic Acid; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nanoparticles; Polyesters; Polyglycolic Acid; Prostatic Neoplasms; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85006070878

HDV genome encodes two forms of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), small HDAg (HDAg-S), which is required for viral replication, and large HDAg (HDAg-L), which is essential for viral assembly. HDAg-L is identical to HDAg-S except that it bears a 19-amino acid extension at the C terminus. Both HDAgs contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS), but only HDAg-L contains a CRM1-independent nuclear export signal at its C terminus. The nuclear export activity of HDAg-L is important for HDV particle formation. However, the mechanisms of HDAg-L-mediated nuclear export of HDV ribonucleoprotein are not clear. In this study, the host cellular RNA export complex TAP-Aly was found to form a complex with HDAg-L, but not with an export-defective HDAg-L mutant, in which Pro205 was replaced by Ala. HDAg-L was found to colocalize with TAP and Aly in the nucleus. The C-terminal domain of HDAg-L was shown to directly interact with the N terminus of TAP, whereas an HDAg-L mutant lacking the NLS failed to interact with full-length TAP. In addition, small hair-pin RNA-mediated down-regulation of TAP or Aly reduced nuclear export of HDAg-L and assembly of HDV virions. Furthermore, a peptide, TAT-HDAg-L(198-210), containing the 10-amino acid TAT peptide and HDAg-L(198-210), inhibited the interaction between HDAg-L and TAP and blocked HDV virion assembly and secretion. These data demonstrate that formation and release of HDV particles are mediated by TAP and Aly. ? 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Peptides; RNA; C-terminal domains; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis delta virus; Nuclear export signals; Nuclear localization signal; Particle formations; Ribonucleoproteins; Viral replication; Viruses; cell protein; hepatitis delta antigen; hepatitis delta antigen L; protein Aly; protein TAP; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; ABC transporter; ALYREF protein, human; hepatitis delta antigen; nuclear localization signal; nuclear protein; peptide; RNA binding protein; transcription factor; transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP); amino acid composition; amino terminal sequence; Article; controlled study; down regulation; molecular size; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein domain; protein function; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein transport; virion; virus assembly; virus particle; virus release; antagonists and inhibitors; cell nucleus; drug effects; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; Hepatitis delta virus; human; metabolism; nuclear localization signal; nucleocytoplasmic transport; physiology; virology; virus assembly; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Cell Nucleus; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatitis delta Antigens; Hepatitis Delta Virus; Humans; Nuclear Localization Signals; Nuclear Proteins; Peptides; Protein Domains; RNA-Binding Proteins; Transcription Factors; Virion; Virus Assembly",2-s2.0-85002589218

The objective of the current research was to examine military pilots' attention distributions between chasing a moving target and a stationary target. METHOD: In the current research, 37 mission-ready F-16 pilots participated. Subjects' eye movements were collected by a portable head-mounted eye-tracker during tactical training in a flight simulator. The scenarios of chasing a moving target (air-to-air) and a stationary target (air-to-surface) consist of three operational phases: searching, aiming, and lock-on to the targets. RESULTS: The findings demonstrated significant differences in pilots' percentage of fixation during the searching phase between air-to-air (M = 37.57, SD = 5.72) and air-to-surface (M = 33.54, SD = 4.68). Fixation duration can indicate pilots' sustained attention to the trajectory of a dynamic target during air combat maneuvers. Aiming at the stationary target resulted in larger pupil size (M = 27,105, SD = 6565), reflecting higher cognitive loading than aiming at the dynamic target (M = 23,864, SD = 8762). DISCUSSION: Pilots' visual behavior is not only closely related to attention distribution, but also significantly associated with task characteristics. Military pilots demonstrated various visual scan patterns for searching and aiming at different types of targets based on the research settings of a flight simulator. The findings will facilitate system designers' understanding of military pilots' cognitive processes during tactical operations. They will assist human-centered interface design to improve pilots' situational awareness. The application of an eye-tracking device integrated with a flight simulator is a feasible and cost-effective intervention to improve the efficiency and safety of tactical training. ? by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.",Attentional processes; Eye movements; Mental workload; Simulation and training; Situation awareness,adult; aerospace medicine; airplane pilot; attention; awareness; eye movement; human; male; middle aged; oculography; psychology; simulation training; soldier; task performance; Adult; Aerospace Medicine; Attention; Awareness; Eye Movement Measurements; Eye Movements; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Military Personnel; Pilots; Simulation Training; Task Performance and Analysis,2-s2.0-85019973787

Methods Twenty children with ASD aged between 3 years and 7.11 years were assessed with the ToM test, and then placed in a free play condition and a pretend play condition to assess pretend play and playfulness with the Child-Initiated Pretend Play Assessment and Test of Playfulness, respectively. In addition, the children's symptom severities of ASD and verbal abilities were also assessed with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Test—second edition, respectively. Results The results of the regression analysis confirmed that ToM significantly predicted pretend play variables, namely, Number of Object Substitutions (R2?=?.158, p?=?.002) and Number of Imitated Actions (R2?=?.175, p?=?.001), but not playfulness. The CARS score was a significant predictor of the Percentage of Elaborate Pretend Play Actions of pretend play (R2?=?.075, p?=?.034), as well as the internal control (R2?=?.125, p?=?.006) and framing (R2?=?.071, p?=?.039) variables of playfulness. Conclusion The findings support the idea that children with ASD who have better ToM might be able to develop better pretend play, but not better playfulness, which might be more strongly related to their autistic severity. ? 2016",autism spectrum disorder; playfulness; pretend play; theory of mind,Article; autism; child; Child Initiated Pretend Play Assessment; Childhood Autism Rating Scale; clinical article; disease severity; disease severity assessment; female; human; male; play; playfulness; pretend play performance; priority journal; rating scale; Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Test; scoring system; Test of Playfulness; theory of mind; verbal communication,2-s2.0-85007407080

Little is known about the feasibility and safety of using dialysis arteriovenous (AV) shunts. We aim to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using dialysis AV shunts for access in right heart catheterization. METHODS: Hemodialysis patients who required right heart catheterization were prospectively enrolled. A 7 Fr sheath was inserted and a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter was advanced for right heart catheterization. Patients were followed for 1 month, and technical success, procedure details, and complications were recorded. RESULTS: Thirteen patients received right heart catheterization via AV shunts. Three patients were evaluated for heart failure, and 10 were examined for pulmonary hypertension. Median patient age was 69 years (interquartile range [IQR], 58-77 years), and median shunt age was 50 months (IQR, 32-75 months). Five shunts were located in the upper arm, 2 were in the right arm, and 5 were native fistulas. All AV shunt punctures were successful on the first attempt. All right heart catheterizations were completed via AV shunts, and the technical success rate was 100%. Median fluoroscopy time was 6.9 minutes. No venous access complications or right heart catheterization-related complications occurred immediately after the procedure or during the 1-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: AV dialysis shunts can be used for venous access for right heart catheterization with acceptable feasibility and patient tolerability.

Here, we report that lung cancer cell populations generate phenotypic and oncogenic plasticity via a switch between differentiation programs controlled by SOX2 and SOX9, thus altering proliferative and invasive capabilities. In lung cancer cells, SOX2 bound the EPCAM promoter to induce EpCAM-p21Cip1 - cyclin A2 signaling, encouraging cell proliferation as well as barrier properties. In contrast, SOX9 bound the SLUG promoter to induce SLUG-mediated cell invasion with a spindle-like phenotype. Pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC elevated a SOX9-positive cell population from SOX2-positive cells, whereas ectopic expression of SOX2 inhibited SOX9 with increased H3K9me2 levels on the SOX9 promoter. In clinical specimens, the expression of SOX2 and SOX9 correlated negatively and positively with lung tumor grade, respectively.

There are still few studies which concern on the emerging persistent organic pollutants like polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) bound on PM2.5. The aim of this study was to investigate PBDEs in PM2.5 in various outdoor (metropolis, industrial, and rural areas) and indoor (library, rail station, hospital, supermarket, department store, and office) environments. PM2.5-bound PBDEs was analyzed by high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry after PM2.5 was collected. Mean levels of PM2.5-bound ?14PBDEs were 79.0 and 116 pg m?3 in outdoor and indoor air, respectively. Compared to other outdoor locations, the industrial sites, Taixi (169 pg m?3) in particular, has the highest PM2.5-bound PBDEs levels which might be attributed to nearby industrial activities and indoor to outdoor migration behaviors. For indoor air, PM2.5-bound PBDEs mean concentrations (libraries, rail stations, department stores, offices, hospitals, and supermarkets) were found to be 357, 35.3, 50.2, 73.2, 59.2, and 124 pg m?3, respectively. The high indoor PM2.5-bound PBDEs levels found in libraries are heavily affected by the presence of indoor electronic equipment or other consumer products. Similarly, this is also true for supermarkets which merchandise electronic consumer products. Although the abundant congener of deca-BDE consisted of 74.7% and 48.03% of ?14PBDEs in the indoor and outdoor air, respectively, nona-BDEs predominantly contributed 11.6% in the indoors while tri- and tert-BDES contributed 11.3% and 16% in the outdoors. Higher brominated PBDEs are more likely due to their emission from electronic surfaces while lower brominated PBDEs are products of photochemical degradation. Other factors affecting both the indoor and outdoor air PM2.5-bound PBDE homologue levels such as migration behaviors might also be considered. ?

Our results showed that these magnetofluorescent GdNS@CQDs have excellent fluorescent and magnetic properties. Moreover, GdNS@CQDs exhibited high stability at physiological conditions and ionic strength. These magnetofluorescent GdNS@CQDs were conjugated with a folic acid, denoted as FA-GdNS@CQDs, for targeting dual modal fluorescence/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the high biocompatibility and low toxicity of FA-GdNS@CQDs. FA-GdNS@CQDs enhanced the MR response as compared to that for commercial Gd-DTPA. The targeting capabilities of FA-GdNS@CQDs were confirmed in HeLa and HepG2 cells using in vitro fluorescence and MR dual modality imaging. Additionally, an anticancer drug, doxorubicin, was incorporated into the FA-GdNS@CQDs forming FA-GdNS@CQDs-DOX, which enables targeted drug delivery. Importantly, the prepared FA-GdNS@CQDs-DOX showed a high quantity of doxorubicin loading capacity (about 80%) and pH-sensitive drug release. The uptake into cancer cells and the intracellular location of the FA-GdNS@CQDs were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. We also successfully demonstrated in vivo fluorescence bio imaging of the FA-GdNS@CQDs, using zebrafish as an animal model. Statement of Significance In this manuscript, we reported a facial, rapid, and environmental friendly method to fabricate hetero atoms including gadolinium, nitrogen, and sulfur doped multi-functional magnetofluorescent carbon quantum dots (GdNS@CQDs) nanocomposite. These multifunctional GdNS@CQDs were conjugated with a folic acid for targeting dual modal fluorescence/magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, an anticancer drug, doxorubicin, was incorporated into the nanocomposite forming FA-GdNS@CQDs-DOX, which enables targeted drug delivery.

Our goal is thus to investigate concentrations of PBDD/DF/DEs in elementary school classroom dust to further assess the impact on school-age children via ingestion. The dust from classrooms, including both normal (NR) and computer classrooms (CR), was collected from six urban and four rural schools. Fourteen PBDEs and twelve PBDD/Fs were measured using high-resolution gas-chromatography/high-resolution mass-spectrometry. The mean levels of Σ14PBDEs in NR and CR dust from the urban classrooms were 370 and 2510?ng/g and those whose dust from the rural classrooms were 464 and 1780?ng/g. The means of ΣPBDD/Fs were 0.0401?ng-WHO2005-TEQ/g (concentration: 4.72?ng/g) in urban NR dust, 0.0636?ng-WHO2005-TEQ/g (7.51?ng/g) in urban CR dust, 0.0281?ng-WHO2005TEQ/g (3.60?ng/g) in rural NR dust, and 0.0474?ng-WHO2005TEQ/g (6.28?ng/g) in rural CR dust. The PBDEs pattern in NR dust was quite different from that in CR dust, but the PBDD/Fs patterns in NR and CR dust were similar. A linearly significant correlation coefficient (n?=?20, r?=?0.862, p?&lt;?0.001) was found between ΣPBDEs and ΣPBDD/Fs in NR and CR dust, indicating that the PBDEs and PBDD/Fs in the dust may be from the same sources in the elementary school classrooms. This study assessed the risks (daily intake and cancer and non-cancer risks) of PBDEs and PBDD/Fs for the children from the classroom dust, and the calculated risk values did not exceed the related thresholds. With regard to the exposure scenarios for school-age children in an indoor environment, the results suggest that they might ingest more dust PBDD/DF/DEs in their homes than in the schools. In conclusion, the exposure of Taiwanese elementary school children to PBDD/DF/DEs via indoor dust was with a safe range based on our findings. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Elementary classroom dust; Polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PBDD/Fs); Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs); Risk assessment; School-age children,"Diseases; Ethers; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Organic pollutants; Risk assessment; Teaching; Correlation coefficient; Elementary classrooms; High-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometries; Indoor environment; Pbdd/fs; Polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); School-age children; Dust; polybrominated dibenzodioxin; polybrominated dibenzofuran; polybrominated diphenyl ether; diphenyl ether derivative; pentabromodiphenyl ether; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; bioaccumulation; dioxin; dust; furan; indoor air; PBDE; pollutant source; pollution exposure; risk assessment; Article; child; concentration (parameters); dust; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; gas chromatography; human; mass spectrometry; primary school; priority journal; risk assessment; rural area; school child; Taiwanese; urban area; air pollutant; analysis; computer; dust; environmental exposure; indoor air pollution; school; Taiwan; toxicity; Taiwan; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Computers; Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Risk Assessment; Schools; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84993661470

Although passive treatment with antitumor antibodies has exhibited remarkable therapeutic efficacy, inhibitory effects on tumor progression by endogenous antitumor autoantibodies (EAAs) have been limited. In this study, we show that P4N, a derivative of the plant lignan nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), enhanced the production of EAAs and inhibited tumor growth at low noncytotoxic concentrations via its immunoregulatory activity. Intratumoral injection of P4N improved the quantity and quality of EAAs, and passive transfer of P4N-induced EAAs dramatically suppressed lung metastasis formation and prolonged the survival of mice inoculated with metastatic CT26 tumor cells. P4N-induced EAAs specifically recognized two surface antigens, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and F1F0 ATP synthase, on the plasma membrane of cancer cells. Additionally, P4N treatment led to B-cell proliferation, differentiation to plasma cells, and high titers of autoantibody production. By serial induction of autocrine and paracrine signals in monocytes, P4N increased B-cell proliferation and antibody production via the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H)/activin A/B-cell activating factor (BAFF) pathway. This mechanism provides a useful platform for studying and seeking a novel immunomodulator that can be applied in targeting therapy by improving the quantity and quality of the EAAs. ? 2016, National Academy of Sciences.

In this study, an integrated microfluidic system was proposed to perform on-chip phage display for selection of specific peptides that could identify CCA cell lines.

This study presents a dual-aptamer assay for detection of CRP by using field-effect transistors (FET).

Furthermore, a microfluidic system was used to automate the dual-aptamer sandwich assay such that the entire diagnosis process could be automated. In addition to electric signals from the FET device, fluorescent signals were also used to confirm this assay. Experimental results revealed that the first aptamer (1st aptamer) and the second aptamer (c aptamer) could be specifically binded with target CRP. Furthermore, the microfluidic chip integrated with FET can be re-used if the binded CRP and 2nd aptamer was eluted. Besides, in order to prevent the interference materials like proteins, cells and any nonspecific molecules from adhering onto the gate region of the FET device even after immobilization of 1st aptamer, we used ethanolamine as the blocking agent to prevent nonspecific adhesion. The experimental results confirmed that blocking using ethanolamine could successfully prevent nonspecific binding. ? 2016 IEEE.",AlGaN HEMT-based FET; C-reactive protein; dual-aptamer; ethanolamine; microfluidic; sandwich assay,Bins; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Ethanolamines; Fluidic devices; High electron mobility transistors; Microfluidics; Proteins; AlGaN; Aptamers; C-reactive proteins; ethanolamine; Sandwich assays; Field effect transistors,2-s2.0-85007164352

Dusp6-deficient mice have been shown to be resistant to diet-induced obesity, but the mechanism behind this remains unclear. 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis demonstrated that dusp6-deficient mice harbour unique gut microbiota with resistance to diet-induced-obesity-mediated alteration of the gut microbiome. Using a germ-free mouse model, we found that faecal/gut microbiota derived from dusp6-deficient mice significantly increased energy expenditure and reduced weight gain in recipient wild-type mice fed on a high-fat diet. On analysis of the intestinal transcriptome of dusp6-deficient mice, we found that dusp6 deficiency mainly induced biological processes involved in metabolism and the extracellular matrix, particularly the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparγ) pathway and tight-junction genes. Furthermore, dusp6-deficient mice have a high-fat-diet-specific transcriptomic response to reverse the expression of genes associated with intestinal barrier functions and mucosal immunity involved in microbiome homeostasis.

However, CXCL4L1 is also expressed in patient tumors, tumor cell lines, and murine xenografts, prompting a more detailed analysis of its role in cancer pathogenesis. We used genetic and antibody-based approaches to attenuate CXCL4L1 in models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Mechanisms of expression were assessed in cell coculture experiments, murine, and avian xenotransplants, including through an evaluation of CpG methylation and mutation of critical CpG residues. CXCL4L1 gene expression was increased greatly in primary and metastatic PDAC. We found that myofibroblasts triggered cues in the tumor microenvironment, which led to induction of CXCL4L1 in tumor cells. CXCL4L1 expression was also controlled by epigenetic modifications at critical CpG islands, which were mapped. CXCL4L1 inhibited angiogenesis but also affected tumor development more directly, depending on the tumor cell type. In vivo administration of an mAb against CXCL4L1 demonstrated a blockade in the growth of tumors positive for CXCR3, a critical receptor for CXCL4 ligands. Our findings define a protumorigenic role in PDAC development for endogenous CXCL4L1, which is independent of its antiangiogenic function. ?2016 AACR.",,"chemokine; chemokine receptor CXCR3; CXCL4 chemokine; CXCL4L1 chemokine; unclassified drug; angiogenesis inhibitor; chemokine; chemokine receptor CXCR3; CXCR3 protein, human; thrombocyte factor 4; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell culture; cell proliferation; controlled study; CpG island; CXCL4L1 gene; DNA methylation; DNA modification; gene; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; in vivo study; male; mouse; myofibroblast; nonhuman; pancreas adenocarcinoma; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein induction; protein localization; tumor cell; tumor growth; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment; animal; drug screening; genetics; mortality; neovascularization (pathology); pancreas tumor; pathology; survival analysis; tumor cell line; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Chemokines; Humans; Mice; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Platelet Factor 4; Receptors, CXCR3; Survival Analysis; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84995445035

Conventionally, a multifunctional nanoparticle can be constructed by integrating organic dyes/magnetic nanoparticles to impart diagnostic functions and anticancer drugs/photosensitizers to achieve therapeutic outcomes. These multicomponents systems usually suffer from severe photobleaching problems and cannot be activated by near-infrared (NIR) light. Here, it is demonstrated that all-in-one lanthanide-doped mesoporous silica frameworks (EuGdOx@MSF) loaded with an anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX) can facilitate simultaneous bimodal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with approximately twofold higher T1-MR contrast as compared to the commercial Gd(III)-DTPA complex and fluorescence imaging with excellent photostability. Upon a very low dose (130 mW cm?2) of NIR light (980 nm) irradiation, the EuGdOx@MSF not only can sensitize formation of singlet oxygen (1O2) by itself but also can phototrigger the release of the DOX payload effectively to exert combined chemo-photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) effects and destroy solid tumors in mice completely. It is also discovered for the first time that the EuGdOx@MSF-mediated PDT effect can suppress the level of the key drug resistant protein, i.e., p-glycoprotein (p-gp) and help alleviate the drug resistant problem commonly associated with many cancers. ? 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Our nanoparticles were ultra-small with superparamagnetic iron oxide cores, conjugated to erlotinib (FeDC-E NPs). Such smart targeted nanoparticles have the preference to release the drug intracellularly rather than into the bloodstream, and specifically recognize and kill cancer cells that overexpress EGFR while being non-toxic to EGFR-negative cells. MRI, transmission electron microscopy and Prussian blue staining results indicated that cellular uptake and intracellular accumulation of FeDC-E NPs in the EGFR overexpressing cells was significantly higher than those of the non-erlotinib-conjugated nanoparticles. FeDC-E NPs inhibited the EGFR-ERK-NF-I B signaling pathways, and subsequently suppressed the migration and invasion capabilities of the highly invasive and migrative CL1-5-F4 cancer cells. In vivo tumor xenograft experiments using BALB/c nude mice showed that FeDC-E NPs could effectively inhibit the growth of tumors. T 2 -weighted MRI images of the mice showed significant decrease in the normalized signal within the tumor post-treatment with FeDC-E NPs compared to the non-targeted control iron oxide nanoparticles.

Four check dams were removed in Kaoshan Stream between 1999 and 2001 to help restore the natural habitat, and we construct an age-structured stochastic simulation model to quantify the effect of this dam removal on salmon abundance. Typhoons are an important factor in the population dynamics, and the presence of dams may augment the mortality associated with typhoons. We define an annual typhoon score that measures the impact of typhoons on salmon survival. We found that habitat restoration resulting from dam removal is a more significant factor than the creation of upstream passage in increasing survival and that juveniles receive the largest benefit. The model predicts that the salmon in Kaoshan Stream would have disappeared by 2007 if the dams had not been removed, indicating that dam removal was effective in increasing abundance. To project the model forward 20 years, we use historical data to forecast future typhoon scores. The model projects that after dam removal, the salmon population will stabilize just below 400 by 2018, which indicates growth from the most recent observed value of 262 in 2014. We then modify the forecasted typhoon scores to include anticipated increases in typhoon intensity associated with climate change. All of these scenarios result in a downward rather than stable trend in abundance, with larger increases in the typhoon score associated with faster rates of decline in the population. However, the population remains above 100 over the next 20 years even in scenarios with high typhoon scores. The model suggests that dam removal reversed the salmon population decline, but the anticipated increase in rain intensity associated with climate change poses a future threat to the salmon. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Age-structured stochastic simulation model; Demography; Fish population; Typhoon score,Climate change; Climate models; Dams; Ecosystems; Fisheries; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Restoration; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Agricultural practices; Critically endangered; Demography; Fish populations; Formosan landlocked salmon; Habitat restoration; Stochastic simulation model; Typhoon intensities; Hurricanes; abundance; age structure; agricultural practice; climate change; dam construction; dam removal; habitat restoration; mortality; population decline; salmonid; survival; typhoon; Taiwan; Oncorhynchus masou,2-s2.0-84983356250

Methods: Corn silk fractions were prepared by partition and chemically characterised by thin-layer chromatography. Free radical scavenging assay, glycation assay, and cell-based viability test (neutral red) were employed to decide the best fraction. Cell death analysis was executed by annexin V/ Propidium iodide staining. Cell proliferation was measured by WST-1. Finally, β-cell function was evaluated by β-cell marker gene expression (RT-PCR) and acute insulin secretion test. Results: Four corn silk fractions were prepared from an ethanolic crude extract of corn silk. In vitro assays indicate ethyl acetate fraction (YMS-EA) was the most potent fraction. YMS-EA also attenuated the hydrogen peroxide- or methylglyoxal-induced induction of reactive oxygen species, reduction of cell viability, and inhibition of cell proliferation. However, YMS-EA was unable to prevent hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis or advanced glycation end-products-induced toxicity. Under hyperglycemic conditions, YMS-EA effectively reduced ROS levels, improved mRNA expression of insulin, glucokinase, and PDX-1, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The similarity of bioactivities among apigenin, luteolin, and YMS-EA indicated that dual activities of YMS-EA might be derived from those compounds. Conclusions: We concluded that YMS-EA fraction could be developed as a preventive food agent against the glucotoxicity to β-cells in Type 2 diabetes. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Advanced glycation end products; Glucotoxicity; Methylglyoxal; Reactive oxygen species; Stigmata Maydis (corn silk); β-cell failure,"acetic acid ethyl ester; advanced glycation end product; aminoguanidine; antidiabetic agent; antioxidant; apigenin; corn silk fraction; glucokinase; herbaceous agent; hydrogen peroxide; insulin; luteolin; messenger RNA; metformin; methylglyoxal; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor PDX 1; trolox C; unclassified drug; acetic acid derivative; advanced glycation end product; antioxidant; hydrogen peroxide; plant extract; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal cell; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; glucotoxicity; hyperglycemia; in vitro study; maize; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pancreas islet beta cell; protein glycosylation; rat; animal; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effects; female; male; metabolism; mouse; Acetates; Animals; Antioxidants; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Female; Glycosylation End Products, Advanced; Hydrogen Peroxide; Male; Mice; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Rats; Reactive Oxygen Species; Zea mays",2-s2.0-85009252997

Hence, evaluating covariate effects on the rates of occurrence of such events is commonly of interest. Examples include repeated hospitalizations, recurrent infections of HIV, and tumor recurrences. In this article, we consider semiparametric regression methods for the occurrence rate function of recurrent events when the covariates may be measured with errors. In contrast to the existing works, in our case the conventional assumption of independent censoring is violated since the recurrent event process is interrupted by some correlated events, which is called informative drop-out. Further, some covariates may be measured with errors. To accommodate for both informative censoring and measurement error, the occurrence of recurrent events is modelled through an unspecified frailty distribution and accompanied with a classical measurement error model. We propose two corrected approaches based on different ideas, and we show that they are numerically identical when estimating the regression parameters. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established, and the finite sample performance is examined via simulations. The proposed methods are applied to the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer trial for assessing the effect of the plasma selenium treatment on the recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. ? 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.",informative censoring; measurement error; recurrent event data; surrogate covariate,"selenium; Article; cancer recurrence; data analysis; human; information processing; informative censoring; measurement error; regression analysis; reliability; selenium blood level; semiparametric regression; simulation; squamous cell carcinoma; follow up; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; recurrent disease; regression analysis; statistical model; tumor recurrence; Follow-Up Studies; HIV Infections; Humans; Models, Statistical; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Recurrence; Regression Analysis",2-s2.0-85006129542

The materials described here can be used to build bases to discover novel cancer therapy targets in connection with computer-aided drug design (CADD). A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of cancer will provide more choices and correct strategies in the development of multiple target drug therapies, which is quite different from the traditional cancer single target therapy. Targeted therapy is one of the most powerful strategies against cancer and can also be applied to other diseases. Due to the large amount of progress in computer hardware and the theories of computational chemistry and physics, CADD has been the main strategy for developing novel drugs for cancer therapy. In contrast to traditional single target therapies, in this review we will emphasize the future direction of the field, i.e., multiple target therapies. Structure-based and ligand-based drug designs are the two main topics of CADD. The former needs both 3D protein structures and ligand structures, while the latter only needs ligand structures. Ordinarily it is estimated to take more than 14 years and 800 million dollars to develop a new drug. Many new CADD software programs and techniques have been developed in recent decades. We conclude with an example where we combined and applied systems biology and CADD to the core networks of four cancers and successfully developed a novel cocktail for drug therapy that treats multiple targets. ? 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",Carcinogenesis; Carcinogenesis relevance value; Computer-aided drug design; Multiple target cocktail; Network markers; Protein-protein interactions,microRNA; tumor marker; protein; protein binding; apoptosis; Bayes theorem; cancer therapy; computer aided design; drug design; epigenetics; gene expression profiling; genetic database; genetic disorder; human; mathematical model; microarray analysis; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecularly targeted therapy; next generation sequencing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; protein protein interaction; reverse engineering; Review; structural proteomics; support vector machine; systems biology; tumor suppressor gene; X ray crystallography; computer aided design; drug design; metabolism; Neoplasms; systems biology; Computer-Aided Design; Drug Design; Humans; Neoplasms; Protein Binding; Proteins; Systems Biology,2-s2.0-84995938496

The incidence of fatal liver cancer is also increasing in the United States. The aim of this study was to establish a spherical tumor model and determine its accuracy in predicting the absorbed dose in yttrium-90 (Y-90) microsphere therapy for liver cancer.Methods: Liver morphology can be approximated by a spherical model comprising three concentric regions representing necrotic, tumor, and normal liver tissues. The volumes of these three regions represent those in the actual liver. A spherical tumor model was proposed to calculate the absorbed fractions in the spherical tumor, necrotic, and normal tissue regions. The THORplan treatment planning system and Monte Carlo N-particle extended codes were used for this spherical tumor model. Using the volume-equivalent method, a spherical tumor model was created to calculate the total absorbed fraction [under different tumor-to-healthy-liver ratios (TLRs)]. The patient-specific model (THORplan) results were used to verify the spherical tumor model results. Results: The results for both the Y-90 spectrum and the Y-90 mean energy indicated that the absorbed fraction was a function of the tumor radius and mass. The absorbed fraction increased with tumor radius. The total absorbed fractions calculated using the spherical tumor model for necrotic, liver tumor, and normal liver tissues were in good agreement with the THORplan results, with differences of less than 3% for TLRs of 2-5. The results for the effect of TLR indicate that for the same tumor configuration, the total absorbed fraction decreased with increasing TLR; for the same shell tumor thickness and TLR, the total absorbed fraction was approximately constant; and for tumors with the same radius, the total fraction absorbed by the tumor increased with the shell thickness. Conclusions: The results from spherical tumor models with different tumor-to-healthy-liver ratios were highly consistent with the reference results (THORplan). These findings indicate that a spherical tumor model can provide good estimates of Y-90 doses in microsphere therapy and can be considered a first approximation for dose estimation in Y-90 microsphere therapy. ? 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",patient-specific model; spherical tumor model; tumor-to-healthy-liver ratio; Y-90 microsphere,"microsphere y 90; radioactive microsphere; unclassified drug; microsphere; yttrium; Article; cancer incidence; diagnostic accuracy; fraction absorbed; liver cell carcinoma; liver metastasis; liver necrosis; liver tumor; Monte Carlo method; prediction; treatment planning; tumor model; tumor necrosis; tumor volume; biological model; chemistry; drug effects; electron; human; Liver Neoplasms; necrosis; pathology; radiation absorption; radiation response; therapeutic use; Absorption, Radiation; Beta Particles; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Microspheres; Necrosis; Patient-Specific Modeling; Tumor Burden; Yttrium Radioisotopes",2-s2.0-84994037358

Despite substantial evidence supporting the role of diacylglycerols (DAG) in modulating chronic inflammation and chronic diseases, the potential mechanisms of its involvement in TLRs-mediated inflammation are still unclear. Here, we show that sn-1,2-diacylglycerols modulate LPS/TLR4-mediated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. ELISA and western blotting experiments indicated that sn-1,2-diacylglycerols suppress LPS-induced responses, including IL-6 and TNF-α production, and COX-2 expression in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages and human endothelial cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Using LPS-induced murine model of systemic inflammation, we show that sn-1,2-diacylglycerols block the cytokine storm, the expression of inflammatory mediators, and LPS-induced septic lung damage and mortality. sn-1,2-diacylglycerols reduce systemic inflammation by inhibiting LPS-induced p38 MAPK- and PI3K/AKT-mediated NF-κB activation in macrophages. These results suggest that exogenous DAG probably acts by blocking p38 MAPK or PI3K/AKT signal transduction, thereby down-regulating NF-κB activation and NF-κB-mediated transcription of genes encoding cytokines and pro-inflammatory oxidative enzymes. Our findings demonstrate that exogenous sn-1,2-diacylglycerol protects mice from LPS-induced lethal endotoxemia by suppressing TLR4-driven inflammatory responses, suggesting that 1,2-diacylglycerols may be used as dietary health supplements for the prevention or therapy of systemic inflammatory diseases. ? 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Diacylglycerol; Systemic inflammation; TLR4,"cyclooxygenase 2; cytokine; diacylglycerol; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor; 1,2-diacylglycerol; antiinflammatory agent; biological marker; cyclooxygenase 2; cytokine; diacylglycerol; lipopolysaccharide; protective agent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cytokine production; down regulation; endothelium cell; endotoxemia; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; genetic code; human; human cell; immunomodulation; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; lethality; lung injury; macrophage activation; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; peritoneum macrophage; priority journal; protein expression; protein synthesis inhibition; RAW 264.7 cell line; signal transduction; transcription regulation; Western blotting; animal; cell line; disease model; drug effects; endotoxemia; immunology; macrophage; metabolism; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Biomarkers; Cell Line; Cyclooxygenase 2; Cytokines; Diglycerides; Disease Models, Animal; Endothelial Cells; Endotoxemia; Humans; Lipopolysaccharides; Macrophages; Mice; Protective Agents; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-84992451562

However, little is known about the effects of ANGPTL1 on sorafenib resistance and cancer stem cell properties in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the mechanism underlying these effects. Here, we show that ANGPTL1 expression positively correlates with sorafenib sensitivity in HCC cells and human HCC tissues. ANGPTL1 significantly decreases epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-driven sorafenib resistance, cancer stemness, and tumor growth of HCC cells by repressing Slug expression. ANGPTL1 directly interacts with and inactivates MET receptor, which contributes to Slug suppression through inhibition of the extracellular receptor kinase/protein kinase B (ERK/AKT)-dependent early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) pathway. ANGPTL1 expression inversely correlates with Slug expression, poor sorafenib responsiveness, and poor clinical outcomes in HCC patients. Conclusion: ANGPTL1 inhibits sorafenib resistance and cancer stemness in HCC cells by repressing EMT through inhibition of the MET receptor?AKT/ERK?Egr-1?Slug signaling cascade. ANGPTL1 may serve as a novel MET receptor inhibitor for advanced HCC therapy.

Hence, studies concentrated on the design and fabrication of hazard-free lighting sources has been significantly increasing. However, issues on light quality and energy-saving are of great importance. Here, we present an original approach to enable the generation of human-eye-friendly and melatonin suppression-less healthy light with high light-quality and energy-saving characters. Taking a three-band organic light-emitting diode (OLED) for example, the suppression threat can be reduced by 83% as the color temperature of the resulting light is decreased from 6000 to 2000?K, while slightly sacrificing its theoretical efficacy limit from 260 to 245?lm/W and spectrum resemblance index (SRI) from 90 to 83. Notably, a comparatively more healthy light can be obtained by incorporating lesser deep-blue and -red emissions even at the same color temperature. The same approach can also apply to other lighting technologies such as light-emitting diode. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Energy-saving; Healthy light; High visual-quality; Lighting design; OLED,Fabrication; Hazards; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Supercomputers; Color temperatures; High lights; Light quality; Lighting designs; Lighting technology; OLED; Red emissions; Visual qualities; Energy conservation,2-s2.0-84988493714

Objectives To investigeate the association between 5-MTP and post-MI left ventricular remodeling. Methods This prospective study enrolled 26 non-diabetic patients with first-time ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and 58 controls. Levels of 5-MTP, N-terminal of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 were measured at day 1, day 3, 3?months, 6?months, and 1?year post-MI. Echocardiography was performed during the acute stage (within 72?h) and 3?months, 6?months, and 1?year post-MI. Results The STEMI patients had a significantly lower plasma 5-MTP level at day 1 which reached a nadir at 3?months post-MI. The level of 5-MTP at day 3 post-MI was significantly correlated with the level of NT-proBNP 1?year post-MI, suggesting that the level of plasma 5-MTP in the early phase after MI may predict subsequent cardiac stress and failure. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that plasma 5-MTP had the best area under the curve value to predict plasma NT-proBNP 1?year post-MI. Further analysis using net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement models confirmed that plasma 5-MTP at day 3 post-MI significantly improved the predictive power of each of the parameters. Conclusion In non-diabetic STEMI patients, plasma 5-MTP levels were associated with biomarkers of post-MI left ventricular remodeling and damage. ? 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",5-methoxytryptophan; Cyclooxygenase-2; Myocardial infarction,amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; biological marker; gelatinase B; procollagen type 3 aminopropeptide; protein 5 MTP; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tryptophan derivative; unclassified drug; 5-methoxytryptophan; biological marker; tryptophan; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; echocardiography; female; heart failure; heart stress; heart ventricle remodeling; human; male; middle aged; priority journal; prospective study; protein blood level; receiver operating characteristic; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; analogs and derivatives; blood; complication; follow up; heart ventricle remodeling; pathophysiology; prognosis; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; time factor; Aged; Biomarkers; Echocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; ROC Curve; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction; Time Factors; Tryptophan; Ventricular Remodeling,2-s2.0-84981349676

However, this connection is especially salient in gelotophobia (the fear of being laughed at), which is regarded as the presentation of humorlessness, and two related traits, gelotophilia (the enjoyment of being laughed at) and katagelasticism (the enjoyment of laughing at others). Here, we explored whether the topological properties of white matter networks can account for the individual differences in the laughter-related traits of 31 healthy adults. We observed a significant negative correlation between gelotophobia scores and the clustering coefficient, local efficiency and global efficiency, but a positive association between gelotophobia scores and path length in the brain's white matter network. Moreover, the current study revealed that with increasing individual fear of being laughed at, the linking efficiencies in superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus decreased. However, there were no significant correlations between either gelotophilia or katagelasticism scores or the topological properties of the brain white matter network. These findings suggest that the fear of being laughed at is directly related to the level of local and global information processing of the brain network, which might provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of the humor information processing. ? 2016 Wu, Zhong, Chan, Chen, Gong, He and Li.",Brain network; Connectome; Diffusion tensor imaging; Gelotophobia; Graph theory,,2-s2.0-84996554638

To achieve this goal, however, these carriers, which are usually piled up at the periphery of tumors near the blood vessel, must simultaneously overcome the challenges associated with low tumor penetration and the transport of sufficient cargos to deep tumors to eradicate whole cancer cells. Here, we report a sponge-like carbon material on graphene nanosheet (graphene nanosponge)-supported lipid bilayers (lipo-GNS) that doubles as a photothermal agent and a high cargo payload platform and releases a burst of drug/energy (docetaxel (DTX) and gasified perfluorohexane (PFH)) and intense heat upon near-infrared irradiation. Ultrasmall lipo-GNS (40 nm) modified with a tumor-targeting protein that penetrates tumor spheroids through transcytosis exhibited a 200-fold increase in accumulation relative to a 270 nm variant of the lipo-GNS. Furthermore, a combination of therapeutic agents (DTX and PFH) delivered by lipo-GNS into tumors was gasified and released into tumor spheroids and successfully ruptured and suppressed xenograft tumors in 16 days without distal harm when subjected to a single 10 min near-infrared laser treatment. Moreover, no tumor recurrence was observed over 60 days post-treatment. This sophisticated lipo-GNS is an excellent delivery platform for penetrated, photoresponsive, and combined gasification/chemo-thermotherapy to facilitate tumor treatment and for use in other biological applications. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",3D tumor model; drug delivery; graphene oxide; mesoporous structure; photoresponsive,Blood vessels; Carbon; Cells; Diseases; Drug delivery; Graphene; Infrared devices; Infrared lasers; Lipid bilayers; 3D tumor models; Biological applications; Graphene oxides; Mesoporous structures; Near-infrared lasers; Personalized medicines; Photo-responsive; Supported lipid bilayers; Tumors,2-s2.0-84994013343

Therefore, the guards of the immune system in the lungs, such as macrophages (Mφs) and dendritic cells (DCs), are the most important defense against Mtb infection. There have been several studies discussing the functions of Mφs and DCs during Mtb infection, but the genome-wide pathways and networks are still incomplete. Furthermore, the immune response induced by Mφs and DCs varies.

We applied a system identification method and a system order detection scheme to dynamic models to identify the real cross-talk GWGEINs using the microarray data of Mφs, DCs and Mtb.

Furthermore, the membrane essential proteins v1098c, and Rv1696 (or cytoplasm for Rv0667), in Mtb could also be potential drug targets because of their important roles in Mtb survival in both cell types.

This study applied an integrated analysis based on texture, backscattering, and attenuation features in ultrasound imaging with the aim of assessing the severity of NAFLD. Ultrasound radiofrequency data obtained from 394 clinical cases were analyzed to extract three texture features (autocorrelation, sum average, and sum variance), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the slope of the center-frequency downshift (CFDS slope). The texture, SNR, and CFDS slope were combined to produce a quantitative diagnostic index (QDI) that ranged from 0 to 6. We trained the QDI using training data and then applied it to test data to assess its utility. In training data, the areas (AUCs) under the receiver operating characteristic curves for NAFLD and severe NAFLD were 0.81 and 0.84, respectively. In test data, the AUCs were 0.73 and 0.81 for NAFLD and severe NAFLD, respectively. The QDI was able to distinguish severe NAFLD and a normal liver from mild NAFLD, and it was significantly correlated with metabolic factors.

A total of 25 eyes with wet AMD, one with myopic neovascularization, and one with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy were enrolled in this study. The limit of detection using P-ELISA was 0.03 pg/mL. Forty-six consecutive samples of aqueous humor were acquired.

Only 13.33% of samples (2/15) achieved complete VEGF suppression 5 weeks after receiving treatment. In some patients, elevated VEGF was still detected 5 weeks after receipt of anti-VEGF antibody, and all samples (10/10) were found to have elevated VEGF levels 49 days after treatment.

This mutator effect relates to a wide range of biomedical problems. There are three possible phases: mutator phase, mixed phase and non-selective phase. We calculate the phase structure, the mean fitness and the fraction of the mutator allele in the population, which can be applied to describe cancer development and RNA viruses. We find that depending on the genome length, either the normal or the mutator allele dominates in the mixed phase. We analytically solve the model for a general fitness function. We conclude that the random fitness landscape is an appropriate choice for describing the observed mutator phenomenon in the case of a small fraction of mutators. It is shown that the increase in the mutation rates in the regular and the mutator parts of the genome should be set independently; only some combinations of these increases can push the complex biomedical system to the non-selective phase, potentially related to the eradication of tumors. ?

Although the molecular pathogenesis of CALR mutations leading to MPNs has been studied using in vitro cell lines models, how mutant CALR may affect developmental hematopoiesis remains unknown. Here we took advantage of the zebrafish model to examine the effects of mutant CALR on early hematopoiesis and model human CALR-mutated MPNs. We identified three zebrafish genes orthologous to human CALR, referred to as calr, calr3a and calr3b. The expression of CALR-del52 and CALR-ins5 mutants caused an increase in the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells followed by thrombocytosis without affecting normal angiogenesis. The expression of CALR mutants also perturbed early developmental hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Importantly, morpholino knockdown of mpl but not epor or csf3r could significantly attenuate the effects of mutant CALR. Furthermore, the expression of mutant CALR caused jak-stat signaling activation in zebrafish that could be blocked by JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib and fedratinib). These findings showed that mutant CALR activates jak-stat signaling through an mpl-dependent mechanism to mediate pathogenic thrombopoiesis in zebrafish, and illustrated that the signaling machinery related to mutant CALR tumorigenesis are conserved between human and zebrafish. ? 2016 The Author(s).",,"calcium binding protein; calreticulin; calreticulin 3a; calreticulin 3b; colony stimulating factor 3 receptor; colony stimulating factor receptor; erythropoietin receptor; fedratinib; Janus kinase; ruxolitinib; STAT protein; thrombopoietin receptor; unclassified drug; calreticulin; fedratinib; JAK2 protein, human; Janus kinase 2; MPL protein, human; pyrazole derivative; pyrrolidine derivative; ruxolitinib; sulfonamide; thrombopoietin receptor; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; attenuation; controlled study; drug effect; embryo; gene expression; gene mutation; hematopoiesis; hematopoietic stem cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mutant; nonhuman; signal transduction; thrombocytopoiesis; thrombocytosis; wild type; zebra fish; animal; carcinogenesis; disease model; drug effects; gene expression regulation; genetics; hematopoiesis; human; metabolism; mutation; myeloid metaplasia; myeloproliferative disorder; pathology; thrombocythemia; thrombocytosis; Animals; Calreticulin; Carcinogenesis; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Janus Kinase 2; Mutation; Myeloproliferative Disorders; Primary Myelofibrosis; Pyrazoles; Pyrrolidines; Receptors, Thrombopoietin; Signal Transduction; Sulfonamides; Thrombocythemia, Essential; Thrombocytosis; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-84990849842

Exposures to BPA have been associated with reproductive, developmental, and cardiovascular effects. In this study, the CalTOX model was used to assess the aggregate health risks on BPA by integrating the currently available BPA data in various environmental media in Taiwan. Local parameters such as chemical properties, local landscape data, and exposure factors were used as model inputs under the continuous source mode. A reference dose (RfD) of 50 μg/kg-day was adopted in this assessment. Monte Carlo simulation was used to simulate great variability of the environmental data. Our results show that an upper limit of 95?% confidence interval of aggregate exposures for the adults (19–64?years old) was 1.05?μg/kg-day, corresponding to a hazard index (HI) of 0.021. The chemical properties (BPA half-life in surface water), intake rates (fruit, vegetable, and fluid intake), and landscape data (average depth of surface waters and leaf wet density) are critical parameters. Finally, HI value would approach to 1 as BPA concentrations in ambient air, surface water, and sediment was greater than 20?ng/m3, 100?μg/L, and 3.3?mg/kg. The quality of the risk assessment on BPA can be further improved by reduction of uncertainty of the abovementioned critical parameters as well as considering additional BPA exposures from canned and packaged goods. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Aggregate health risk; Bisphenol A; Monte-Carlo simulation; Multimedia model; Probabilistic assessment,Aggregates; Chemical properties; Data integration; Epoxy resins; Health risks; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Phenols; Surface waters; Aggregate exposure; Bis-phenol a; Confidence interval; Endocrine disruptor; Environmental data; Environmental media; Multimedia modeling; Probabilistic assessments; Risk assessment; cardiovascular disease; endocrine disruptor; health risk; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; pollution exposure; probability; risk assessment; Taiwan,2-s2.0-84988354825

Thus, the use of big databases and genome-wide high-throughput data to unravel the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying cell cycle progression in stem cells and cancer cells is a matter of considerable interest. Real genetic-and-epigenetic cell cycle networks (GECNs) of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and HeLa cancer cells were constructed by applying system modeling, system identification, and big database mining to genome-wide next-generation sequencing data. Real GECNs were then reduced to core GECNs of HeLa cells and ESCs by applying principal genome-wide network projection. In this study, we investigated potential carcinogenic and stemness mechanisms for systems cancer drug design by identifying common core and specific GECNs between HeLa cells and ESCs. Integrating drug database information with the specific GECNs of HeLa cells could lead to identification of multiple drugs for cervical cancer treatment with minimal side-effects on the genes in the common core. We found that dysregulation of miR-29C, miR-34A, miR-98, and miR-215; and methylation of ANKRD1, ARID5B, CDCA2, PIF1, STAMBPL1, TROAP, ZNF165, and HIST1H2AJ in HeLa cells could result in cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis through NFκB, TGF-β, and PI3K pathways. We also identified 3 drugs, methotrexate, quercetin, and mimosine, which repressed the activated cell cycle genes, ARID5B, STK17B, and CCL2, in HeLa cells with minimal side-effects. ? 2016 The Author(s).

One solution to this crisis is early diagnosis of infectious disease, which represents a powerful way to optimize treatment, increase patient survival rate, and decrease healthcare costs. However, conventional early diagnosis methods take a long time to generate results, lack accuracy, and are known to seriously underperform with regard to fungal and viral infections. Synthetic biology offers a fast and highly accurate alternative to conventional infectious disease diagnosis.

Previous attempts used contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to correlate the mechanical index (MI) with the scale of BBB-opening, but MI only partially gauged acoustic activities, and CE-MRI did not fully explore correlations of pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic behaviors. Recently, the cavitation index (CI) has been derived to serve as an indicator of microbubble-ultrasound stable cavitation, and may also serve as a valid indicator to gauge the level of FUS-induced BBB opening. This study investigates the feasibility of gauging FUS-induced BBB opened level via the two indexes, MI and CI, through dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI analysis as well as passive cavitation detection (PCD) analysis. Pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic parameters derived from DCE-MRI were characterized to identify the scale of FUS-induced BBB opening. Our results demonstrated that DCE-MRI can successfully access pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic BBB-opened behavior, and was highly correlated both with MI and CI, implying the feasibility in using these two indices to gauge the scale of FUS-induced BBB opening.

Here, we describe KDM4A as a E2F1 coactivator and demonstrate a functional role for the E2F1-KDM4A complex in the control of tumor metabolism. KDM4A associates with E2F1 on target gene promoters and enhances E2F1 chromatin binding and transcriptional activity, thereby modulating the transcriptional profile essential for cancer cell proliferation and survival. The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) PDK1 and PDK3 are direct targets of KDM4A and E2F1 and modulate the switch between glycolytic metabolism and mitochondrial oxidation. Downregulation of KDM4A leads to elevated activity?of pyruvate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial oxidation, resulting in excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The altered metabolic phenotypes can be partially rescued by ectopic expression of PDK1 and PDK3, indicating a KDM4A-dependent tumor metabolic regulation via PDK.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key virulence factor and plays important roles in pathogenesis of H. pylori infection. Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate isomerase (GmhA), as an enzyme participating in the first step of heptose biosynthesis, is indispensable for the formation of inner core oligosaccharide of LPS. In this study, we cloned one putative gmhA ortholog, hp0857, from H. pylori 26695 and overexpressed it in Eschericha coli. Based on the results of molecular weight determination, the recombinant HP0857 is likely a homodimer. Analysis of enzymatic kinetic properties of this protein confirmed that hp0857 is indeed encoded a phosphoheptose isomerase which can utilize sedoheptulose 7-phosphate as the substrate in the ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (ADP- L,D-Hep) biosynthesis pathway. We also generated an HP0857 knockout mutant and explored its phenotypic changes. This mutant exhibited a decreased growth rate and displayed a “deep rough” type of LPS structure. In addition, it also had a slight decrease in its motility and was more susceptible to hydrophobic antibiotic novobiocin and detergents Triton X-100 and SDS. Furthermore, the adhesive capacity of the HP0857 knockout mutant to AGS cells was reduced significantly, and most of the infected cells didn't show a classic hummingbird phenotype. However, complementation of the HP0857 knockout mutation restored most of these phenotypic changes. In conclusion, we demonstrated that HP0857 protein is essential for inner core biosynthesis of H. pylori LPS and is a potential target for developing new antimicrobial agents against H. pylori infection. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Adhesion; Helicobacter pylori; Lipopolysaccharide; Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate isomerase,"bacterial enzyme; bacterium lipopolysaccharide; detergent; homodimer; isomerase; novobiocin; sedoheptulose 7 phosphate isomerase; triton x 100; unclassified drug; Escherichia coli protein; GmhA protein, E coli; isomerase; lipopolysaccharide; lipopolysaccharide, Helicobacter pylori; phosphoheptose isomerase; sedoheptulose 7-phosphate; sugar phosphate; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterium adherence; biosynthesis; carbohydrate synthesis; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; enzyme substrate; Escherichia coli; gene mutation; gene overexpression; Helicobacter pylori; human; human cell; molecular cloning; molecular weight; nonhuman; priority journal; cell adhesion; classification; Helicobacter pylori; metabolism; physiology; species difference; Aldose-Ketose Isomerases; Cell Adhesion; Escherichia coli Proteins; Helicobacter pylori; Lipopolysaccharides; Racemases and Epimerases; Species Specificity; Sugar Phosphates",2-s2.0-84977100985

RAGE induces cellular signaling pathways upon binding with various ligands, such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), β-Amyloids, and S100 proteins. The solution structure of S100A12 and the V ligand-binding region of RAGE have been reported previously. Using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy to conduct 1H-15 heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) titration experiments, we identified and mapped the binding interface between S100A12 and the V domain of RAGE. The NMR chemical shift data were used as the constraints for the High Ambiguity Driven biomolecular DOCKing (HADDOCK) calculation to generate a structural model of the S100A12-V domain complex. In addition, tranilast (an anti-Allergic drug) showed strong interaction with S100A12 in the 1H-15N HSQC titration, fluorescence experiments, and WST-1 assay. The results also indicated that tranilast was located at the binding site between S100A12 and the V domain, blocking interaction between these two proteins.

Incorporating the PPI information to define gene pairs for interaction tests within pathways can increase the power for pathway-based association tests. We propose a pathway association test, which aggregates the interaction signals in PPI networks within a pathway, for GWAS with case-control samples. Gene size is properly considered in the test so that genes do not contribute more to the test statistic simply due to their size. Simulation studies were performed to verify that the method is a valid test and can have more power than other pathway association tests in the presence of gene-gene interactions within a pathway under different scenarios. We applied the test to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium GWAS datasets for seven common diseases. The most significant pathway is the chaperones modulate interferon signaling pathway for Crohn's disease (p-value = 0.0003). The pathway modulates interferon gamma, which induces the JAK/STAT pathway that is involved in Crohn's disease. Several other pathways that have functional implications for the seven diseases were also identified. The proposed test based on gene-gene interaction signals in PPI networks can be used as a complementarytool to the current existing pathway analysis methods focusing on main effects of genes.

These water-in-oil-in-water DECs less than 200 nm in diameter are synthesized using a single component of PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) polymer and the magnetic nanoparticles, which are capable of encapsulating large quantities of targeted supermolecules composed of palitaxel-incorporated beta-cyclodextrin decorated by hyaluronic acid (HA, a CD44-targeting ligand) in the watery core. The release profiles (slow, sustained and burst release) of the targeted supermolecules can be directly controlled by regulating the high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF) and polymer conformation without sacrificing the targeting ability. Through an intravenous injection, the positive targeting of the supermolecules exhibited a 20-fold increase in tumor accumulation via the passive targeting and delivery of DECs followed by positive targeting of the supermolecules. Moreover, this dual-targeting drug-incorporated supermolecular delivery vehicle at the tumor site combined with magneto-thermal therapy suppressed the cancer growth more efficiently than treatment with either drug or supermolecule alone.

Despite substantial evidence supporting the pathogenic role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the progression of atherogenesis, its function in the regulation of VSMC migration remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism by which TLR4 regulates VSMC migration. Inhibitor experiments revealed that TLR4-induced IL-6 secretion and VSMC migration were mediated via the concerted actions of MyD88 and TRIF on the activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling. Neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibodies abrogated TLR4-driven VSMC migration and F-actin polymerization. Blockade of p38 MAPK or ERK1/2 signaling cascade inhibited TLR4 agonist-mediated activation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Moreover, siRNA-mediated suppression of CREB production repressed TLR4-induced IL-6 production and VSMC migration. Rac-1 inhibitor suppressed TLR4-driven VSMC migration but not IL-6 production. Importantly, the serum level of IL-6 and TLR4 endogenous ligand HMGB1 was significantly higher in patients with coronary artery diseases (CAD) than in healthy subjects. Serum HMGB1 level was positively correlated with serum IL-6 level in CAD patients. The expression of both HMGB1 and IL-6 was clearly detected in the atherosclerotic tissue of the CAD patients. Additionally, there was a positive association between p-CREB and HMGB1 in mouse atherosclerotic tissue. Based on our findings, we concluded that, upon ligand binding, TLR4 activates p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling through MyD88 and TRIF in VSMCs. These signaling pathways subsequently coordinate an additive augmentation of CREB-driven IL-6 production, which in turn triggers Rac-1-mediated actin cytoskeleton to promote VSMC migration. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",cAMP response element binding protein; Interleukin 6; Migration; Too-like receptor 4; Vascular smooth muscle cells,"cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; F actin; high mobility group B1 protein; interleukin 6; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 4; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 7; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; myeloid differentiation factor 88; Rac1 protein; synaptotagmin I; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor adaptor molecule 1; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 6; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; myeloid differentiation factor 88; TICAM-1 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor; vesicular transport adaptor protein; adult; aged; animal cell; Article; cell function; cell migration; cell viability; controlled study; coronary artery disease; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; major clinical study; male; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein secretion; signal transduction; vascular smooth muscle cell; Western blotting; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cell motion; cytology; metabolism; physiology; vascular smooth muscle; Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport; Animals; Cell Movement; Cells, Cultured; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-12; Interleukin-6; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Signal Transduction; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-84983416187

Our results indicate that immunizations with the chimeric FliC VLPs and GM-CSF/FliC H5N1 VLPs elicited more potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies in sera, and induced higher numbers of hemagglutinin-specific antibody-secreting cells and germinal center B cell subsets in splenoctyes.

Therefore, it is urgent to develop a drug delivery system with molecular imaging tracking ability to accurately understand the distribution, location, and concentration of a drug in living organisms. In this study, we developed bovine serum albumin (BSA)-based nanoparticles (NPs) with dual magnetic resonance (MR) and fluorescence imaging modalities (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-BSA-Gd/1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea [BCNU] NPs) to deliver BCNU for inhibition of brain tumor cells (MBR 261-2). These BSA-based NPs are water dispersible, stable, and biocompatible as confirmed by XTT cell viability assay. In vitro phantoms and in vivo MR and fluorescence imaging experiments show that the developed FITC-BSA-Gd/BCNU NPs enable dual MR and fluorescence imaging for monitoring cellular uptake and distribution in tumors. The T1 relaxivity (R1) of FITC-BSA-Gd/BCNU NPs was 3.25 mM-1 s-1, which was similar to that of the commercial T1 contrast agent (R1 =3.36 mM-1 s-1).

However, the role of HMDB in cervical cancer remains unclear. Herein, we found that HMDB dose-and time-dependently inhibited growth of HeLa cervical cancer cells, accompanied with G1 cell cycle arrest. HMDB decreased protein expression of cyclins D1/D3/E and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2/4/6 and reciprocally increased mRNA and protein levels of CDK inhibitors (p15, p16, p21, and p27), thereby leading to the accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. HMDB also triggered the accumulation of acidic vesicles and formation of microtubule-associated protein-light chain 3 (LC3), followed by increased expression of LC3 and Beclin-1 and decreased expression of p62, suggesting that HMDB triggered autophagy in HeLa cells. Meanwhile, suppression of the expression of survivin and Bcl-2 implied that HMDB-induced autophagy is tightly linked to apoptosis. Exploring the action mechanism, HMDB induced autophagy via the modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR signaling pathway rather than the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. These results suggest that HMDB inhibits HeLa cell growth by eliciting a G1 arrest through modulation of G1 cell cycle regulators and by concomitantly inducing autophagy through the mediation of AMPK-mTOR and Akt-mTOR pathways, and may be a promising antitumor agent against cervical cancer. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",1-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl-1; 3-propanedione; Autophagy; Beclin-1; G1 arrest; Light chain 3 (LC3); P62,"1 (2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl) 3 phenyl 1,3 propanedione; antineoplastic agent; beclin 1; cyclin D1; cyclin D3; cyclin dependent kinase 2; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin dependent kinase 6; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B; cyclin E; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein bcl 2; protein kinase B; protein p62; retinoblastoma protein; unclassified drug; 1-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl-1,3-propanedione; beclin 1; BECN1 protein, human; cell cycle protein; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; ketone; light chain 3, human; microtubule associated protein; propane; protein kinase B; target of rapamycin kinase; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cell cycle assay; controlled study; down regulation; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression regulation; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; microtubule assembly; MTT assay; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; real time polymerase chain reaction; TUNEL assay; uterine cervix cancer; Western blotting; analogs and derivatives; autophagy; biological model; cell proliferation; cell vacuole; chemistry; drug effects; female; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; HeLa cell line; lysosome; metabolism; pathology; signal transduction; uterine cervix tumor; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Beclin-1; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Proliferation; Female; G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; HeLa Cells; Humans; Ketones; Lysosomes; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Models, Biological; Propane; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vacuoles",2-s2.0-84981248775

The objective of this study was to develop a readily usable sampling collection device that would eliminate macromolecular interference and accurately provide specimens for further studies.

We found a higher incidence of myopia among patients with inflammatory diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (7.9%), uveitis (3.7%), or systemic lupus erythematosus (3.5%) compared to those without inflammatory diseases (p < 0.001) using data from children (< 18 years old) in the National Health Insurance Research database. We then examined the inhibition of myopia by atropine in Syrian hamsters with monocular form deprivation (MFD), an experimental myopia model. We found atropine downregulated inflammation in MFD eyes. The expression levels of c-Fos, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were upregulated in myopic eyes and downregulated upon treatment with atropine. The relationship between the inflammatory response and myopia was investigated by treating MFD hamsters with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A (CSA) or the inflammatory stimulators lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or peptidoglycan (PGN). Myopia progression was slowed by CSA application but was enhanced by LPS and PGN administration. The levels of c-Fos, NF-κB, IL-6, and TNF-α were upregulated in LPS- and PGN-treated eyes and downregulated by CSA treatment.

Methods and Materials Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) was consecutively performed on tumor-bearing mice, and temporal and spatial changes of Ktrans values were measured along with tumor growth. Tumor responses to RT and CT were studied before and after observed changes in Ktrans values with time. Results Dynamic changes with an initial increase and subsequent decline in Ktrans values were found to be associated with tumor growth. When each tumor was divided into core and peripheral regions, the Ktrans decline was greater in core, although neither vascular structure or necrosis could be linked to this spatial difference. Tumor responses to RT were worse if applied after the decline of Ktrans, and there was less drug distribution and cell death in the tumor core after CT. Conclusion The Ktrans value in growing tumors, reflecting the changes of tumor microenvironment and vascular function, is strongly associated with tumor responses to RT and CT and could be a potential surrogate marker for predicting the tumor response to these treatments. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"Cell death; Chemotherapy; Computerized tomography; Magnetic resonance imaging; Radiotherapy; Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; Methods and materials; Peripheral regions; Spatial differences; Temporal and spatial changes; Tumor microenvironment; Vascular functions; Vascular structures; Tumors; doxorubicin; histone H2AX; contrast medium; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cell death; controlled study; DNA damage; drug distribution; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; histology; male; mouse; nonhuman; oncological parameters; priority journal; radiation dose; radiological parameters; spatiotemporal analysis; treatment response; tumor growth; tumor volume; vascular necrosis; vascular tumor; animal; blood flow velocity; C57BL mouse; chemoradiotherapy; diagnostic imaging; magnetic resonance angiography; Neoplasms, Experimental; Neovascularization, Pathologic; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; treatment outcome; tumor cell line; Animals; Blood Flow Velocity; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemoradiotherapy; Contrast Media; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neoplasms, Experimental; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84990866273

Materials and Methods: Four-dimensional flow MRI was performed in 20 MFS patients and 12 age-matched normal subjects with a 3T system. The cross-sectional areas of 10 planes along the aorta were segmented for calculating the axial and circumferential wall shear stress (WSSaxial, WSScirc), oscillatory shear index (OSIaxial, OSIcirc), and the nonroundness (NR), presenting the asymmetry of segmental WSS. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to present the correlations between the quantified indices and the body surface area (BSA), aortic root diameter (ARD), and Z score of the ARD. P &lt; 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results: Patients exhibited lower WSSaxial in the aortic root and the WSScirc in the arch (P &lt; 0.05–0.001). MFS patients exhibited higher OSIaxial and OSIcirc in the sinotubular junction and arch, but lower OSIcirc in the descending aorta (all P &lt; 0.05). The NR values were lower in patients (P &lt; 0.05). The WSSaxial or WSScirc exhibited moderate to strong correlations with BSA, ARD, or Z score (R2 = 0.50–0.72) in MFS patients. Conclusion: The significant differences in the quantified indices, which were associated with BSA, ARD, or Z score, in MFS were opposite to previous reports for younger MFS patients, indicating that altered flows in MFS patients may depend on the disease progress. The possible time dependency of hemodynamic alterations in MFS patients strongly suggests that longitudinal follow-up of 4D Flow is needed to comprehend disease progress. J. Magn. Reson.

Human epidermal growth factor (EGF) is the target protein of S100A4 and a critical ligand of the receptor EGFR. The EGF/EGFR system promotes cell survival, differentiation, and growth by activating several signaling pathways. Amlexanox is an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic drug that is used to treat recurrent aphthous ulcers. In the present study, we determined that amlexanox interacts with S100A4 using heteronuclear single quantum correlation titration. We elucidated the interactions of S100A4 with EGF and amlexanox using fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We generated two binary models (for the S100A4-EGF and S100A4-amlexanox complexes) and observed that amlexanox and EGF share a similar binding region in mS100A4. We also used a WST-1 assay to investigate the bioactivity of S100A4, EGF, and amlexanox, and found that amlexanox blocks the binding between S100A4 and EGF, and is therefore useful for the development of new anti-proliferation drugs. ? 2016 Cho et al.

Nanoceria (CeO2 nanoparticles) are used to increase fuel efficiency in internal combustion engines, are present in exhaust fumes, and could affect cells of the airway. Components from the environment such as biologically derived proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids can form a dynamic layer, commonly referred to as the “protein corona” which alters cellular nanoparticle interactions and internalization. Using confocal reflectance microscopy, we quantified nanoceria uptake by lung-derived cells in the presence and absence of a serum-derived protein corona. Employing mass spectrometry, we identified components of the protein corona, and demonstrated that the interaction between transferrin in the protein corona and the transferrin receptor is involved in mediating the cellular entry of nanoceria via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, under these conditions nanoceria does not affect cell growth, viability, or metabolism, even at high concentration. Alternatively, despite the antioxidant capacity of nanoceria, in serum-free conditions these nanoparticles induce plasma membrane disruption and cause changes in cellular metabolism. Thus, our results identify a specific receptor-mediated mechanism for nanoceria entry, and provide significant insight into the potential for nanoparticle-dependent toxicity. ? 2016 Marine Biological Laboratory.",,"allergy; antioxidant; asthma; combustion; corona; exhaust emission; nanoparticle; nutrient uptake; physiological response; protein; serum; ceric oxide; cerium; clathrin; metal nanoparticle; protein corona; serum-free medium; transferrin; transferrin receptor; cell membrane; chemistry; endocytosis; human; metabolism; serum-free medium; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Membrane; Cerium; Clathrin; Culture Media, Serum-Free; Endocytosis; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Protein Corona; Receptors, Transferrin; Transferrin",2-s2.0-84988924310

Case Report A 39-year-old woman underwent amniocentesis at 17?weeks of gestation, which revealed a karyotype of 47,XY,+5[1]/46,XY[20]. The single colony with trisomy 5 had five metaphase cells, and all five cells had the karyotype of 47,XY,+5. Repeat amniocentesis performed at 20?weeks of gestation revealed a karyotype of 46,XY in 27/27 colonies. Simultaneously, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), and quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) were performed on uncultured amniocytes. Interphase FISH revealed no trisomy 5 in 100 uncultured amniocytes. aCGH revealed no genomic imbalance. QF-PCR excluded uniparental disomy 5. A healthy 3662-g male baby was delivered with a normal karyotype in cord blood and 3.75% (3/80?cells) of trisomy 5?cells in uncultured urinary cells compared with 0.95% (1/105?cells) of trisomy 5?cells in normal control examined by FISH at 1.5?months of age. A review of seven cases with mosaic trisomy 5 at amniocentesis shows that 4/7 had clinically normal outcome, 3/7 had structural defects, mainly the heart, 6/6 had normal karyotype in blood, and 2/3 had mosaic trisomy 5 in the fetal tissues. Conclusion Prenatal diagnosis of mosaic trisomy 5 should alert the possibility of fetal structural abnormalities, especially the heart, and culture artifacts. We suggest that the application of molecular cytogenetic techniques such as aCGH, interphase FISH, and QF-PCR on uncultured amniocytes is useful in our understanding of the mosaic status at repeat amniocentesis. ? 2016",amniocentesis; mosaic trisomy 5; prenatal diagnosis; pseudomosaicism; uncultured amniocytes,"DNA; fluorescein isothiocyanate; adult; amniocentesis; amnion cell; Article; case report; cell culture; chromosome analysis; comparative genomic hybridization; DNA determination; DNA marker; father; female; fluorescence analysis; fluorescence in situ hybridization; follow up; gestational age; human; human cell; interphase; karyotype; karyotype 46,XY; karyotype 47,XY; male; maternal age; metaphase; molecular diagnosis; mosaicism; mother; newborn; polymerase chain reaction; prenatal diagnosis; pseudomosaicism; quantitative analysis; repeat procedure; trisomy; trisomy 5; umbilical cord blood; amniocentesis; chromosome 5; embryology; Fetal Diseases; fetus blood; genetics; infant; karyotyping; live birth; mosaicism; pregnancy; procedures; Adult; Amniocentesis; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Cytogenetic Analysis; Female; Fetal Blood; Fetal Diseases; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Infant; Karyotype; Karyotyping; Live Birth; Male; Mosaicism; Pregnancy",2-s2.0-84977111263

Materials and methods Perioperative blood samples from prostate cancer (PC) patients who underwent total gland cryoablation between October 2011 and March 2013 were collected prospectively. Plasma TGF-β1 levels were quantified using magnetic bead immunoassay. The perioperative change in TGF-β1 was defined as the change in TGF-β1 from before surgery to 1–2 months after surgery. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined according to the Phoenix criteria. The Mann–Whitney U, Kruskal–Wallis rank sum, and Chi-square test were used to compare the clinical characteristics of the subsets. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied for the comparison of recurrence risk among the groups. Results A total of 75 PC patients were included. During a median follow-up period of 12 months (range: 2.5–47 months), 11 patients had BCR, and 64 patients did not. Significantly greater changes in the perioperative TGF-β1 levels (median: 470.3 vs. 78.9 pg/ml) were observed in patients with than without BCR (p < 0.05). According to the changes in TGF-β1 levels, the patients were further divided into 4 groups, which were determined in the quartile categories of perioperative TGF-β1 levels. Group 4 (?430) predicted the worst BCR outcome. Conclusions Perioperative plasma TGF-β1 levels were associated with BCR after prostate cryoablation for localized PC. Increase in postoperative plasma TGF-β1 may be a novel predictor for poor oncological outcomes and prompt a more aggressive follow-up or earlier salvage treatment. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Cancer progression; Cryoablation; Prognostic factor; Prostate cancer; TGF-β1,"prostate specific antigen; transforming growth factor beta1; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; biochemical recurrence; biochemical recurrence free survival; cancer prognosis; controlled study; cryoablation; follow up; Gleason score; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; predictive value; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein blood level; biosynthesis; blood; cryosurgery; immunoassay; middle aged; pathology; procedures; proportional hazards model; Prostatic Neoplasms; tumor recurrence; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cryosurgery; Humans; Immunoassay; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Proportional Hazards Models; Prostatic Neoplasms; Transforming Growth Factor beta1",2-s2.0-84971634537

Considering the large number of cellular samples that have to be handled daily at the hospitals, it is thus important to develop a rapid and simple analytical method to distinguish MGMT activity in different types of cells. In this paper, we describe a MGMT-activated fluorescence turn-on probe for the rapid no-wash imaging of MGMT in living cells. The probe consists of a specific MGMT suicide pseudosubstrate, O6-benzyl-guanine and an environment-sensitive fluorophore, SBD. In the presence of MGMT, the enzyme transfers SBD to the protein active site where the hydrophobic surrounding causes the fluorophore to exhibit more than 50-fold fluorescence enhancement. With this probe, bright fluorescence was observed for MGMT-positive, Hela S3 and MCF-7 cells, while MGMT-deficient CHO cells displayed no fluorescence. We believe that this fluorescence activation probe design can also be extended to detect other transferases, for which there are still no effective methods to image them in living cells.

The model consists of stochastic Boolean genetic elements and possesses noise-induced multistability (multimodality). We obtain analytical expressions for probabilities for the case of constant but finite number of microRNA molecules which act as a noise source for the competing gene and pseudogene mRNAs. The probability distribution functions display both the global bistability regime as well as even-odd number oscillations for a certain range of model parameters.

The aim of our study was to develop a suitable biodegradable thermosensitive hydrogel system as a carrier for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 delivery in the treatment of critical-sized femoral defects. Methods: A block copolymer composed of monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and 2, 2'-Bis (2-oxazolin) (Box) was synthesized by ring opening polymerization. The synthesized block copolymer was characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Different biophysical and biochemical properties of the synthesized copolymer, including temperature-induced structure changes, degradation rate, pH changes during hydrolytic degradation, cell toxicity, and the release profile of BMP-2, were also evaluated and/or were compared with those of a well-characterized mPEG-PLGA copolymer. In animal testing, rabbits (n = 36) that received critically sized (10 mm) femoral defects were divided into 6 groups. These experimental groups included an untreated group, autograft, and groups treated with the synthesized copolymer carrying different concentrations of BMP-2 (0, 5, 10, and 20 μg/ml). Bone repair was evaluated using X-ray radiography, histological staining, micro-computed tomography (μCT), biomarker examination and biomechanical testing in a 12-week treatment period. Results: A new thermosensitive mPEG-PLGA/Box/mPEG-PLGA block copolymer, or named as BOX copolymer, was successfully prepared. Compared to the reported mPEG-PLGA in vitro, the prepared BOX copolymer at the same weight percent concentrations exhibited wider temperature ranges of gelation, slower degradation rates, higher the pH values, as well as less cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the BMP-2 release from BOX hydrogel exhibited a near-linear release profile in vitro. In animal experiments, treatment of critical-sized bony defects with 25 wt% BOX hydrogel carrying BMP-2 effectively promoted fracture healing during the 12-week trial period and higher concentrations of BMP-2 treatment correlated with better bone quality. Most importantly, clinical outcome and bone healing in the BOX-hydrogel group with 20 μg/ml BMP-2 were nearly equivalent to those in the autograft group in a 12-week treatment course. Conclusion: These data support that the use of BOX hydrogel (25 wt%) as a drug delivery system is a promising method in the treatment of large bone defects. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Biodegradable polymer; BMP-2; Fracture healing; mPEG-PLGA; Thermosensitive hydrogel,"monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol); polyglactin; polymer; recombinant bone morphogenetic protein 2; unclassified drug; biodegradable plastic; biological marker; bone morphogenetic protein 2; drug carrier; macrogol derivative; poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-methoxy-poly(ethyleneglycol) copolymer; polyglactin; recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2; recombinant protein; transforming growth factor beta; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biodegradability; biodegradation; biomechanics; bone defect; bone remodeling; chemical structure; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug release; femur; fetus; fibroblast; fracture healing; gelation; heat sensitivity; histopathology; human; human cell; hydrogel; hydrolysis; in vitro study; mouse; New Zealand White (rabbit); nonhuman; osteoblast; pH; ring opening; animal; autograft; bone transplantation; cell line; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; disease model; drug effects; femur; femur fracture; fracture nonunion; hydrogel; Leporidae; micro-computed tomography; pathology; procedures; radiography; temperature; transplantation; Animals; Autografts; Biodegradable Plastics; Biomarkers; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Bone Transplantation; Cell Line; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Carriers; Femoral Fractures; Femur; Fracture Healing; Fractures, Ununited; Humans; Hydrogels; Mice; Polyethylene Glycols; Polyglactin 910; Rabbits; Radiography; Recombinant Proteins; Temperature; Transforming Growth Factor beta; X-Ray Microtomography",2-s2.0-84987653386

Endothelium is critical in maintaining cellular and inflammatory homeostasis, controlling systemic inflammation, and progression of inflammatory diseases. We postulated that endothelium produces and releases endogenous soluble factors to modulate inflammatory responses and protect against systemic inflammation. Objective: To identify endothelial cell-released soluble factors that protect against endothelial barrier dysfunction and systemic inflammation. Methods and Results: We found that conditioned medium of endothelial cells inhibited cyclooxgenase-2 and interleukin-6 expression in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Analysis of conditioned medium extracts by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed the presence of 5-methoxytryptophan (5-MTP), but not other related tryptophan metabolites. Furthermore, endothelial cell-derived 5-MTP suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses and signaling in macrophages and endotoxemic lung tissues. Lipopolysaccharide suppressed 5-MTP level in endothelial cell-conditioned medium and reduced serum 5-MTP level in the murine sepsis model. Intraperitoneal injection of 5-MTP restored serum 5-MTP accompanied by the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial leakage and suppression of lipopolysaccharide-or cecal ligation and puncture-mediated proinflammatory mediators overexpression. 5-MTP administration rescued lungs from lipopolysaccharide-induced damages and prevented sepsis-related mortality. Importantly, compared with healthy subjects, serum 5-MTP level in septic patients was decreased by 65%, indicating an important clinical relevance. Conclusions: We conclude that 5-MTP belongs to a novel class of endothelium-derived protective molecules that defend against endothelial barrier dysfunction and excessive systemic inflammatory responses. ? 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.",5-methoxytryptophan; capillary permeability; inflammation; sepsis; shock,"5 methoxytryptophan; C reactive protein; chemokine; cyclooxygenase 2; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; kynurenine; lipopolysaccharide; tryptophan; unclassified drug; 5-methoxytryptophan; antiinflammatory agent; tryptophan; aged; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; clinical article; conditioned medium; controlled study; cytokine production; endothelium cell; endotoxemia; enzyme immunoassay; female; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; liquid chromatography; lung; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; sepsis; spleen; tryptophan metabolism; analogs and derivatives; animal; blood; C57BL mouse; endotoxemia; inflammation; metabolism; middle aged; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vascular endothelium; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Endothelium, Vascular; Endotoxemia; Female; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Middle Aged; Tryptophan",2-s2.0-84966697317

Due to the complex pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, antifibrotic drug development has faced the challenge of efficiently and specifically targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, CXCR4-targeted nanoparticles (NPs) were formulated to deliver siRNAs against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into fibrotic livers to block angiogenesis during the progression of liver fibrosis. AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist that was incorporated into the NPs, served dual functions: it acted as a targeting moiety and suppressed the progression of fibrosis by inhibiting the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). We demonstrated that CXCR4-targeted NPs could deliver VEGF siRNAs to fibrotic livers, decrease VEGF expression, suppress angiogenesis and normalize the distorted vessels in the fibrotic livers in the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced mouse model. Moreover, blocking SDF-1α/CXCR4 by CXCR4-targeted NPs in combination with VEGF siRNA significantly prevented the progression of liver fibrosis in CCl4-treated mice.

Actin filaments serve as the backbone of intracellular force, and transduce external mechanical signal via focal adhesion complex into the cell. During migration, cells not only undergo molecular changes but also rapid mechanical modulation. Here we focus on determining, the role of spatial distribution of mechanical changes of actin filaments in epithelial, mesenchymal, fibrotic and cancer cells with non-migration, directional migration, and non-directional migration behaviors using the atomic force microscopy. We found 1) non-migratory cells only generated one type of filament elasticity, 2) cells generating spatially distributed two types of filament elasticity showed directional migration, and 3) pathologic cells that autonomously generated two types of filament elasticity without spatial distribution were actively migrating non-directionally. The demonstration of spatial regulation of filament elasticity of different cell types at the nano-scale highlights the coupling of cytoskeletal function with physical characters at the sub-cellular level, and provides new research directions for migration related disease. ? 2016 The Author(s).

The purpose of this study was to: (1) compare the accuracy of C.N.B. and F.N.A. in the detection of thyroid malignancy; (2) evaluate the accuracy of C.N.B. in nodules with prior non-diagnostic F.N.A. results. Methods: Meta-analysis was performed with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis statistical software, version 2.0. A bivariate approach of hierarchical summary R.O.C. was performed using R software. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Publication bias analysis was performed by funnel plot and Egger’s test analysis. Results: The main results of our study are as follows. 1) Overall C.N.B. had fewer non-diagnostic results than F.N.A. (pooled O.R. = 4.93, 95% C.I.: 2.17–11.19). Pooled sensitivities and specificities of C.N.B. and F.N.A. did not differ significantly. (2) There was no significant difference in the rates of non-diagnostic results of first-line F.N.A. and C.N.B. (O.R. = 2.42, 95% C.I. 0.95–6.18).

While protein sensors based on antibodies are not easy to keep for a long time, aptamers (single-stranded DNA) are found to be a good alternative for recognizing tumor-related protein specifically. This study investigates the feasibility of employing aptamers to recognize the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) specifically and subsequently triggering rolling circle amplification (RCA) of DNAs on extended-gate field-effect transistors (EGFETs) to enhance the sensitivity. The EGFETs are fabricated by the standard CMOS technology and integrated with readout circuits monolithically. The monolithic integration not only avoids the wiring complexity for a large sensor array but also enhances the sensor reliability and facilitates massive production for commercialization. With the RCA primers immobilized on the sensory surface, the protein signal is amplified as the elongation of DNA, allowing the EGFET to achieve a sensitivity of 8.8?pM, more than three orders better than that achieved by conventional EGFETs. Moreover, the responses of EGFETs are able to indicate quantitatively the reaction rates of RCA, facilitating the estimation on the protein concentration. Our experimental results demonstrate that immobilized RCA on EGFETs is a useful, label-free method for early diagnosis of diseases related to low-concentrated tumor makers (e.g., PDGF) for serum sample, as well as for monitoring the synthesis of various DNA nanostructures in real time.

We previously described remarkable cell-to-cell heterogeneity in epigenetic pattern within a clonal population of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading human pathogen. We here report that the epigenetic diversity is caused by extensive DNA inversions among hsdSA, hsdSB, and hsdSC, three methyltransferase hsdS genes in the Spn556II type-I restriction modification (R-M) locus. Because hsdSA encodes the sequence recognition subunit of this type-I R-M DNA methyltransferase, these site-specific recombinations generate pneumococcal cells with variable HsdSA alleles and thereby diverse genome methylation patterns. Most importantly, the DNA methylation pattern specified by the HsdSA1 allele leads to the formation of opaque colonies, whereas the pneumococci lacking HsdSA1 produce transparent colonies. Furthermore, this HsdSA1-dependent phase variation requires intact DNA methylase activity encoded by hsdM in the Spn556II (renamed colony opacity determinant or cod) locus. Thus, the DNA inversion-driven ON/OFF switch of the hsdSA1 allele in the cod locus and resulting epigenetic switch dictate the phase variation between the opaque and transparent phenotypes. Phase variation has been well documented for its importance in pneumococcal carriage and invasive infection, but its molecular basis remains unclear. Our work has discovered a novel epigenetic cause for this significant pathobiology phenomenon in S. pneumoniae. Lastly, our findings broadly represents a significant advancement in our understanding of bacterial R-M systems and their potential in shaping epigenetic and phenotypic diversity of the prokaryotic organisms because similar site-specific recombination systems widely exist in many archaeal and bacterial species. ? 2016 Li et al.",,"DNA methyltransferase; nucleotidyltransferase; restriction endonuclease; tyrosine recombinase PsrA; unclassified drug; bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; HSDS protein, Bacteria; allele; allogeneic restriction; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; bacterium mutant; cell adhesion assay; controlled study; DNA inversion; DNA methylation; DNA rearrangement; DNA sequence; DNA structure; epigenetics; gene; gene amplification; gene locus; genetic variability; host specificity determinant gene; human; human cell; microscopy; molecular cloning; nonhuman; phenotypic variation; Streptococcus pneumoniae; upper respiratory tract; animal; C57BL mouse; disease model; female; genetic epigenesis; genetics; microbiology; mouse; phenotype; pneumococcal infection; polymerase chain reaction; site directed mutagenesis; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Disease Models, Animal; DNA Methylation; DNA Restriction-Modification Enzymes; DNA, Bacterial; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Phenotype; Pneumococcal Infections; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Streptococcus pneumoniae",2-s2.0-84980519584

However, NCI-H716 cells are cultured in suspension and tend to form multicellular aggregates, preventing high-throughput calcium imaging due to interferences caused by laborious immobilization and stimulus delivery procedures.

Grifola frondosa (GF) is an edible mushroom indigenous to many Asian countries with a large fruiting body characterized by overlapping caps. In particular, GF is known for its anti-tumor activity, which has been targeted by scientific and clinical research. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the cold-water extract of GF (GFW) and its active fraction (GFW-GF) on autophagy and apoptosis, and the underlying mechanisms in?vitro and in?vivo. Our results revealed that GFW and GFW-GF inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and stimulated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, thereby inducing autophagy. We also demonstrated that GFW and GFW-GF inhibited proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in Hep3B hepatoma cells. GFW and GFW-GF markedly arrested cells in S phase and promoted cleavage of caspase-3 and -9.

Once S100A11 proteins bind to calcium ions at EF-hand motifs, S100A11 changes its conformation, promoting interaction with target proteins. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) consists of three extracellular domains, including the V domain, C1 domain, and C2 domain. In this case, the V domain is the target for mutant S100A11 (mS100A11) binding. RAGE binds to the ligands, resulting in cell proliferation, cell growth, and several signal transduction cascades. We used NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy to demonstrate the interactions between mS100A11 and RAGE V domain. The tranilast molecule is a drug used for treating allergic disorders. We discovered that the RAGE V domain and tranilast would interact with mS100A11 by using 1H-15N HSQC NMR titrations. According to the results, we obtained two binary complex models from the HADDOCK program, S100A11-RAGE V domain and S100A11-tranilast, respectively. We overlapped two binary complex models with the same orientation of S100A11 homodimer and demonstrated that tranilast would block the binding site between S100A11 and the RAGE V domain. We further utilized a water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay to confirm this result.

Developing a simple, cost-effective and biocompatible approach to treat cancers using ultra-low doses of light is a grand challenge in clinical cancer treatments. In this study, we report for the first time that nano-sized graphene oxide (GO) exhibits single-photon excitation wavelength dependent photoluminescence in the visible and short near-infrared (NIR) region, suitable for in vivo multi-color fluorescence imaging. We also demonstrate in both in vitro and in vivo experiments to show that nano GO can sensitize the formation of singlet oxygen to exert combined nanomaterial-mediated photodynamic therapeutic (NmPDT) and photothermal therapy (NmPTT) effects on the destruction of B16F0 melanoma tumors in mice using ultra-low doses (~0.36 W/cm 2 ) of NIR (980 nm) light. The average half-life span of the mice treated by the GO-PEG-folate-mediated NmPDT effects is beyond 30 days, which is ~1.8 times longer than the mice treated with doxorubicin (17 days).

This work proposes a multifunctional liposomal system that can intracellularly and simultaneously deliver the therapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX), heat, and a bubble-generating agent (ammonium bicarbonate, ABC) into targeted tumor cells to have a cytotoxic effect. Gold nanocages that are encapsulated in liposomes effectively convert near-infrared light irradiation into localized heat, which causes the decomposition of ABC and generates CO2 bubbles, rapidly triggering the release of DOX. Additionally, a hybridized Mucin-1 aptamer is conjugated on the surface of the test liposomes, which then function as a recognition probe to enhance the uptake of those liposomes by cells, and as a molecular beacon to signal when the internalized particles have been maximized, which is the optimal time for photothermally triggering the release of the drug following the systemic administration of the liposomes. Empirical results reveal that this combined treatment effectively controls targeted drug release in a spatially and temporally precise fashion and so significantly increases the potency of the drug while minimizing unwanted side effects, making it a promising treatment for cancer. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Cancer therapy; Gold nanocage; Molecular beacon; Photothermal effect; Targeted delivery,"Ammonium bicarbonate; Carbon dioxide; Cytotoxicity; Diseases; Gold; Infrared devices; Cancer therapy; Molecular beacon; Nanocages; Photothermal effects; Targeted delivery; Liposomes; ammonia; aptamer; bicarbonate; doxorubicin; gold; liposome; mucin 1; nanocage; antineoplastic agent; doxorubicin; liposome; nanoparticle; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; cell migration; cell viability assay; controlled drug release; controlled study; decomposition; drug efficacy; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; heat; heating; in vitro study; in vivo study; irradiation; lipid bilayer; liposomal delivery; molecular beacon; molecular imaging; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; time; tumor cell; zeta potential; animal; Bagg albino mouse; body weight; cell survival; chemistry; delayed release formulation; drug delivery system; drug effects; drug release; endocytosis; fluorescence; Hep-G2 cell line; human; infrared radiation; MCF-7 cell line; molecular dynamics; nude mouse; pharmacology; temperature; time factor; tumor volume; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Body Weight; Cell Survival; Delayed-Action Preparations; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Endocytosis; Fluorescence; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Infrared Rays; Liposomes; MCF-7 Cells; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Molecular Imaging; Nanoparticles; Temperature; Time Factors; Tumor Burden",2-s2.0-84962732835

During endocytosis, Au NP clusters undergo fantastic color changes, from green to yellow-orange due to the plasmonic coupling effect. Analysis of brightness/hue values of the dark-field images helps estimate the numbers of Au NPs in the clusters. The Au NP clusters were further categorized into four groups within the endocytosis. As the results, the late endosomes had increased number of large Au NP clusters with time, while clustered numbers in secondary and tertiary groups were first increased and then decreased due to the fusion and fission of the endocytic vesicles. The time constants and cluster numbers for different groups are fitted by using an integrated rate equation, and show a positive correlation with the size of the Au NP cluster. The efficiency of Au NP uptake is only about 50% for normal cells, while 75% for cancer cells. Compared to normal cells, cancer cells show a larger number in uptake, while faster rate in removal.

The combination of conventional fractionation radiotherapy (CFRT) and systemic therapy has been established as the standard treatment for many cancer types. With advances in linear accelerators and image-guided techniques, high-dose fractionation radiotherapy (HFRT) is increasingly introduced in cancer centers. Clinicians are currently integrating HFRT into multimodality treatment. The shift from CFRT to HFRT reveals different effects on the tumor microenvironment and responses,particularly the immune response. Furthermore, the combination of HFRT and drugs yields different results in different types of tumors or using different treatment schemes. We have reviewed clinical trials and preclinical evidence on the combination of HFRT with drugs, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune therapy. Notably, HFRT apparently enhances tumor cell killing and antigen presentation, thus providing opportunities and challenges in treating cancer. ? 2016 Yang and Chiang.",Chemotherapy; High-dose fractionation radiotherapy; Immunotherapy; Stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy; Target therapy,bevacizumab; cetuximab; erlotinib; gefitinib; temozolomide; antigen presentation; cell killing; chemotherapy; clinical trial (topic); conventional fractionation radiotherapy; high dose fractionation radiotherapy; human; immune response; multimodality cancer therapy; overall survival; preclinical study; radioisotope therapy; Review; systemic therapy,2-s2.0-84982794748

Traditionally, an MRCT would assume that a treatment effect is uniform across regions. However, heterogeneity among regions may have impact upon the evaluation of a medicine's effect. In this study, we consider a random effects model using discrete distribution (DREM) to account for heterogeneous treatment effects across regions for the design and evaluation of MRCTs. We derive an power function for a treatment that is beneficial under DREM and illustrate determination of the overall sample size in an MRCT. We use the concept of consistency based on Method 2 of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare's guidance to evaluate the probability for treatment benefit and consistency under DREM. We further derive an optimal sample size allocation over regions to maximize the power for consistency. Moreover, we provide three algorithms for deriving sample size at the desired level of power for benefit and consistency. In practice, regional treatment effects are unknown. Thus, we provide some guidelines on the design of MRCTs with consistency when the regional treatment effect are assumed to fall into a specified interval. Numerical examples are given to illustrate applications of the proposed approach. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Consistency; Discrete random effects model; Multiregional clinical trial; Optimal sample size allocation; Power for benefit and consistency,"clinical trial; human; model; practice guideline; probability; sample size; welfare; algorithm; biostatistics; clinical trial (topic); multicenter study (topic); statistical model; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Algorithms; Biostatistics; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Models, Statistical; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Probability; Sample Size; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84957604827

Resulting nanopeas can transport multiple PVA micelles containing the fully concealed hydrophobic drug docetaxel (DTX) which can be later released by a near-infrared photoactuation trigger. Through integrating the rod-shaped adhesion and lactoferrin (Lf) targeting, the nanopea enhances both uptake by cancer cellc in vitro and particle accumulation at tumor in vivo. A photopenetrative delivery of micelles/DTX to the tumor site is actuated by NIR irradiation which ruptures the nanopeas as well as releases nanosized micelles/DTX. This trigger also results in thermal damage to the tumor and increases the micelles/DTX permeability, facilitating drug penetration into the deep tumor far from blood vessels for thermal chemotherapy.

The immunogenic and immunomodulatory properties of HP-NAP make it a potential diagnostic and vaccine candidate for H. pylori and a new drug candidate for cancer therapy. In order to obtain substantial quantities of purified HP-NAP used for its clinical applications, an efficient method to purify this protein with high yield and purity needs to be established. In this protocol, we have described a method for one-step negative chromatographic purification of recombinant HP-NAP overexpressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) by using diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) ion-exchange resins (e.g., Sephadex) in batch mode. Recombinant HP-NAP constitutes nearly 70% of the total protein in E. coli and is almost fully recovered in the soluble fraction upon cell lysis at pH 9.0. Under the optimal condition at pH 8.0, the majority of HP-NAP is recovered in the unbound fraction while the endogenous proteins from E. coli are efficiently removed by the resin. This purification method using negative mode batch chromatography with DEAE ion-exchange resins yields functional HP-NAP from E. coli in its native form with high yield and purity.

These applications were demonstrated with KT98 mouse neural stem cells, and A549 and MDA-MB-435 human cancer cells. High single-cell isolation efficiency and long-term culture capability are achieved by using different sizes of microwells on the top and bottom of the microfluidic channel. The small microwell array is designed for precisely isolating single-cells, and the large microwell array is used for single-cell clonal culture in the microfluidic chip.

Human FGF1 gene 1B promoter (-540 to +31)-driven SV40 T antigen has been shown to result in tumorigenesis in the brains of transgenic mice. FGF1B promoter (-540 to +31)-driven green fluorescent protein (F1BGFP) has also been used in isolating neural stem cells (NSCs) with self-renewal and multipotency from developing and adult mouse brains. In this study, we provide six lines of evidence to demonstrate that FGF1/FGFR signaling is implicated in the expression of Aurora A (AurA) and the activation of its kinase domain (Thr288 phosphorylation) in the maintenance of glioblastoma (GBM) cells and NSCs. First, treatment of FGF1 increases AurA expression in human GBM cell lines. Second, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we observed that F1BGFP reporter facilitates the isolation of F1BGFP(+) GBM cells with higher expression levels of FGFR and AurA. Third, both FGFR inhibitor (SU5402) and AurA inhibitor (VX680) could down-regulate F1BGFP-dependent AurA activity. Fourth, inhibition of AurA activity by two different AurA inhibitors (VX680 and valproic acid) not only reduced neurosphere formation but also induced neuronal differentiation of F1BGFP(+) GBM cells. Fifth, flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that F1BGFP(+) GBM cells possessed different NSC cell surface markers. Finally, inhibition of AurA by VX680 reduced the neurosphere formation of different types of NSCs. Our results show that activation of AurA kinase through FGF1/FGFR signaling axis sustains the stem cell characteristics of GBM cells.

This disease affects multiple organ systems with varying degrees of severity. Exploration of the molecular pathological changes occurring in different cell types in SMA is crucial for developing new therapies. This study collected 39 human microarray datasets from ArrayExpress and GEO databases to build an integrative transcriptomic analysis for recognizing novel SMA targets. The transcriptomic analysis was conducted through combining weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) for gene module detection, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for functional categorization and filtration, and Cytoscape (visual interaction gene network analysis) for target gene identification. Seven novel target genes (Bmp4, Serpine1, Gata6, Ptgs2, Bcl2, IL6 and Cntn1) of SMA were revealed, and are all known in the regulation of TNFα for controlling neural, cardiac and bone development. Sequentially, the differentially expressed patterns of these 7 target genes in mouse tissues (e.g., spinal cord, heart, muscles and bone) were validated in SMA mice of different severities (pre-symptomatic, mildly symptomatic, and severely symptomatic). In severely symptomatic SMA mice, TNFα was up-regulated with attenuation of Bmp4 and increase of Serpine1 and Gata6 (a pathway in neural and cardiac development), but not in pre-symptomatic and mildly symptomatic SMA mice. The severely symptomatic SMA mice also had the elevated levels of Ptgs2 and Bcl2 (a pathway in skeletal development) as well as IL6 and Cntn1 (a pathway in nervous system development). Thus, the 7 genes identified in this study might serve as potential target genes for future investigations of disease pathogenesis and SMA therapy. ? 2016 Yang et al.

Although such physical metaphors help both authors and audiences make sense of material, they also constrain authoring in ways that can negatively impact presentation delivery. In this article, we derive heuristics for the design of presentation media that are independent of any underlying physical metaphors. We use these heuristics to craft a new kind of presentation medium called SlideSpace - one that combines hierarchical outlines, content collections, and design rules to automate the real-time, outline-driven synthesis of hybrid Slide-Canvas visuals. Through a qualitative study of SlideSpace use, we validate our heuristics and demonstrate that such a hybrid presentation medium can combine the advantages of existing systems while mitigating their drawbacks.

M. citrifolia fruit extracts were obtained by using five different organic solvents, including hexane (Hex), methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), chloroform (CHCl3), and ethanol (EtOH). The water-EtOAc extracts from M. citrifolia fruits was found to have the highest anticancer activity. HPLC data revealed the predominance of chrysin in water-EtOAc extracts of M. citrifolia fruit. Furthermore, the combined effects of cotreatment with apigenin and chrysin on liver and breast cancer were investigated. Treatment with apigenin plus chrysin for 72-96 h reduced HepG2 and MDA-MB-231 cell viability and induced apoptosis through down-regulation of S-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (Skp2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) expression. However, the combination treatment for 36 h synergistically decreased MDA-MB-231 cell motility but not cell viability through down-regulation of MMP2, MMP9, fibronectin, and snail in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, chrysin combined with apigenin also suppressed tumor growth in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells xenograft through down-regulation of ki-67 and Skp2 protein. The experimental results showed that chrysin combined with apigenin can reduce HepG2 and MDA-MB-231 proliferation and cell motility and induce apoptosis.

However, it is not well known whether altered plasma AcylCN, and amino acid profiles are associated with albuminuria or diabetic nephropathy (DN) in T2D. Objective: The aim of this study was to elucidate alterations in plasma levels of AcylCNs and amino acids with respect to the T2D patients with various stages of albuminuria. Methods: We recruited 52 healthy subjects as control, and 156 T2D patients which were divided into 52 normoalbuminuria, 52 microalbuminuria, and 52 macroalbuminuria. Plasma 37 AcylCNs and 12 amino acids were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Results: We found that T2D with normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria had lower shot-, medium-, and long-chain AcylCNs, whereas T2D with macroalbuminuria had higher short-and medium-chain AcylCNs and lower long-chain AcylCNs than healthy subjects. Moreover, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was a negative, independent and significant predictor of albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) levels (β?=??0.376, P?<?0.001), whereas plasma Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly and positively associated with ACR levels (β?=?0.169, P?=?0.049). Furthermore, multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that isobutyrylcarnitine (C4) was a positive, independent, and significant predictor of ACR levels with higher odds of having T2D patients with progression normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria [OR?=?9.93, 95?% CI (3.51–28.05), P?<?0.001]. Conclusions: The findings suggest that plasma C4 may serve as a potential biomarker for the early stages of DN. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Acylcarnitine; Amino acids; Diabetic nephropathy; Metabolomics; Type 2 diabetes,acylcarnitine; albumin; arginine; C reactive protein; carnitine derivative; cholesterol oxidase; citrulline; creatinine; glucose; glycine; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; isobutyrylcarnitine; isoleucine; leucine; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; methionine; ornithine; phenylalanine; triacylglycerol; tyrosine; unclassified drug; valine; adult; albuminuria; amino acid analysis; anthropometry; Article; blood pressure measurement; chemical analyzer; chemical reaction; colorimetry; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; glomerulus filtration rate; human; lipid blood level; macroalbuminuria; major clinical study; microalbuminuria; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; tandem mass spectrometry; urinalysis,2-s2.0-84969974084

Adherent cells of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293-derived cell, 293A, which supports the production of E1/E3-deleted Ad-F0ΔTM when cultured in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), were adapted to suspension growth under serum-free medium. In doing so, we studied the immunogenicity of Ad-F0ΔTMsus, which propagated in a bioreactor that was cultured with serum-free suspension of 293A, in comparison with Ad-F0ΔTMadh, which was produced from parental 293A cells that were adherently cultured in medium containing FBS. The size and morphology of Ad-F0ΔTMsus and Ad-F0ΔTMadh virions were identical upon inspection with electron microscopy. The results showed that anti-F IgG and RSV-neutralizing titer were raised in the serum of both mice that were intranasally immunized twice with Ad-F0ΔTMsus or Ad-F0ΔTMadh at two-week injection intervals. Furthermore, the immune responses persisted for six months after vaccination. Activation of F protein-specific CD8+ T cell's epitope associated IFN-γ and IL-4 was induced in both Ad-F0ΔTMsus- and Ad-F0ΔTMadh, but not in Ad-LacZsus, -immunized mouse splenocytes. No vaccine-enhanced lung inflammation, airway mucus occlusion or eosinophils infiltration were observed in Ad-immunized mice followed by RSV challenge; however, these symptoms were observed following immunization with formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine.

The purpose of this study is to develop a redox and pH-sensitive self-assembling hyaluronic acid nanoparticle with active targeting peptide for anticancer drug delivery. Anti-cancer drug is grafted onto hyaluronic acid (HA) via cis-aconityl linkage and disulfide bond to possess pH sensitivity and redox property, respectively. This conjugate is amphiphilic and can self-assemble into nanoparticle (NP) in aqueous solution. The results show that the nanoconjugate is successfully developed and the grafting ratio of cystamine (cys) is 17.8% with drug loading amount about 6.2% calculated by 1H NMR spectra. The particle size is approximately 229.0 nm using dynamic light scatting measurement, and the morphology of nanoparticles is observed as spherical shape by transmission electron microscope. The pH and redox sensitivities are evaluated by changing either pH value or concentration of dithiothreitol in the medium. It is proved that the drug carrier is capable of achieving sustained controlled release of anti-cancer drug to 95% within 150 h. The intracellular uptake is observed by fluorescent microscope and the images show that conjugating luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) peptide can enhance specific uptake of nanoparticles by OVCAR-3 cancer cells; thus, resulting in inhibitory cell growth to less than 20% in 72 h in vitro. Orthotopic ovarian tumor model is also established to evaluate the therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy using non-invasive in vivo imaging system. The representative results demonstrate that LHRH-conjugated NPs possess a preferable tumor imaging capability and an excellent antitumor ability to almost 30% of original size in 20 days. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Active targeting; Cancer therapy; Drug delivery; Dual responsive; Orthotopic model; Self-assembling,"Covalent bonds; Diagnosis; Drug delivery; Fish; Grafting (chemical); Hyaluronic acid; Nanoparticles; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Organic acids; Particle size; Peptides; pH sensors; Solutions; Transmission electron microscopy; Tumors; Active targeting; Cancer therapy; Dual responsive; Orthotopic; Self-assembling; Diseases; cystamine; dithiothreitol; doxorubicin; glutathione; gonadorelin; hyaluronic acid; nanoconjugate; antineoplastic antibiotic; delayed release formulation; doxorubicin; nanoconjugate; peptide; animal cell; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; Article; controlled release formulation; controlled study; drug delivery system; drug uptake; female; human; human cell; in vitro study; light scattering; mouse; nonhuman; ovarian cancer cell line; ovary cancer; pH; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; ring opening; synthesis; theranostic nanomedicine; tissue section; transmission electron microscopy; animal; chemistry; delayed release formulation; drug delivery system; drug effects; Ovarian Neoplasms; ovary; oxidation reduction reaction; pathology; procedures; theranostic nanomedicine; tumor cell line; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Cell Line, Tumor; Cystamine; Delayed-Action Preparations; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Female; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mice; Nanoconjugates; Ovarian Neoplasms; Ovary; Oxidation-Reduction; Peptides; Theranostic Nanomedicine",2-s2.0-84960436641

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are marked by persistent infection and immune tolerance to vaccination. This disease offers a unique opportunity to discover key repertoire signatures during infection and in response to vaccination. Complementarity determining region 3 of an antibody heavy chain (CDR-H3) has a major impact on the antigenic specificity of an antibody. We used next-generation sequencing to characterize the CDR-H3 sequences in paired siblings of 4 families in which only one member of each pair had chronic HBV infection. Blood samples were obtained before and 2 weeks after HBV vaccination. The analysis revealed a huge network of sequence-related CDR-H3 clones found almost exclusively among carriers. In contrast, vaccination induced significant increases of CDR-H3 cluster diversities among siblings without hepatitis B. Several vaccination-associated clone clusters were identified. Similar findings of vaccination-associated clone networks were observed in healthy adults receiving HBV boosters. These strategies can be used to identify signatures of other infectious diseases and accelerate discoveries of antibody sequences with important biomedical implications. ? 2016, The Author(s).",,"hepatitis B antibody; hepatitis B vaccine; immunoglobulin G; blood; chronic hepatitis B; clinical trial; female; human; immunology; male; Female; Hepatitis B Antibodies; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Male",2-s2.0-85010385747

To determine whether fibroblasts block cancer cell epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) via 5-MTP, we evaluated the effect of Hs68 fibroblasts (HsFb) on A549 cancer cell EMT in a two-chamber system. Co-incubation of A549 with HsFb prevented TGF-β1-induced reduction of E-cadherin and increase in Snail and N-cadherin. Transfection of HsFb with tryptophan hydroxylase-1 siRNA, which inhibited tryptophan hydroxylase-1 protein expression and 5-MTP release in HsFb abrogated the effect of HsFb on A549 EMT. Direct addition of pure 5-MTP to cultured A549 cells followed by TGF-β1 prevented TGF-β1-induced reduction of E-cadherin, and elevation of Snail, vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase 9. Administration of 5-MTP to a murine xenograft tumor model reduced vimentin protein expression in the tumor tissues compared to vehicle control which was correlated with reduction of metastasis in the 5-MTP treated mice. Our experimental data suggest that 5-MTP exerted its anti-EMT actions through inhibition of p38 MAPK activation, p65/p50 NF-κB nuclear translocation and transactivation without the involvement of COX-2 or p300 histone acetyltransferase.

Here we synthesized dispersible polyethylene glycol-coated (PEGylated) copper nanowires (CuNWs) and showed for the first time that PEGylated CuNWs were able to convert near-infrared (NIR, 808 nm) light into heat at a photothermal efficiency of 12.5%. The PEGylated CuNWs exhibited good reusability and enabled rapid temperature rise to >50 °C in 6 min by NIR irradiation. The PEGylated CuNWs were flexible and intertwined around the cancer cells, which, upon NIR irradiation, allowed for direct heat transmission to cells and effectively triggered cancer cell ablation in vitro. Intratumoral injection of PEGylated CuNWs into colon tumor-bearing mice and ensuing NIR irradiation for 6 min significantly raised the local temperature to >50 °C, induced necrosis, and suppressed tumor growth.

In this study, we combined the advantages of the microfluidic system and the selected low-cost, stable and specific aptamers and developed an integrated, aptamer-based microfluidic system for automatic glycated hemoglobin measurements. The detection process of human whole blood can be totally automated in this integrated microfluidic system. According to the experimental results, when compared to conventional bench-top manual assays, reagent consumption was significantly reduced by 75%, and the analysis time was reduced from 3.5 h to 30 min. Besides, the novelty in this research also lies in the simultaneously performed two parallel assays for detection of Hb and HbA1c in a single chip.

Measurements of serum 5-MTP levels in healthy subjects and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) showed that serum 5-MTP concentrations were inversely correlated with CAD. To test the role of 5-MTP in occlusive vascular disease, we subjected mice to a carotid artery ligation model of neointima formation and treated mice with vehicle or 5-MTP. Compared with vehicle-treated mice, 5-MTP significantly reduced intimal thickening by 40% 4 weeks after ligation. BrdU incorporation assays revealed that 5-MTP significantly reduced VSMC proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, 5-MTP reduced endothelial loss and detachment, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressions, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the ligated arterial wall, suggesting attenuation of endothelial dysfunction. Signaling pathway analysis indicated that 5-MTP mediated its effects predominantly via suppressing p38 MAPK signaling in endothelial and VSMCs.

In contrast, recent studies reveal that CSCs exhibit increased inflammation due to constitutive NF-κB activation; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, the analysis of microarray data revealed upregulation of NF-κB-regulated pro-inflammatory genes and downregulation of copper metabolism MURR1 domain-containing 1 (COMMD1) during the enrichment for stemness in SAS head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. The 3′-UTR of COMMD1 mRNA contains microRNA (miR)-205 target site. Parallel studies with HNSCC and NSCLC cells indicated that miR-205 is upregulated upon NF-κB activation and suppresses COMMD1 expression in stemness-enriched cancer cells. COMMD1 negatively regulates the inflammatory responses induced by TLR agonists, IL-1β, and TNF-α by targeting RelA for degradation. The shRNA-mediated downregulation of COMMD1 in cancer cells enhanced inflammatory response, generating favorable conditions for macrophage recruitment. In addition, genes associated with stemness were also upregulated in these cells, which exhibited increased potential for anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, COMMD1 downregulation promoted in vivo tumorigenesis and tumor growth, and tumors derived from COMMD1-knockdown cells displayed elevated level of NF-κB activation, increased expression of inflammatory- and stemness-associated genes, and contain expanded population of tumor-associated leukocytes and stemness-enriched cancer cells.

Methods and Materials In this prospective phase 1/2 trial, 2-fraction BNCT with intravenous L-boronophenylalanine (L-BPA, 400 mg/kg) was administered at a 28-day interval. Before each fraction, fluorine-18-labeled-BPA-positron emission tomography was conducted to determine the tumor/normal tissue ratio of an individual tumor. The prescription dose (D80) of 20 Gy-Eq per fraction was selected to cover 80% of the gross tumor volume by using a dose volume histogram, while minimizing the volume of oral mucosa receiving >10 Gy-Eq. Tumor responses and adverse effects were assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0, respectively. Results Seventeen patients with a previous cumulative radiation dose of 63-165 Gy were enrolled. All but 2 participants received 2 fractions of BNCT. The median tumor/normal tissue ratio was 3.4 for the first fraction and 2.5 for the second, whereas the median D80 for the first and second fraction was 19.8 and 14.6 Gy-Eq, respectively. After a median follow-up period of 19.7 months (range, 5.2-52 mo), 6 participants exhibited a complete response and 6 exhibited a partial response. Regarding acute toxicity, 5 participants showed grade 3 mucositis and 1 participant showed grade 4 laryngeal edema and carotid hemorrhage. Regarding late toxicity, 2 participants exhibited grade 3 cranial neuropathy. Four of six participants (67%) receiving total D80 > 40 Gy-Eq had a complete response. Two-year overall survival was 47%. Two-year locoregional control was 28%. Conclusions Our results suggested that 2-fraction BNCT with adaptive dose prescription was effective and safe in locally recurrent H&N cancer.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy favorably improves oxygen transport to the hypoxic tumor tissues, thereby increasing the sensitivity of tumor cells to DOX. However, the use of HBO with DOX potentiates the ROS-mediated cytotoxicity of the drug toward normal tissues. In this work, we hypothesize that regional oxygen treatment by an implanted oxygen-generating depot may enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX against malignant tissues in a highly site-specific manner, without raising systemic oxygen levels. Upon implantation close to the tumor, the oxygen-generating depot reacts with the interstitial medium to produce oxygen in situ, effectively shrinking the hypoxic regions in the tumor tissues. Increasing the local availability of oxygen causes the cytotoxicity of DOX that is accumulated in the tumors to be significantly enhanced by the elevated production of ROS, ultimately allaying the hypoxia-induced DOX resistance in solid malignancies. Importantly, this enhancement of cytotoxicity is limited to the site of the tumors, and this feature of the system that is proposed herein is unique. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation analysis; Chemotherapy; Cytotoxicity; Drug products; Electric resistance; Histology; Tumors; Hyperbaric oxygen therapies; Induced resistance; Interstitial medium; Intracellular production; Malignant tissues; Oxygen transport; Reactive oxygen species; Solid malignancy; Oxygen; alginic acid; calcium ion; doxorubicin; oxygen; antineoplastic agent; CA9 protein, human; calcium chloride; calcium peroxide; carbonate dehydratase IX; catalase; doxorubicin; oxygen; peroxide; tumor antigen; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug pellet; fluorescence; human; human cell; hypoxia; induced resistance; mouse; nonhuman; oxygen therapy; animal; chemistry; drug effect; drug implant; drug resistance; drug screening; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; metabolism; nude mouse; pharmacology; positron emission tomography; procedures; tumor cell line; tumor hypoxia; Animals; Antigens, Neoplasm; Antineoplastic Agents; Calcium Chloride; Carbonic Anhydrase IX; Catalase; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin; Drug Implants; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Hyperbaric Oxygenation; Mice, Nude; Oxygen; Peroxides; Positron-Emission Tomography; Tumor Hypoxia; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84966440526

Analysis of the crystal CGL structures bound to galactose, galactosamine, and globotriose Gb3 indicated that each CGL can bind three ligands through a carbohydrate-binding motif involving an extensive histidine- and water-mediated hydrogen bond network. CGL binding to Gb3 is further enhanced by additional side-chain-mediated hydrogen bonds in each of the three ligand-binding sites. NMR titrations revealed that the three binding sites have distinct microscopic affinities toward galactose and galactosamine.

During chronic viral infection, immune-escape mutants on the preS2 region of LHBS (preS2-LHBS) are gain-of-function mutations that are linked to preneoplastic ground glass hepatocytes (GGHs) and early disease onset of hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we show that preS2-LHBS provoked calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and triggered stored-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The activation of SOCE increased ER and plasma membrane (PM) connections, which was linked by ER-resident stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1) protein and PM-resident calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1 (Orai1). Persistent activation of SOCE induced centrosome overduplication, aberrant multipolar division, chromosome aneuploidy, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft tumorigenesis in hepatocytes expressing preS2-LHBS. Chemical inhibitions of SOCE machinery and silencing of STIM1 significantly reduced centrosome numbers, multipolar division, and xenograft tumorigenesis induced by preS2-LHBS.

The antibodies of Aβ 1-28 (Aβ ab ) are used as the specific biorecognition element for Aβ42 that were conjugated on the surface of MNG. In the presence of magnetic nanoparticles on MNG, the electrode coating material, the biosensor can be quickly constructed, without requiring an electrode drying process, which reduce the analysis time and is convenient for proceeding to detection. The reusable biosensor with good reproducibility and stability was linear within the range from 5 pg mL -1 to 800 pg mL -1 , covering the cut-off level of Aβ42 and a detection limit of 5 pg mL -1 had been achieved.

However, existing nucleus extraction techniques are relatively inefficient and labor-intensive. Therefore, this study presents an innovative, microfluidics-based approach featuring optically-induced cell lysis (OICL) for nucleus extraction and collection in an automatic format. In comparison to previous micro-devices designed for nucleus extraction, the new OICL device designed herein is superior in terms of flexibility, selectivity, and efficiency. To facilitate this OICL module for continuous nucleus extraction, we further integrated an optically-induced dielectrophoresis (ODEP) module with the OICL device within the microfluidic chip. This on-chip integration circumvents the need for highly trained personnel and expensive, cumbersome equipment. Specifically, this microfluidic system automates four steps by 1) automatically focusing and transporting cells, 2) releasing the nuclei on the OICL module, 3) isolating the nuclei on the ODEP module, and 4) collecting the nuclei in the outlet chamber. The efficiency of cell membrane lysis and the ODEP nucleus separation was measured to be 78.04 ± 5.70% and 80.90 ± 5.98%, respectively, leading to an overall nucleus extraction efficiency of 58.21 ± 2.21%. These results demonstrate that this microfluidics-based system can successfully perform nucleus extraction, and the integrated platform is therefore promising in cell fusion technology with the goal of achieving genetic replication, or even animal cloning, in the near future. ?

Lower-limb peripheral arterial disease and hemodialysis (HD) vascular access stenosis are highly prevalent in HD patients; in particular, progressively narrowed vascular access and suboptimal dialysis blood flows are the major issues. In this paper, we propose a fractionalorder integrator (FOI) for indicating the differences in the risetiming and amplitudes of bilateral photoplethysmography (PPG) signals with the aim of improving HD healthcare. The area under the systolic peak ratio was used as an index to separate the patients without arterial stenosis from those with arterial stenosis; subsequently, info-gap decision making was conducted to evaluate risk levels in reference to the patients' health records and the degrees of stenosis. The experimental results indicated that in comparison with 1) the resistive index; 2) bilateral timing parameters; and 3) the hybrid intelligent method, our proposed screening model was more efficient in preventing complications of peripheral arterial stenosis and was easily implemented in an embedded system. ? 2015 IEEE.

Chitosan (CS) was conjugated with a copper chelator, D-penicillamine (D-pen), to obtain a CS-SS-D-pen conjugate through the formation of a disulfide bond. D-pen release from the conjugate was triggered by intracellular glutathione (GSH) via reducing biologically reversible disulfide bonds. Self-assembled CS-SS-D-pen nanoparticles were prepared through ionotropic gelation with tripolyphosphate and subsequently coated with hyaluronic acid (HA). The HA-coated CS-SS-D-pen NPs were reduced by GSH to release free D-pen and trigger ROS production via a series of reactions involving Cu(II)-catalyzed D-pen oxidation and H2O2 generation. DOX was loaded into the HA-coated CS-SS-D-pen NPs by a method involving the complexation of DOX with Cu(II) ions. The Cu(II)-DOX complex-loaded NPs exhibited redox-responsive release properties which accelerated DOX release at a higher glutathione level (10 mM). Confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the Cu(II)-DOX-loaded NPs effectively delivered DOX to human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT-29) by active targeting via HA-CD44 interactions. Intracellular ROS generated from the HA-coated CS-SS-D-pen NPs sensitized cancer cells to DOX-induced cytotoxicity. In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that Cu(II)-DOX-loaded NPs sensitized cells to DOX-induced cytotoxicity in CD44-overexpressing HT-29 cells compared to CD44 low-expressing HCT-15 cells. Statement of Significance In this manuscript, we develop a CD44-targetable loaded with nanoparticles Cu(II)-DOX complex. The nanoparticles exhibited redox-responsive properties, which triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and accelerated DOX release. The Cu(II)-DOX-loaded nanoparticle sensitized cells to DOX-induced cytotoxicity in CD44-overexpressing HT-29 cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the combination of CD44-targeting and redox-responsive property for triggering ROS production and subsequent drug release. We believe our findings would appeal to the readership of Acta Biomaterialia because the study bring new and interesting ideals in the development of specific and stimuli-responsive nanoparticles as drug carrier for cancer therapy. ? 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.",CD44-targeting; Chitosan; Doxorubicin; Hyaluronic acid; Nanoparticles,"chitosan; doxorubicin; glutathione; Hermes antigen; hyaluronic acid; hydrogen peroxide; nanoconjugate; nanoparticle; penicillamine; reactive oxygen metabolite; tripolyphosphate; disulfide; doxorubicin; fluorescein isothiocyanate; Hermes antigen; nanoparticle; penicillamine; reactive oxygen metabolite; Article; catalysis; cell viability; complex formation; confocal laser microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; cytotoxicity assay; disulfide bond; drug release; flow cytometry; gelation; HT 29 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; molecular interaction; nanofabrication; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; protein expression; Western blotting; cell death; cell survival; chemistry; drug effects; drug release; metabolism; molecular weight; oxidation reduction reaction; particle size; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; static electricity; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Antigens, CD44; Cell Death; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Chitosan; Disulfides; Doxorubicin; Drug Liberation; Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate; Glutathione; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Hydrogen Peroxide; Molecular Weight; Nanoparticles; Oxidation-Reduction; Particle Size; Penicillamine; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Reactive Oxygen Species; Static Electricity",2-s2.0-84958279976

It is closely associated with gastric diseases such as ulcer and inflammation. Recently, some H. pylori strains were found to express resistance to a family of antibiotics known as quinolones due to single-point mutations. Although traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and molecular diagnostic-based approaches can be used to determine the presence and abundance of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains, such processes are relatively expensive, labor-intensive, and require bulky and costly equipment. This study therefore reports an advanced diagnostic assay performed on an integrated microfluidic system for rapid detection of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori. The assay features three components: (1) nucleic acid extraction by specific probe-conjugated magnetic beads, (2) amplification of the target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments by using single-nucleotide-polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (SNP-PCR), and (3) optical detection of the PCR products. The device integrates several microfluidic components including micro-pumps, normally-closed micro-valves, and reaction chambers such that the entire diagnostic assay can be automatically executed on a single microfluidic system within one hour with detection limits of 100, 102, and 102 bacterial cells for H. pylori detection and two different SNP sites strains. Three PCR-based assays for determining presence of H. pylori infection and two DNA single-point mutation assays aimed at determining whether the infected strains were resistant to quinolone can be performed simultaneously on a single chip, suggesting that this microfluidic system could be a promising tool for rapid diagnosis of the presence of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V..",Antibiotic resistance detection; H. pylori; Microfluidic; Optical detection; SNP-PCR,"Antibiotics; Assays; Chains; Diagnosis; Fluidic devices; Microfluidics; Nucleic acids; Antibiotic resistance; H. pylori; Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori); Integrated microfluidic systems; Microfluidic components; Optical detection; Single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNP-PCR; Polymerase chain reaction; bacterial DNA; quinolone derivative; antibiotic resistance; drug effects; genetic procedures; genetics; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; human; isolation and purification; microbiology; microfluidics; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; Biosensing Techniques; DNA, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Microfluidics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quinolones",2-s2.0-84947967438

Anti-viral effects have previously been reported for extracts and specific substances derived from Spirulina, and here we show that this Spirulina cold water extract has low cellular toxicity, and is well-tolerated in animal models at one dose as high as 5,000 mg/kg, or 3,000 mg/kg/day for 14 successive days. Anti-flu efficacy studies revealed that the Spirulina extract inhibited viral plaque formation in a broad range of influenza viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant strains. Spirulina extract was found to act at an early stage of infection to reduce virus yields in cells and improve survival in influenza-infected mice, with inhibition of influenza hemagglutination identified as one of the mechanisms involved. Together, these results suggest that the cold water extract of Spirulina might serve as a safe and effective therapeutic agent to manage influenza outbreaks, and further clinical investigation may be warranted.",,antivirus agent; animal; cell survival; chemistry; dog; drug effects; isolation and purification; MDCK cell line; mouse; Orthomyxoviridae; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Spirulina; survival analysis; treatment outcome; viral plaque assay; virology; virus replication; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Cell Survival; Dogs; Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells; Mice; Orthomyxoviridae; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Spirulina; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Viral Plaque Assay; Virus Replication,2-s2.0-84963811915

The pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of prostate cancer includes the estimation of time activity curves (TACs), and thereby, the corresponding kinetic parameters (KPs), and plays a pivotal role in diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. In this paper, we endeavor to develop a blind source separation algorithm, namely convex-optimization-based KPs estimation (COKE) algorithm for PK analysis based on compartmental modeling of DCE-MRI data, for effective prostate tumor detection and its quantification. The COKE algorithm first identifies the best three representative pixels in the DCE-MRI data, corresponding to the plasma, fast-flow, and slow-flow TACs, respectively. The estimation accuracy of the flux rate constants (FRCs) of the fast-flow and slow-flow TACs directly affects the estimation accuracy of the KPs that provide the cancer and normal tissue distribution maps in the prostate region. The COKE algorithm wisely exploits the matrix structure (Toeplitz, lower triangular, and exponential decay) of the original nonconvex FRCs estimation problem, and reformulates it into two convex optimization problems that can reliably estimate the FRCs. After estimation of the FRCs, the KPs can be effectively estimated by solving a pixel-wise constrained curve-fitting (convex) problem. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed COKE algorithm. The COKE algorithm is also evaluated with DCE-MRI data of four different patients with prostate cancer and the obtained results are consistent with clinical observations. ? 1964-2012 IEEE.",Cancer diagnosis; Compartmental model; Convex Optimization; DCE-MRI; Kinetic parameters; Pharmacokinetic analysis; Prostate cancer; Time activity curve; Tumor characterization,"Algorithms; Blind source separation; Convex optimization; Curve fitting; Diagnosis; Diseases; Kinetic parameters; Magnetic resonance imaging; Optimization; Pharmacokinetics; Pixels; Positron emission tomography; Rate constants; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Tumors; Urology; Cancer diagnosis; Compartmental model; DCE-MRI; Pharmacokinetic analysis; Prostate cancers; Time-activity curves; Tumor characterization; Parameter estimation; algorithm; cancer diagnosis; compartment model; Conference Paper; contrast enhancement; convex optimizationbased kp estimation; dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; human; male; measurement accuracy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pharmacokinetics; prostate cancer; simulation; tissue distribution; biological model; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; prostate tumor; contrast medium; Algorithms; Contrast Media; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Biological; Prostatic Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84963544860

Advantages include reduced immune reactivity, especially if derived from the same host, stability in biologic fluids, and ability to target uptake. Those from mesenchymal stem cells appear to be intrinsically therapeutic, while those from cancer cells promote tumor progression. Therapeutic proteins can be loaded into vesicles by overexpression in the donor cell, with oligomerization and membrane sequences increasing their loading. Examples of protein delivery for therapeutic benefit in pre-clinical models include delivery of: catalase for Parkinson’s disease to reduce oxidative stress and thus help neurons to survive; prodrug activating enzymes which can convert a prodrug which crosses the blood–brain barrier into a toxic chemotherapeutic drug for schwannomas and gliomas; and the apoptosis-inducing enzyme, caspase-1 under a Schwann cell specific promoter for schwannoma.

The proposed radar chip comprises three major components: a digital-to-time converter (DTC), a transmitter, and a receiver. The all-digital standard cell-based DTC achieves a timing resolution of 10 ps on a 100-ns time scale, supporting a range-gated sensing process. The transmitter is composed of a digital pulse generator. The receiver comprises a direct-sampling passive frontend for achieving high linearity, an integrator for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and a successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter for signal quantization. A fully integrated CMOS impulse radar chip was fabricated using 65-nm CMOS technology, and the total power consumption is 21 mW. In the backend, a real-time digital signal-processing platform captures human respiratory waveforms via the radar chip and processes the waveforms by applying a human respiratory feature extraction algorithm. Furthermore, a clinical trial was conducted for establishing a new diagnosis workflow for identifying respiratory diseases by the proposed wireless sensor system. The proposed system was validated by applying an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system and support vector machine algorithm to the clinical trial results. These algorithms confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed system in diagnosing respiratory diseases. ? 2016 IEEE.",Biomedical applications; CMOS; digital signal processing (DSP); radar systems; Sensors,Algorithms; Analog to digital conversion; CMOS integrated circuits; Digital signal processing; Extraction; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Inference engines; Pulmonary diseases; Pulse generators; Quantization (signal); Radar; Radar signal processing; Radar systems; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Signal to noise ratio; Transmitters; Adaptive network based fuzzy inference system; Digital pulse generators; Feature extraction algorithms; Real-time digital signal processing; Successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter; Support vector machine algorithm; Total power consumption; Wireless sensor system; Diagnosis,2-s2.0-84960540662

However, how the islet remodeling influences the pancreatic environment and the associated neurovascular networks is largely unknown. The lack of information is primarily due to the difficulty of global visualization of the hyperplasic islet (>200 μm) and the neurovascular environment with high definition.Methods:We modulated the pancreatic optical property to achieve 3-dimensional (3-D) whole-islet histology and to integrate transmitted light microscopy (which provides the ground-truth tissue information) with confocal fluorescence imaging. The new optical and imaging conditions were used to globally examine the hyperplastic islets of the young (2 months) obese db/db and ob/ob mice, which otherwise cannot be easily portrayed by the standard microtome-based histology. The voxel-based islet micrographs were digitally processed for stereo projection and qualitative and quantitative analyses of the islet tissue networks.Results:Paired staining and imaging of the pancreatic islets, ducts and neurovascular networks reveal the unexpected formation of the 'neuro-insular-ductal complex' in the young obese mice. The complex consists of the peri- and/or intra-islet ducts and prominent peri-ductal sympathetic nerves; the latter contributes to a marked increase in islet sympathetic innervation. In vascular characterization, we identify a decreased perivascular density of the ob/ob islet pericytes, which adapt to ensheathing the dilated microvessels with hypertrophic processes.Conclusions:Modulation of pancreatic optical property enables 3-D panoramic examination of islets in the young hyperphagic mice to reveal the formation of the islet-duct complex and neurovascular remodeling. On the basis of the morphological proximity of the remodeled tissue networks, we propose a reactive islet microenvironment consisting of the endocrine cells, ductal epithelium and neurovascular tissues in response to the metabolic challenge that is experienced early in life. ? 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"animal experiment; animal model; Article; confocal microscopy; controlled study; density; fluorescence imaging; fluorescence microscopy; histopathology; hyperphagia; hyperplasia; image analysis; image reconstruction; microtome; microvasculature; mouse; neurovascular remodeling; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas islet; pancreas islet transplantation; pericyte; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; sympathetic innervation; sympathetic nerve; three dimensional imaging; vascular remodeling; adrenergic system; animal; innervation; insulin resistance; metabolism; mouse mutant; nerve cell plasticity; obesity; pancreas islet; pathology; vascularization; Animals; Hyperphagia; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Insulin Resistance; Islets of Langerhans; Mice; Mice, Obese; Neuronal Plasticity; Obesity; Sympathetic Nervous System",2-s2.0-84949034587

In this work, electromagnetic thermotherapy was successfully developed and employed in vitro and in vivo to treat livers that had been lacerated. Briefly, a new hemostasis plug was integrated with an electromagnetic thermotherapy system (ETS) to perform surgery on lacerated livers. The high-frequency, alternating electromagnetic field (EMF) was generated by the ETS and was shown to induce a pre-set temperature increase within the hemostasis plug embedded in the target tissue. In order to prevent overheating and maintain a constant hemostasis temperature, a temperature feedback control system was utilized. The effect of the intensity of the EMF on the heating capacity of the ETS-hemostasis system was first explored. Furthermore, the relationship between the coagulation zone and operating temperature were investigated in vitro. By utilizing the temperature feedback control system, the hemostasis plug could be heated to a specific temperature for efficient hemostasis. With this approach, the optimal treatment temperature and time were investigated for liver laceration. Lacerated livers from New Zealand white rabbits were successfully treated with the hemostasis plug and ETS within a short period of time. When compared with the traditional perihepatic packing approach, the volume of blood loss from liver laceration surgeries treated by ETS has been dramatically reduced by 83%, suggesting a high therapeutic potential for this system. ? 2015, Biomedical Engineering Society.",Electromagnetic thermotherapy; Hemostasis; Laceration,"Adaptive control systems; Control systems; Electromagnetic fields; Feedback control; Surgery; Alternating electromagnetic field; Electromagnetic thermotherapy; Hemostasis; Human health concerns; Laceration; New Zealand White rabbit; Operating temperature; Therapeutic potentials; Physical therapy; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bleeding; controlled study; electromagnetic field; electromagnetic thermotherapy; electromagnetic thermotherapy system; hemostasis; hemostasis plug; hyperthermic therapy; in vitro study; in vivo study; intermethod comparison; liver injury; liver surgery; New Zealand White (rabbit); nonhuman; priority journal; scalpel; surgical equipment; temperature; temperature controller; temperature feedback control system; thermocoagulation; vascular equipment; animal; Blood Loss, Surgical; electromagnetism; hemostasis; Lacerations; liver; rabbits and hares; thermotherapy; Animals; Blood Loss, Surgical; Electromagnetic Fields; Hemostasis, Surgical; Hyperthermia, Induced; Lacerations; Liver; Rabbits",2-s2.0-84936805309

In this study, we identify that the specific lysine residue 447 (K447) of HSPA5 could be modified with polyubiquitin for subsequent degradation through the ubiquitin proteasomal system, leading to the suppression of cell migration and invasion of breast cancer. We further found that GP78, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacted with the C-terminal region of HSPA5 and mediated HSPA5 ubiquitination and degradation. Knock down of GP78 significantly increased the expression of HSPA5 and enhanced migration/invasive ability of breast cancer cells. Knock down of histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) increased the acetylation of HSPA5 at lysine residues 353 (K353) and reduced GP78-mediated ubiquitination of HSPA5 at K447 and then increased cell migration/invasion. In addition, we demonstrate that E3 ubiquitin ligase GP78 preferentially binds to deacetylated HSPA5. Notably, the expression levels of GP78 inversely correlated with HSPA5 levels in breast cancer patients. Patients with low GP78 expression significantly correlated with invasiveness of breast cancer, advanced tumor stages and poor clinical outcome. Taken together, our results provide new mechanistic insights into the understanding that deacetylation of HSPA5 by HDAC6 facilitates GP78-mediated HSPA5 ubiquitination and suggest that post-translational regulation of HSPA5 protein is critical for HSPA5-mediated metastatic properties of breast cancer. ? 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

As proof-of-concept, we identified a labile Zn-site in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein and showed that the antialcoholism drug, disulfiram, could inhibit HCV replication to a similar extent as the clinically used antiviral agent, ribavirin. The discovery of a novel viral target and a new role for disulfiram in inhibiting HCV replication will enhance the therapeutic armamentarium against HCV.

To enable controlled drug release and enhance the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-crossing efficiency for brain tumor therapy, a new dual-targeting magnetic polydiacetylene nanocarriers (PDNCs) delivery system modified with lactoferrin (Lf) is developed. The PDNCs are synthesized using the ultraviolet (UV) cross-linkable 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) monomers through spontaneous assembling onto the surface of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles to form micelles-polymerized structures. The results demonstrate that PDNCs will reduce the drug leakage and further control the drug release, and display self-responsive fluorescence upon intracellular uptake for cell trafficking and imaging-guided tumor treatment. The magnetic Lf-modified PDNCs with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-targeting ability can enhance the transportation of the PDNCs across the BBB for tracking and targeting gliomas. An enhanced therapeutic efficiency can be obtained using Lf-Cur (Curcumin)-PDNCs by improving the retention time of the encapsulated Cur and producing fourfold higher Cur amounts in the brain compared to free Cur. Animal studies also confirm that Lf targeting and controlled release act synergistically to significantly suppress tumors in orthotopic brain-bearing rats. ? 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been found to effectively reduce the impact of long-range scatterings induced by the external charges. Yet, demonstrations of scalable device applications using the SAMs technique remains missing due to the difficulties in the device fabrication arising from the strong surface tension of the modified dielectric environment. Here, we use patterned SAM arrays to build graphene electronic devices with transport channels confined on the modified areas. For high-mobility applications, both rigid and flexible radio-frequency graphene field-effect transistors (G-FETs) were demonstrated, with extrinsic cutoff frequency and maximum oscillation frequency enhanced by a factor of ~2 on SiO2/Si substrates. For high sensitivity applications, G-FETs were functionalized by monoclonal antibodies specific to cancer biomarker chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, enabling its detection at a concentration of 0.01fM, five orders of magnitude lower than that detectable by a conventional colorimetric assay.

We found that (GA)15 with 15 repeats fibrillates rapidly and ultimately forms flat, ribbon-type fibrils evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The fibrils are capable of amyloid dye binding and contain a characteristic cross-β sheet structure, as revealed by x-ray scattering.

The exact etiology of endometriosis is still unknown. It has, however, been shown that there are higher numbers of Escherichia coli in menstrual blood, and higher endotoxin levels in menstrual fluid, as well as, in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether lower genital tract infections could increase the risk of endometriosis. We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance database to conduct a population-based cohort study. We included patients diagnosed with inflammatory diseases of the cervix, vagina, and vulva, and a control group comprising patients matched by age, sex, and comorbidities but without inflammatory diseases of the cervix, vagina, or vulva. A total of 79,512 patients were included in the inflammatory disease group and an equal number of control individuals were selected. The incidence of endometriosis (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.91-2.12; P<0.001) was higher among patients than controls. Cox proportional hazards models showed that irrespective of comorbidities, lower genital tract infection was an independent risk factor for endometriosis. Patients with lower genital tract infections exhibit a substantially higher risk for developing endometriosis. Copyright ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We combined the anticancer drug gemcitabine (Gem) with recombinant lipoprotein-based immunotherapy (rlipo-E7m/CpG) to treat advanced cancer. Mice bearing huge solid tumors (≧ 12?mm in diameter) or orthotopic cervical cancer were treated with a therapeutic regimen consisting of rlipo-E7m/CpG and Gem. In addition, tumor-infiltrating immune cells were quantified by flow cytometry following the chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. We observed the eradication of huge tumors following the administration of Gem on days 21, 24, and 27 or following rlipo-E7m/CpG therapy on day 30 post-tumor implantation. The combination therapy substantially reduced the number of immunosuppressive cells (CD11b+Gr-1+, CD11b+F4/80+, and CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) and increased the number of tumor-infiltrating antigen-specific CD8+T cells compared to Gem or rlipo-E7m/CpG monotherapy. Interestingly, the administration of Gem and rlipo-E7m/CpG reduced the quantity of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-expressing antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the regressing tumors. These findings demonstrated that Gem enhances the eradication of huge tumors by inhibiting a broad range of immunosuppressive cells when combined with immunotherapy. Based on the promising results from this animal study, Gem chemotherapy combined with recombinant lipoimmunogen-based immunotherapy represents a feasible approach for cancer therapy. ? 2016, ?

Disruption of endothelial barrier function by bacterial endotoxins, cytokines or growth factors results in inflammation and vascular damage leading to vascular diseases. We have identified 5-methoxytryptophan (5-MTP) as an anti-inflammatory factor by metabolomic analysis of conditioned medium of human fibroblasts. Here we postulated that endothelial cells release 5-MTP to protect the barrier function. Conditioned medium of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) prevented endothelial hyperpermeability and VE-cadherin downregulation induced by VEGF, LPS and cytokines. We analyzed the metabolomic profile of HUVEC conditioned medium and detected 5-MTP but not melatonin, serotonin or their catabolites, which was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Addition of synthetic pure 5-MTP preserved VE-cadherin and maintained barrier function despite challenge with pro-inflammatory mediators. Tryptophan hydroxylase-1, an enzyme required for 5-MTP biosynthesis, was downregulated in HUVECs by pro-inflammatory mediators and it was accompanied by reduction of 5-MTP. 5-MTP protected VE-cadherin and prevented endothelial hyperpermeability by blocking p38 MAPK activation. A chemical inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190, exhibited a similar protective effect as 5-MTP. To determine whether 5- MTP prevents vascular hyperpermeability in vivo, we evaluated the effect of 5-MTP administration on LPS-induced murine microvascular permeability with Evans blue. 5-MTP significantly prevented Evans blue dye leakage. Our findings indicate that 5-MTP is a new class of endothelium-derived molecules which protects endothelial barrier function by blocking p38 MAPK. ?2016 Chu et al.

Materials and Methods A total of 56 patients were enrolled. Tumors were segmented on pretreatment PET images using the adaptive threshold. Twelve different texture parameters were computed: standard uptake value (SUV) entropy, uniformity, entropy, dissimilarity, homogeneity, coarseness, busyness, contrast, complexity, grey-level nonuniformity, zone-size nonuniformity, and high grey-level large zone emphasis. Comparisons of PET/HCT and PET/ACT were performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Bland-Altman analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify the parameters significantly associated with disease-specific survival (DSS). A fixed threshold at 45% of the maximum SUV (T45) was used for validation. Results SUV maximum and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were significantly higher in PET/ACT. However, texture parameters obtained with PET/ACT and PET/HCT showed a high degree of agreement. The lowest levels of variation between the two modalities were observed for SUV entropy (9.7%) and entropy (9.8%). SUV entropy, entropy, and coarseness from both PET/ACT and PET/HCT were significantly associated with DSS. Validation analyses using T45 confirmed the usefulness of SUV entropy and entropy in both PET/HCT and PET/ACT for the prediction of DSS, but only coarseness from PET/ACT achieved the statistical significance threshold. Conclusions Our results indicate that 1) texture parameters from PET/ACT are clinically useful in the prediction of survival in NSCLC patients and 2) SUV entropy and entropy are robust to attenuation correction methods.",,"adult; aged; analytical parameters; Article; attenuation; busyness; cancer staging; cancer survival; coarseness; computer assisted tomography; contrast; controlled study; disease specific survival; dissimilarity; entropy; female; glycolysis; grey level nonuniformity; high grey level large zone emphasis; homogeneity; human; image analysis; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; parameters; positron emission tomography; receiver operating characteristic; respiration averaged computed tomography; spiral computer assisted tomography; standard uptake value entropy; survival prediction; texture parameter; total lesion glycolysis; uniformity; zone size nonuniformity; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; diagnostic imaging; Kaplan Meier method; lung; Lung Neoplasms; middle aged; mortality; positron emission tomography; procedures; prognosis; proportional hazards model; survival analysis; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Survival Analysis; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84961262750

Tissue engineering combined with stem cell therapy is a potential effective treatment for periodontal bone loss. Amniotic membrane (AM) is a potential scaffold enriched with multiple growth factors. It has the effects of anti-inflammation, antiangiogenesis, and immunosuppression. Herein, we used adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and an AM co-cultured system to study bone regeneration in a rat periodontal defect model in vivo. Methods: Human ADSCs were isolated from the infrapatellar fat pad, and characterized by flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and multipotent differentiation assays. The co-culture system was applied in the periodontal two-wall osseous defect in a rat model, and computed tomography was used to measure the effect. Results: Human ADSCs isolated from the infrapatellar fat pad showed spindle-like morphology. Flow cytometry results demonstrated that ADSCs expressed a high level of CD90 and CD105, but not CD31, CD34, and CD45. ADSCs strongly expressed stemness genes, including SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, and KLF4 on different passages. Furthermore, ADSCs were able to differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic cells. In the periodontal osseous defect rat model, ADSCs and the AM co-culture system significantly increased bone regeneration. Conclusion: This study provides the basis for using ADSCs with an AM co-culture system as stem cell therapy and scaffold transplantation in clinical periodontology. ? 2015 .",Adipose-derived stem cell; Amniotic membrane; Bone regeneration; Periodontal defect animal model,"CD34 antigen; endoglin; kruppel like factor 4; octamer transcription factor 4; Thy 1 antigen; transcription factor NANOG; transcription factor Sox2; biological marker; adipose derived stem cell; amnion; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bone regeneration; cell differentiation; cell isolation; cell structure; coculture; cytoplasm; human; human cell; nonhuman; periodontal disease; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; stem cell transplantation; tooth extraction; adipose tissue; amnion; animal; cell culture; coculture; cytology; disease model; male; Periodontal Diseases; procedures; Sprague Dawley rat; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; tissue engineering; Adipose Tissue; Amnion; Animals; Biomarkers; Bone Regeneration; Cells, Cultured; Coculture Techniques; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Male; Periodontal Diseases; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells; Tissue Engineering",2-s2.0-84960383911

The design strategy relies on the use of Ti4+-immobilized polydopamine (PDA) coated reduced graphene oxide (rGO@PDA-Ti4+) that serves as an attractive platform to bind riboflavin 5′-monophosphate molecules (FMNs) through ion-pair interactions between phosphate groups and Ti4+. The as-prepared rGO@PDA-Ti4+-FMNs (nanosensor), fluoresce only weakly due to the ineffective F?rster resonance energy transfer between the FMNs and rGO@PDA-Ti4+. The experimental findings revealed that the microwave-assisted interaction of the nanosensor with α-, β-casein, ovalbumin, human serum, non-fat milk, egg white, and living cells (all containing Ps) releases FMNs (due to the high formation constant between phosphate groups and Ti4+), leading to an excellent fluorescence 'turn-on' response. The fluorescence spectroscopy, confocal microscopy, and MALDI-TOF MS spectrometry were used to detect Ps both qualitatively and quantitatively. Under the optimized conditions, the nanosensor showed a detection limit of ca. 118.5, 28.9, and 54.8 nM for the tryptic digests of α-, β-casein and ovalbumin, respectively. Furthermore, the standard addition method was used as a bench-mark proof for phosphopeptide quantification in egg white samples. We postulate that the present quantitative assay for Ps holds tremendous potential and may pave the way to disease diagnostics in the near future. ?

This close relationship with inflammation suggests that a re-examination of the immune system’s role in strokes is necessary. We used a systems biology approach to investigate the role of immune-related functions via their interactions with other molecular functions in early cardioembolic stroke. Based on protein interaction models and on microarray data from the blood of stroke subjects and healthy controls, networks were constructed to delineate molecular interactions at four early stages (pre-stroke, 3 h, 5 h and 24 h after stroke onset) of cardioembolic stroke. A comparative analysis of functional networks identified interactions of immune-related functions with other molecular functions, including growth factors, neuro/hormone and housekeeping functions. These provide a potential pathomechanism for early stroke pathophysiology. In addition, several potential targets of miRNA and methylation regulations were derived based on basal level changes observed in the core networks and literature. The results provide a more comprehensive understanding of stroke progression mechanisms from an immune perspective and shed light on acute stroke treatments. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Cardioembolic stroke; Core network; Functional network; Immune system; Inflammation; Systems biology,algorithm; Article; cardioembolic stroke; clinical article; computer network; controlled study; data mining; down regulation; gene expression; human; immunopathology; mathematical model; microarray analysis; protein function; protein protein interaction; upregulation; case control study; cerebrovascular accident; coronary artery disease; DNA methylation; embolism; genetics; immunology; inflammation; metabolism; protein protein interaction; systems biology; microRNA; protein binding; Case-Control Studies; Coronary Disease; DNA Methylation; Embolism; Humans; Inflammation; MicroRNAs; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Maps; Stroke; Systems Biology,2-s2.0-84959342746

Epigenetics may be defined as the mechanisms that lead to heritable changes in gene function and without affecting the sequence of genome. These mechanisms explain how individuals with the same genotype produce phenotypic differences in response to environmental stimuli. Recently, with the accumulation of high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, a key goal of systems biology is to construct networks for different cellular levels to explore whole cellular mechanisms. At present, there is no satisfactory method to construct an integrated genetic and epigenetic cellular network (IGECN), which combines NGS omics data with gene regulatory networks (GRNs), microRNAs (miRNAs) regulatory networks, protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs), and epigenetic regulatory networks of methylation using high-throughput NGS data. Results: We investigated different kinds of NGS omics data to develop a systems biology method to construct an integrated cellular network based on three coupling models that describe genetic regulatory networks, protein-protein interaction networks, microRNA (miRNA) regulatory networks, and methylation regulation. The proposed method was applied to construct IGECNs of gastric cancer and the human immune response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, to elucidate human defense response mechanisms. We successfully constructed an IGECN and validated it by using evidence from literature search. The integration of NGS omics data related to transcription regulation, protein-protein interactions, and miRNA and methylation regulation has more predictive power than independent datasets. We found that dysregulation of MIR7 contributes to the initiation and progression of inflammation-induced gastric cancer; dysregulation of MIR9 contributes to HIV-1 infection to hijack CD4+ T cells through dysfunction of the immune and hormone pathways; dysregulation of MIR139-5p, MIRLET7i, and MIR10a contributes to the HIV-1 integration/replication stage; dysregulation of MIR101, MIR141, and MIR152 contributes to the HIV-1 virus assembly and budding mechanisms; dysregulation of MIR302a contributes to not only microvesicle-mediated transfer of miRNAs but also dysfunction of NF-ΚB signaling pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis. Conclusion: The coupling dynamic systems of the whole IGECN can allow us to investigate genetic and epigenetic cellular mechanisms via omics data and big database mining, and are useful for further experiments in the field of systems and synthetic biology. ? 2016 Chen and Li.",Epigenetic cellular mechanisms; Epigenetic regulation; HIV; Integrated genetic and epigenetic cellular network; MiRNA; Next-generation sequencing data,"microRNA; biology; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cells; cytology; gene regulatory network; genetic epigenesis; genetics; high throughput sequencing; host pathogen interaction; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; liver tumor; metabolism; pathology; physiology; procedures; protein protein interaction; stomach tumor; virology; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cells; Computational Biology; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Regulatory Networks; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; HIV-1; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Protein Interaction Maps; Stomach Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84958259693

While TDP-43 mutations have been identified in ALS patients, how these mutations are linked to ALS remains unclear. Here we examined the biophysical properties of six ALS-linked TDP-43 mutants and found that one of the mutants, D169G, had higher thermal stability than wild-type TDP-43 and that it was cleaved by caspase 3 more efficiently, producing increased levels of the C-terminal 35 kD fragments (TDP-35) in vitro and in neuroblastoma cells. The crystal structure of the TDP-43 RRM1 domain containing the D169G mutation in complex with DNA along with molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the D169G mutation induces a local conformational change in a β turn and increases the hydrophobic interactions in the RRM1 core, thus enhancing the thermal stability of the RRM1 domain. Our results provide the first crystal structure of TDP-43 containing a disease-linked D169G mutation and a disease-related mechanism showing that D169G mutant is more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by caspase 3 into the pathogenic C-terminal 35-kD fragments due to its increased stability in the RRM1 domain.

Different imaging modalities can combine with a variety of therapeutic moieties in theranostic nanoagents. In this study, a multi-functionalized, integrated theranostic nanoagent based on folate-conjugated reducible polyethylenimine passivated carbon dots (fc-rPEI-Cdots) is developed and characterized. These nanoagents emit visible blue photoluminescence under 360 nm excitation and can encapsulate multiple siRNAs (EGFR and cyclin B1) followed by releasing them in intracellular reductive environment. In vitro cell culture study demonstrates that fc-rPEI-Cdots is a highly biocompatible material and a good siRNA gene delivery carrier for targeted lung cancer treatment. Moreover, fc-rPEI-Cdots/pooled siRNAs can be selectively accumulated in lung cancer cells through receptor mediated endocytosis, resulting in better gene silencing and anti-cancer effect. Combining bioimaging of carbon dots, stimulus responsive property, gene silencing strategy, and active targeting motif, this multi-functionalized, integrated theranostic nanoagent may provide a useful tool and platform to benefit clinicians adjusting therapeutic strategy and administered drug dosage in real time response by monitoring the effect and tracking the development of carcinomatous tissues in diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.",,"biomaterial; carbon; folic acid; imine; nanoparticle; poly(ethylene imine); polyethylene derivative; small interfering RNA; animal; chemistry; disease model; gene expression; gene silencing; gene transfer; genetics; human; Lung Neoplasms; male; materials testing; molecular imaging; mouse; oxidation reduction reaction; particle size; reporter gene; theranostic nanomedicine; transgene; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Carbon; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Folic Acid; Gene Expression; Gene Silencing; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genes, Reporter; Humans; Imines; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Materials Testing; Mice; Molecular Imaging; Nanoparticles; Oxidation-Reduction; Particle Size; Polyethylenes; RNA, Small Interfering; Theranostic Nanomedicine; Transgenes",2-s2.0-84958279602

Most of these isotopes emit high-energy cascade gamma rays in addition to positron decay that can be detected and create a triple coincidence with annihilation photons. Triple coincidence is discarded in most scanners, however, the majority of the triple coincidence contains true photon pairs that can be recovered. In this study, we propose a strategy for recovering triple coincidence events to raise the sensitivity of PET imaging for non-pure positron emitters. To identify the true line of response (LOR) from a triple coincidence, a framework utilizing geometrical, energy and temporal information is proposed. The geometrical criterion is based on the assumption that the LOR with the largest radial offset among the three sub pairs of triple coincidences is least likely to be a true LOR. Then, a confidence time window is used to test the valid LOR among those within triple coincidence. Finally, a likelihood ratio discriminant rule based on the energy probability density distribution of cascade and annihilation gammas is established to identify the true LOR. An Inveon preclinical PET scanner was modeled with GATE (GEANT4 application for tomographic emission) Monte Carlo software. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method in terms of identification fraction, noise equivalent count rates (NECR), and image quality on various phantoms. With the inclusion of triple coincidence events using the proposed method, the NECR was found to increase from 11% to 26% and 19% to 29% for I-124 and Br-76, respectively, when 7.4-185 MBq of activity was used. Compared to the reconstructed images using double coincidence, this technique increased the SNR by 5.1-7.3% for I-124 and 9.3-10.3% for Br-76 within the activity range of 9.25-74 MBq, without compromising the spatial resolution or contrast. We conclude that the proposed method can improve the counting statistics of PET imaging for non-pure positron emitters and is ready to be implemented on current PET systems. ? 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",non-pure positron emitter; preclinical PET; triple coincidence,"Application programs; Gamma rays; Image processing; Photons; Positron emission tomography; Positrons; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Recovery; Scanning; Signal to noise ratio; Annihilation photons; Counting statistics; Geant4 application for tomographic emissions; Noise equivalent count rates; Positron emitters; Probability density distribution; Temporal information; triple coincidence; Electrons; bromine 76; ellipticine derivative; radioactive iodine; computed tomography scanner; computer simulation; devices; electron; gamma radiation; human; image processing; imaging phantom; Monte Carlo method; photon; positron emission tomography; procedures; software; Computer Simulation; Electrons; Ellipticines; Gamma Rays; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Iodine Radioisotopes; Monte Carlo Method; Phantoms, Imaging; Photons; Positron-Emission Tomography; Software; Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84959243928

There are several available forms of linear accelerator (LINAC)–based SRS, and the goal of the present study is to identify which of these techniques is best (as evaluated by dosimetric outcomes statistically) when the target is located adjacent to brainstem. We collected the records of 17 patients with lesions close to the brainstem who had previously been treated with single-fraction radiosurgery. In all, 5 different lesion catalogs were collected, and the patients were divided into 2 distance groups—1 consisting of 7 patients with a target-to-brainstem distance of less than 0.5?cm, and the other of 10 patients with a target-to-brainstem distance of ? 0.5 and &lt; 1?cm. Comparison was then made among the following 3 types of LINAC-based radiosurgery: dynamic conformal arcs (DCA), intensity-modulated radiosurgery (IMRS), and volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT). All techniques included multiple noncoplanar beams or arcs with or without intensity-modulated delivery. The volume of gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 0.2?cm3 to 21.9?cm3. Regarding the dose homogeneity index (HIICRU) and conformity index (CIICRU) were without significant difference between techniques statistically. However, the average CIICRU = 1.09 ± 0.56 achieved by VMAT was the best of the 3 techniques. Moreover, notable improvement in gradient index (GI) was observed when VMAT was used (0.74 ± 0.13), and this result was significantly better than those achieved by the 2 other techniques (p &lt; 0.05). For V4?Gy of brainstem, both VMAT (2.5%) and IMRS (2.7%) were significantly lower than DCA (4.9%), both at the p &lt; 0.05 level. Regarding V2?Gy of normal brain, VMAT plans had attained 6.4 ± 5%; this was significantly better (p &lt; 0.05) than either DCA or IMRS plans, at 9.2 ± 7% and 8.2 ± 6%, respectively. Owing to the multiple arc or beam planning designs of IMRS and VMAT, both of these techniques required higher MU delivery than DCA, with the averages being twice as high (p &lt; 0.05). If linear accelerator is only 1 modality can to establish for SRS treatment. Based on statistical evidence retrospectively, we recommend VMAT as the optimal technique for delivering treatment to tumors adjacent to brainstem. ? 2016 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists",Conformity index; Gradient index; Stereotactic radiosurgery; VMAT,"Article; brain stem tumor; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; dosimetry; female; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; linear accelerator; male; priority journal; stereotactic radiosurgery; tumor volume; volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy; Brain Neoplasms; brain stem; magnetic and electromagnetic equipment; organs at risk; pathology; procedures; radiosurgery; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; Brain Neoplasms; Brain Stem; Female; Humans; Male; Organs at Risk; Particle Accelerators; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated",2-s2.0-84990855010

Thus, an imaging system that can locate SLNs in operating rooms is desired. Many 2-D probe imaging systems and a freehand single-photon emission-computed tomography (fhSPECT) system have been proposed. However, 2-D probe imaging systems are affected by shine-through and shadowing effects. Here, we propose an alternative to 3-D imaging systems, i.e., a dual-photon emission computed tomography (DuPECT) system, which integrates both preoperative and intraoperative information to locate SLNs using cascade isotopes such as Se-75. The system consists of a LaBr3 -based probe and planar head, a collimation system, and a coincidence circuit. For each disintegration, the slat and parallel-hole collimator define a plane and a line, respectively, which represent the possible flight paths of each photon. SLNs can be located using the line-plane intersection. Here, the performance is evaluated using Monte Carlo software developed in our laboratory, integrated with SimSET and GATE software. A measurement study indicates that the randoms rate increases with increased initial activities, while the scatter rate is lower than 1.2 count/s for various activities. In a simulated imaging study, four injection sites and two LNs placed at various depths are minimally distinguishable. However, the LNs are clearly identifiable in the absence of injection sites. Our results indicate that the proposed three-dimensional imaging system has the potential to identify injection sites and various SLNs. However, difficulties with low sensitivity for LN detection, especially in the presence of activity from injection sites, and the choice of appropriate radioisotope must be overcome for its clinical usage. ? 1963-2012 IEEE.",Dual-photon emission computed tomography; DuPECT; probes; sentinel lymph nodes,Body fluids; Computerized tomography; Imaging systems; Particle beams; Photons; Probes; Reconfigurable hardware; Tomography; DuPECT; Early-stage breast cancer; Parallel hole collimators; Photon emissions; Sentinel lymph nodes; Simulation studies; Standard procedures; Three dimensional imaging systems; Single photon emission computed tomography,2-s2.0-84962662154

Here, we sought to investigate the predictive value of distinct MRI parameters for the detection of early DM. Between November 2010 and June 2011, a total of 51 newly diagnosed NPC patients were included. All of the study participants were followed until December 2014 at a single institution after completion of therapy. DM was defined as early when they were detected on pretreatment FDG-PET scans or within 6 months after initial diagnosis. The following parameters were tested for their ability to predict early DM: pretreatment FDG-PET standardized uptake value (SUV), MRI-derived AJCC tumor staging, tumor volume, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) values. The DCE-derived v e was defined as the volume fraction of the extravascular, extracellular space. Compared with patients without early DM, patients with early DM had higher SUV, tumor volume, DCE mean (median) v e, v e skewness, v e kurtosis, and the largest mean v e selected among sequential slices (P<0.05). No differences were identified when early DM were defined only according to the results of pretreatment FDG-PET. Among different quantitative DCE parameters, the mean v e had the highest area under curve (AUC, 0.765). However, the AUCs of SUV, tumor volume, mean v e, v e skewness, v e kurtosis, or the largest mean v e selected among the sequential slices did not differ significantly from one another (P=0.82). Taken together, our results suggest that DCE-derived v e may be a useful parameter in combination with SUV and tumor volume for predicting early DM. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI may be complementary to FDG-PET for selecting the most appropriate treatment approach in NPC patients. Copyright ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Here, we show that Astragalus membranaceus (Fischer) Bge. var. mongolicus (Bge.) Hsiao (AM), a traditional Chinese medicine, can inhibit tumor growth in vivo and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. The antitumor effect of AM was assessed on the subcutaneous tumors of human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 grafted into nude mice. The mice were treated with either water or 500 mg/kg AM once per day before being sacrificed for extraction of tumors, which were then subjected to microarray expression profiling. The gene expression of the extraction was then profiled using microarray analysis. The identified genes differentially expressed between treated mice and controls reveal that administration of AM suppresses chromosome organization, histone modification and regulation of macromolecule metabolic process.

However, the markers currently used for isolation of CSCs are often not selective enough to enrich CSCs for the study of this special cell population.

Several lines of evidence have suggested that alterations in chromatin remodeling components contribute to cancer initiation and progression. In this study, we identified SMARCD1 (SWI/SNF-related, matrixassociated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily d, member 1) as a novel target gene of miR-7. miR-7 expression reduced SMARCD1 protein expression in lung cancer cell lines. We used luciferase reporters carrying wild type or mutated 3'UTR of SMARCD1 and found that miR-7 blocked SMARCD1 expression by binding to two seed regions in the 3'UTR of SMARCD1 and down-regulated SMARCD1 mRNA expression. Additionally, upon chemotherapy drug treatment, miR-7 downregulated p53-dependent apoptosis-related gene BAX (BCL2- associatedXprotein) and p21 expression by interfering with the interaction between SMARCD1 and p53, thereby reducing caspase3 cleavage and the downstream apoptosis cascades. We found that although SMARCD1 sensitized lung cancer cells to chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis, miR-7 enhanced the drug resistance potential of lung cancer cells against chemotherapy drugs. SMARCD1 was down-regulated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, andSMARCD1and miR-7 expression levels were negatively correlated in clinical samples. Our investigation into the involvement of the EGFR-regulated microRNA pathway in the SWI/ SNF chromatin remodeling complex suggests that EGFRmediated miR-7 suppresses the coupling of the chromatin remodeling factor SMARCD1 with p53, resulting in increased chemo-resistance of lung cancer cells. ? 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Biological organs; Cell culture; Cell death; Chemotherapy; Chromosomes; Cytology; Diseases; Drug products; Drug therapy; Gene expression; Genes; Proteins; RNA; Adenocarcinoma cells; Apoptosis-related genes; Chromatin remodeling; Chromatin remodeling complex; Chromatin remodeling factors; Epidermal growth factor receptors; Non small cell lung cancer; Protein expressions; Cells; caspase 3; cell protein; cisplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor; luciferase; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 7; protein Bax; protein p21; protein p53; SMARCD1 protein; unclassified drug; chromatin; microRNA; MIRN7 microRNA, human; protein binding; protein p53; SMARCD1 protein, human; TP53 protein, human; transcription factor; 3' untranslated region; apoptosis; Article; BAX gene; cancer resistance; chromatin assembly and disassembly; controlled study; down regulation; gene expression; gene interaction; human; human cell; lung cancer cell line; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; regulatory mechanism; chromatin; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; pathophysiology; tumor cell line; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Chromatin; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Protein Binding; Transcription Factors; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",2-s2.0-84959017435

SO2 can be removed almost completely. Sulfur can be recovered as solid after cooling the sulfur vapor. The DeSO2 rate increases with SO2 concentration and also with O2 concentration. Highest DeSO2 rate occurs at around 170°C. A novel technology of promoted SO2 decomposition (PSD) is thus established.

However, recognition of metabolites or potential biomarkers closely related to either particular clinical symptoms or prognosis has been difficult. The current study aims to identify potential biomarkers of functional dyspepsia (FD) by a new strategy that combined hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)-based metabonomics techniques and an integrative multi-objective optimization (LPIMO) method. First, clinical symptoms of FD were evaluated using the Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI), and plasma metabolic profiles were measured by 1H NMR. Correlations between the key metabolites and the NDI scores were calculated. Then, LPIMO was developed to identify a multi-biomarker panel by maximizing diagnostic ability and correlation with the NDI score. Finally, a KEGG database search elicited the metabolic pathways in which the potential biomarkers are involved. The results showed that glutamine, alanine, proline, HDL, β-glucose, α-glucose and LDL/VLDL levels were significantly altered in FD patients. Among them, phosphatidycholine (PtdCho) and leucine/isoleucine (Leu/Ile) were positively and negatively correlated with the NDI Symptom Index (NDSI) respectively.

To improve bioavailability and increase potency of tangeretin, its derivative, 5-acetyloxy-6,7,8,4′-tetramethoxyflavone (5-AcTMF), has been synthesized and shown potent inhibition of proliferation activity against human breast and leukemia cancer cell lines. In this study, we have further investigated the anticancer effects of 5-AcTMF on CL1-5 non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that 5-AcTMF effectively inhibited cancer cell proliferation, induced G2/M-phase arrest associated with cdc2 and CDC25c and increased in the apoptotic cells associated with caspase activation, down regulation of Bcl-2, XIAP and Survivn, inducing release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. We also found that 5-AcTMF treatment of CL1-5 activated autophagy, indicated by triggered autophagosome formation and increased LC3-II levels and formation of LC3 puncta. Moreover, we also found that 5-AcTMF lowered phophoatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Over-expression of AKT by AKT cDNA transfection decreased 5-AcTMF mediated apoptosis and autophagy, supporting the induction of apoptosis and autophagy by inhibition of AKT pathway. In an animal study, 5-AcTMF effectively delayed tumor growth in a nude mouse model of CL1-5 xenografts without observed adverse effect. Immunohistochemistry Analysis indicated that 5-AcTMF induced CL1-5 cell apoptosis and autophagy in vivo. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 5-AcTMF is a novel small molecule agent that can inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation, and induce G(2)/M phase arrest and via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and autophagy. ? 2016, 2016 ?

As an early-warning design, a wireless assistive technology using an integrated flexible sensor and virtual alarm unit was developed to detect blood leakage during dialysis therapies. The flexible sensor was designed using a screen print technique with printing electronic circuits on a plastic substrate. A self-organising algorithm was used to design a virtual alarm unit, consisting of a virtual direct current grid and a virtual alarm driver.

The application of assessment tools shifted from a single scale to a package of tools with muti-dimensions and multiple assessing methods. Based onsuch findings, we recommend toinclude the experience of internet users as the foundational concepts for understanding the phenomenon of internet addiction, and propose a conceptual model to validate its constructs and formation process.

Rapid advances in biological science have led to the creation of novel electrical circuits and signal processing methods and the development of tools for diagnosing and treating human diseases. Many biomedical engineering researchers have developed novel tools designed to tackle specific medical conditions. The instruments used represent an interface between biology and electronics. These interfaces enable biological phenomena to be quantified and characterized, thus allowing the biological processes underlying them to be elucidated. A typical interface comprises a sensor or electrode for detecting some biological parameter, the signals from which are then amplified and converted into a digital form. These digital data can be processed by hardware or transferred to a personal computer for closed-loop control, long-term storage, and more precise signal processing. The guidelines for such signal processing algorithms require low complexity, short latency, high sensitivity, and accurate characterization. Microprocessors are used to make the design of an electronic algorithm flexible and adaptable. Depending on the requirements of a specific application, the data can be transferred through wired or wireless links. Communication can be achieved using widely available and clearly defined technical specifications. This chapter discusses the main hardware and software components used in closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems and describes the evaluation procedures that are used to ensure that the system performs as specified. Even when the system parameters can change with the physiological characteristics, a closed-loop control system can accurately extract the signals of interest. ?

In vitro data suggest that indoxyl sulfate, a protein-bound uremic toxin, may induce vascular dysfunction and thrombosis. However, there is no clinical evidence regarding the role of indoxyl sulfate in hemodialysis vascular access. From January 2010 to June 2013, we prospectively enrolled patients undergoing angioplasty for dialysis access dysfunction. Patients were stratified into tertiles by baseline serum indoxyl sulfate levels. Study participants received clinical follow-up at 6-month intervals until June 2014. Primary end points were restenosis, thrombosis, and failure of vascular access. Median follow-up duration was 32 months. Of the 306 patients enrolled, 262 (86%) had symptomatic restenosis, 153 (50%) had access thrombosis, and 25 (8%) had access failure. In patients with graft access, free indoxyl sulfate tertiles showed a negative association with thrombosis-free patency (thrombosis-free patency rates of 54%, 38%, and 26% for low, middle, and high tertiles, respectively; P=0.001). Patients with graft thrombosis had higher free and total indoxyl sulfate levels. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, graft thrombosis was independently predicted by absolute levels of free indoxyl sulfate (hazard ratio=1.14; P=0.01) and free indoxyl sulfate tertiles (high versus low, hazard ratio=2.41; P=0.001).

The aim of this work was to evaluate the roles of miRNA (miR)-155 on the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced response in biliary atresia (BA), which is the most common form of pediatric chronic liver disease and a leading indication for pediatric liver transplantation. The expression of miR-155 and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) gene in human and mice liver tissues of BA and healthy controls was evaluated. IFN-γ-induced expression of miR-155, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was determined in bile duct cells. A miR-155 inhibitor was used to determine the influence in the IFN-γ-induced signaling pathway by western blot analysis. A strong up-regulation of miR-155 expression was observed in BA histologic sections and mouse bile duct cells treated with IFN-γ. miR-155 down-regulated SOCS1 protein expression by targeting its mRNA. Up-regulation of miR-155 expression by IFN-γ in bile duct cells led to the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (Stat1) and inflammatory cytokines through the Janus kinase (Jak)/Stat pathway, whereas targeted inhibition of miR-155 expression by anti-miRNA oligonucleotides significantly decreased the mRNA or protein expression levels of these inflammatory cytokines and Stat1. Overall, our results suggest that miR-155 regulates the IFN-γ signaling pathway by targeting SOCS1 expression and may be a potential target in BA therapy ? 2016 by The Chinese Physiological Society and Airiti Press Inc.",Bile duct; Inflammatory response; Interferon gamma; Jak/Stat pathway; MicroRNA-155; SOCS1,"gamma interferon; Janus kinase; messenger RNA; microRNA 155; oligonucleotide; STAT1 protein; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; cytokine; gamma interferon; microRNA; MIRN155 microRNA, human; Mirn155 microRNA, mouse; SOCS1 protein, human; Socs1 protein, mouse; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; bile duct atresia; controlled study; cytokine response; down regulation; gene expression regulation; gene silencing; histopathology; human; human tissue; inhibition kinetics; liver cell; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; signal transduction; SOCS1 gene; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; bile duct atresia; C57BL mouse; case control study; metabolism; signal transduction; Animals; Biliary Atresia; Case-Control Studies; Cytokines; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Mice, Inbred C57BL; MicroRNAs; Signal Transduction; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85011062047

Accordingly, overcoming the host response induced by chemotherapy could substantially improve therapeutic outcome and patient survival. In this study, resistance to treatment and metastasis has been attributed to expansion of stem-like tumor-initiating cells (TICs). Molecular analysis of the tumor stroma in neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated human desmoplastic cancers and orthotopic tumor xenografts revealed that traditional maximum-tolerated dose chemotherapy, regardless of the agents used, induces persistent STAT-1 and NF-κB activity in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. This induction results in the expression and secretion of ELR motif-positive (ELR+) chemokines, which signal through CXCR-2 on carcinoma cells to trigger their phenotypic conversion into TICs and promote their invasive behaviors, leading to paradoxical tumor aggression after therapy. In contrast, the same overall dose administered as a low-dose metronomic chemotherapy regimen largely prevented therapy-induced stromal ELR+ chemokine paracrine signaling, thus enhancing treatment response and extending survival of mice carrying desmoplastic cancers. These experiments illustrate the importance of stroma in cancer therapy and how its impact on treatment resistance could be tempered by altering the dosing schedule of systemic chemotherapy. ? 2016 Chan et al.",,"1 (2 bromophenyl) 3 (2 hydroxy 4 nitrophenyl)urea; chemokine; chemokine receptor CXCR2; CXCL1 chemokine; CXCL2 chemokine; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; epithelial derived neutrophil activating factor 78; granulocyte chemotactic protein 2; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; paclitaxel; STAT1 protein; chemokine receptor CXCR2; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; STAT1 protein; STAT1 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; breast carcinoma; cancer patient; carcinogenesis; carcinoma associated fibroblast; carcinoma cell; cell expansion; cell infiltration; cell interaction; cell population; chemotherapy; controlled study; female; fibroblast; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; low drug dose; macrophage; maximum tolerated dose; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; priority journal; protein expression; protein motif; protein secretion; stroma; treatment response; tumor initiating cell; tumor invasion; tumor vascularization; tumor xenograft; Breast Neoplasms; fibroblast; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; metronomic drug administration; pathology; stroma cell; U-937 cell line; Administration, Metronomic; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Fibroblasts; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; NF-kappa B; Receptors, Interleukin-8B; STAT1 Transcription Factor; Stromal Cells; U937 Cells",2-s2.0-85008433322

From this calculation, we could retrieve both negative effective permittivity and permeability of the sphere simultaneously at frequencies around 153 THz in the aids of Lewin's theory and the power distribution clearly demonstrate the expected negative Goos-H?nchen effect, which usually occurred in a negative refractive waveguide, thus creating two energy vortices to trap incident energy and then promoting the pump absorption efficiency. Meanwhile, a magnetic lasing mode at 167.3 THz is demonstrated and reveals a magnetic dipole resonance mode and a circulating energy flow within the dielectric sphere, providing a possible stopped light feedback mechanism to enable the all-dielectric nanolaser. More importantly, the corresponding mode volume is reduced to 0.01λ3 and a gain threshold of 5.1×103 is obtained. To validate our design of all-dielectric nanolaser, we employ finite-difference-time-domain simulation software to examine the behavior of the nanolaser. From simulation, we could obtain a pinned-down population inversion of 0.001 and a lasing peak at around 166.5 THz, which is very consistent with the prediction of Mie theory. Finally, according to Mie theory, we can regard the all-dielectric nanolaser as the excitation of material polariton and thus could make an analogue between lasing modes of the dielectric and metallic nanoparticles.

Radix Paeoniae Rubra (Chi Shao) contains several phytochemicals with hypoglycemic actions. Current research aims to explore potential insulinotropic effects and long-term therapeutic efficacy of such herb against type 2 diabetes. Methods. Composition analysis for the ethanol extract (PRExt) was executed by high performance liquid chromatography. Polyphenol-enriched fraction was characterized by high pressure size exclusion chromatography. Multiple cell platforms were employed to evaluate hypoglycemic bioactivities. In animal experiments, blood glucose, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-index assessment, glucose tolerance test, and in vivo glucose uptake were all measured. Additional effects of PRExt on obesity and hepatic steatosis were evaluated by serum and histological analysis. Results. PRExt provides multiple hypoglycemic effects including the enhancement of glucose-mediated insulin secretion. Pentagalloylglucose and polyphenol-enriched fraction are two insulinotropic constituents. Moreover, PRExt intraperitoneal injection causes acute hypoglycemic effects on fasted db/db mice. Oral administration of PRExt (200 mg/kg b.w.) gradually reduces blood glucose in db/db mice to the level similar to that in C57J/B6 mice after 30 days. The improvement of glucose intolerance, HOMA-index, and in vivo glucose uptake is evident in addition to the weight loss effect and attenuation of hepatic steatosis. Conclusion. PRExt is an effective antidiabetic herbal extract with multiple hypoglycemic bioactivities. ? 2016 Chia-Chuan Chang et al.",,alanine aminotransferase; cholesterol; exendin 4; glucose; glucose pentagallate; insulin; Paeonia radix; polyphenol; triacylglycerol; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antidiabetic activity; Article; biological activity; blood analysis; cell assay; clinical evaluation; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug screening; fatty liver; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; glucose tolerance test; glucose transport; high performance liquid chromatography; histopathology; homeostasis; homeostasis model assessment index; hyperglycemia; in vivo study; insulin like activity; insulin release; male; metabolic parameters; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; size exclusion chromatography; therapy effect; weight reduction,2-s2.0-85006164670

We observed that extracellular signals were further transduced to transcription factors (TFs), resulting in the aberrant regulation of their target genes, in turn inducing mechanisms that are responsible for HCC progression, including cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, aberrant cell cycle, cell survival, and metastasis. We also selected potential multiple drugs specific to prominent epigenetic network markers of each stage of HCC: lestaurtinib, dinaciclib, and perifosine against the NTRK2, MYC, and AKT1 markers influencing HCC progression from stage I to stage II; celecoxib, axitinib, and vinblastine against the DDIT3, PDGFB, and JUN markers influencing HCC progression from stage II to stage III; and atiprimod, celastrol, and bortezomib against STAT3, IL1B, and NFKB1 markers influencing HCC progression from stage III to stage IV.",DNA methylation; Hepatocarcinogenesis; MiRNAs; Multiple potential drugs; Principal network projection,"atiprimod; axitinib; bortezomib; celastrol; celecoxib; dinaciclib; lestaurtinib; messenger RNA; microRNA; perifosine; transcription factor; vinblastine; AKT1 gene; apoptosis; Article; cancer genetics; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer staging; cell cycle; cell proliferation; cell survival; data mining; DDIT3 gene; DNA methylation; epigenetics; extracellular matrix; gene control; gene regulatory network; gene targeting; genetic database; genetic marker; IL1B gene; JUN gene; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell carcinoma; marker gene; medical information; metastasis; NFKB1 gene; NTRK2 gene; oncogene myc; PDGFB gene; pharmacogenetics; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; STAT3 gene; systems biology; biology; disease exacerbation; DNA sequence; genetic epigenesis; genetics; high throughput sequencing; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; pathology; procedures; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Disease Progression; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Regulatory Networks; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Staging; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Systems Biology",2-s2.0-84998630616

Although various noninvasive detection methods for lung cancer biomarkers in breath samples exist, they are unsuitable for self-diagnostics and immediate detection because they entail complicated handling procedures and are time intensive. In this study, we simulated, fabricated, and characterized disposable nanosensors by using single TiO2 and Ag NWs in flexible plastic tubes. The proposed sensors simultaneously detect 2-propyl-1-pentanol (2-PP) lung cancer biomarkers and changes in the humidity, flow rate, and temperature of the flowing gas. The optimal dimension of the tubes was determined and verified through dynamic simulations and experiments. The current tube design decreases sensing variation and moisture interference by 43.28% and 78.77%, respectively, compared with previous designs. In the future, the proposed breath sensor, which has a response time of less than 10 s, can be used in a tube for simple and quick screening of lung cancer patients with the 2-PP concentration exceeding 100 ppb. The developed breath-sensing platform can be applied in noninvasive on-site disease screening. ? 2016 Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"2 ethylhexanol; 2 propyl 1 pentanol; biological marker; nanotube; nanowire; pentanol; silver nanoparticle; titanium dioxide; unclassified drug; boron derivative; plastic; silver; titanium; titanium boride; tumor marker; adsorption; aqueous solution; Article; breath analysis; centrifugation; controlled study; disposable equipment; electric conductivity; electric resistance; electrode; electron transport; flow rate; gas flow; heat transfer; human; humidity; lung cancer; major clinical study; moisture; nanoarray; nanosensor; priority journal; respiratory equipment; temperature; breath analysis; chemistry; devices; exhalation; lung tumor; mechanics; point of care system; Biomarkers, Tumor; Boron Compounds; Breath Tests; Exhalation; Humidity; Lung Neoplasms; Mechanical Phenomena; Nanowires; Plastics; Point-of-Care Systems; Silver; Temperature; Titanium",2-s2.0-84994259564

The number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) has been identified as a surrogate marker for vascular repair and health. Deficiency of EPCs has been demonstrated in dialysis patients to be associated with vascular events. Nonetheless, their role in thrombosis of AVFs remains unknown. Methods: From January 2010 to May 2013, 147 HD patients with dysfunctional AVFs were enrolled. Surface makers including CD34, KDR and CD133 were used in combination to determine the number of circulating EPCs. All participants were prospectively followed at 6-month interval until December 2015. The primary outcome was thrombosis of dialysis AVFs. Results: The median follow-up was 47 months, within which 42 patients experienced at least one episode of AVF thrombosis. Patients with AVF thrombosis had lower CD34+KDR+ cell counts compared with patients without thrombosis (median 5 vs. 13 per 150,000 mononuclear cells, p &lt; 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated an inverse relationship between CD34+KDR+ cell count tertiles and thrombosis-free patency (59, 69 and 86% for low, middle and high tertiles; p = 0.02). Using Cox regression analysis, AVF thrombosis was predicted by baseline CD34+KDR+ cell counts (hazards ratio (HR) 0.963, 95% CI 0.928-1.000, p = 0.05) and tertiles (high vs. low, HR 3.266, 95% CI 1.380-7.728, p &lt; 0.01). In multivariate analysis, only CD34+KDR+ cell tertiles, C-reactive protein and lesion length remained independent predictors for thrombosis. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated an independently reverse association between circulating EPCs and thrombosis of dialysis AVFs. Further studies are warranted to ascertain whether EPCs serve as a marker or a therapeutic target for AVF thrombosis. ? 2016 S.

Current tools for GWAS interaction analysis are mainly developed for unrelated case-control samples. Relatively fewer tools for interaction analysis are available for complex disease studies with family-based design, and these tools tend to be computationally expensive. Results: We developed a fast gene-gene interaction test, GCORE-sib, for discordant sib pairs and implemented the test into an efficient tool. We used simulations to demonstrate that the GCORE-sib has correct type I error rates and has comparable power to that of the regression-based interaction test. We also showed that the GCORE-sib can run more than 10 times faster than the regression-based test. Finally, the GCORE-sib was applied to a GWAS dataset with approximately 2,000 discordant sib pairs, and the GCORE-sib finished testing 19,368,078,382 pairs of SNPs within 6 days. Conclusions: An efficient gene-gene interaction tool for discordant sib pairs was developed. It will be very useful for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis in GWAS using discordant sib pairs.

While N-linked glycosylation sites on the globular head are variable among different strains and different subtypes, N-linked glycosylation sites in the stem region are mostly well conserved among various influenza virus strains. Targeting highly conserved HA stem regions has been proposed as a useful strategy for designing universal influenza vaccines. Since the HA stem region is constituted by an HA1 N-terminal part and a full HA2 part, we expressed a series of recombinant HA mutant proteins with deleted N-linked glycosylation sites in the HA1 stem and HA2 stem regions of H5N1 and pH1N1 viruses. Unmasking N-glycans in the HA2 stem region (H5 N484A and H1 N503A) was found to elicit more potent neutralizing antibody titers against homologous, heterologous, and heterosubtypic viruses. Unmasking the HA2 stem N-glycans of H5HA but not H1HA resulted in more CR6261-like and FI6v3-like antibodies and also correlated with the increase of cell fusion inhibition activity in antisera. Only H5 N484A HA2 stem mutant protein immunization increased the numbers of antibody-secreting cells, germinal center B cells, and memory B cells targeting the stem helix A epitopes in splenocytes. Unmasking the HA2 stem N-glycans of H5HA mutant proteins showed a significantly improvement in the protection against homologous virus challenges but did so to a less degree for the protection against heterosubtypic pH1N1 virus challenges. These results may provide useful information for designing more effective influenza vaccines. ? 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Methods: MRI studies of 169 lymph node lesions, dissected from 22 patients with a histopathologically confirmed lymph node status, were analyzed using in-house software developed using MATLAB? (The MathWorks? Inc., Natick, MA). A radiologist manually contoured the lesions, and ADCs for each lesion were divided into two (low and high) and three (low, intermediate and high) partitions by using the FCM clustering algorithm. Results: The results showed that the low-value ADC clusters were more sensitive (95.7%) in distinguishing malignant from benign lesions than the whole-lesion mean ADC values (78.3%), while retaining a high specificity (approximately 90%). Moreover, receiveroperating characteristic curves demonstrated that the low-value ADC clusters used as a predictor of malignancy for lymph nodes could achieve a higher area under the curve (0.949 and 0.944 for two and three partitions, respectively). Conclusion: The segmentation by ADC values of lesions through the FCM technique enables the efficient characterization of the lymph node pathology and can help distinguish malignant from benign lymph nodes. Advances in knowledge: Tumour heterogeneity may degrade the prediction of metastatic lymph nodes that involves using mean region-of-interest ADC values. The clustering of ADC values in lesions by using FCM can improve the diagnostic accuracy of nodal metastasis and reduce interreader variance. ? 2016 The Authors.",,"gadodiamide; adult; aged; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer surgery; clinical article; cluster analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; diffusion weighted imaging; female; fuzzy c means; fuzzy system; head and neck cancer; human; image analysis; image segmentation; imaging software; lymph node metastasis; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; radiological parameters; sensitivity and specificity; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; head and neck tumor; image processing; lymph node; lymph node metastasis; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; predictive value; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-84989359972

Dysregulation of T cells plays a critical role in SLE pathogenesis. Our previous study indicates that JKAP (also named DUSP22) inhibits T-cell activation and that JKAP knockout mice develop spontaneous autoimmunity; therefore, we investigated whether JKAP downregulation is involved in SLE patients. JKAP protein levels in purified T cells were examined by immunoblotting using blood samples from 43 SLE patients and 32 healthy controls. SLE patients showed significantly decreased JKAP protein levels in peripheral blood T cells compared to healthy controls. JKAP protein levels in peripheral blood T cells were inversely correlated with SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and anti-dsDNA antibody levels. JKAP downregulation in T cells was highly correlated with daily urinary protein amounts and with poor renal outcome in lupus nephritis patients. Notably, the diagnostic power of JKAP downregulation in T cells for active lupus nephritis was higher than those of serum anti-dsDNA antibody, C3, and C4 levels. Moreover, T-cell-specific transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative JKAP mutant developed spontaneous autoimmune nephritis. Furthermore, JKAP-deficient T cells overproduced complement components, soluble ICAM-1, and soluble VCAM-1 in the kidney; these cytokines have been reported to be involved in lupus nephritis.

Cancer cells use the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) pathway to suppress the host's immune response in order to facilitate survival, growth, invasion, and metastasis of malignant cells. Higher IDO1 expression was shown to be involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and to be correlated with impaired clinical outcome. However, the potential correlation between the expression of IDO1 in a CRC population with a low mutation rate of the APC gene remains unknown. Material and Methods. Tissues and blood samples were collected from 192 CRC patients. The expressions of IDO1, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2), and beta-catenin proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined by PCR amplification of microsatellite loci. Results. The results showed that high IDO1 or TDO2 protein expression was associated with characteristics of more aggressive phenotypes of CRC. For the first time, they also revealed a positive correlation between the abnormal expression of beta-catenin and IDO1 or TDO2 proteins in a CRC population with a low mutation rate of APC. Conclusion. We concluded that an IDO1-regulated molecular pathway led to abnormal expression of beta-catenin in the nucleus/cytoplasm of CRC patients with low mutation rate of APC, making IDO1 an interesting target for immunotherapy in CRC. ? 2016 I-Chien Chen et al.",,"beta catenin; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, human; tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase; tumor marker; aged; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; colorectal cancer; female; gene locus; gene mutation; human; major clinical study; male; microsatellite instability; microsatellite marker; mutation rate; phenotype; protein expression; cancer staging; colorectal tumor; enzyme immunoassay; enzymology; follow up; lymph node metastasis; metabolism; pathology; prognosis; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Tryptophan Oxygenase",2-s2.0-84983734679

When compared to conventional methods, the microfluidic approaches are faster, more compact, require considerably smaller quantities of samples and reagents, and can be automated. Furthermore, they allow for more precise control of reaction conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, and shearing forces) such that more efficient screening can be performed. A variety of affinity reagents for targeting cancer cells or cancer biomarkers are now available and will likely replace conventional antibodies.

This work elucidates an injectable co-delivery system that is based on cationic liposomes that are adsorbed on anionic hollow microspheres (Lipos-HMs) via electrostatic interaction, from which the localized sequence-specific release of a chemopreventive agent (1,25(OH)2D3) and an anticancer drug (doxorubicin; DOX) can be thermally driven in a time-controllable manner by an externally applied high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF). Lipos-HMs can greatly promote the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells by reducing their cytoplasmic expression of an antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase) by 1,25(OH)2D3, increasing the susceptibility of cancer cells to the cytotoxic action of DOX. In nude mice that bear xenograft tumors, treatment with Lipos-HMs under exposure to HFMF effectively inhibits tumor growth and is the most effective therapeutic intervention among all the investigated. These empirical results demonstrate that the synergistic anticancer effects of sequential release of 1,25(OH)2D3 and DOX from the Lipos-HMs may have potential for maximizing DOX cytotoxicity, supporting more effective cancer treatment. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Chemopreventive agent; Combination chemotherapy; Reactive oxygen species; Sequential drug release; Synergistic anticancer effect,"Chemotherapy; Cytotoxicity; Enzymes; Liposomes; Oxygen; Tumors; Anticancer effects; Chemopreventive agents; Combination chemotherapy; Drug release; Reactive oxygen species; Diseases; doxorubicin; reactive oxygen metabolite; antineoplastic agent; calcitriol; doxorubicin; liposome; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; Article; body weight; cancer therapy; cell viability; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug release; female; MCF 7 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; static electricity; tumor growth; tumor volume; tumor xenograft; animal; Bagg albino mouse; breast tumor; cell survival; chemistry; delayed release formulation; drug effects; human; magnetic field; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Calcitriol; Cell Survival; Delayed-Action Preparations; Doxorubicin; Female; Humans; Liposomes; Magnetic Fields; MCF-7 Cells; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase",2-s2.0-84979276861

More than 80% of patients died from PCa developed bone metastases. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a main bioactive component of honeybee hive propolis. Transwell and wound healing assays demonstrated that CAPE treatment suppressed the migration and invasion of PC-3 and DU-145 PCa cells. Gelatin zymography and Western blotting indicated that CAPE treatment reduced the abundance and activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2. Analysis using Micro-Western Array (MWA), a high-throughput antibody-based proteomics platform with 264 antibodies detecting signaling proteins involved in important pathways indicated that CAPE treatment induced receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway but suppressed abundance of 9-catenin, NF-κB activity, PI3K-Akt signaling, and epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). Overexpression or knockdown of ROR2 suppressed or enhanced cell migration of PC-3 cells, respectively. TCF-LEF promoter binding assay revealed that CAPE treatment reduced canonical Wnt signaling. Intraperitoneal injection of CAPE reduced the metastasis of PC-3 xenografts in tail vein injection nude mice model. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that CAPE treatment increased abundance of ROR2 and Wnt5a but decreased protein expression of Ki67, Frizzle 4, NF-κB p65, MMP-9, Snail, β-catenin, and phosphorylation of IκBa.

However, increased expression of 14-3-3σ paradoxically suppresses in vitro cell invasion of HCC. We hypothesize that surrounding tumor-associated stromal cells play a crucial role in 14-3-3σ-regulated HCC cell invasion. In this study, H68 fibroblasts, THP- 1 and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-treated THP-1 (PMA-THP-1) cells were incubated with conditioned media of control (control-CM) and 14-3-3σ-overepxressing cells (14-3-3σ-CM), followed by co-culture with HCC cells. Invasiveness of HCC cells was examined by a Boyden chamber assay. HCC cells co-cultured with 14-3-3σ-CM treated cells significantly enhanced their invasive ability compared with control-CM treated cells. Moreover, incubation with 14-3-3σ-CM induced differential expression profiles of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in fibroblasts (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-12 and MMP- 14), THP-1 (MMP-1 and MMP-12) and PMA-THP-1 cells (MMP-2, MMP-12 and MMP-14). In contrast, silencing of 14-3-3σ by siRNA significantly abolished 14-3-3σ-CM induced MMPs. In addition, treatment with recombinant 14-3-3σ (r14-3-3σ) protein exhibits a similar expression profile of MMPs induced by 14-3-3σ-CM in fibroblasts, THP-1 and PMA-THP-1 cells. Finally, knockdown of aminopeptidase N (APN) significantly abrogated r14-3-3σ induced expression of MMPs in HS68 fibroblasts.

Therefore, it is primarily necessary to design materials that can conquer over both cancer cells as well as pathogens. Advancements in the realm of nanomaterial-based theranostics for photodynamic (PDT) and photothermal (PTT) therapies have been groundbreaking. However, a greater focus on graphene-based nanomaterials such as photothermal theranostics under the first and second near-infrared (NIR) window is imminent. Keeping that in mind, we have developed a new and simple biocompatible nanocomposite material composed of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) to achieve RGO functionalized PAA (RGOPAA). The focus of this study is to compare PTT capability and inactivation of cancer cells and pathogens by RGOPAA under two different NIR windows (808 and 1064 nm). The photothermal heating curves of RGOPAA showed similar temperature profiles at 808 and 1064 nm wavelengths. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images showed successful internalization of RGOPAA into HeLa cells while the MTT assay and heat shock protein expression studies revealed that the cytotoxicity of HeLa cells was mainly attributed to heat generation of graphene upon photoirradiation. In addition, photothermal studies were also performed in the pathogenic bacteria, S. aureus, which revealed excellent killing efficiencies. Our findings conclude that both NIR I and II produce similar effects in terms of cancer cell and pathogen inactivation, although NIR II can be a much better choice for in vivo imaging studies owing to its deeper penetration and higher transparency. ? 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Bacteria; Biocompatibility; Biological materials; Cytology; Diseases; Graphene; Infrared devices; Nanocomposites; Nanostructured materials; Confocal laser scanning microscopy; Heat shock protein; Pathogen inactivation; Pathogenic bacterium; Photothermal heating; Polyacrylic acids; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Temperature profiles; Pathogens,2-s2.0-84978063368

Considered essential for controlling innate and adaptive immune responses against influenza virus infections, dendritic cells (DCs) trigger proinflammatory and adaptive immune responses in hosts. In this study, we engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing recombinant HA from pandemic H1, H5, and H7 influenza viruses. rH1HA, rH5HA, and rH7HA were obtained as wild-type proteins or in the presence of kifunensine (KIF) or further with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase-treated KIF (KIF+E) to generate single-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) N-glycans consisting of (i) terminally sialylated complex-type N-glycans, (ii) high-mannose-type N-glycans, and (iii) single-GlcNAc-type N-glycans.

Our data indicate that native avian rHA proteins (H5N1 and H7N9) are more immunostimulatory than human rHA protein (pH1N1). The high-mannose-type or single-GlcNAc-type N-glycans of both avian and human HA types are more stimulatory than the complex-type N-glycans.

The syndromes of SDP were correlated with various severe Yang deficiency related symptoms. To obtain a common profile for SDP, we distributed questionnaires to 300 senior clinical TCM practitioners. According to the survey, we concluded 2 sets of symptoms for SDP: (1) pulse feels deep or faint and (2) reversal cold of the extremities. Twenty-four individuals from Taipei City Hospital, Linsen Chinese Medicine Branch, Taiwan, were recruited. We extracted the total mRNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the 24 individuals for microarray experiments. Twelve individuals (including 6 SDP patients and 6 non-SDP individuals) were used as the training set to identify biomarkers for distinguishing the SDP and non-SDP groups. The remaining 12 individuals were used as the test set. The test results indicated that the gene expression profiles of the identified biomarkers could effectively distinguish the 2 groups by adopting a hierarchical clustering algorithm.

Every year, over 7.5 million persons die due to HBV. No effective drug exists for the treatment of HBV. Thus, we designed and synthesized 16 new pyridine-pyrazole-sulfonate compounds containing pyridine-SCH2-pyrazole and pyridine-pyrazole derivatives. Their structures were characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, IR, mass spectroscopy, and high performance liquid chromatography. All the compounds were evaluated for their anti-HBV activities and a structure-activity relationship (SAR) in HepG2 2.2.15 cells was established. We found that the pyridine-pyrazole derivatives could inhibit the HBV gene expression and viral DNA replication. Among these compounds, 2-[3-(2-nitrophenylsulfonyl)oxy-5-pyrazol-yl]pyridine 19d has shown the most potent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 9.19 μM and high selectivity index, SI (TC50/IC50) of 35.46.

Herein, we introduce a simple photosensitive poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel based platform for high dynamic range testing of combinatorial cocktail drug screening using three chemical and two protein drug treatments for colon cancer. UV cross linked PEGDA hydrogel droplet arrays on a Teflon patterned glass substrate enable a rapid yet accurate selection and dosage assignment of the drugs. Precisely loaded cocktails of the anticancer drugs were simultaneously released in-parallel with the PEGDA hydrogel chips into 2D or 3D cultured HCT-8 colon cancer cells for combinatorial drug screening. We demonstrate the functionality of our UV gel-Drug Chips 1000 fold range of concentrations for each of the five drugs in 30 seconds to find the optimized drug cocktail using a fractional factorial control system. Our device has low drug consumption, requiring only 12 nL per screening run per droplet. In addition, our UV gel-Drug Chips were employed for find the optimized drug cocktail using a fractional search algorithm. Our cocktail drug response results for both 2D (cell viability is 7.3%) and 3D (cell viability is 10.8%) colon cancer cells were analogous to those found by conventional method (6.8 and 9.3 respectively).

However, despite the fact that engineered MSCs have demonstrated profound anticancer effects, the exact intrinsic impact of MSCs themselves on tumor progression is still being debated. Therefore, in order to ensure pertinent MSC-based cancer therapy, it is essential to further explore the intrinsic antitumor and protumor effects of MSCs on tumor progression. Here, we show that dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles can not only increase the antitumor effect of antitumor MSCs but also reverse the protumor effect of protumor MSCs and hence turn protumor MSCs into antitumor MSCs in vivo, which can be attributed to the in vitro finding that dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles can not only inhibit the colony formation of cancer cells likely through induction of cytokine receptor expression to competitively capture the tumorous cytokine but also diminish cancer-mediated fibroblast differentiation and angiogenesis of protumor MSCs. This is the first report to demonstrate the induction of antitumor MSCs from protumor MSCs. ? 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Cells; Cytology; Dextran; Diseases; Flowcharting; Iron; Iron oxides; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Oncology; Stem cells; Tumors; Anti-cancer agents; Anticancer effects; Colony formation; Cytokine receptor; Iron oxide nanoparticle; Mesenchymal stem cell; Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells; Tumor progressions; Cell culture,2-s2.0-84970028637

Although the leaky vessels of tumors can improve the penetration of nanodrugs via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, various aspects of the tumor microenvironment still restrict this process. This study investigated whether vascular disruption using the acoustic vaporization of micro- or nanoscale droplets (MDs or NDs) induced by ultrasound sonication can overcome the limitations of the EPR effect to allow drug diffusion into extensive regions. The intravital penetration of DiI-labeled liposomes (as a drug model with red fluorescence) was observed using an acousto-optical integrated system comprising a 2-MHz focused ultrasound transducer (transmitting a three-cycle single pulse and a peak negative pressure of 10 MPa) in a window-chamber mouse model. Histology images of the solid tumor were also used to quantify and demonstrate the locations where DiI-labeled liposomes accumulated. In the intravital image analyses, the cumulative diffusion area and fluorescence intensity at 180 min were 0.08±0.01 mm2 (mean±standard deviation) and 8.5±0.4%, respectively, in the EPR group, 0.33±0.01 mm2 and 13.1±0.4% in the MD group (p &lt; 0.01), and 0.63±0.01 mm2 and 18.9±1.1% in the ND group (p &lt; 0.01). The intratumoral accumulations of DiI-labeled liposomes were 1.7- and 2.3-fold higher in the MD and ND groups, respectively, than in the EPR group. These results demonstrate that vascular disruption induced by acoustic droplet vaporization can improve drug penetration more than utilizing the EPR effect. The NDs showed longer lifetime in vivo than MDs and provided potential abilities of long periods of treatment, intertissue ND vaporization, and intertissue NDs-converted bubble cavitation to improve the drug penetration and transport distance. ?

The nanocarriers with switchable surface charges in response to tumor extracellular acidity (pHe) were capable of selectively co-delivering indocyanine green (ICG), a photothermal agent, and doxorubicin (DOX), a chemotherapy drug, to tumor sites. The in vitro cellular uptake of ICG/DOX-loaded nanoparticles by cancer cells and macrophages was significantly promoted in weak acidic environments due to the increased protonation of the NAcHis moieties. The results of in vivo and ex vivo biodistribution studies demonstrated that upon intravenous injection the theranostic nanoparticles were substantially accumulated in TRAMP-C1 solid tumor of tumor-bearing mice. Immunohistochemical examination of tumor sections confirmed the active permeation of the nanoparticles into deep tumor hypoxia due to their small size, pHe-induced near neutral surface, and the additional hitchhiking transport via tumor-associated macrophages. The prominent imaging-guided photothermal therapy of ICG/DOX-loaded nanoparticles after tumor accumulation induced extensive tumor tissue/vessel ablation, which further promoted their extravasation and DOX tumor permeation, thus effectively suppressing tumor growth. ?

TLR4 is highly expressed in dendritic cell (DC) and several TLR4 agonists are known to trigger DC maturation. We herein evaluated the effect of CCL-34 on DC maturation. Human CD14+ monocyte-derived immature DC were treated with CCL-34, its inactive structural analog CCL-44, or LPS to assess the DC maturation. CCL-34 induced DC maturation according to their characteristically dendrite-forming morphology, CD83 expression and IL-12p70 production. The allostimulatory activity of DC on proliferation of naive CD4+CD45+RA+ T cells and their secretion of interferon-γ was increased by CCL-34. Phagocytosis, an important function of immature DC, was reduced after CCL-34 treatment. All these effects related to DC maturation were evidently induced by positive control LPS but not by CCL-44 treatment. TLR4 neutralization impaired human DC maturation triggered by CCL-34. The induction of IL-12, a hallmark of DC maturation, by CCL-34 and LPS was only evident in TLR4-competent C3H/HeN, but not in TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ mice.

Here, we examined the potential involvement of DNA methylation in regulating SNCG and its role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We used 8 OSCC cell lines to investigate SNCG methylation and expression. SNCG methylation was examination by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfate sequencing. Cells showing a high degree of SNCG methylation were treated with 5-aza (methylation inhibitor), and changes in their methylation and expression profiles were analyzed. Functional effects of SNCG in OSCC were examined by its overexpression and knockdown. Additionally, methylation and expression of SNCG in OSCC tissues were investigated and correlated with clinicopathologic features. All OSCC cells showed detectable SNCG expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfate sequencing revealed high SNCG expression in SCC25 cells with the unmethylated allele, and their 15 CpG islands were unmethylated. The methylated allele was detected only in OEC-M1 cells exhibiting low SNCG expression, and their CpG islands were partially methylated. 5-aza treatment in OEC-M1 cells attenuated methylation and restored SNCG expression. SNCG overexpression increased colony forming, migration, and invasion abilities in OEC-M1 cells. Silencing SNCG in SCC25 cells suppressed these behaviors. All 25 tumor-adjacent normal tissues were negative for SNCG immunostaining. SNCG upregulation was frequently observed in dysplastic and OSCC tissues. Positive SNCG expression was found in 45% (37 of 82) OSCC tissues. Positive SNCG expression in OSCC significantly correlated with cancer staging and lymph node metastasis. However, SNCG methylation did not correlate with its expression and clinicopathologic variables in OSCC tissues. DNA methylation may participate in regulating SNCG expression in some OSCC cells. SNCG upregulation could be involved in OSCC progression. ? 2016 International & American Associations for Dental Research.",DNA methylation; Epigenetics; Gene Expression; Oral cancer; Oral pathology; Tumor progression,"azacitidine; gamma synuclein; messenger RNA; tumor marker; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; cell motion; disease course; DNA methylation; gene expression; human; metabolism; Mouth Neoplasms; pathology; polymerase chain reaction; tumor cell line; upregulation; Western blotting; Azacitidine; Biomarkers, Tumor; Blotting, Western; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Disease Progression; DNA Methylation; gamma-Synuclein; Gene Expression; Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-84961572030

Although surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are the standard methods commonly used in clinics, hyperthermia has been developed as a new and promising strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, magnetic bioceramic hydroxyapatite (mHAP) nanocrystals have been developed as heat mediator for intracellular hyperthermia. Hyaluronic acid (HA) modified mHAP nanocrystals are synthesized by a wet chemical precipitation process to achieve active targeting. The results demonstrate that the HA targeting moiety conjugated by a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer arm is successfully immobilized on the surface of mHAP The HA-modified mHAP possesses relatively good biocompatibility, an adequate biodegradation rate and superparamagnetic properties. The HA-modified mHAP could be localized and internalized into HA receptor-overexpressed malignant cells (e.g., MDA-MB-231 cell) and used as the heat generating agent for intracellular hyperthermia. The results from this study indicate that biocompatible HA-modified mHAP shows promise as a novel heat mediator and a specific targeting nanoagent for intracellular hyperthermia cancer therapy.

We theoretically and experimentally investigated the key effects of the dielectric passivation layer on localized single-cell electroporation for different cancer cells, which were randomly distributed with a high density throughout the chip surface as a monolayer. The passivation layer not only prevented the conventional or bulk electroporation with bubble and ion generation, but also provide an intense electric field in-between electrode gap for localized single-cell electroporation with high cell viability.

A cluster randomized trial was performed in Bogot?, Colombia between 2008 and 2012 to evaluate effects of opportunistic breast cancer screening. Thirteen clinics were randomized to an intervention arm and 13 to a control arm. Physicians in intervention clinics were instructed to perform clinical breast examination on all women aged 50-69 years attending clinics for non-breast health issues, and then refer them for mammographic screening. Physicians in control clinics were not explicitly instructed to perform breast screening or mammography referrals, but could do so if they thought it indicated (""usual care""). Women were followed for 2-years postrandomization. 7,436 women were enrolled and 7,419 (99.8%) screened in intervention clinics, versus 8,419 enrolled and 1,108 (13.1%) screened in control clinics. Incidence ratios (IR) of early, advanced and all breast cancers were 2.9 (95% CI 1.1-9.2), 1.0 (0.3-3.5) and 1.9 (0.9-4.1) in the first (screening) year of the trial, and the cumulative IR for all breast cancers converged to 1.4 (0.7-2.8) by the end of follow-up (Year 2). Eighteen (69.2%) of 26 women with early stage disease had breast conservation surgery (BCS) versus 6 (42.5%) of 14 women with late-stage disease (p = 0.02). Fifteen (68.2%) of 22 women with breast cancer in the intervention group had BCS versus nine (50.0%) of 18 women in the control group (p = 0.34). Well-designed opportunistic clinic-based breast cancer screening programs may be useful for early breast cancer detection in LMICs. What's new? Breast cancer is a common malignancy in Colombia, and its mortality rates are rising. To catch the disease earlier, recently developed guidelines from the National Cancer Institute of Colombia center on opportunistic (hospital-based) screening with biennial mammography and clinical breast examination. In this randomized trial involving patients at primary health-care clinics in Bogot?, opportunistic breast screening was associated with increased rates of disease detection and use of breast-conservation therapy. Cancers were diagnosed at earlier stages in women who underwent screening versus usual care. The data suggest that opportunistic breast screening can advance early detection in low-resource settings. ? 2015 The Authors.

Whether heterogeneity in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET) images and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression could provide additional information on clinical outcomes in advanced-stage OPSCC was investigated. Patients with stage III-IV OPSCC who completed primary therapy were eligible. Zone-size nonuniformity (ZSNU) extracted from pretreatment FDG PET scans was used as an index of image heterogeneity. EGFR and p16 expression were examined by immunohistochemistry. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) served as outcome measures. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for survival analysis. A bootstrap resampling technique was applied to investigate the stability of outcomes. Finally, a recursive partitioning analysis (RPA)-based model was constructed. A total of 113 patients were included, of which 28 were p16-positive. Multivariate analysis identified the Ang's profile, EGFR and ZSNU as independent predictors of both DSS and OS. Using RPA, the three risk factors were used to devise a prognostic scoring system that successfully predicted DSS in both p16-positive and -negative cases. The c-statistic of the prognostic index for DSS was 0.81, a value which was significantly superior to both AJCC stage (0.60) and the Ang's risk profile (0.68). In patients showing an Ang's high-risk profile (N = 77), the use of our scoring system clearly identified three distinct prognostic subgroups. It was concluded that a novel index may improve the prognostic stratification of patients with advanced-stage OPSCC. What's new? Advanced-stage oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) generally is associated with poor outcome, and existing classification schemes provide for only limited risk stratification. One of the most promising validated prognostic approaches in OPSCC is based on the Ang's risk profile, which is characterized by cancer stage, p16 status and smoking. In the present study, Ang's profile, EGFR expression and zone-size nonuniformity (ZSNU) were found to independently predict OPSCC survival. A novel index that incorporated the three factors successfully predicted disease-specific survival for both p16-positive and p16-negative cases. The new scoring system could significantly improve prognostic stratification in advanced-stage OPSCC. ? 2015 UICC.",epidermal growth factor receptor; FDG PET/CT; human papillomavirus; oropharyngeal carcinoma; survival analysis,"epidermal growth factor receptor; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adult; aged; chemistry; female; head and neck tumor; human; male; middle aged; mortality; oropharynx tumor; positron emission tomography; prognosis; proportional hazards model; scintiscanning; squamous cell carcinoma; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oropharyngeal Neoplasms; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor",2-s2.0-84955698780

CTS is diagnosed clinically as the gold standard and confirmed with nerve conduction studies (NCS). Complementing NCS, ultrasound imaging could provide additional anatomical information on pathological and motion changes of the median nerve. The purpose of this study was to estimate the transverse sliding patterns of the median nerve during finger movements by analyzing ultrasound dynamic images to distinguish between normal subjects and CTS patients. Transverse ultrasound images were acquired, and a speckle-tracking algorithm was used to determine the lateral displacements of the median nerve in radial-ulnar plane in B-mode images utilizing the multilevel block-sum pyramid algorithm and averaging. All of the averaged lateral displacements at separate acquisition times within a single flexion-extension cycle were accumulated to obtain the cumulative lateral displacements, which were curve-fitted with a second-order polynomial function. The fitted curve was regarded as the transverse sliding pattern of the median nerve. The R2 value, curvature, and amplitude of the fitted curves were computed to evaluate the goodness, variation and maximum value of the fit, respectively. Box plots, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm were utilized for statistical analysis. The transverse sliding of the median nerve during finger movements was greater and had a steeper fitted curve in the normal subjects than in the patients with mild or severe CTS. The temporal changes in transverse sliding of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel were found to be correlated with the presence of CTS and its severity. The representative transverse sliding patterns of the median nerve during finger movements were demonstrated to be useful for quantitatively estimating median nerve dysfunction in CTS patients. ?2016 Kuo et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"area under the curve; Article; B scan; carpal tunnel syndrome; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity; electrophysiology; fuzzy system; gold standard; human; informed consent; median nerve; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; ultrasound scanner; carpal tunnel syndrome; cluster analysis; diagnostic imaging; echography; female; male; median nerve; motion; pathology; pathophysiology; pattern recognition; reproducibility; Carpal Tunnel Syndrome; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Median Nerve; Motion; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-84955516387

This investigation developed nanofibrous growth factor-eluting poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-collagen hybrid scaffolds that enabled the sustainable release of recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF) to treat diabetic wounds. RhPDGF, collagen, and PLGA were dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol, and then electrospun into nanofibrous scaffolds. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and an elution method were utilized to evaluate the rates of in vivo and in vitro release of growth factors from the scaffolds. High concentrations and effectiveness of rhPDGF were documented for over three weeks. The water contact angles of nanofibrous rhPDGF-eluting PLGA-collagen hybrid scaffolds were less (97.2 ± 0.7°) than those of PLGA-collagen hybrid mesh (107.6 ± 1.0°) or virgin PLGA (113 ± 3.3°) (all post hoc p < 0.05). The nanofibers with rhPDGF-eluting PLGA-collagen hybrid scaffold also exhibited significantly higher water-retaining capacity than those in other groups (all post hoc p < 0.001). Furthermore, the scaffolds caused more re-epithelialization and contained more collagen I in rats with rhPDGF-eluting scaffolds than controls, as determined from the expressed matrix metalloproteinase 9 in the hair canals in developing hair follicles.

Apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE?/?) mice chronically treated with DEHP for 4?weeks showed exacerbated hyperlipidemia, systemic inflammation, and atherosclerosis. In addition, DEHP promoted low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, which led to inflammation in endothelial cells as evidenced by increased protein expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, chronic DEHP treatment increased hepatic cholesterol accumulation by downregulating the protein expression of key regulators in cholesterol clearance including LDL receptor, cholesterol 7α-hydrolase, ATP-binding cassette transporter G5 and G8, and liver X receptor α. Moreover, the adiposity and inflammation of white adipose tissues were promoted in DEHP-treated apoE?/? mice.

Hence, the need to develop a strategy for prophylaxis or therapy, such as a broadly neutralizing antibody against IAV, is urgent. In this study, single-chain variable fragment (scFv) phage display technology was used to select scFv fragments recognizing influenza envelope proteins. The Tomlinson I and J scFv phage display libraries were screened against the recombinant HA2 protein (rHA2) for three rounds. Only the third-round elution sample of the Tomlinson J library showed high binding affinity to rHA2, from which three clones (3JA18, 3JA62, and 3JA78) were chosen for preparative-scale production as soluble antibody by E. coli. The clone 3JA18 was selected for further tests due to its broad affinity for influenza H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1. Simulations of the scFv 3JA18-HA trimer complex revealed that the complementarity-determining region of the variable heavy chain (VH-CDR2) bound the stem region of HA. Neutralization assays using a peptide derived from VH-CDR2 also supported the simulation model. Both the selected antibody and its derived peptide were shown to suppress infection with H5N1 and H1N1 viruses, but not H3N2 viruses. The results also suggested that the scFvs selected from rHA2 could have neutralizing activity by interfering with the function of the HA stem region during virus entry into target cells. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"immunoglobulin Fc fragment; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; neutralizing antibody; single chain fragment variable antibody; antibody specificity; genetics; human; immunology; influenza; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); Influenza A virus (H5N1); virology; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibody Specificity; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Humans; Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Single-Chain Antibodies",2-s2.0-84952863735

PBDEs level was distinctly higher by an order of magnitude in central-air-conditioner system filter (CASF) dust in clean rooms (32,600 ng g-1), than in IAF dust. In clinic and the office workers, PBDEs daily intake via indoor dust ingestion varied from 2.96 × 10-8 to 1.25 × 10-7 mg kg b.w.-1 day-1 (29.6-125 ng kg b.w.-1 day-1), which was obviously below the lowest observed adverse effect of level (LOAEL) of 1 mg kg b.w.-1 day-1. Assessment of the risk of non-cancer diseases with neurobehavioral effects and of cancer with neurobehavioral effects in clinic and office workers was notably below threshold values (non-cancer: 1.00 and cancer: 1.00 × 10-6). In conclusion, clinic and office workers had no harmful effects in the currently existing levels of indoor dust PBDEs in workplaces. IAF or CSAF dust can possibly reflect spatial and temporal dust distribution in the microenvironment. It is also suggested that collection of airconditioner filter dust may be an alternative method to conventional dust sampling for assessment of indoor contamination by PBDEs. ?

Metal or anode can be used as the support for the EDC plate, with metal-supported plates being more easily fabricated. EDC plates can almost completely eliminate NOx from combustion exhausts. Very high NO concentrations are preferred, to allow very high combustion temperatures, and so achieve superior fuel efficiency. An optimum cathode loading exists.

In this study, aggregates of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cord-blood mesenchymal stem cells (cbMSCs), which are capable of inducing therapeutic angiogenesis, are prepared. We hypothesize that the concurrent delivery of an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may significantly increase cell retention following the transplantation of HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates in a mouse model with hindlimb ischemia. Our in vitro results demonstrate that the antioxidant NAC can restore ROS-impaired cell adhesion and recover the reduced angiogenic potential of HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates under oxidative stress. In the animal study, we found that by scavenging the ROS generated in ischemic tissues, NAC is likely to be able to establish a receptive cell environment in the early stage of cell transplantation, promoting the adhesion, retention, and survival of cells of engrafted aggregates. Therapeutic angiogenesis is therefore enhanced and blood flow recovery and limb salvage are ultimately achieved. The combinatory strategy that uses an antioxidant and HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates may provide a new means of boosting the therapeutic efficacy of cell aggregates for the treatment of ischemic diseases. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Antioxidant; Cell therapy; Ischemic diseases; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species,"Aggregates; Antioxidants; Blood; Cell adhesion; Cell culture; Cytology; Disease control; Diseases; Endothelial cells; Histology; Oxidative stress; Stem cells; Tissue; Cell therapy; Cell transplantation; Human umbilical vein endothelial cells; Ischemic tissues; Mesenchymal stem cell; Reactive oxygen species; Therapeutic angiogenesis; Therapeutic efficacy; Cells; acetylcysteine; cyclosporin A; reactive oxygen metabolite; acetylcysteine; antioxidant; reactive oxygen metabolite; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood flow; cell adhesion; cell aggregation; cell survival; cell transplantation; controlled study; ischemia; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; umbilical vein endothelial cell; angiogenesis; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cytology; drug effects; human; male; mesenchymal stroma cell; metabolism; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Acetylcysteine; Animals; Antioxidants; Cell Adhesion; Cell Survival; Cell Transplantation; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Ischemia; Male; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species",2-s2.0-84945157426

Next, operation procedures were reorganized according to GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) methodology. Then the user interface was redesigned according to specific Universal Design (UD) principles. Following these revisions, an experiment involving four scenarios was conducted to compare the new prototype to other players, and it was tested by twelve visually impaired participants.

In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of flavone, apigenin and luteolin on human breast cancer cells. Methods: The anti-cancer activity of flavone, apigenin and luteolin was investigated using the MTS assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by Hoechst 33342 staining, flow cytometry and western blot. Cell migration was determined using the culture inserts and xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer instrument equipped with a CIM-plate 16. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blot were used to determine the signaling pathway elicited by flavone, apigenin and luteolin. Results: Flavone, apigenin and luteolin showed potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of Hs578T, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The ability of flavone, apigenin and luteolin to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells through apoptosis was confirmed by Hoechst33342 staining and the induction of sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle. Flavone, apigenin and luteolin induced forkhead box O3 (FOXO3a) expression by inhibiting Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. This subsequently elevated the expression of FOXO3a target genes, including the Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip1 (p21) and p27kip1 (p27), which increased the levels of activated poly(ADP) polymerase (PARP) and cytochrome c. Conclusion: Taken together, these data demonstrated that flavone, apigenin and luteolin induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells through inhibiting PI3K/Akt activation and increasing FOXO3a activation, which suggest that flavone, apigenin and luteolin will be the potential leads for the preventing and treating of breast cancer. ? 2015 Lin et al.",Akt; Apoptosis; Breast cancer; Flavones; FOXO3a; P27,"apigenin; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cytochrome c; flavone; hoe 33342; luteolin; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; transcription factor FKHRL1; antineoplastic agent; apigenin; flavone; flavone derivative; forkhead transcription factor; FOXO3 protein, human; luteolin; protein kinase B; transcription factor FKHRL1; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cancer inhibition; cancer prevention; cell migration; concentration response; controlled study; drug potency; drug structure; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; flow cytometry; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene targeting; Hs578T cell line; human; human cell; MCF 7 cell line; MDA MB 231 cell line; MTS assay; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; Western blotting; breast tumor; cell cycle; cell proliferation; drug effects; female; metabolism; pathology; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apigenin; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Female; Flavones; Flow Cytometry; Forkhead Box Protein O3; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Humans; Luteolin; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-84959099909

Heart transplantation is a promising way to treat this. Because donor resources are limited, cell-based therapy has been developed as an alternative. Therefore, genes that trigger cardiogenesis could have potential in the treatment of heart disease. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is reported to stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation under conditions of myocardial infarction, but little is known about its function during cardiac differentiation. In this study, we established an in vitro cardiogenesis model through a reliable chemical induction protocol to determine whether FGF1 and its gene expression are involved in cardiogenesis. Oxytocin, not only a well-known hormone but also a cardiac differentiation inducer, was used in a mouse embryonic stem cell line, E14Tg2a, to achieve cardiac differentiation. After differentiation, beating cell clusters appeared and the expression of FGF1B mRNA was upregulated in the late differentiation stage (differentiation days 8-14). Interestingly, FGF1B expression patterns during cardiac differentiation were similar to those of a mature cardiomyocyte marker, troponin T2, cardiac. The blockage of FGF1-FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling reduced not only the appearance of beating cluster formation but also the expression levels of cardiomyocyte-associated genes. Moreover, by investigating FGF1 downstream signaling cascades, we observed that the efficiency of beating cluster formation was mainly regulated through the FGF1-FGFR-PKC signaling axis. Taken together, we provide evidence to support that FGF1 could regulate cardiogenesis primarily through the protein kinase C signaling, but not through the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, pathway. ? 2015 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"alkaline phosphatase; fibroblast growth factor 1; fibroblast growth factor 1B; fibroblast growth factor receptor; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; octamer transcription factor 4; oxytocin; protein kinase C epsilon; transcription factor GATA 4; transcription factor NANOG; troponin T; unclassified drug; fibroblast growth factor 1; fibroblast growth factor receptor; oxytocin; protein kinase C; troponin T; animal cell; Article; cell differentiation; cell fate; cell proliferation; controlled study; embryo; embryonic stem cell; gene expression; heart development; heart muscle cell; in vitro study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; upregulation; animal; cardiac muscle cell; cell differentiation; cell line; cytology; drug effects; genetics; metabolism; second messenger; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Embryonic Stem Cells; Fibroblast Growth Factor 1; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxytocin; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Kinase C; Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor; Second Messenger Systems; Troponin T",2-s2.0-84983189409

However, in addition to the inherent challenges of hydrophobicity and low abundance, complete membrane proteome coverage of clinical specimen is usually hindered by the requirement of large amount of starting materials. Toward comprehensive membrane proteomic profiling for small amounts of samples (10 μg), we developed high-pH reverse phase (Hp-RP) combined with stop-and-go extraction tip (StageTip) technique, as a fast (?15 min.), sensitive, reproducible, high-resolution and multiplexed fractionation method suitable for accurate quantification of the membrane proteome. This approach provided almost 2-fold enhanced detection of peptides encompassing transmembrane helix (TMH) domain, as compared with strong anion exchange (SAX) and strong cation exchange (SCX) StageTip techniques. Almost 5000 proteins (?60% membrane proteins) can be identified in only 10 μg of membrane protein digests, showing the superior sensitivity of the Hp-RP StageTip approach. The method allowed up to 9- and 6-fold increase in the identification of unique hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides, respectively. The Hp-RP StageTip method enabled in-depth membrane proteome profiling of 11 lung cancer cell lines harboring different EGFR mutation status, which resulted in the identification of 3983 annotated membrane proteins. This provides the largest collection of reference peptide spectral data for lung cancer membrane subproteome.

This herb is used to validate a target-based drug screening platform called Herbochip? and evaluate anti-inflammatory effects of Geranium wilfordii ethanolic extract (GWE) using tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) as a drug target together with subsequent in vitro and in vivo assays. Methods: A microarray-based drug screening platform was constructed by arraying HPLC fractions of herbal extracts onto a surface-activated polystyrene slide (Herbochip?). Using TNF-α as a molecular probe, fractions of 82 selected herbal extracts, including GWE, were then screened to identify plant extracts containing TNF-α-binding agents. Cytotoxicity of GWE and modulatory effects of GWE on TNF-α expression were evaluated by cell-based assays using TNF-α sensitive murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells as an in vitro model. Results: The in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of GWE were further assessed by animal models including carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats and xylene-induced ear edema in mice, in comparison with aspirin. The hybridization data obtained by Herbochip? analysis showed unambiguous signals which confirmed TNF-α binding activity in 46 herbal extracts including GWE. In L929 cells GWE showed significant inhibitory effect on TNF-α expression with negligible cytotoxicity. GWE also significantly inhibited formation of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema and xylene-induced ear edema in animal models, indicating that it indeed possessed anti-inflammatory activity. Conclusion: We have thus validated effectiveness of the Herbochip? drug screening platform using TNF-α as a molecular target. Subsequent experiments on GWE lead us to conclude that the anti-RA activity of GWE can be attributed to inhibitory effect of GWE on the key inflammatory factor, TNF-α. Our results contribute towards validation of the traditional use of GWE in the treatment of RA and other inflammatory joint disorders. ? 2015 Huang et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Anti-inflammatory; Anti-rheumatoid arthritis; Geraniaceae; Geranium wilfordii; Herbochip; TNF-alpha,"Acacia spinosa extract; Acer garrettii extract; acetylsalicylic acid; Achyranthes bidentata extract; Aconitum carmichaeli extract; Allemanda blanchetii extract; Amomum kravanh extract; Angelica pubescens extract; Angelica sinensis extract; antiinflammatory agent; antineoplastic agent; antirheumatic agent; Atractylodes chinensis extract; Atractylodes macrocephala extract; Blinkworthia lycioides extract; Cachlosbermum regium extract; Callisia fragrans extract; Campylotropis yunnanensis extract; Centrolobium ochroxylum extract; Chaenomeles speciosa extract; Chaetocarpus castanocarpus extract; Cinchona succirubra extract; Cinnamomum burmannii extract; Cinnamomum cassia extract; Citrus reticulata extract; Clematis chinesis extract; Geranium wilfordii extract; plant extract; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antiinflammatory agent; carrageenan; herbaceous agent; tumor necrosis factor alpha; xylene; Acacia spinosa; Acer garrettii; Aconitum carmichaelii; Amomum kravanh; Angelica pubescens; animal cell; antiinflammatory activity; antirheumatic activity; apoptosis; Article; Atractylodes chinensis; Blinkworthia lycioides; Cachlosbermum regium; Callisia fragrans; Campylotropis yunnanensis; cell assay; Centrolobium ochroxylum; Chaenomeles speciosa; Cinchona succirubra; Cinnamomum burmannii; Clematis chinesis; controlled study; drug activity; drug cytotoxicity; drug protein binding; drug screening; drug targeting; ear edema; fibrosarcoma cell; fractionation; Geranium; Geranium wilfordii; high throughput screening; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; mandarin; medicinal plant; microarray kit; molecular probe; mouse; nonhuman; paw edema; protein expression; protein targeting; validation process; animal; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; cell line; chemically induced; chemistry; China; edema; inflammation; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; male; metabolism; microarray analysis; phytotherapy; procedures; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Carrageenan; Cell Line; China; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Edema; Geranium; Inflammation; Male; Mice, Inbred ICR; Microarray Analysis; Phytotherapy; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Xylenes",2-s2.0-84938972550

However, regulations of this signaling pathway are not completely understood. Here, we report that Lzap, a tumor suppressor, controls nuclear translocation of β-catenin. In zebrafish embryos disruption of lzap increases the expression of chordin (chd), which encodes a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist that is localized in prospective dorsal cells and promotes dorsal fates. Consistently, lzap-deficient embryos with attenuatedBMPsignaling are dorsalized, which can be rescued by overexpression of zebrafish lzap or bmp2b or human LZAP. The expansion of chd expression in embryos lacking lzap is due to the accumulation of nuclear β-catenin in ventral cells, in which β-catenin is usually degraded. Furthermore, the activity of GSK3, a master regulator ofβ-catenin degradation, is suppressed in lzap-deficient embryos via inhibitory phosphorylation. Finally, we also report that a similar regulatory axis is also likely to be present in a human tongue carcinoma cell line, SAS. Our results reveal that Lzap is a novel regulator of GSK3 for the maintenance of ventral cell properties and may prevent carcinogenesis via the regulation of β-catenin degradation. ? 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Cell culture; Cells; Cytology; Phosphorylation; Tumors; Bone morphogenetic proteins; Catenin degradation; Glycogen synthase kinase-3; Master regulators; Metazoan development; Nuclear translocations; Signaling pathways; Tumor suppressors; Cell signaling; beta catenin; chordin; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; glycogen synthase kinase 3; messenger RNA; protein kinase C; protein Lzap; tumor suppressor protein; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; beta catenin; glycogen synthase kinase 3; Lzap protein, zebrafish; tumor suppressor protein; Wnt protein; zebrafish protein; 5' untranslated region; animal cell; Article; bioaccumulation; bmp2b gene; bmp4 gene; bmp7a gene; carcinoma cell line; cell fate; cellular distribution; chd gene; controlled study; embryo; embryo cell; embryonic ventral cell; enzyme activity; enzyme inactivation; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme repression; gene; gene activation; gene disruption; gene expression regulation; gene overexpression; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; intracellular signaling; lzap gene; molecular dynamics; noggin 1 gene; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; tongue carcinoma cell line; upregulation; zebra fish; animal; cell lineage; embryology; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology; signal transduction; tumor suppressor gene; Animals; beta Catenin; Cell Lineage; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Wnt Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-84949645208

The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the HDR 192 Ir dose distribution in cervical cancer patients when performing brachytherapy using a metal-containing applicator. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) measurements and Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) code were used to explore the doses to the rectum and bladder when using a Henschke applicator containing metal during brachytherapy. When the applicator was assumed to be present, the absolute dose difference between the TLD measurement and MCNPX simulation values was within approximately 5%. A comparison of the MCNPX simulation and TPS calculation values revealed that the TPS overestimated the International Commission of Radiation Units and Measurement (ICRU) rectum and bladder reference doses by 57.78% and 49.59%, respectively. We therefore suggest that the TPS should be modified to account for the shielding effects of the applicator to ensure the accuracy of the delivered doses.",,"metal; bladder; brachytherapy; computer simulation; human; Monte Carlo method; procedures; radiometry; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; rectum; Brachytherapy; Computer Simulation; Humans; Metals; Monte Carlo Method; Radiometry; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Rectum; Urinary Bladder",2-s2.0-84949644739

A correct EV typing result is crucial for effective medical treatment and disease control; however, the emergence of novel viral strains has impaired the performance of available diagnostic tools. Here, we present a web-based tool, named EVIDENCE (EnteroVirus In DEep conception, http://symbiont.iis.sinica.edu.tw/evidence ), for EV genotyping and recombination detection. We introduce the idea of using mixed-ranking scores to evaluate the fitness of prototypes based on relatedness and on the genome regions of interest. Using phylogenetic methods, the most possible genotype is determined based on the closest neighbor among the selected references. To detect possible recombination events, EVIDENCE calculates the sequence distance and phylogenetic relationship among sequences of all sliding windows scanning over the whole genome. Detected recombination events are plotted in an interactive figure for viewing of fine details. In addition, all EV sequences available in GenBank were collected and revised using the latest classification and nomenclature of EV in EVIDENCE. These sequences are built into the database and are retrieved in an indexed catalog, or can be searched for by keywords or by sequence similarity. EVIDENCE is the first web-based tool containing pipelines for genotyping and recombination detection, with updated, built-in, and complete reference sequences to improve sensitivity and specificity. The use of EVIDENCE can accelerate genotype identification, aiding clinical diagnosis and enhancing our understanding of EV evolution. ? 2015 Lin et al.",,"Article; controlled study; Enterovirus; Enterovirus A; Enterovirus B; Enterovirus C; genetic distance; genetic recombination; genetic similarity; genome analysis; genotype; nonhuman; phylogeny; sensitivity and specificity; sequence analysis; strain identification; virus detection; virus genome; virus strain; biology; classification; Enterovirus; genetic database; genetic recombination; genetics; genotyping technique; molecular evolution; procedures; software; virus RNA; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Enterovirus; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Viral; Genotyping Techniques; Phylogeny; Recombination, Genetic; RNA, Viral; Software",2-s2.0-84969277614

The development of systems biology has let scientists reveal more hidden mechanisms of cancers, but attempts to apply systems biology to cancer therapies remain at preliminary stages. Our lab has successfully developed various systems biology models for several cancers. Based on these achievements, we present the first attempt to combine multiple-target therapy with systems biology. Methods: In our previous study, we identified 28 significant proteins - i.e., common core network markers - of four types of cancers as house-keeping proteins of these cancers. In this study, we ranked these proteins by summing their carcinogenesis relevance values (CRVs) across the four cancers, and then performed docking and pharmacophore modeling to do virtual screening on the NCI database for anti-cancer drugs. We also performed pathway analysis on these proteins using Panther and MetaCore to reveal more mechanisms of these cancer house-keeping proteins. Results: We designed several approaches to discover targets for multiple-target cocktail therapies. In the first one, we identified the top 20 drugs for each of the 28 cancer house-keeping proteins, and analyzed the docking pose to further understand the interaction mechanisms of these drugs. After screening for duplicates, we found that 13 of these drugs could target 11 proteins simultaneously. In the second approach, we chose the top 5 proteins with the highest summed CRVs and used them as the drug targets. We built a pharmacophore and applied it to do virtual screening against the Life-Chemical library for anti-cancer drugs. Based on these results, wet-lab bio-scientists could freely investigate combinations of these drugs for multiple-target therapy for cancers, in contrast to the traditional single target therapy. Conclusions: Combination of systems biology with computer-aided drug design could help us develop novel drug cocktails with multiple targets. We believe this will enhance the efficiency of therapeutic practice and lead to new directions for cancer therapy. ? 2015 Wong et al.",core network marker; ligand-based CADD; Multiple drug targets; pharmacophore; structure-based CADD; systems biology; virtual screening,"BRCA1 protein; CEBPB protein; CREBBP protein; CTNNB1 protein; CUL1 protein; CUL3 protein; cyclin dependent kinase 2; E1A associated p300 protein; ESR1 protein; histone deacetylase 1; histone deacetylase 2; histone deacetylase 4; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1; ISG15 protein; KIAA0101 protein; Myc protein; PCNA protein; PRKDC protein; protein; protein MDM2; protein p53; PSMA3 protein; RB1 protein; SRC protein; telomeric repeat binding factor 1; tumor marker; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2; UBC protein; unclassified drug; XRCC6 protein; YWHAZ protein; ligand; analytical parameters; Article; carcinogenesis relevance value; drug design; drug screening; drug targeting; human; mathematical analysis; molecular docking; pharmacophore; priority journal; protein structure; protein targeting; chemistry; computer aided design; computer interface; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; Neoplasms; procedures; sequence homology; systems biology; Biomarkers, Tumor; Computer-Aided Design; Drug Design; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Ligands; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasms; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Systems Biology; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-84962423441

Recent studies further provided insights into the coordinated patterns of post-stroke gene expressions and the relationships between neurodegenerative diseases and neural function recovery processes after a stroke. Results: Differential protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) were constructed at 3 post-stroke time points, and proteins with a significant stroke relevance value (SRV) were discovered. Genes, including UBC, CUL3, APP, NEDD8, JUP, and SIRT7, showed high associations with time after a stroke, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis results showed that these post-stroke time series-associated genes were related to molecular and cellular functions of cell death, cell survival, the cell cycle, cellular development, cellular movement, and cell-to-cell signaling and interactions. These biomarkers may be helpful for the early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Conclusions: This is our first attempt to use our theory of a systems biology framework on strokes. We focused on 3 key post-stroke time points. We identified the network and corresponding network biomarkers for the 3 time points, further studies are needed to experimentally confirm the findings and compare them with the causes of ischemic stroke. Our findings showed that stroke-associated biomarker genes at different time points were significantly involved in cell cycle processing, including G2-M, G1-S and meiosis, which contributes to the current understanding of the etiology of stroke.

Intercellular transport is related to many diseases and nanotubes are potentially useful as drug-delivery channels for cancer therapy. Here, we apply fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) as a photostable tracker, as well as a protein carrier, to illustrate the transport events in TNTs of human cells. Proteins, including bovine serum albumin and green fluorescent protein, are first coated on 100-nm FNDs by physical adsorption and then single-particle tracking of the bioconjugates in the transient membrane connections is carried out by fluorescence microscopy. Stop-and-go and to-and-fro motions mediated by molecular motors are found for the active transport of protein-loaded FNDs trapped in the endosomal vehicles of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). Quantitative analysis of the heterotypical transport between HEK293T and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by flow cytometry confirm the formation of open-ended nanotubes between them, despite that their TNTs differ in structural components. Our results demonstrate the promising applications of this novel carbon-based nanomaterial for intercellular delivery of biomolecular cargo down to the single-particle level. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) provide a unique intercellular communication pathway through which transport of proteins, vesicles, and organelles occurs.

This has created a bottleneck for microfluidic systems to perform high-throughput experiments due to requirement of a costly time-lapse microscopy system. Here, we describe the development of a portable microfluidic device for endpoint analysis of cell motility. The reported device incorporates a cell alignment feature to position the seeded cells on the same initial location, so that the cells' motilities can be analyzed based on their locations at the end of the experiment after the cells have migrated.

Multiple blood samples detection of CTCs during a course of treatment might facilitate a choice by a medical doctor of an effective drug and a treatment for particular patients. A simple and cost-effective method to identify the trend of decreasing CTCs during a treatment with various therapies is in great demand. A novel multilayer, concentric filter device combined with an immune-binding method enables the enrichment and detection of rare cells in a mass cell population with a separation based on size. Such separation implemented with a filter is among the most efficient, simple and inexpensive methods to isolate cells, but its main disadvantages are clogging, deformation of cells, and a requirement of a significant difference of size between targeted rare cells and normal cells. We designed a concentric filter device and an immune-binding method to create a significant size difference of target cells, and increased the efficiency of separation to identify rare cells with a simple miniature centrifuge in the laboratory. The enrichment of target rare cells from a mass cell population and the detection were demonstrated on mixing targeted MCF-7 blast cancer cells and Jurkat blood cells in ratio 1:1 000 000.

Both platelet count and platelet adhesion are crucial to stop bleeding. Although eltrombopag is known to improve platelet counts, its effects on platelet adhesion are not yet known. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of eltrombopag on platelet production and platelet adhesive affinity. To evaluate the efficacy of low-dose eltrombopag (25 mg) for patients with chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and to determine the ex vivo platelet adhesion ability before and after treatment with eltrombopag, we conducted an open-label, multicenter study in which 25 Taiwanese patients with chronic ITP were enrolled. During the 6-month evaluation, the starting and maximum doses of eltrombopag were 25 and 50 mg, respectively, to maintain the platelet count of ?50,000 per μL. Flow-based adhesion assay was used to detect the percentage of platelets adhering to immobilized von Willebrand factor-collagen on microslides. Of the enrolled patients, 48% achieved a platelet count of ?50,000 per μL. Interestingly, 83% of all responders required 25 mg of eltrombopag daily to achieve the target platelet count. In addition, the percentage of bleeding patients was significantly reduced in both responders and nonresponders by 50% from the baseline level throughout the treatment period. The ex vivo platelet adhesion capacity was elevated after the 6-month eltrombopag treatment in both responders and nonresponders. Furthermore, glycoprotein VI (GPVI) expression was significantly upregulated after treatment with eltrombopag. Low-to-intermediate dose of eltrombopag showed good efficacy to expedite platelet production and augment platelet adhesion.

In this approach, a customized system is used to project light images on a photoconductive substrate in order to create localized virtual electrodes when an alternating electric field is applied across the fluidic medium in an optically controlled digital electropolymerization chip. Upon these virtual electrodes, the localized electric fields are generated, which could activate the polymerization of acrylate-based molecules, such as poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), to form microstructures with the same shapes as the projected light images. We have demonstrated that the 3-D PEGDA microstructures with the customized shapes could be fabricated rapidly through a layer-by-layer process by applying a series of digital masks (projected light images). With our current projection and microscopy system, the fabrication of microhydrogel structures with a lateral resolution of 3 μm and an adjustable thickness ranging from tens of nanometers to hundreds of micrometers has been demonstrated. In summary, this novel technique provides an efficient process for the rapid printing of the 3-D biopolymer-based microstructures, and could enable many future applications in a mechanoanalysis of cancer cells, tissue engineering, and drug screening. ? 1992-2012 IEEE.",biopolymer; micro fabrication; Three-dimensional micro structures; tissue engineering,Biomolecules; Cell engineering; Electric fields; Electrodes; Electropolymerization; Microstructure; Polyethylene glycols; Thickness measurement; Tissue engineering; Alternating electric field; Future applications; Hydrogel microstructures; Micro architectures; Optically controlled; Photoconductive substrates; Polyethylene glycol diacrylate; Ultra-violet light; Digital microfluidics,2-s2.0-84959570803

In those biobanks, ""Taiwan Biobank"" is the first and the largest government-supported biobank which comprises population-based cohort study and disease- oriented study. Since the collection of information, data, and biological specimen of biobanks often involve highly sensitive personal information, in the legal framework of Taiwan, there is a specific regulation, ""Human Biobank Management Act"" (HBMA), which plays an important role in regulating biobanks in Taiwan. HBMA, the Personal Information Act and other regulations constitute a comprehensive legal and regulatory privacy framework of biobanks.

Methods: To deduce the same, Tregs were depleted in BALB/c mice by injecting anti-CD25 antibody followed by RSV infection (anti-CD25-RSV mice). Results: In this model, a decrease in anti-fusion (F) antibody and neutralizing activity, and an increase in anti-nucleocapsid (N) antibody in serum, were seen. Decreased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, increased IgG2a, and an influx of activated CD8+ T-cells into the lungs were also observed. Co-culture of splenic CD45RA+ B-cells from RSV-infected normal mice with CD4+ cells isolated from anti-CD25-RSV mice (B/CD4) increased anti-F antibody secretion. The inclusion of CD25+ Tregs isolated from isotype Ig-RSV mice into the B/CD4 co-culture substantially enhanced the frequency of anti-F antibody production. However, the same effect was not seen in the co-culture of CD45RA+ B-cells with dendritic cells (DCs) (B/DCs) or CD8+ cells (B/CD8) that were obtained from anti-CD25-RSV mice. The transfer of enriched B-cells from anti-CD25-RSV mice into RSV-infected SCID mice increased severe lung inflammation associated with the increased viral load and eosinophil number. Conclusions: These results indicate that Tregs modulate B-cell activity, particularly in producing F-specific neutralizing antibodies, to regulate RSV-mediated exacerbated diseases. ? 2015 The Authors.",Antigenicity; B-cells; Regulatory T-cells; Respiratory syncytial virus,"antibody; cd25 antibody; fusion antibody; immunoglobulin G2a; unclassified drug; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; antibody titer; antigenicity; Article; B lymphocyte; CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T lymphocyte; CD45RA+ B lymphocyte; dendritic cell; human; human cell; mouse; nonhuman; regulatory T lymphocyte; respiratory syncytial virus infection; animal; B lymphocyte; Bagg albino mouse; CD8+ T lymphocyte; female; Human respiratory syncytial virus; immunology; lung; pathology; physiology; regulatory T lymphocyte; respiratory syncytial virus infection; SCID mouse; spleen; virology; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; B-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Female; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, SCID; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Viruses; Spleen; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory",2-s2.0-84948971944

Clinical studies have demonstrated that S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) are highly expressed in TNBC. Therefore, therapeutic strategies designed to downregulate LRP6 or Skp2 may play an important clinical role in the treatment of TNBC. However, the regulatory effects of many drugs on Skp2 and LRP6 expression are currently unknown. In the present study, combined treatment with chrysin and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (5GG) synergistically induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in AU565 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the combination of chrysin and 5GG suppressed tumor growth in nude mice with xenografted MDA-MB-231 cells by downregulating the phospho-LRP6 (pLRP6) and Skp2 proteins.

Therefore, identifying the miRNAs expressed in cells/organisms aids in understanding genetic control in cells/organisms. In this report, we determined the binding of oligonucleotides to a receptor-modified silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (SiNW-FET) by monitoring the changes in conductance of the SiNW-FET. We first modified a SiNW-FET with a DNA probe to directly and selectively detect the complementary miRNA in cell lysates. This SiNW-FET device has 7-fold higher sensitivity than reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in detecting the corresponding miRNA. Next, we anchored viral p19 proteins, which bind the double-strand small RNAs (ds-sRNAs), on the SiNW-FET. By perfusing the device with synthesized ds-sRNAs of different pairing statuses, the dissociation constants revealed that the nucleotides at the 3′-overhangs and pairings at the terminus are important for the interactions. After perfusing the total RNA mixture extracted from Nicotiana benthamiana across the device, this device could enrich the ds-sRNAs for sequence analysis.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a primary hepatic cancer, accounts for 90%-95% of liver cancer cases. The pathogenesis of HCC consists of a stepwise process of liver damage that extends over decades, due to hepatitis, fatty liver, fibrosis, and cirrhosis before developing fully into HCC. Multiple risk factors are highly correlated with HCC, including infection with the hepatitis B or C viruses, alcohol abuse, aflatoxin exposure, and metabolic diseases. Over the last decade, genetic alterations, which include the regulation of multiple oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes and the activation of tumorigenesis-related pathways, have also been identified as important factors in HCC. Recently, zebrafish have become an important living vertebrate model organism, especially for translational medical research. In studies focusing on the biology of cancer, carcinogen induced tumors in zebrafish were found to have many similarities to human tumors. Several zebrafish models have therefore been developed to provide insight into the pathogenesis of liver cancer and the related drug discovery and toxicology, and to enable the evaluation of novel smallmolecule inhibitors. This review will focus on illustrative examples involving the application of zebrafish models to the study of human liver disease and HCC, through transgenesis, genome editing technology, xenografts, drug discovery, and drug-induced toxic liver injury. ? 2015 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

These structural insights suggest a possible substrate transport mechanism in which the substrate first binds at the periplasmic entrance of ST50 and subsequently, via iris-like structural movements to open the periplasmic end, penetrates the periplasmic domain for efflux pumping of molecules, including poisonous metabolites or xenobiotics, for excretion outside the pathogen. ? 2015, Nature Publishing Group.

EV71 virus-like particles (VLPs) are empty capsids consisting of viral structural proteins and can elicit potent immune responses, thus holding promise as an EV71 vaccine candidate. However, an efficient, scalable production and purification scheme is missing. For mass production of EV71 VLPs, this study aimed to develop a production and chromatography-based purification process. We first demonstrated the successful EV71 VLPs production in the stirred-tank bioreactor in which High Five? cells were infected with a recombinant baculovirus co-expressing EV71 structural polyprotein P1 and protease 3CD. The culture supernatant containing the VLPs was subjected to tangential flow filtration (TFF) for concentration/diafiltration, which enabled the removal of >80% of proteins while recovering >80% of VLPs. The concentrated VLPs were next subjected to hydroxyapatite chromatography (HAC) in which the VLPs were mainly found in the flow through. After another TFF concentration/diafiltration, the VLPs were purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and concentrated/diafiltered by a final TFF. The integrated process yielded an overall VLPs recovery of ?36% and a purity of ?83%, which was better or comparable to the recovery and purity for the purification of live EV71 virus particles. This process thus may move the EV71 VLPs vaccine one step closer to the clinical applications. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Chromatography; Downstream processing; Enterovirus 71; Purification; Vaccine; Virus-like particle,"virus protein; recombinant protein; virosome; virus like particle vaccine; anion exchange; antigenicity; Article; cell viability; cytolysis; diafiltration; Enterovirus 71; immune response; isoelectric point; large scale production; molecular weight; nonhuman; priority journal; size exclusion chromatography; vaccine production; virus like agent; virus particle; virus purification; animal; Baculoviridae; bioreactor; cell line; Enterovirus A; filtration; genetics; growth, development and aging; insect; isolation and purification; liquid chromatography; procedures; Animals; Baculoviridae; Bioreactors; Cell Line; Chromatography, Gel; Chromatography, Liquid; Enterovirus A, Human; Filtration; Insects; Recombinant Proteins; Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle; Virosomes",2-s2.0-84947486820

An elution technique and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit were used to determine the rhPDGF-BB release rates in vitro and in vivo from this membrane. Eighteen Sprague-Dawley streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were randomized into 3 groups: rhPDGF-BB-loaded nanofibrous membrane group, PLGA only membrane group, and conventional gauze sponge group for the wound associated with diabetes of rat in each group. The nanofibrous biodegradable membranes released effective concentrations of rhPDGF-BB for over 21 days. The nanofibrous rhPDGFBB-loaded PLGA membranes contained more water and were further hydrophilic than PLGA only fibers. The rhPDGF-BB-loaded PLGA membranes considerably helped the diabetic wounds repairing. Furthermore, the proliferative cells and angiogenesis of rats associated with diabetes by rhPDGF-BB-loaded nanofibrous membranes were greater than those of other groups, owing to the increased matrix metalloproteinase 9. These biodegradable rhPDGF-BB-loaded membranes were effective in treating diabetic wounds as very advanced accelerators during the initial phases of wound-healing process. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

They have also been gaining importance in nanotechnology applications. Understanding the mechanisms behind amyloid formation can help develop strategies towards the prevention of fibrillation processes or create new technological applications. It is thus essential to observe the structures of amyloids and their self-assembly processes at the nanometer-scale resolution under physiological conditions. In this work, we used highly force-sensitive frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) to characterize the fibril structures formed by the N-terminal domain of a bacterial division protein MinE in solution. The approach enables us to investigate the fibril morphology and protofibril organization over time progression and in response to changes in ionic strength, molecular crowding, and upon association with different substrate surfaces. In addition to comparison of the fibril structure and behavior of MinE1-31 under varying conditions, the study also broadens our understanding of the versatile behavior of amyloid-substrate surface interactions. ? 2015 Chiang et al.

However, the only clinically approved systemic antiangiogenic agent for advanced HCC is sorafenib, which exerts considerable toxicity. Moreover, acquired resistance to antiangiogenic therapy often develops and restricts the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment. Hence, in this study, we develop a CXCR4-targeted lipid-based nanoparticle (NP) formulation to specifically deliver vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) siRNA as an antiangiogenic substance into HCC. AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, is added into NPs to serve as both a targeting moiety and a sensitizer to antiangiogenic therapy. We demonstrate that AMD-modified NPs (AMD-NPs) can efficiently deliver VEGF siRNAs into HCC and downregulate VEGF expression in vitro and in vivo. Despite the upregulation of the SDF1α/CXCR4 axis upon the induction of hypoxia after antiangiogenic therapy, CXCR4 inhibition by AMD-NPs in combination with either conventional sorafenib treatment or VEGF siRNA prevents the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages. These dual treatments also induce synergistic antiangiogenic effects and suppress local and distant tumor growth in HCC. In conclusion, the tumor-targeted multifunctional AMD-NPs that co-deliver VEGF siRNA and AMD3100 provide an effective approach for overcoming tumor evasion of antiangiogenic therapy, leading to delayed tumor progression in HCC. ? 2015 The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy.",,"antineoplastic agent; chemokine receptor CXCR4; chemokine receptor CXCR4 antagonist; nanoparticle; plerixafor; small interfering RNA; sorafenib; stromal cell derived factor 1alpha; vasculotropin; angiogenesis inhibitor; carbanilamide derivative; chemokine receptor CXCR4; heterocyclic compound; nanoparticle; nicotinamide; plerixafor; small interfering RNA; sorafenib; stromal cell derived factor 1; vasculotropin A; advanced cancer; animal experiment; antiangiogenic activity; Article; controlled study; down regulation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cancer; liver cell carcinoma; male; mouse; nonhuman; treatment response; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; upregulation; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; C3H mouse; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; disease course; gene therapy; genetics; Liver Neoplasms; metabolism; Neovascularization, Pathologic; signal transduction; tumor cell line; vascularization; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemokine CXCL12; Disease Progression; Genetic Therapy; Heterocyclic Compounds; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C3H; Nanoparticles; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Niacinamide; Phenylurea Compounds; Receptors, CXCR4; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Tumor Microenvironment; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",2-s2.0-84948718039

The development of artificial tissues with large dimensions that exceed the diffusion limitation will require nutrients and oxygen to be delivered via perfusion instead of diffusion alone over a short time period. One approach to perfusion is to vascularize engineered tissues, creating a de novo three-dimensional (3D) microvascular network within the tissue construct. This significantly shortens the time of in vivo anastomosis, perfusion and graft integration with the host. In this study, we aimed to develop injectable allogeneic collagen-phenolic hydroxyl (collagen-Ph) hydrogels that are capable of controlling a wide range of physicochemical properties, including stiffness, water absorption and degradability. We tested whether collagen-Ph hydrogels could support the formation of vascularized engineered tissue graft by human blood-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in vivo. First, we studied the growth of adherent ECFCs and MSCs on or in the hydrogels. To examine the potential formation of functional vascular networks in vivo, a liquid pre-polymer solution of collagen-Ph containing human ECFCs and MSCs, horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide was injected into the subcutaneous space or abdominal muscle defect of an immunodeficient mouse before gelation, to form a 3D cell-laden polymerized construct. These results showed that extensive human ECFC-lined vascular networks can be generated within 7 days, the engineered vascular density inside collagen-Ph hydrogel constructs can be manipulated through refinable mechanical properties and proteolytic degradability, and these networks can form functional anastomoses with the existing vasculature to further support the survival of host muscle tissues. Finally, optimized conditions of the cell-laden collagen-Ph hydrogel resulted in not only improving the long-term differentiation of transplanted MSCs into mineralized osteoblasts, but the collagen-Ph hydrogel also improved an increased of adipocytes within the vascularized bioengineered tissue in a mouse after 1 month of implantation. Statement of Significance We reported a method for preparing autologous extracellular matrix scaffolds, murine collagen-Ph hydrogels, and demonstrated its suitability for use in supporting human progenitor cell-based formation of 3D vascular networks in vitro and in vivo. Results showed extensive human vascular networks can be generated within 7 days, engineered vascular density inside collagen-Ph constructs can be manipulated through refinable mechanical properties and proteolytic degradability, and these networks can form functional anastomoses with existing vasculature to further support the survival of host muscle tissues.

Two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, PC9 and gefitinib-resistant PC9/Gef, were established for examining resistance mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used for examining global protein expression changes between PC9 and PC9/Gef. The results revealed that 164 identified proteins were associated with the formation of gefitinib resistance in PC9 cells. Additional studies using RNA interference showed that progesterone receptor membrane component 1 and pericentrin proteins have major roles in gefitinib resistance.

In the present study we reveal a combination of IFN-γ-irreversible structural and epigenetic defects in HLA class I antigen-processing machinery in a recurrent melanoma metastasis after immunotherapy. These defects include loss of tapasin and one HLA haplotype as well as selective silencing of HLA-A3 gene responsiveness to IFN-γ. Tapasin loss is caused by a germ-line frameshift mutation in exon 3 (TAPBP684delA) along with a somatic loss of the other gene copy. Selective silencing of HLA-A3 gene and its IFN-γ responsiveness is associated with promoter CpG methylation nearby site-α and TATA box, reversible after DNA methyltransferase 1 depletion. This treatment combined with tapasin reconstitution and IFN-γ stimulation restored the highest level of HLA class I expression and its ability to elicit cytotoxic T cell responses. These results represent a novel tumor immune evasion mechanism through impairing multiple components at various levels in the HLA class I antigen presentation pathway.

Yet IGA remains the dominant mode of analysis of gene expression data. The Connectivity Map (CMap), an extensive database on genomic profiles of effects of drugs and small molecules and widely used for studies related to repurposed drug discovery, has been mostly employed in IGA mode. Here, we constructed a GSA-based version of CMap, Gene-Set Connectivity Map (GSCMap), in which all the genomic profiles in CMap are converted, using gene-sets from the Molecular Signatures Database, to functional profiles. We showed that GSCMap essentially eliminated cell-type dependence, a weakness of CMap in IGA mode, and yielded significantly better performance on sample clustering and drug-target association. As a first application of GSCMap we constructed the platform Gene-Set Local Hierarchical Clustering (GSLHC) for discovering insights on coordinated actions of biological functions and facilitating classification of heterogeneous subtypes on drug-driven responses. GSLHC was shown to tightly clustered drugs of known similar properties. We used GSLHC to identify the therapeutic properties and putative targets of 18 compounds of previously unknown characteristics listed in CMap, eight of which suggest anti-cancer activities. The GSLHC website http://cloudr.ncu.edu.tw/gslhc/ contains 1,857 local hierarchical clusters accessible by querying 555 of the 1,309 drugs and small molecules listed in CMap.

Here, we present solution structures of an activated BAX oligomer by means of spectroscopic and scattering methods, providing details about the monomer-monomer interfaces in the oligomer and how the oligomer is assembled from homodimers. We show that this soluble oligomer undergoes a direct conversion into membrane-inserted oligomer, which has the ability of inducing apoptosis and structurally resembles a membrane-embedded oligomer formed from BAX monomers in lipid environment. Structural differences between the soluble and the membrane-inserted oligomers are manifested in the C-terminal helices.

We isolated a mutant, m2, that showed a 23% increase in survival time under starvation conditions. The P-element insertion was mapped to the region upstream of the vha16-1 gene, which encodes the c subunit of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. We found that vha16-1 is highly expressed in the fly midgut, and that m2 mutant flies are hypomorphic for vha16-1 and also exhibit reduced midgut acidity. This deficit is likely to induce altered metabolism and contribute to accelerated aging, since vha16-1 mutant flies are short-lived and display increases in body weight and lipid accumulation. Similar phenotypes were also induced by pharmacological treatment, through feeding normal flies and mice with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide) or proton pump inhibitor (PPI, lansoprazole) to suppress gut acid production.

Nucleus-targeting nanomaterials are very rare. It is a grand challenge to design highly efficient nucleus-targeting multifunctional nanomaterials that are able to perform simultaneous bioimaging and therapy for the destruction of cancer cells. Here, unique nucleus-targeting gold nanoclusters (TAT peptide-Au NCs) are designed to perform simultaneous in vitro and in vivo fluorescence imaging, gene delivery, and near-infrared (NIR) light activated photodynamic therapy for effective cancer cell killing. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations reveal that TAT peptide-Au NCs are distributed throughout the cytoplasm region with a significant fraction entering into the nucleus. The TAT peptide-Au NCs can also act as DNA nanocargoes to achieve very high gene transfection efficiencies (?81%) in HeLa cells and in zebrafish. Furthermore, TAT peptide-Au NCs are also able to sensitize formation of singlet oxygen (1O<inf>2</inf>) without the co-presence of organic photosensitizers for the destruction of cancer cells upon NIR light photoexcitation. A unique nucleus-targeting gold nanocluster(TAT peptide-Au NC)-based multifunctional theranostic platform is designed to perform simultaneous in vitro and in vivo cellular fluorescence imaging, gene delivery, and intrinsic near infrared light-activated photodynamic therapy.

To produce the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine, we previously constructed recombinant baculoviruses to co-express EV71 P1 polypeptide and 3CD protease using the Bac-to-Bac? vector system. The recombinant baculoviruses resulted in P1 cleavage by 3CD and subsequent VLP assembly in infected insect cells, but caused either low VLP yield or excessive VLP degradation. To tackle the problems, here we explored various expression cassette designs and flashBAC GOLD? vector system which was deficient in v-cath and chiA genes. We found that the recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD? system was insufficient to improve the EV71 VLP yield. Nonetheless, BacF-P1-C3CD, a recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLDTM system to express P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the CMV promoter, dramatically improved the VLP yield while alleviating the VLP degradation. Infection of High FiveTM cells with BacF-P1-C3CD enhanced the total and extracellular VLP yield to ?268 and ?171mg/L, respectively, which enabled the release of abundant VLP into the supernatant and simplified the downstream purification. Intramuscular immunization of mice with 5μg purified VLP induced cross-protective humoral responses and conferred protection against lethal virus challenge. Given the significantly improved extracellular VLP yield (?171mg/L) and the potent immunogenicity conferred by 5μg VLP, one liter High FiveTM culture produced ?12,000 doses of purified vaccine, thus rendering the EV71 VLP vaccine economically viable and able to compete with inactivated virus vaccines. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Baculovirus; EV71; Hand-foot-and-mouth disease; Protease; Vaccine; VLP,"Gene expression; Gold; Purification; Vaccines; Baculovirus; EV71; Foot and mouth disease; Protease; VLP; Viruses; baculovirus vector; Enterovirus 71 virus like particle vaccine; recombinant vaccine; unclassified drug; virus like particle vaccine; recombinant protein; virosome; virus antibody; virus like particle vaccine; virus protein; 3CD gene; animal experiment; Article; Baculoviridae; chiA gene; controlled study; Cytomegalovirus; Enterovirus 71; female; gene expression; humoral immunity; immune response; immunization; immunogenicity; mouse; nonhuman; polh gene; promoter region; v cath gene; virus gene; virus like agent; virus recombinant; Western blotting; animal; Asia; blood; disease model; Enterovirus A; Enterovirus Infections; gene vector; genetics; immunology; insect; intramuscular drug administration; metabolism; survival analysis; Hexapoda; Human enterovirus 71; Mus; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Asia; Baculoviridae; Disease Models, Animal; Enterovirus A, Human; Enterovirus Infections; Genetic Vectors; Injections, Intramuscular; Insects; Mice; Recombinant Proteins; Survival Analysis; Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle; Viral Proteins; Virosomes",2-s2.0-84940467176

Approaches that enhance monocyte tumor homing and promote their migration will improve the clinical value of these cells as cellular carriers. Previous studies have shown that irradiation (IR) can promote macrophage aggregation in hypoxic regions. To investigate whether IR enhances the infiltration of bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) into tumors, the infiltration of BMDMs from GFP-transgenic mice in a murine prostate adenocarcinoma TRAMP-C1 model was examined by fluorescence microscopy. IR did not increase the number of BMDMs that infiltrated initially, but did increase monocyte retention within IR-treated tumors for up to 2 weeks. We also showed that BMDMs can take up various imaging and therapeutic agents, although the mobility of BMDMs decreased with increasing load. When BMDMs were differentiated in IR-treated tumor-conditioned medium (IR-CM) in vitro, the nanoparticle load-mediated inhibition of migration was attenuated. These IR-CM-differentiated BMDMs delivered polymer vesicles encapsulating doxorubicin to radiation therapy (RT)-induced hypoxic tumor regions, and enhanced the efficacy of RT. The prolonged retention of monocytes within irradiated tumor tissues and the ability of IR-CM to enhance the migratory ability of cargo-laden BMDMs suggest that monocytes preconditioned by IR-CM can potentially act as cellular carriers for targeted therapy following conventional RT. ? 2015 Jiang et al.",,"doxorubicin; nanoparticle; antineoplastic antibiotic; conditioned medium; doxorubicin; nanoparticle; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone marrow derived monocyte; cancer inhibition; cancer radiotherapy; cell count; cell differentiation; cell infiltration; cell migration; cell motility; controlled study; drug delivery system; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; migration inhibition; monocyte; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; prostate adenocarcinoma; therapy effect; adenocarcinoma; animal; C57BL mouse; cell motion; chemistry; conditioned medium; drug effects; enzyme immunoassay; flow cytometry; image processing; monocyte; pathology; pharmacology; Prostatic Neoplasms; radiation response; transgenic mouse; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Culture Media, Conditioned; Doxorubicin; Flow Cytometry; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Monocytes; Nanoparticles; Prostatic Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84947976474

The percolation threshold for electrical conductivity for the nanocomposite prepared through scCO2 mixing was 2 wt%, one-third that obtained after acetone mixing.

Thus, finding a high-affinity inhibitor of Pin1 has become an attractive topic. The WW domain of human Pin1 can recognize the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-proline (pS/pT-P) motifs, while its PPIase domain catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of prolyl bonds to regulate the cell cycle. Here we incorporated a series of 4-substituted proline derivatives into the phosphopeptides and investigated their affinities for the WW domain of Pin1 to develop better inhibitors of Pin1. On the basis of the ligand Myt1-T412 [PPA(pT)PP], we synthesized several phosphopeptides in which the proline residue in the pT-P motif was replaced with various 4-substituted proline derivatives. Isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence anisotropy analyses show that the replacement of proline with (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline increases the binding affinity of the peptide. Circular dichroism measurements suggest that a more PPII-like structure of phosphopeptides makes them bind to the WW domain more tightly. Chemical shift perturbation experiments also indicate that (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline interacts with Trp34 of the WW domain in the binding site. Results of molecular modeling further suggested that a strong C-H?π interaction induced by (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline is important in enhancing the affinity of the peptide for the WW domain. The results of this study provide new valuable information for designing and developing effective inhibitors of human Pin1. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding energy; Binding sites; Bins; Chemical shift; Dichroism; Peptides; Cancer development; Chemical shift perturbations; Circular dichroism measurements; Cis/trans Isomerization; Fluorescence anisotropy; High-affinity inhibitors; Isothermal titration calorimetry; Proline derivatives; Financial markets; 4 fluoroproline; peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1; phosphopeptide; proline; proline derivative; protein inhibitor; unclassified drug; fluoro-proline; NIMA-interacting peptidylprolyl isomerase; peptidylprolyl isomerase; phosphopeptide; protein binding; anisotropy; Article; binding affinity; chemical interaction; chemical modification; circular dichroism; drug binding site; drug design; fluorescence analysis; fluorescence anisotropy; human; isomerization; isothermal titration calorimetry; ligand binding; mass spectrometer; molecular model; molecular recognition; nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; peptide synthesis; priority journal; protein domain; protein motif; protein structure; amino acid sequence; analogs and derivatives; binding site; chemical structure; chemistry; enzyme specificity; metabolism; molecular genetics; protein conformation; protein domain; Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Humans; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptidylprolyl Isomerase; Phosphopeptides; Proline; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Substrate Specificity",2-s2.0-84944036974

Since the statistics of the backscattered ultrasound signals strongly depend on density and spatial arrangement of local scatterers, appropriate modeling of the backscattered signals may be capable of providing unique physiological information on local tissue properties. Among various techniques, the Nakagami imaging, realized in a window-based estimation scheme, has a good performance in assessing different scatterer statistics in tissues. However, inconsistent m values have been reported in literature and obtained only from a local tissue region, abating the reliability of Nakagami imaging in tissue characterization. The discrepancies in m values in relevant literature may stem from the nonuniformity of the ultrasound image resolution, which is often neglected. We therefore hypothesized that window-based Nakagami m estimation was highly associated with the regional spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging. To test this hypothesis, our study investigated the effect of beamforming methods, including synthetic aperture (SA), coherent plane wave compounding (CPWC), multi-focusing (MF), and single-focusing (SF), on window-based m parameter estimation from the perspective of the resolution cell. The statistics of m parameter distribution as a function of imaging depth were characterized by their mean, variance, and skewness. The phantom with a low scatterer density (16 scatterers mm-3) had significantly lower m values compared to the ones with high scatterer densities (32 and 64 scatterers mm-3). Results from the homogeneous phantom with 64 scatterers mm-3 showed that SA, MF, and CPWC had relatively uniform lateral resolutions compared to SF and thus relatively constant m estimates at different imaging depths. Our findings suggest that an ultrasound imaging regime exhibiting invariant spatial resolution throughout the entire imaging field of view would be the most appropriate for Nakagami imaging for tissue characterization. ? 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",backscattering; beamforming; Nakagami distribution; tissue characterization; ultrasound,"Backscattering; Beamforming; Characterization; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Synthetic apertures; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonics; Backscattered signal; Backscattered Ultrasound; M-parameter estimation; Nakagami distribution; Parameter distributions; Physiological informations; Tissue characterization; Ultrasound tissue characterization; Tissue; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; human; image enhancement; imaging phantom; procedures; radiation; radiation scattering; ultrasound; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; High-Energy Shock Waves; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Phantoms, Imaging; Scattering, Radiation; Ultrasonics",2-s2.0-84941711473

The energy transferred from T1 to biological substrates and molecular oxygen, via type I and II reactions, generates reactive oxygen species, (1O2, H2O2, O2*, HO*), which causes cellular damage that leads to tumor cell death through necrosis or apoptosis. The solubility, selectivity, and targeting of photosensitizers are important factors that must be considered in PDT.

Over one-third of these missing proteins are annotated as membrane proteins, owing to their relatively challenging accessibility with standard shotgun proteomics. Using nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a model study, we aim to mine missing proteins from disease-associated membrane proteome, which may be still largely under-represented. To increase identification coverage, we employed Hp-RP StageTip prefractionation of membrane-enriched samples from 11 NSCLC cell lines. Analysis of membrane samples from 20 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal lung tissue was incorporated to include physiologically expressed membrane proteins. Using multiple search engines (X!Tandem, Comet, and Mascot) and stringent evaluation of FDR (MAYU and PeptideShaker), we identified 7702 proteins (66% membrane proteins) and 178 missing proteins (74 membrane proteins) with PSM-, peptide-, and protein-level FDR of 1%. Through multiple reaction monitoring using synthetic peptides, we provided additional evidence of eight missing proteins including seven with transmembrane helix domains. This study demonstrates that mining missing proteins focused on cancer membrane subproteome can greatly contribute to map the whole human proteome.

These models do not reproduce the specific pathophysiological features of HCCs, which occur in cirrhotic livers that show pronounced necroinflammation, abnormal angiogenesis and extensive fibrosis. As these features are crucial for studying the role of the pathologic host microenvironment in tumor initiation, progression and treatment response, alternative HCC models are desirable. Here we describe a syngeneic orthotopic HCC model in immunocompetent mice with liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) that recapitulates key features of human HCC. Induction of substantial hepatic fibrosis requires 12 weeks of CCl 4 administration. Intrahepatic implantation of mouse HCC cell lines requires 30 min per mouse. Tumor growth varies by tumor cell line and mouse strain used. Alternatively, tumors can be induced in a genetically engineered mouse model.

Intranasal immunization of H5HA antigen with recombinant FliC protein in an oil-in-water emulsion increased H5HA-specific IgG and IgA titers in sera, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs), and nasal washes. Use of FliC adjuvant for intranasal immunization further augmented B-cell responses in mucosal environments via increased IgA titers in BALFs and nasal washes. Increases in IgA and IgG titers through the use of FliC adjuvant in intranasal immunization correlated with higher neutralizing antibody titers in sera and BALFs and higher numbers of IgG- and IgA-secreting B cells in spleen and cervical lymph nodes. High levels of IL-17A cytokine production were also found in stimulated T cells of spleen and cervical lymph node cells, only by intranasal immunization particularly with the use of FliC adjuvant in oil-in-water emulsions.

Their protocol uses lightweight hash operation and synchronized secret value shared between back-end server and tag, which is more secure and efficient than other related RFID authentication protocols. Unfortunately, in this paper, we demonstrate that Srivastava et al.’s tag authentication protocol has a serious security problem in that an adversary may use the stolen/lost reader to connect to the medical back-end server that store information associated with tagged objects and this privacy damage causing the adversary could reveal medical data obtained from stolen/lost readers in a malicious way. Therefore, we propose a secure and efficient RFID tag authentication protocol to overcome security flaws and improve the system efficiency.

However, the mechanistic relationship between EMT and the Wnt pathway in CSC is not entirely clear. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) indicated that EMT induces a switch from the β-catenin/E-cadherin/Sox15 complex to the β-catenin/Twist1/TCF4 complex, the latter of which then binds to CSC-related gene promoters. Tandem coimmunoprecipitation and re-ChIP experiments with epithelial-type cells further revealed that Sox15 associates with the β-catenin/E-cadherin complex, which then binds to the proximal promoter region of CASP3. Through this mechanism, Twist1 cleavage is triggered to regulate a β-catenin-elicited promotion of the CSC phenotype. During EMT, we documented that Twist1 binding to β-catenin enhanced the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin/TCF4 complex, including by binding to the proximal promoter region of ABCG2, a CSC marker. In terms of clinical application, our definition of a five-gene CSC signature (nuclear β-catenin High/nuclear Twist1 High/E-cadherin Low/Sox15Low/CD133High) may provide a useful prognostic marker for human lung cancer. ? 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"beta catenin; breast cancer resistance protein; caspase 3; CD133 antigen; protein Sox15; T cell factor 4 protein; transcription factor; transcription factor Twist1; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; beta catenin; cadherin; CD133 antigen; glycoprotein; leukocyte antigen; nuclear protein; peptide; protein binding; SOX15 protein, human; transcription factor Sox; transcription factor Twist; TWIST1 protein, human; ABCG2 gene; animal experiment; animal model; Article; autocrine effect; cancer recurrence; cancer stem cell; carcinogenicity; CASP3 gene; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; human; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung cancer; mouse; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; phenotype; prediction; priority journal; promoter region; protein cleavage; protein protein interaction; transcription regulation; animal; cancer stem cell; DNA microarray; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; immunohistochemistry; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; SCID mouse; tumor cell line; tumor recurrence; Western blotting; Wnt signaling pathway; xenograft; Animals; Antigens, CD; beta Catenin; Blotting, Western; Cadherins; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glycoproteins; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Lung Neoplasms; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Nuclear Proteins; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Peptides; Protein Binding; SOX Transcription Factors; Transplantation, Heterologous; Twist Transcription Factor; Wnt Signaling Pathway",2-s2.0-84942885232

The DOX-loaded SLNs have a mean hydrodynamic diameter of ~100 nm and a low polydispersity index (under 0.20) with a high drug-loading efficiency ranging from 80.8% to 90.6%. The in vitro drug release profiles show that the DOX-loaded SLNs exhibit a pH-controlled drug release behavior with the maximum and minimum unloading percentages of 63.4% at pH 4.7 and 25.2% at pH 7.4, respectively. The DOX-loaded C-PEG-SLNs displayed a superior ability in inhibiting the proliferation of MCF-7/MDR cells. At a DOX concentration of 80 μM, the cell viabilities treated with C-PEG-SLNs were approximately one-third of the group treated with free DOX. The inhibition activity of C-PEG-SLNs could be attributed to the transport of C-PEG to cell membrane, leading to the change of the composition of the cell membrane and thus the inhibition of permeability glycoprotein activity. This hypothesis is supported by the confocal images showing the accumulation of DOX in the nuclei of cancer cells and the localization of C-PEG on the cell membranes. The results of in vivo study further demonstrated that the DOX delivered by the SLNs accumulates predominantly in tumor via enhanced permeability and retention effect, the enhanced passive tumor accumulation due to the loose intercellular junctions of endothelial cells lining inside blood vessels at tumor site, and the lack of lymphatic drainage. The growth of MCF-7/MDR xenografted tumor on Balb/c nude mice was inhibited to ~400 mm3 in volume as compared with the free DOX treatment group, 1,140 mm3, and the group treated with 1,2 distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)] solid lipid nanoparticles, 820 mm3. Analysis of the body weight of nude mice and the histology of organs and tumor after the administration of DOX-loaded SLNs show that the SLNs have no observable side effects.

Upregulated expression of members of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of secreted copper amine oxidases catalyzes the crosslinking of collagens and elastin in the extracellular matrix. LOXs are linked to the development and metastatic progression of breast cancers. Accordingly, aberrant expression of LOX-like 2 (LOXL2) is observed in poorly differentiated, high-grade tumors and is predictive of diseases recurrence, and for decreased overall patient survival. Therefore, LOXL2 expression may serve as a biomarker for breast cancer. Mechanistically, hydrogen peroxide is produced as a byproduct of LOXL2 when using an appropriate substrate, lysine. We exploited this chemistry to generate a revolutionary gold-based electrochemical biosensor capable of accurately detecting nanomolar quantities of LOXL2 in mouse blood, and in human blood samples. Two different sources of the blood samples obtained from breast cancer patients were used in this study indicating the applicability of detecting LOXL2 in breast cancers patients. Limited numbers of urine specimens from breast cancer patients were also tested. Collectively, all of these tests show the promise and potential of this biosensor for detecting LOXL2 as a surrogate biomarker of breast cancer.

To address this issue, this work develops an injectable hollow microsphere (HM) system that carries the anticancer agent irinotecan (CPT-11) and a NO-releasing donor (NONOate). Upon injection of this system into acidic tumor tissue, environmental protons infiltrate the shell of the HMs and react with their encapsulated NONOate to form NO bubbles that trigger localized drug release and serve as a Pgp-mediated MDR reversal agent. The site-specific drug release and the NO-reduced Pgp-mediated transport can cause the intracellular accumulation of the drug at a concentration that exceeds the cell-killing threshold, eventually inducing its antitumor activity. These results reveal that this pH-responsive HM carrier system provides a potentially effective method for treating cancers that develop MDR. Two is better than one: A carrier system is developed that can generate NO bubbles in the acidic environment of tumor tissues to trigger localized drug release (specifically irinotecan, denoted CPT-11) and to reverse Pgp-mediated multidrug resistance (Pgp=P-glycoprotein). The combined system enhances intracellular drug accumulation in cancer cells so that the concentration exceeds the therapeutic threshold, eventually leading to antitumor activity. ? 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the technical difficulties in isolating and detecting rare CTCs have limited the widespread applicability of this method to date. In this work, a new integrated microfluidic system integrating micromixers and micropumps capable of performing 'negative selection and enrichment' of CTCs was developed. By using anti-human CD45 antibodies-coated magnetic beads, leukocytes were effectively removed by applying an external magnetic force, leaving behind an enriched target cell population. The on-chip CTC recovery rate was experimentally found to be 70 ± 5% after a single round of negative selection and enrichment. Meanwhile, CD45 depletion efficiency was 83.99 ± 1.00% and could be improved to 99.84 ± 0.04% after three consecutive rounds of depletion. Notably, on-chip negative selection and enrichment was 58% faster and the repeated depletion could be processed automatically. These promising results suggested the developed microfluidic chip is potentiated for a standardized CTC isolation platform. ? 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",cancer cells; magnetic beads; microfluidics; micromixer; separation,Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Diagnosis; Diseases; Fluidic devices; Magnetism; Mixers (machinery); Separation; Tumors; Cancer cells; Circulating tumor cells; Integrated microfluidic systems; Integrated microfluidics; Isolation platform; Magnetic beads; Micro mixers; Technical difficulties; Microfluidics,2-s2.0-84938058742

During migration, cells not only undergo molecular changes but also mechanical modulation. This process is led by actin filaments serving as the backbone of intra-cellular force and transduces external mechanical signal via focal adhesion complex into the cell. Here, we focus on determining the mechanical changes of actin filaments and the spatial distribution of forces in response to changing chemical stimulations and during cell migration. Atomic force microscopy and micropost array detector are used to determine and compare the magnitude and distribution of filament elasticity and force generation in fibroblasts and keloid fibroblasts. We found both filament elasticity and force generation show spatial distribution in a polarized and migrating cell. Such spatial distribution is disrupted when mechano-signalling is perturbed by focal adhesion kinase inhibitor and in keloid fibroblasts.

Detail mechanistic studies reveal that the probes self-assemble to form fluorescence-quenched J-type aggregate. In the presence of target analyte, bright fluorescence in the near-IR region is emitted through the recognition-induced disassembly of the probe aggregate. This Cy5 fluorophore is a unique self-assembly/disassembly dye as it gives remarkable fluorescence enhancement.

Our approach combines phosphoproteomics for high throughput cancer-related biomarker discovery from patient tissues and an impedimetric kinase activity biosensor for sensitive validation. Using non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a proof-of-concept study, label-free quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of a pair of cancerous and its adjacent normal tissues revealed 198 phosphoproteins that are over-phosphorylated in NSCLC. Among the differentially regulated phosphorylation sites, the most significant alteration was in residue S165 in the Hepatoma Derived Growth Factor (HDGF) protein. Hence, HDGF was selected as a model system for the electrochemical studies. Further motif-based analysis of this altered phosphorylation site revealed that extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) are most likely to be the corresponding kinases. For validation of the kinase-substrate pair, densely packed peptide monolayers corresponding to the HDGF phosphorylation site were coupled to a gold electrode. Phosphorylation of the monolayer by ERK2 and dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase (AP) were detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and surface roughness analysis. Compared to other methods for quantification of kinase concentration, this label-free electrochemical assay offers the advantages of ultra-sensitivity as well as higher specificity for the detection of cancer-related kinase-substrate pair. With implementation of multiple kinase-substrate biomarker pairs, we expect this integrated approach to become a high throughput platform for discovery and validation of phosphorylation-mediated biomarkers. ?

Cancer is driven by the somatic evolution of cell lineages. In this study, the evolution of somatic cancer cell lineages during carcinogenesis was modeled as an equilibrium point (ie, phenotype of attractor) shifting, the process of a nonlinear stochastic evolutionary biological network. This process is subject to intrinsic random fluc-tuations because of somatic genetic and epigenetic variations, as well as extrinsic disturbances because of carcinogens and stressors. In order to maintain the normal function (ie, phenotype) of an evolutionary biological network subjected to random intrinsic fluctuations and extrinsic disturbances, a network robustness scheme that incorporates natural selection needs to be developed. This can be accomplished by selecting certain genetic and epigenetic varia-tions to modify the network structure to attenuate intrinsic fluctuations efficiently and to resist extrinsic disturbances in order to maintain the phenotype of the evolutionary biological network at an equilibrium point (attractor). However, during carcinogenesis, the remaining (or neutral) genetic and epige-netic variations accumulate, and the extrinsic disturbances become too large to maintain the normal phenotype at the desired equilibrium point for the nonlinear evolutionary biological network. Thus, the network is shifted to a cancer phenotype at a new equilibrium point that begins a new evolutionary process. In this study, the natural selection scheme of an evolutionary biological network of carcinogenesis was derived from a robust negative feedback scheme based on the nonlinear stochastic Nash game strategy. The evolvability and phenotypic robustness criteria of the evolutionary cancer network were also estimated by solving a Hamilton–Jacobi inequality – constrained optimization problem. The simulation revealed that the phenotypic shift of the lung cancer-associated cell network takes 54.5 years from a normal state to stage I cancer, 1.5 years from stage I to stage II cancer, and 2.5 years from stage II to stage III cancer, with a reasonable match for the statistical result of the average age of lung cancer. These results suggest that a robust negative feedback scheme, based on a stochastic evolutionary game strategy, plays a critical role in an evolutionary biological network of carcinogenesis under a natural selection scheme. ? the authors, publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Limited.",Carcinogenesis; Global linearization; Hamilton–Jacobi inequality; LMI; Natural selection; Network evolution; Network phenotype robustness criterion; Stochastic evolutionary game strategy,accuracy; algorithm; Article; calculation; cancer staging; carcinogenesis; computer model; epigenetics; genetic trait; genetic variability; heritability; mathematical model; molecular evolution; natural selection; negative feedback; nonlinear system; phenotypic variation; prediction; statistical analysis,2-s2.0-84937416292

Hepatoma-derived growth factor (hHDGF) and HDGF-related proteins (HRPs) contain conserved N-terminal HATH domains with a characteristic structural motif, namely the PWWP motif. The HATH domain has attracted attention because of its ability to bind with heparin/heparan sulfate, DNA, and methylated histone peptide. Depending on the sequence of the PWWP motif, HRP HATHs are classified into P-type (Pro-His-Trp-Pro) and A-type (Ala-His-Trp-Pro) forms. A-type HATH is highly unstable and tends to precipitate in solution. We replaced the Pro residue in P-type HATH HDGF with Ala and evaluated the influence on structure, dynamics, and ligand binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) hydrogen/deuterium exchange and circular dichroism (CD) measurements revealed reduced stability. Analysis of NMR backbone 15 N relaxations (R 1 , R 2 , and nuclear Overhauser effect) revealed additional backbone dynamics in the interface between the β-barrel and the C-terminal helix bundle. The β1-β2 loop, where the AHWP sequence is located, has great structural flexibility, which aids HATH-HATH interaction through the loop. A-type HATH, therefore, shows a stronger tendency to aggregate when binding with heparin and DNA oligomers. This study defines the role of the first residue of the PWWP motif in modulating HATH domain stability and oligomer formation in binding. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Bins; Dichroism; DNA sequences; Oligomers; Polysaccharides; Proteins; Chemical equations; Hepatoma-derived growth factors; Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Nuclear overhauser effects; Oligomer formations; Protein-protein interactions; Structural flexibilities; Nuclear magnetic resonance; amino acid; deuterium; DNA; heparan sulfate; hepatoma derived growth factor; histone methyltransferase; hydrogen; low molecular weight heparin; oligomer; DNA; heparin; hepatoma-derived growth factor; protein binding; signal peptide; Article; circular dichroism; controlled study; deuterium hydrogen exchange; heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance; heteronuclear single quantum coherence; histone methylation; ligand binding; molecular weight; oligomerization; point mutation; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein binding; protein conformation; protein domain; protein expression; protein motif; protein protein interaction; protein secondary structure; protein stability; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; sequence alignment; site directed mutagenesis; thermostability; amino acid sequence; chemical structure; chemistry; human; metabolism; molecular genetics; protein domain; Amino Acid Sequence; DNA; Heparin; Humans; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Stability; Sequence Alignment",2-s2.0-84936792247

HER2 is also served as prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer because HER2 over-expression is associated with a 5-10% increase in cancer related death of gastric cancer. Cancer patients exhibiting HER2 over-expression can significantly improve their overall survival rates by taking the targeting drug Herceptin, which directly targets HER2. However, Herceptin has limited functions toward patients without HER2 over-expression and therefore it needs a highly specific and accurate detection method for diagnosis of HER2 over-expression. Currently, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique is routinely employed to detect HER2 amplification. However, it is a labor-intensive, time-consuming hybridization process and is relatively costly. Furthermore, well-trained personnel are required to operate the delicate and complicate process. More importantly, it may take 1-2 days for well-trained personnel to perform a whole FISH assay. Given these limitations, we developed a new, integrated microfluidic FISH system capable of automating the entire FISH protocol which could be performed within a shorter period of time when compared to traditional methods. The microfluidic FISH chip consisted of a microfluidic control module for transportation of small amounts of fluids and a hybridization module to perform the hybridization of DNA probes and cells/tissue samples. With this approach, the new microfluidic chip was capable of performing the whole FISH assay within 20. h. Four cell lines, two for non-. HER2 amplification and two for HER2 amplification, and two clinical tissue samples, one for non-. HER2 amplification and another for HER2 amplification, were used for verifications of the developed chip. Experimental data showed that there was no significant difference between the benchtop protocol and the chip-based protocol. Furthermore, the reagent consumption was greatly reduced (~70% reduction). Especially, only 2-μl usage for FISH deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe was used, which is five-fold reduction when compared with the traditional method. It is the first time that the entire FISH assay could be automated on a single chip by using tissue samples. The microfluidic system developed herein is therefore promising for rapid, automatic diagnosis of HER2-related diseases by detecting the HER2 gene with minimal consumption of samples and reagents and has a great potential for future pharmacogenetic diagnostics and therapy. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Biomarker; Cancer; Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); HER2; Herceptin; Microfluidics,"Biomarkers; Cell culture; Diagnosis; Disease control; Diseases; Fluidic devices; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Gene therapy; Nucleic acids; Tissue; Cancer; Fluorescence in situ hybridization; Fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques; HER2; Herceptin; Human epidermal growth factor; Integrated microfluidics; Microfluidic platforms; Microfluidics; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; tumor marker; analytic method; Article; benchtop method; biochip; breast cancer cell line; cancer diagnosis; controlled study; DNA probe; FISH microfluidic chip; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene amplification; gene overexpression; intermethod comparison; microfluidic analysis; oncogene neu; protein expression; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; experimental neoplasm; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene expression profiling; human; lab on a chip; metabolism; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; tumor cell line; upregulation; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Neoplasms, Experimental; Receptor, ErbB-2; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-84924364130

The current study further examined the accuracy level of the Kinect sensor for assessment of various gait parameters during treadmill walking under different walking speeds. Twenty healthy participants walked on the treadmill and their full body kinematics data were measured by a Kinect sensor and a motion tracking system, concurrently. Spatiotemporal gait parameters and knee and hip joint angles were extracted from the two devices and were compared. The results showed that the accuracy levels when using the Kinect sensor varied across the gait parameters. Average heel strike frame errors were 0.18 and 0.30 frames for the right and left foot, respectively, while average toe off frame errors were -2.25 and -2.61 frames, respectively, across all participants and all walking speeds. The temporal gait parameters based purely on heel strike have less error than the temporal gait parameters based on toe off. The Kinect sensor can follow the trend of the joint trajectories for the knee and hip joints, though there was substantial error in magnitudes. The walking speed was also found to significantly affect the identified timing of toe off. The results of the study suggest that the Kinect sensor may be used as an alternative device to measure some gait parameters for treadmill walking, depending on the desired accuracy level. ? 2015 The Authors.",Gait analysis; Knee and hip joint angle; Step time; Step width,"adult; ankle; Article; computer program; electronic sensor; female; foot; force; gait; ground reaction force; hip; human; human experiment; kinematics; knee; laboratory test; male; measurement accuracy; measurement error; motion analysis system; normal human; priority journal; standing; three dimensional imaging; toe; treadmill exercise; walking; walking speed; adolescent; algorithm; biomechanics; devices; exercise test; gait; physiology; reference value; reproducibility; signal processing; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Biomechanical Phenomena; Exercise Test; Female; Gait; Hip Joint; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Walking; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84937811549

Methods Condition medium (CM) from OSCC cells (OEC-M1 and YD38) were collected and their effects on macrophage (THP-1) polarization were examined. Modulation of Axl, PI3/Akt, and NF-κB were performed to investigate their potential involvement in TAM polarization. Expression of pAxl and CD206 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in OSCC tissues. Results THP-1 polarized to M2 phenotype with increasing expression of interleukins, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase and CD206 upon treatment with CM of OSCC. Activated Axl signaling in OSCC enhanced M2 induction ability. Suppression of Axl signaling and inhibition of PI3/Akt and NF-κB diminished M2 induction. pAxl expression was significantly associated with distribution of CD206 positive cells in OSCC tissues. Conclusion Axl signaling of OSCC involved in polarizing TAMs toward M2 phenotype. Induction of M2 phenotype macrophage polarization by OSCC cells might involve the Axl/PI3/Akt/NF-κB pathway. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Type II ground glass hepatocytes (GGHs) harbouring the HBV pre-S2 mutant large surface protein (LHBS) have been recognized as a morphologically distinct hallmark of HCC in the advanced stages of chronic HBV infection. Considering its preneoplastic nature, we hypothesized that type II GGH may exhibit high genomic instability, which is important for the carcinogenic process in chronic HBV carriers. In this study we found that pre-S2 mutant LHBS directly interacted with importin α1, the key factor that recognizes cargos undergoing nuclear transportation mediated by the importin α/β-associated nuclear pore complex (NPC). By interacting with importin α1, which inhibits its function as an NPC factor, pre-S2 mutant LHBS blocked nuclear transport of an essential DNA repair and recombination factor, Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1), upon DNA damage, thereby delaying the formation of nuclear foci at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Pre-S2 mutant LHBS was also found to block NBS1-mediated homologous recombination repair and induce multi-nucleation of cells. In addition, pre-S2 mutant LHBS transgenic mice showed genomic instability, indicated by increased global gene copy number variations (CNVs), which were significantly higher than those in hepatitis B virus X mice, indicating that pre-S2 mutant LHBS is the major viral oncoprotein inducing genomic instability in HBV-infected hepatocytes. Consistently, the human type II GGHs in HCC patients exhibited increased DNA DSBs representing significant genomic instability. In conclusion, type II GGHs harbouring HBV pre-S2 mutant oncoprotein represent a high-risk marker for the loss of genome integrity in chronic HBV carriers and explain the complex chromosome changes in HCCs.

Up to half of CHB carriers receiving chemotherapy develop hepatitis and among these cases a notable proportion are associated with HBV reactivation. However, the molecular mechanism(s) through which various chemotherapeutic agents induce HBV reactivation is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of the cell cycle regulator p21 (Waf1/Cip1) in the modulation of HBV replication when a common chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin, is present. We showed that p21 expression was increased by doxorubicin treatment. This elevation in p21 expression enhanced the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα); such an increase is likely to promote the binding of C/EBPα to the HBV promoter, which will contribute to the activation of HBV replication. Our current study thus reveals the mechanism underlying doxorubicin modulation of HBV replication and provides an increased understanding of HBV reactivation in CHB patients who are receiving systemic chemotherapy. ? 2015 Chen et al.

In this work, liposomes that contain doxorubicin (DOX) and ammonium bicarbonate (ABC, a bubble-generating agent) are prepared and functionalized with an antinucleolin aptamer (AS1411 liposomes) to target DOX-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR), which overexpress nucleolin receptors. Free DOX and liposomes without functionalization with AS1411 (plain liposomes) were used as controls. The results of molecular dynamic simulations suggest that AS1411 functionalization may promote the affinity and specific binding of liposomes to the nucleolin receptors, enhancing their subsequent uptake by tumor cells, whereas plain liposomes enter cells with difficulty. Upon mild heating, the decomposition of ABC that is encapsulated in the liposomes enables the immediate activation of generation of CO2 bubbles, creating permeable defects in their lipid bilayers, and ultimately facilitating the swift intracellular release of DOX. In vivo studies in nude mice that bear tumors demonstrate that the active targeting of AS1411 liposomes can substantially increase the accumulation of DOX in the tumor tissues relative to free DOX or passively targeted plain liposomes, inhibiting tumor growth and reducing systemic side effects, including cardiotoxicity. The above findings indicate that liposomes that are functionalized with AS1411 represent an attractive therapeutic alternative for overcoming the MDR effect, and support a potentially effective strategy for cancer therapy. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Cancer therapy; Doxorubicin; Multidrug resistance; Receptor-mediated endocytosis; Thermoresponsive liposomes,"Ammonium bicarbonate; Carbon dioxide; Cells; Chemotherapy; Cytology; Diseases; Drug therapy; Enzyme activity; Lipid bilayers; Molecular biology; Molecular dynamics; Oncology; Tumors; Cancer therapy; Doxorubicin; Multidrug resistance; Receptor-mediated endocytosis; Thermo-responsive; Liposomes; AGRO 100; ammonium bicarbonate; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic antibiotic; bicarbonate; doxorubicin; lipid bilayer; liposome; nucleolin; oligodeoxyribonucleotide; peptide aptamer; phosphoprotein; RNA binding protein; animal; Bagg albino mouse; chemistry; drug effects; drug resistance; female; human; lipid bilayer; microbubble; mouse; multidrug resistance; nude mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Antineoplastic Agents; Aptamers, Peptide; Bicarbonates; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin; Drug Resistance, Multiple; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Humans; Lipid Bilayers; Liposomes; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Microbubbles; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Phosphoproteins; RNA-Binding Proteins",2-s2.0-84938544203

Constant monitoring of rifampicin is important for controlling the side effects and preventing overdose caused by chronic medication. In this study, we present an easy to use, effective and less costly method for detecting residual rifampicin in urine samples using protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA)-stabilized gold nanoclusters (BSA-Au NCs) adsorbed on a paper substrate in which the concentration of rifampicin in urine can be detected via fluorescence quenching. The intensity of the colorimetric assay performed on the paper-based platforms can be easily captured using a digital camera and subsequently analyzed. Results: The decreased fluorescence intensity of BSA-Au NCs in the presence of rifampicin allows for the sensitive detection of rifampicin in a range from 0.5 to 823 μg/mL. The detection limit for rifampicin was measured as 70 ng/mL. The BSA-Au NCs were immobilized on a wax-printed paper-based platform and used to conduct real-time monitoring of rifampicin in urine. Conclusion: We have developed a robust, cost-effective, and portable point-of-care medical diagnostic platform for the detection of rifampicin in urine based on the ability of rifampicin to quench the fluorescence of immobilized BSA-Au NCs on wax-printed papers. The paper-based assay can be further used for the detection of other specific analytes via surface modification of the BSA in BSA-Au NCs and offers a useful tool for monitoring other diseases. ? 2015 Chatterjee et al.",Fluorescence quenching; Fluorescent biosensors; Gold nanocluster; Rifampicin detection; TB drug monitoring; Wax-printed paper platform,"Body fluids; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Drug dosage; Fluorescence; Gold; Multilayers; Patient monitoring; Quenching; Surface treatment; Bovine serum albumins; Colorimetric assays; Drug monitoring; Fluorescence intensities; Fluorescence quenching; Gold nanocluster; Printed papers; Real time monitoring; Nanoclusters; bovine serum albumin; ethambutol; gold nanocluster; gold nanoparticle; isoniazid; pyrazinamide; rifampicin; unclassified drug; gold; metal nanoparticle; rifampicin; tuberculostatic agent; Article; camera; colorimetry; drug determination; drug monitoring; fluorescence; fluorescence quenching; human; immobilization; limit of detection; paper; paper based assay; particle size; quantum yield; sensitivity and specificity; urine; animal; bovine; chemistry; evaluation study; genetic procedures; paper; point of care system; procedures; spectrofluorometry; ultrastructure; Bovinae; Animals; Antibiotics, Antitubercular; Biosensing Techniques; Cattle; Gold; Humans; Limit of Detection; Metal Nanoparticles; Paper; Point-of-Care Systems; Rifampin; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",2-s2.0-84934281851

Overcoming resistance to chemotherapy and investigating molecular targeted therapies are challenges currently faced during resistance management. Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is an adapter protein mediating cholesterol synthesis, steroid signaling, and cytochrome p450 activation. Attention has recently focused on the role of PGRMC1 in cell survival, anti-apoptosis, and damage response. In the present study, we used knockdown and overexpression approaches in the following set of uterine sarcoma models to further evaluate the role of PGRMC1 in drug resistance: the doxorubicin-sensitive MES-SA cells and the doxorubicin-resistant MES-SA/DxR-2 μM and MES-SA/DxR-8 μM cells (with different levels of doxorubicin resistance). PGRMC1 repressed doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity and exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect; it also promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression to the S phase. Of note, PGRMC1 overexpression led to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the sensitive MES-SA cells, thus facilitating their migration and invasion. The combination of PGRMC1 knockdown and the P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil significantly decreased the viability of P-glycoprotein-overexpressing MES-SA/DxR-8 μM cells after doxorubicin treatment. Taken together, our results show that PGRMC1 contributed to chemoresistance through cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and EMT induction, leading to the suggestion that PGRMC1 may serve as a therapeutic target in combination with an inhibitor in different drug resistance pathways and indicating the usefulness of predictive resistance biomarkers in uterine sarcoma. ? 2015 Springer Basel.",Andriamycin; Drug resistant; Metastasis; Programed cell death; Uterine cancer,"doxorubicin; progesterone receptor; progesterone receptor membrane component 1; unclassified drug; verapamil; antineoplastic antibiotic; doxorubicin; membrane protein; multidrug resistance protein; PGRMC1 protein, human; progesterone receptor; small interfering RNA; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer cell; cancer resistance; cell cycle progression; cell cycle S phase; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug mechanism; epithelial mesenchymal transition; human; human cell; IC50; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; uterus sarcoma; antagonists and inhibitors; apoptosis; cell adhesion; cell cycle; cell motion; drug resistance; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; flow cytometry; fluorescent antibody technique; genetics; metabolism; pathology; sarcoma; signal transduction; tumor cell culture; Uterine Neoplasms; Western blotting; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Cell Adhesion; Cell Cycle; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Doxorubicin; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Humans; Membrane Proteins; P-Glycoprotein; Receptors, Progesterone; RNA, Small Interfering; Sarcoma; Signal Transduction; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Uterine Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84929707805

The envelope (E) protein plays an important role in viral infection. However, there is no effective antibody for clinical treatment due to antibody dependent enhancement of infection. In this study, using Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), we demonstrated the first aptamer (S15) that can bind to DENV-2 envelop protein domain III (ED3) with a high binding affinity. S15 was found to form a parallel quadruplex based on Quadfinder prediction, gel mobility assay and circular dichroism studies. Both the quadruplex structure and the sequence on 5'-end were necessary for the binding activity of S15. NMR titration experiments indicated that S15 bound to a highly conserved loop between βA and βB strands of ED3. Moreover, S15 can neutralize the infections by all four serotypes of DENVs. Our result provides a new opportunity in the development of DNA aptamers against DENVs in the future. ? 2015 Chen et al.

Simple methods that use non-invasive biological samples are especially suitable for the deployment in the clinical environment. In this paper we demonstrate the application of a method that employs a capped gold nanoslit surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor and a microfluidic chip for the detection of a urinary nucleic acid biomarker in clinical samples. This method detects low concentrations of the biomarker in a relatively large volume (?1 mL) of the sample. The method utilizes magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for the isolation of target molecules and signal enhancement in conjunction with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on capped gold nanoslits. The ability of the method to detect urinary miRNA-16-5p in AKI patients was tested and the result was compared with the data obtained with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). miRNA-16-5p has been found to be a specific and noninvasive biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI). Our method allows the detection of the biomarker in the urine of AKI patients without amplification and labeling of the target molecules. ?

To promote its clinical therapeutic applications, development of safe and effective magnetic nanocarriers is in high demand. Herein, we present a redox-sensitive polymer/metal nanocomplex system (PSPIO) for efficient magnetofection and magnet resonance imaging (MRI) on cancer cells. PSPIO was prepared by modifying SPIO with redox-sensitive polyethylenimine (SSPEI) via a ligand exchange process. PSPIO could efficiently condense plasmid DNA (pDNA) into nanoparticles, which exhibited several favorable properties for gene delivery, including protection of nucleic acids from enzymatic degradation, stable colloids in serum, and redox-responsive pDNA release. As a potential MR imaging agent, PSPIO displayed good magnetization (28.3 emu/g) and dose-dependent T2-weighted imaging contrast (R2 = 291.1 s-1 mM-1) in vitro. The use of redox-sensitive SSPEI polymer contributed to much lower cytotoxicity of PSPIO compared to nondegradable bPEI25k. In vitro transfection efficiency of PSPIO was significantly enhanced under an external magnetic field. In the presence of serum, PSPIO exhibited higher transgene expression than SSPEI or bPEI25k polymer on mouse glioma (ALTS1C1) or human prostate cancer (PC3) cell lines. Taken together, it is demonstrated that PSPIO possess great potential for cancer gene therapy and molecular imaging. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Body fluids; Cell culture; Cells; Copolymers; Diseases; Gene therapy; Gene transfer; Genes; Molecular imaging; Nucleic acids; Polymers; Cancer gene therapy; Enzymatic Degradation; External magnetic field; Human prostate cancer; Magnetic nanocarriers; T2-weighted imaging; Therapeutic Application; Transgene expression; Magnetic resonance imaging; nanoparticle; polyethyleneimine; animal; chemistry; endocytosis; epithelium cell; gene expression; gene transfer; glia; human; magnetic field; metabolism; mouse; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxidation reduction reaction; pathology; plasmid; procedures; transgene; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Endocytosis; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression; Gene Transfer Techniques; Humans; Magnetic Fields; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mice; Nanoparticles; Neuroglia; Oxidation-Reduction; Plasmids; Polyethyleneimine; Transgenes",2-s2.0-84935011916

However, E-cadherin's exact role in Wnt/?-catenin-mediated promotion of the CSC phenotype remains unclear. Recently, a significant positive correlation has been observed between the expression of nuclear (an aberrant nuclear localization) E-cadherin and ?-catenin in gastric and colorectal carcinomas. Here we conducted a series of in-vitro and in-vivo studies to show that the ?-catenin/TCF4 interaction was abolished by E-cadherin and was correlated with its nuclear localization, and consequently decreased ?-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity. Nuclear E-cadherin was a negative regulator of Wnt/?-Catenin-elicited promotion of the CSC phenotype. Using immunohistochemistry on lung cancer tissue microarrays, we found that changes in subcellular location of E-cadherin may be described by tumor grade and stage, suggesting cellular redistribution during lung tumorigenesis. Furthermore, nuclear E-cadherin expression was more significantly inversely correlated with CD133 (a lung CSC marker) expression (P&lt;0.005) than total E-cadherin expression (P&lt;0.05), suggesting that lung cancer as defined by nuclear E-cadherinLow/nuclear ?-cateninHigh/CD133High biomarkers has superior prognostic value over total E-cadherinLow/nuclear ?-cateninHigh/CD133High.",,ABC transporter; beta catenin; breast cancer resistance protein; CD133 antigen; protein; short hairpin RNA; TCF4 protein; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; Wnt protein; animal experiment; animal model; Article; binding site; cancer stem cell; carcinogenicity; cell clone; cell fractionation; cell proliferation assay; cell stimulation; confocal microscopy; controlled study; ectopic expression; endocytosis; female; flow cytometry; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; internalization; lung cancer; nonhuman; overall survival; phenotype; priority journal; promoter region; protein degradation; protein expression; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; supernatant; tissue microarray; transcription initiation; Western blotting; Wnt signaling pathway,2-s2.0-84989338265

However, the limited aqueous photostability, rapid body clearance, and poor cellular uptake severely restrict its practical applications. For these problems to be overcome, ICG-encapsulated hybrid polymeric nanomicelles (PNMs) were developed in this work through coassociation of the amphiphilic diblock copolymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-b-PEG) and hydrophobic electrostatic complexes composed of ICG molecules and branched poly(ethylenimine) (PEI). The ICG-encapsulated hybrid PNMs featured a hydrophobic PLGA/ICG/PEI core stabilized by hydrophilic PEG shells. The encapsulation of electrostatic ICG/PEI complexes into the compact PLGA-rich core not only facilitated the ICG loading but also promoted its aqueous optical stability. The effects of the chain length of PEI in combination with ICG on the physiochemical properties of PNMs and their drug leakage were also investigated. PEI10k (10 kDa) could form highly robust and dense complexes with ICG, and thus prominently reduced ICG outflow from the PNMs. The results of in vitro cellular uptake and cytotoxicity studies revealed that the ICG/PEI10k-loaded PNMs significantly promoted cellular uptake of ICG by HeLa cells due to their near-neutral surface, and thereby augmented the NIR-triggered hyperthermia effect in destroying cancer cells. These findings strongly indicate that the ICG/PEI10k-loaded PNMs have significant potential for attaining effective cancer imaging and photothermal therapy. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Copolymers; Diseases; Electrostatics; Hydrophobicity; Infrared devices; Medical imaging; Mobile security; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylene oxides; Amphiphilic diblock copolymers; Electrostatic complexes; Near-infrared imaging; Photothermal cancer therapy; Photothermal therapy; Physio-chemical properties; Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid; Polymeric nanomicelles; Polymers; antineoplastic agent; indocyanine green; micelle; nanomaterial; polymer; cell proliferation; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effects; drug screening; HeLa cell line; human; micelle; Neoplasms; pathology; photochemistry; phototherapy; temperature; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Proliferation; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; HeLa Cells; Humans; Indocyanine Green; Micelles; Molecular Structure; Nanostructures; Neoplasms; Photochemical Processes; Phototherapy; Polymers; Temperature",2-s2.0-84931274870

The most commonly encountered vision-threatening diseases are age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), both of which may require short-term or life-long anti-VEGF injection treatment therapy. Accurate measurement of VEGF concentration in aqueous humor can provide significant and timely information to diagnose the disease state. Adequate and precise therapy may consequently be provided. At odds with conventional diagnostic approaches is the fact that a maximum of only 200 microliters of aqueous humor can be safely removed from the eye for testing. Fortunately, new diagnostic platforms, such as P-ELISA, require only minute volumes, i.e., approximately 2 microliters per test ""well"" and approximately 40 microliters total to quantify VEGF levels, and the testing process takes less than an hour. Thus, point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, such as P-ELISA, should be examined and improved upon as needed in order to develop an efficient tool for outpatient clinics and others to obtain semi-quantitative results that might facilitate accurate dosing of anti-VEGF treatment and delay or prevent the progression of AMD and DR. ?

However, accurate measurement of the HbA1c level at the point of care is hampered by costly, large-scale instruments (such as high-performance liquid chromatography) or reagent instability of classical immunologic methods, which involve antibody-based immunoturbidimetry. In this work, an integrated microfluidic system using aptamer-based testing to measure HbA1c in blood samples is therefore presented. This measuring system used nucleic-acid aptamers that exhibited high sensitivity and high specificity for hemoglobin and HbA1c to perform a stable and robust testing. The compact microfluidic system consumed less samples and reagents and significantly shortened the detection time. Combining the advantages of microfluidics and aptamers, this integrated microsystem presents a promising tool for accurate and point-of-case HbA1c detection. To demonstrate its clinical utility, whole blood samples with clinically-relevant concentrations of HbA1c and Hb were automatically measured on the integrated microfluidic system. Experimental data showed that the developed aptamer-based microfluidic system is capable of detecting HbA1c and Hb with a good linear response. The entire process was completed within 25. min. The aptamer-antibody on-chip sandwich immunoassay may be further refined to allow diabetes screening and diagnosis at lower cost and earlier phase to minimize the risk of diabetic complications. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Aptamer; Diabetes mellitus; HbA1c; MEMS; Microfluidic,"Antibodies; Blood; Fluidic devices; Hemoglobin; High performance liquid chromatography; Liquid chromatography; MEMS; Nucleic acids; Accurate measurement; Aptamers; Diabetes mellitus; Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); HbA1c; Integrated microfluidic systems; Integrated microsystems; Nucleic acid aptamers; Microfluidics; antibody; aptamer; hemoglobin A1c; nucleic acid; reagent; aptamer; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; immobilized antibody; Article; blood sampling; calibration; concentration (parameters); human; immunoassay; microfluidics; sensitivity and specificity; synthesis; chemistry; devices; equipment design; evaluation study; genetic procedures; immunomagnetic separation; magnetism; microfluidic analysis; Antibodies, Immobilized; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Biosensing Techniques; Equipment Design; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunomagnetic Separation; Magnetic Phenomena; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-84921459521

In this study, based on an information flow model and microarray data, we measured the information flow in cellular networks indirectly by using a systems biology method. First, we used a recursive least square parameter estimation algorithm to identify the system parameters of coupling signal transduction pathways and the cellular gene regulatory network (GRN). Then, based on the identified parameters and systems theory, we estimated the signal transductivities of the coupling signal transduction pathways from the extracellular signals to each downstream protein and the information transductivities of the GRN between transcription factors in response to environmental events. According to the proposed method, the information flow, which is characterized by signal transductivity in coupling signaling pathways and information transductivity in the GRN, can be estimated by microarray temporal data or microarray sample data. It can also be estimated by other high-throughput data such as next-generation sequencing or proteomic data. Finally, the information flows of the signal transduction pathways and the GRN in leukemia cancer cells and non-leukemia normal cells were also measured to analyze the systematic dysfunction in this cancer from microarray sample data. The results show that the signal transductivities of signal transduction pathways change substantially from normal cells to leukemia cancer cells. ? 2015 Chen and Li.",Gene regulatory network; Information flow; Information transductivity; Microarray data; Signal transduction pathway; Signal transductivity; System theory,,2-s2.0-84935856031

Circulating tumour cells (CTC) are cells that are released from a primary tumour into the bloodstream and that are considered to act as the main promoters of metastasis. These cells are therefore targets for the understanding of tumour biology and an improvement of clinical management of the disease. Early detection of CTC and analysis of their cell surface markers provide critical information for the diagnosis of cancer and its target therapy. CTC are shed into the bloodstream as tumours grow, and are believed to initiate the spread of cancer. The identification and analysis of CTC is thus an important objective for the development of noninvasive cancer diagnosis. Methods of capture and detection of CTC have been complicated and costly, and the captured cells could not be cultured and expanded directly. Because CTC are rare, existing as only a few per one billion blood cells, a highly efficient method is required to capture and to culture CTC for further assay. Chipbased and traditional methods have emerged to isolate, to detect and to characterize CTC. As CTC are a rare event, their investigation requires multidisciplinary considerations of both biological and physical properties. Chip-based biosensor platforms are being introduced into the technology for the quantification of CTC with promising results. This review describes recent progress in the identification of CTC; the approach developed has a simple workflow and scalable multiplexing, which makes it ideal for further investigation of CTC biomarkers. ? 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.",Biomarkers; Cancer; Chip-based biosensor; Circulating tumour cells (CTC); Metastasis; Non-invasive,"aptamer; silicon dioxide; tumor marker; Article; biosensor; cell isolation; cell search system; circulating tumor cell; ctc chip method; dynabeads method; epithelial mesenchymal transition; flow cytometry; human; iset method; macs method; metastasis; neoplasm; onco quick method; polymerase chain reaction; screen cell method; blood; blood examination; cell separation; microfluidic analysis; pathology; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; tumor embolism; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Separation; Flow Cytometry; Hematologic Tests; Humans; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",2-s2.0-84930699496

The virus is primarily transmitted through mosquitoes and the resulting disease, chikungunya fever, is found in nearly 40 countries. Neither an effective vaccine nor a specific antiviral drug exists for treatments of chikungunya fever. Thus 22 new conjugated compounds of uracil-coumarin-arene were designed and synthesized as potential inhibiting agents. Their chemical structures were determined unambiguously by spectroscopic methods, including single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography. The three units in these conjugates were connected by specially designed -SCH<inf>2</inf>- and -OSO<inf>2</inf>- joints. Five of these new conjugates were found to inhibit CHIKV in Vero cells with significant potency (EC<inf>50</inf> = 10.2-19.1 μM) and showed low toxicity (CC<inf>50</inf> = 75.2-178 μM). The selective index values were 8.8-11.5 for three conjugates. By analysis of the data from the anti-viral assays, the structure-activity relationship is derived on the basis of the nature of the uracil, the functional groups attached to the arene, and the joints between the ring units. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Some of these AMPs are found to exhibit cytotoxic activity against the growth of cancer cells and thus have obvious anticancer potential. Here, we have studied the antiproliferation on the human colorectal cancer cell line SW480 of two AMPs, namely m2163 and m2386, identified by us from a lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 previously. A half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 40?μg/ml is determined first using the MTT (3-(4, 5-cimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay for either peptide m2163 or m2386. The apoptosis in treated SW480 cells by either peptide m2163 or m2386 is analyzed using flow cytometry with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide double staining. These analyses show that a substantial population of treated SW480 cells can undergo apoptosis by either peptide m2163 or m2386. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot analyses are subsequently used to study how the apoptosis is induced in the treated SW480 cells by either peptide m2163 or m2386. While m2163 is found to induce the expression of Fas and TRAILR1, the expression of Fas, TNFR1, and TRAILR1 death receptors on the cell surface of treated SW480 cells is found to be induced by m2386. Further, the expression of some mitochondria-related apoptosis proteins such as Smac is found to be also induced, suggesting that either peptide m2163 or m2386 can trigger both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. The cell membrane permeability is greatly enhanced upon treatment with either peptide m2163 or m2386 as analyzed by the flow cytometry using both FITC-labeled peptides. The flow cytometry is also used to analyze the fluorescence intensity given by FITC-m2163 in either the mitochondria or cytoplasm fraction of the treated and fractionated SW480 cells. It is found that the detected fluorescence intensity of the mitochondria fraction is much weaker than that of the cytoplasm one, suggesting that most of the FITC-m2163 peptides are located in the cytoplasm rather than the mitochondria. This is further confirmed by a confocal microscopy study that either peptide m2163 or m2386 can localize on the cell membrane for a substantial length of time and then penetrate into the cell cytoplasm to induce the apoptosis. ? 2015, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Antimicrobial peptides; Antiproliferation; Apoptosis,"antimicrobial peptide m2163; antimicrobial peptide m2386; death receptor 4; Fas antigen; fluorescein isothiocyanate; lipocortin 5; polypeptide antibiotic agent; propidium iodide; second mitochondrial activator of caspase; tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; unclassified drug; antimicrobial cationic peptide; antimicrobial peptide m2163, Lactobacillus casei; antimicrobial peptide m2386, Lactobacillus casei; bacterial protein; peptide; tumor protein; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; cell membrane permeability; cell surface; colorectal cancer cell line; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytoplasm; flow cytometry; fluorescence; human; human cell; IC50; Lactobacillus casei; mitochondrion; MTT assay; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; SW480 cell line; Western blotting; biosynthesis; cell proliferation; chemistry; Colorectal Neoplasms; drug effects; gene expression regulation; Lactobacillus casei; pathology; ribosome; tumor cell line; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Apoptosis; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Colorectal Neoplasms; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lactobacillus casei; Microscopy, Confocal; Mitochondria; Neoplasm Proteins; Peptides; Ribosomes",2-s2.0-84929958791

However, it is difficult for most systems to affect every cancer cell in a tumor tissue due to the presence of the natural tumor barrier, leading to potential tumor recurrence. Here, core-shell magnetoresponsive virus-mimetic nanocapsules (VNs), which can infect cancer cells sequentially and double as a magnetothermal agent fabricated through anchoring iron oxide nanoparticles in a single-component protein (lactoferrin) shell, are reported. With large payload of hydrophilic/hydrophobic anticancer cargos, doxorubicin and palictaxel, VNs can simultaneously give a rapid drug release and intense heat while applying an external high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF). Furthermore, after being liberated from dead cells by HFMF manipulation, the constructive VNs can sequentially infect neighboring cancer cells and deliver sufficient therapeutic agents to next targeted sites. With high efficiency for sequential cell infections, VNs have successfully eliminated subcutaneous tumor after a combinatorial treatment. These results demonstrate that the VNs could be used for locally targeted, on-demand, magnetoresponsive chemotherapy/hyperthermia, combined with repeated cell infections for tumor therapy and other therapeutic applications. ? 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Approximately 31 antibody molecules were conjugated to each nanoparticle. Cet-PEG-dexSPIONs specifically bind to EGFR-expressing tumor cells and enhance image contrast on magnetic resonance imaging. Cet-PEG-dexSPION-treated A431 cells showed significant inhibition of epidermal growth factor-induced EGFR phosphorylation and enhancement of EGFR internalization and degradation. In addition, a significant increase in apoptosis was detected in EGFR-overexpressing cell lines, A431 and 32D/EGFR, after 24 hours of incubation at 37°C with cet-PEG-dexSPIONs compared with cetuximab alone. The antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of cetuximab was observed in cet-PEG-dexSPIONs.

As complex diseases are caused by the joint effects of multiple genes, while the effect of individual gene or SNP is modest, a method considering the joint effects of multiple SNPs can be more powerful than testing individual SNPs. The multi-SNP analysis aims to test association based on a SNP set, usually defined based on biological knowledge such as gene or pathway, which may contain only a portion of SNPs with effects on the disease. Therefore, a challenge for the multi-SNP analysis is how to effectively select a subset of SNPs with promising association signals from the SNP set. Results: We developed the Optimal P-value Threshold Pedigree Disequilibrium Test (OPTPDT). The OPTPDT uses general nuclear families. A variable p-value threshold algorithm is used to determine an optimal p-value threshold for selecting a subset of SNPs. A permutation procedure is used to assess the significance of the test. We used simulations to verify that the OPTPDT has correct type I error rates. Our power studies showed that the OPTPDT can be more powerful than the set-based test in PLINK, the multi-SNP FBAT test, and the p-value based test GATES. We applied the OPTPDT to a family-based autism GWAS dataset for gene-based association analysis and identified MACROD2-AS1 with genome-wide significance (p-value= 2.5 × 10- 6). Conclusions: Our simulation results suggested that the OPTPDT is a valid and powerful test. The OPTPDT will be helpful for gene-based or pathway association analysis. The method is ideal for the secondary analysis of existing GWAS datasets, which may identify a set of SNPs with joint effects on the disease. ? 2015 Wang et al.",,"analytical error; analytical parameters; Article; autism; family study; gene mutation; genetic algorithm; genetic association; genetic database; genetic disorder; genetic screening; genome analysis; nuclear family; optimal P value threshold pedigree dsisequilibrium test; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; validation study; algorithm; biology; diseases; female; genetics; genome-wide association study; genomics; human; male; pedigree; procedures; Algorithms; Autistic Disorder; Computational Biology; Disease; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Male; Nuclear Family; Pedigree; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-84930199415

Oral cancer is the most common type of head and neck cancer. More than 90% of oral cancers are oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The overall five-year survival rate of OSCC patients is approximately 63%, which is due to the low response rate to current therapeutic drugs. In this review we discuss the possibility of using caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) as an alternative treatment for oral cancer. CAPE is a strong antioxidant extracted from honeybee hive propolis. Recent studies indicate that CAPE treatment can effectively suppress the proliferation, survival, and metastasis of oral cancer cells. CAPE treatment inhibits Akt signaling, cell cycle regulatory proteins, NF-κB function, as well as activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Therefore, CAPE treatment induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in oral cancer cells. According to the evidence that aberrations in the EGFR/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling, NF-κB function, COX-2 activity, and MMPs activity are frequently found in oral cancers, and that the phosphorylation of Akt, EGFR, and COX-2 correlates to oral cancer patient survival and clinical progression, we believe that CAPE treatment will be useful for treatment of advanced oral cancer patients. ? 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Akt; Apoptosis; Caffeic acid phenethyl ester; Cell cycle arrest; Cell proliferation; Metastasis; MMP; NF-κB; Oral cancer,beta catenin; caffeic acid phenethyl ester; cell cycle protein; cyclin D1; cyclin E; cyclooxygenase 1; cyclooxygenase 2; epidermal growth factor receptor; fluorouracil; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; mammalian target of rapamycin; matrix metalloproteinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1; protein kinase B; protein kinase B beta; reactive oxygen metabolite; retinoblastoma protein; thymidylate synthase; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; transcription factor FKHR; transcription factor FKHRL1; tumor necrosis factor alpha; vasculotropin; caffeic acid derivative; caffeic acid phenethyl ester; phenethyl alcohol; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; cancer inhibition; cell cycle arrest; cell proliferation; down regulation; enzyme activity; extracellular matrix; fibroblast; gene overexpression; gluconeogenesis; glycogenolysis; head and neck cancer; human; IC50; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nonhuman; protein phosphorylation; Review; signal transduction; upregulation; analogs and derivatives; animal; Mouth Neoplasms; Apis mellifera; Animals; Caffeic Acids; Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Phenylethyl Alcohol,2-s2.0-84929377656

Because the proton concentration is minuscule, exquisite selectivity for protons over other ions is critical to HV1 function. The selectivity of the open HV1 channel requires an aspartate near an arginine in the selectivity filter (SF), a narrow region that dictates proton selectivity, but the mechanism of proton selectivity is unknown. Here we use a reduced quantum model to elucidate how the Asp-Arg SF selects protons but excludes other ions. Attached to a ring scaffold, the Asp and Arg side chains formed bidentate hydrogen bonds that occlude the pore. Introducing H3O+ protonated the SF, breaking the Asp-Arg linkage and opening the conduction pathway, whereas Na+ or Cl- was trapped by the SF residue of opposite charge, leaving the linkage intact, thus preventing permeation. An Asp-Lys SF behaved like the Asp-Arg one and was experimentally verified to be proton-selective, as predicted. Hence, interacting acidic and basic residues form favorable AspH0-H2O0-Arg+ interactions with hydronium but unfavorable Asp--X-/X+-Arg+ interactions with anions/cations. This proposed mechanism may apply to other proton-selective molecules engaged in bioenergetics, homeostasis, and signaling.",,"arginine; aspartic acid; Hv1 channel, human; ion; ion channel; protein binding; proton; tritium; tritium oxide; water; chemistry; conformation; human; metabolism; molecular model; mutation; physiology; Arginine; Aspartic Acid; Humans; Ion Channels; Ions; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Mutation; Protein Binding; Protons; Tritium; Water",2-s2.0-84929222952

However, simple and efficient methods are needed to improve the diagnosis and evaluation of cancer. Here, we propose a reusable biosensor based on a magnetic graphene oxide (MGO)-modified Au electrode to detect vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human plasma for cancer diagnosis. In this biosensor, Avastin is used as the specific biorecognition element, and MGO is used as the carrier for Avastin loading. The use of MGO enables rapid purification due to its magnetic properties, which prevents the loss of bioactivity. Moreover, the biosensor can be constructed quickly, without requiring a drying process, which is convenient for proceeding to detection. Our reusable biosensor provides the appropriate sensitivity for clinical diagnostics and has a wide range of linear detection, from 31.25-2000pgmL-1, compared to ELISA analysis. In addition, in experiments with 100% serum from clinical samples, readouts from the sensor and an ELISA for VEGF showed good correlation within the limits of the ELISA kit. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the change in current (δC) for reproducibility of the Au biosensor was 2.36% (n=50), indicating that it can be reused with high reproducibility. Furthermore, the advantages of the Avastin-MGO-modified biosensor for VEGF detection are that it provides an efficient detection strategy that not only improves the detection ability but also reduces the cost and decreases the response time by 10-fold, indicating its potential as a diagnosis product. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Cancer diagnosis; Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV); Magnetic graphene oxide (MGO); Reusable biosensor; Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),Bioactivity; Diseases; Endothelial cells; Graphene; Magnetoplasma; Voltammetry; Biorecognition elements; Cancer diagnosis; Clinical diagnostics; Differential pulse voltammetry; High reproducibility; MgO; Relative standard deviations; Vascular endothelial growth factor; Biosensors; bevacizumab; gold; graphene oxide; magnetic graphene oxide; tumor marker; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; graphite; oxide; vasculotropin A; Article; biological activity; biosensor; brain tumor; cancer diagnosis; case report; controlled study; differential pulse voltammetry; electrochemical analysis; electrode; ELISA kit; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; intermethod comparison; molecular recognition; process development; protein blood level; protein determination; protein isolation; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; chemistry; diagnostic use; genetic procedures; isolation and purification; magnetism; Neoplasms; pathology; Biosensing Techniques; Graphite; Humans; Magnetic Phenomena; Neoplasms; Oxides; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,2-s2.0-84922230103

Objective We investigated whether these chemoattractants and S100A9, through the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE; ie, its receptor), are involved in fibrocyte trafficking in patients with chronic obstructive asthma (COA) and during an acute exacerbation (AE) in patients without airflow obstruction (Asthma AE group). Methods We collected peripheral blood from 14 asthmatic patients with normal pulmonary function, 14 patients with COA, 11 patients in the Asthma AE group, and 14 healthy subjects. Isolated circulating fibrocytes were used for migration assay. Expression of CCR7, CXCR4, S100A9, and RAGE in fibrocytes was measured by using flow cytometry. CCL19 and CXCL12 expression in bronchial tissues was determined by using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Results There were higher numbers of circulating fibrocytes in patients in the Asthma AE group and patients with COA. The expression of CXCL12 in bronchial tissues and CXCR4 in circulating fibrocytes was higher in the Asthma AE group and, to a lesser extent, in patients with COA. The expression of CCL19 in bronchial tissues and CCR7 in fibrocytes was higher in patients with COA. CXCL12/CXCR4 and CCL19/CCR7 enhanced fibrocyte transmigration in the Asthma AE group and in patients with COA, respectively. The upregulated expression of S100A9 and RAGE in fibrocytes of patients in the Asthma AE group and those with COA contributes to the enhanced basal migratory motility of fibrocytes. Conclusion The CXCR4/CXCL12 axis contributes to chemotaxis of fibrocytes in patients in the Asthma AE group, whereas the CCR7/CCL19 axis plays an important role in patients with COA. S100A9 enhances the basal migratory motility of fibrocytes from patients in the Asthma AE group and patients with COA. ? 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.",Asthma; chemokine receptors; chemokines; fibrocytes; S100A9,"advanced glycation end product; advanced glycation end product receptor; calgranulin B; CD34 antigen; CD45 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR7; chemokine receptor CXCR4; collagen type 1; macrophage inflammatory protein 3beta; messenger RNA; calgranulin B; chemokine receptor CCR7; chemokine receptor CXCR4; macrophage inflammatory protein 3beta; stromal cell derived factor 1; adult; airway obstruction; Article; asthma; blood sampling; cell migration; chemotaxis; chronic obstructive asthma; clinical article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; female; flow cytometry; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lung function; male; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; asthma; case control study; cell motion; chronic disease; disease course; gene expression; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; respiratory tract mucosa; Asthma; Calgranulin B; Case-Control Studies; Cell Movement; Chemokine CCL19; Chemokine CXCL12; Chronic Disease; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Expression; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Receptors, CCR7; Receptors, CXCR4; Respiratory Mucosa",2-s2.0-84937512080

Despite the relatively simple biochemical and cellular composition of articular cartilages, the self-repair ability of cartilage is limited. Successful cartilage tissue engineering requires intricately coordinated interactions between matrerials, cells, biological factors, and phycial/mechanical factors, and still faces a multitude of challenges. This article presents an overview of the cartilage biology, current treatments, recent advances in the materials, biological factors, and cells used in cartilage tissue engineering/regeneration, with strong emphasis on the perspectives of gene regulation (e.g., microRNA) and gene therapy. Successful cartilage engineering is dictated by intricate coordination of scaffolds, cells, biological signals, and physical/mechanical factors. In particular, gene therapy in combination with cell therapy offers a promising solution to cartilage repair. This article not only reviews the four pillars of cartilage engineering, but also focuses on the cartilage repair from the perspectives of gene therapy. ? 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment strategy, but its role remains unclear in HCCs, which are associated with decreased cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte infiltration in both murine and human tumors. Moreover, in mouse models after sorafenib treatment intratumoral hypoxia is increased and may fuel evasive resistance. Using orthotopic HCC models, we now show that increased hypoxia after sorafenib treatment promotes immunosuppression, characterized by increased intratumoral expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed death ligand-1 and accumulation of T-regulatory cells and M2-type macrophages. We also show that the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells is mediated in part by hypoxia-induced up-regulation of stromal cell-derived 1 alpha. Inhibition of the stromal cell-derived 1 alpha receptor (C-X-C receptor type 4 or CXCR4) using AMD3100 prevented the polarization toward an immunosuppressive microenvironment after sorafenib treatment, inhibited tumor growth, reduced lung metastasis, and improved survival. However, the combination of AMD3100 and sorafenib did not significantly change cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte infiltration into HCC tumors and did not modify their activation status. In separate experiments, antibody blockade of the programmed death ligand-1 receptor programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) showed antitumor effects in treatment-naive tumors in orthotopic (grafted and genetically engineered) models of HCC. However, anti-PD-1 antibody treatment had additional antitumor activity only when combined with sorafenib and AMD3100 and not when combined with sorafenib alone. Conclusion: Anti-PD-1 treatment can boost antitumor immune responses in HCC models; when used in combination with sorafenib, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy shows efficacy only with concomitant targeting of the hypoxic and immunosuppressive microenvironment with agents such as CXCR4 inhibitors. ? 2014 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,"chemokine receptor CXCR4; plerixafor; programmed death 1 ligand 1; sorafenib; stromal cell derived factor 1alpha; antineoplastic agent; carbanilamide derivative; chemokine receptor CXCR4; CXCR4 protein, human; nicotinamide; programmed death 1 receptor; protein kinase inhibitor; sorafenib; add on therapy; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer immunotherapy; cancer inhibition; cancer model; cancer survival; CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; death; drug efficacy; human; human cell; hypoxia; immune deficiency; immune response; immunocompetent cell; immunosuppressive treatment; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; lung metastasis; lymphocyte proliferation; lymphocytic infiltration; macrophage; metastasis inhibition; mouse; murine model; nonhuman; polarization; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; transgenic organism; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor cell; tumor microenvironment; upregulation; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; drug effects; immunology; immunotherapy; Liver Neoplasms; procedures; tumor microenvironment; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Humans; Immunotherapy; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Niacinamide; Phenylurea Compounds; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Receptors, CXCR4; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-84928207236

However, what is not yet comprehensively understood is the affect the biochemical, physical, and genetic requirements have over the dynamic development of human or mouse preimplantation embryos. The conventional microdrop technique often cultures embryos in groups, which limits the investigation of the microenvironment of embryos. We report an open microwell platform, which enables micropipette manipulation and culture of embryos in defined sub-microliter volumes without valves. The fluidic environment of each microwell is secluded from others by layering oil on top, allowing for non-invasive, high-resolution time-lapse microscopy, and data collection from each individual embryo without confounding factors. We have successfully cultured mouse embryos from the two-cell stage to completely hatched blastocysts inside microwells with an 89% success rate (n = 64), which is comparable to the success rate of the contemporary practice. Development timings of mouse embryos that developed into blastocysts are statistically different to those of embryos that failed to form blastocysts (p-value &lt; 10-10, two-tailed Student's t-test) and are robust indicators of the competence of the embryo to form a blastocyst in vitro with 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Embryos at the cleavage- or blastocyst-stage following the normal development timings were selected and transferred to the uteri of surrogate female mice. Fifteen of twenty-two (68%) blastocysts and four of ten (40%) embryos successfully developed into normal baby mice following embryo transfer. This microwell platform, which supports the development of preimplanted embryos and is low-cost, easy to fabricate and operate, we believe, opens opportunities for a wide range of applications in reproductive medicine and cell biology. ? 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,Cytology; Microchannels; Contemporary practices; Culture environments; Dynamic development; Embryo transfer; High resolution; Microenvironments; Pre-implantation embryos; Student's t tests; Mammals; Mus,2-s2.0-84928820143

Our team had reported recently on a technique that combines sedimentation theory, computer vision, and micro particle manipulation techniques on an OEK microfluidic platform to determine the mass and density of micron-scale entities in a fluidic medium; the mass and density of yeast cells were accurately determined in that prior work. In the work reported in this paper, we further refined the technique by performing significantly more experiments to determine a universal correction factor to Stokes' equation in expressing the drag force on a microparticle as it falls towards an infinite plane. Specifically, a theoretical model for micron-sized spheres settling towards an infinite plane in a microfluidic environment is presented, and which was validated experimentally using five different sizes of micro polystyrene beads. The same sedimentation process was applied to two kinds of leukemic cancer cells with similar sizes in an OEK platform, and their density and mass were determined accordingly. Our tests on mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells (L1210) and human leukemic cells (HL-60) have verified the practical viability of this method. Potentially, this new method provides a new way of measuring the volume, density, and mass of a single cell in an accurate, selective, and repeatable manner. ? 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,Diseases; Drag; Electrohydrodynamics; Electromagnetic fields; Microfluidics; Correction factors; Human leukemic cells; Lymphocytic leukemia; Microfluidic environment; Microfluidic platforms; Microfluidics chips; Sedimentation process; Theoretical modeling; Molecular biology,2-s2.0-84927941641

There is not currently a vaccine available against HFMD, even though a newly developed formalin-inactivated EV71 (FI-EV71) vaccine has been tested in clinical trial and has shown efficacy against EV71. We have designed and genetically engineered a recombinant adenovirus Ad-EVVLP with the EV71 P1 and 3CD genes inserted into the E1/E3-deleted adenoviral genome. Ad-EVVLP were produced in HEK-293A cells. In addition to Ad-EVVLP particles, virus-like particles (VLPs) formed from the physical association of EV71 capsid proteins, VP0, VP1, and VP3 expressed from P1 gene products. They were digested by 3CD protease and confirmed to be produced by Ad-EVVLP-producing cells, as determined using transmission electron microscopy and western blotting. Mouse immunogenicity studies showed that Ad-EVVLP-immunized antisera neutralized the EV71 B4 and C2 genotypes. Activation of VLP-specific CD4+ and CD8+/IFN-γ T cells associated with Th1/Th2-balanced IFN-?, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-13 was induced; in contrast, FI-EV71 induced only Th2-mediated neutralizing antibody against EV71 and low VLP-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. The antiviral immunity against EV71 was clearly demonstrated in mice vaccinated with Ad-EVVLP in a hSCARB2 transgenic (hSCARB2-Tg) mouse challenge model. Ad-EVVLP-vaccinated mice were 100% protected and demonstrated reduced viral load in both the CNS and muscle tissues. Ad-EVVLP successfully induced anti-CVA16 immunities. Although antisera had no neutralizing activity against CVA16, the 3C-specific CD4+ and CD8+/IFN-γ T cells were identified, which could mediate protection against CVA16 challenge. FI-EV71 did not induce 3C-mediated immunity and had no efficacy against the CVA16 challenge. These results suggest that Ad-EVVLP can enhance neutralizing antibody and protective cellular immune responses to prevent EV71 infection and cellular immune responses against CV infection. ? 2015 Tsou et al.",,"Ad EVVLP vaccine; Ad LacZ vaccine; adenovirus vector; formalin inactivated EV71 vaccine; gamma interferon; inactivated virus vaccine; interleukin 17; interleukin 4; plasmid DNA; RNA; unclassified drug; virus like particle vaccine; antiserum; capsid protein; IL17A protein, human; inactivated vaccine; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 4; neutralizing antibody; recombinant vaccine; virus vaccine; animal model; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell proliferation; cellular immunity; controlled study; Coxsackie virus infection; Enterovirus 71; Enterovirus infection; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; flow cytometry; hand foot and mouth disease; isolation and purification; mouse; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); real time polymerase chain reaction; Th1 Th2 balance; transmission electron microscopy; virus load; Western blotting; animal; Enterovirus A; female; genetic engineering; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; immunology; transgenic mouse; virology; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Capsid Proteins; Enterovirus A, Human; Female; Genetic Engineering; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Immune Sera; Interleukin-13; Interleukin-17; Interleukin-4; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Vaccines, Inactivated; Vaccines, Synthetic; Viral Vaccines",2-s2.0-84928910836

Due to its immunogenic and immunomodulatory properties, HP-NAP has been used for developing vaccines against H. pylori infection and new drugs for cancer therapy. Results: Here, we provide a simple process for high-yield production of HP-NAP by applying one-step negative chromatography to purify recombinant HP-NAP expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). In our E. coli expression system, recombinant HP-NAP constitutes nearly 70% of the total protein. Overexpressed recombinant HP-NAP is almost completely soluble upon cell lysis at pH 9.5. Under the optimal condition at pH 8.0, recombinant HP-NAP with purity higher than 95% can be obtained from E. coli by collecting the unbound fraction using diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) Sephadex resin in batch mode. The overall yield of HP-NAP from a 50-ml E. coli culture is ~19 mg. The purified HP-NAP folds into a multimer with a secondary structure of α-helix and is able to trigger the production of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils. Conclusions: Purification of recombinant HP-NAP overexpressed in E. coli using DEAE Sephadex negative mode batch chromatography is an efficient method for high-yield production of highly pure HP-NAP in its native state. The purified HP-NAP is useful for various clinical applications including vaccine development, diagnosis, and new drug development. ?

Robots have the advantages of high precision, strong consistency, and stability. Thus, in the field of medical applications, the use of robots exactly helps to overcome the technical limitations of conventional surgery performed by physicians. Telepresence helps extend not only human vision and hearing but also the sense of touch, which is important for physical rehabilitation. From the user's perspective, human-centered design is definitely critical to the success of the telepresence robot.

To address these limitations, we developed a paper-based immunoaffinity platform for separating subgroups of EVs that is easy, efficient, and requires sample volumes as low as 10 μl. Biological samples can be pipetted directly onto paper test zones that have been chemically modified with capture molecules that have high affinity to specific EV surface markers. We validate the assay by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), paper-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (P-ELISA), and transcriptome analysis.

The syndecans (SDCs), a group of adhesion receptors, can modulate adhesion and organize the extracellular matrix (ECM). In this study, we cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) on controlled polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates coated with poly- l-lysine (poly) or fibronectin (FN) to investigate cell adhesion and mechanotransduction mechanisms by mechanical stretching on PDMS using DRG neurons. Our results demonstrated that neuronal density, neurite length, and neurite branching were lower in the PDMS group and could be further reversed through activating SDC-4 by FN. The expression of the SDC-4 pathway decreased but with increased pPKCα in the PDMS-poly group. After mechanical stretching, pPKCα-FAKpTyr397-pERK1/2 expression was increased in both poly- and FN-coated PDMS. These results indicate that SDC4-pPKCα-FAKpTyr397-pERK1/2 may play a crucial role in DRG adhesion and mechanotransduction. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Dorsal root ganglion; Focal adhesion kinase; Mechanotransduction; Polydimethylsiloxane; Protein kinase C; Syndecan-4,"beta actin; dimeticone; fibronectin; focal adhesion kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; polylysine; protein kinase C alpha; syndecan 4; baysilon; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; protein kinase C alpha; syndecan 4; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; cell adhesion; cell density; controlled study; mechanotransduction; mouse; nerve fiber growth; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; spinal cord nerve cell; spinal ganglion; statistical significance; animal; cell adhesion; culture technique; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; mechanical stress; metabolism; nerve cell; neurite; phosphorylation; physiology; spinal ganglion; ultrastructure; Animals; Cell Adhesion; Cell Culture Techniques; Dimethylpolysiloxanes; Fibronectins; Ganglia, Spinal; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Mice, Inbred ICR; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Neurites; Neurons; Phosphorylation; Polylysine; Protein Kinase C-alpha; Stress, Mechanical; Syndecan-4",2-s2.0-84924720780

The polymersomes were obtained from the self-assembly of lipid-containing copolymer, poly(acrylic acid-co-distearin acrylate), in aqueous solution. The Cy5.5 and Gd(III) species were loaded into polymersomes via hydrophobic association (loading efficiency of Cy5.5 ca 74%) and electrostatic complexation (Gd(III) 83%), respectively. The Cy5.5/Gd(III)-loaded polymersomes (CGLPs) have shown excellent payload confinement, reduced dilution effect on assembly dissociation and decreased protein/salt-induced colloidal aggregation. Owing to the highly hydrated structure of vesicular membrane, the superior contrast enhancement of CGLPs in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was obtained as a result of prolonged rotational correlation time of Gd(III) cations and fast water exchange from Gd(III) to bulk solution. The CGLPs exhibit a 15-fold higher longitudinal relaxivity value (ca 60mM-1s-1) than that (4mM-1s-1) of the commercial contrast agent, Magnevist, in phosphate buffered saline. The in vivo characterization demonstrates that CGLPs exhibit a signal-to-noise ratio in T1-weighted MR image contrast similar to that of Magnevist, yet with a Gd dose 5-fold lower. An excellent contrast in NIR imaging at tumor site was attained following the intravenous injection of GGLPs into Tramp-C1 tumor-bearing mice (C57BL/6). Along with their non-toxicity at the dose used, these results demonstrate the great potential of the CGLPs as an advanced diagnostic nanodevice. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Cancer diagnosis; Diagnostic polymersomes; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Near-infrared (NIR) imaging,"Complexation; Diagnosis; Hydration; Hydrogels; Hydrophobicity; Infrared devices; Loading; Polymers; Positive ions; Self assembly; Signal to noise ratio; Solutions; Tumors; Cancer diagnosis; Electrostatic complexation; Hydrophobic association; Near-infrared fluorophores; Near-infrared imaging; Phosphate-buffered salines; Polymersomes; Rotational correlation time; Magnetic resonance imaging; acrylic acid derivative; contrast medium; distearin acrylate; gadolinium; gadolinium pentetate meglumine; phosphate buffered saline; polyacrylic acid; polymer; polymersome; unclassified drug; acrylic acid resin; carbocyanine; carbopol 940; contrast medium; CY5.5 cyanine dye; diacylglycerol; fluorescent dye; animal experiment; animal model; aqueous solution; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; complex formation; contrast enhancement; dilution; drug cytotoxicity; drug uptake; human; human cell; hydrophobicity; male; mouse; near infrared imaging system; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prostate tumor; signal noise ratio; single drug dose; static electricity; tumor xenograft; animal; C57BL mouse; cancer transplantation; cell survival; chemical phenomena; chemistry; drug delivery system; drug effects; HeLa cell line; molecular imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; polymerization; procedures; Prostatic Neoplasms; transport at the cellular level; Mus; Acrylic Resins; Animals; Biological Transport; Carbocyanines; Cell Survival; Contrast Media; Diglycerides; Drug Delivery Systems; Fluorescent Dyes; Gadolinium; HeLa Cells; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molecular Imaging; Neoplasm Transplantation; Polymerization; Prostatic Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84923322614

It has been suggested that chemotactic gradients attract neutrophils, leading to extravasation, but recent findings also implicate vascular hydrodynamic forces in chemotactic responses. With this motivation, we developed a Labchip that mimics the dynamic three-dimensional microenvironment of a blood vessel. This capillary-endothelium-mimetic (CEM) microfluidic chip serves as a dynamic transwell system for studying neutrophil migration at different flow velocities. Under lower flow rates, the chemotactic factor dominates over the flow rate, increasing the extravasation of neutrophil-like cells; at higher flow rates, the neutrophil-like cells aggregate near the side wall of the chamber due to a hydrodynamic force, limiting extravasation. In this report, we demonstrate the use of this Labchip for studying extravasation behavior over an extended period of time, under conditions of continuous flow and a stable concentration gradient. This Labchip-based approach is also applicable to the study of cancer metastasis, atherosclerosis and other angiopathies. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Hepatoma cells incubated with ConA-SCHSs were thus more easily killed by the subsequent irradiation with a NIR laser.

It has been unclear why standard statistical methods, such as the t-test and ANOVA, often lead to low levels of reproducibility, how likely applying fold-change cutoffs to enhance reproducibility is to miss key signals, and how adversely using such methods has affected data interpretations. We broadly examined expression data to investigate the reproducibility problem and discovered that molecular heterogeneity, a biological property of genetically different samples, has been improperly handled by the statistical methods. Here we give a mathematical description of the discovery and report the development of a statistical method, named HTA, for better handling molecular heterogeneity. We broadly demonstrate the improved sensitivity and specificity of HTA over the conventional methods and show that using fold-change cutoffs has lost much information. We illustrate the especial usefulness of HTA for heterogeneous diseases, by applying it to existing data sets of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease, and show it can abundantly and reproducibly uncover disease signatures not previously detectable. Based on 156 biological data sets, we estimate that the methodological issue has affected over 96% of expression studies and that HTA can profoundly correct 86% of the affected data interpretations. The methodological advancement can better facilitate systems understandings of biological processes, render biological inferences that are more reliable than they have hitherto been and engender translational medical applications, such as identifying diagnostic biomarkers and drug prediction, which are more robust. ? 2015 Chen et al.",,"Article; bipolar disorder; controlled study; data analysis; gene expression; genetic heterogeneity; heterogeneity corrected transcriptome analysis; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; molecular heterogeneity; Parkinson disease; reproducibility; schizophrenia; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; validation study; gene expression regulation; genetic database; human; human genome; questionnaire; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Heterogeneity; Genome, Human; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84961349496

A previous study revealed that a high blood glucose concentration induces glycoxidation and weakens the retinal capillaries. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of high blood glucose induced diabetic retinopathy remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we cultured the retinal pigmented epithelial cell line ARPE-19 in mannitol-balanced 5.5, 25, and 100 mM glucose media and investigated protein level alterations. Proteomic analysis revealed significant changes in 137 protein features, of which 124 demonstrated changes in a glucose concentration dependent manner. Several proteins functionally associated with redox regulation, protein folding, or the cytoskeleton are affected by increased glucose concentrations. Additional analyses also revealed that cellular oxidative stress, including endoplasmic reticulum stress, was significantly increased after treatment with high glucose concentrations. However, the mitochondrial membrane potential and cell survival remained unchanged during treatment with high glucose concentrations. To summarize, in this study, we used a comprehensive retinal pigmented epithelial cell based proteomic approach for identifying changes in protein expression associated retinal markers induced by high glucose concentrations. Our results revealed that a high glucose condition can induce cellular oxidative stress and modulate the levels of proteins with functions in redox regulation, protein folding, and cytoskeleton regulation; however, cell viability and mitochondrial integrity are not significantly disturbed under these high glucose conditions. ? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The ruling elite, irrespective of whether it is democratic, has the incentive to develop state capacity to prevent damage caused by natural disasters, which is considered a threat to its rule and revenue. To win elections in a democracy, the elite may increase public spending for disaster mitigation in favor of voters' demands. Democracy also empowers civil society and stimulates social spending, which benefits vulnerable citizens. Thus, a strong state capacity effectively reduces human vulnerability, especially in a democracy. I used panel data from 150 countries between 1995 and 2009 to demonstrate the relationship among state capacity, democracy, and the impact of disasters. After controlling for the density and magnitude continuity of natural-disaster hazards, the empirical results I obtained from the multilevel models indicate that democracy reduces the disaster mortality rate, and a strong state capacity mitigates the effect of a disaster on a population, especially in a democracy. I also found that state capacity and democracy are more effective in preventing human losses caused by predictable disasters such as floods and storms, rather than earthquakes. ?

This work reports an injectable system of hollow microspheres (HMs) that can rapidly produce localized heat activated by near-infrared (NIR) light and control the release of an antibiotic via a ""molecular switch"" in their polymer shells, as a combination strategy for treating subcutaneous abscesses. The HMs have a shell of poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and an aqueous core that is comprised of vancomycin (Van) and polypyrrole nanoparticles (PPy NPs), which are photothermal agents. Experimental results demonstrate that the micro-HMs ensure efficiently the spatial stabilization of their encapsulated Van and PPy NPs at the injection site in mice with subcutaneous abscesses. Without NIR irradiation, the HMs elute a negligible drug concentration, but release substantially more when exposed to NIR light, suggesting that this system is suitable as a photothermally-responsive drug delivery system. The combination of photothermally-induced hyperthermia and antibiotic therapy with HMs increases cytotoxicity for bacteria in abscesses, to an extent that is greater than the sum of the two treatments alone, demonstrating a synergistic effect.

The effectiveness of antiviral therapies for influenza has been limited by the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel antiviral therapies. Here we tested the effects of 300 traditional Chinese medicines on the replication of various influenza virus strains in a lung cell line, A549, using an influenza-specific luciferase reporter assay. Of the traditional medicines tested, Polygonum cuspidatum (PC) and its active components, resveratrol and emodin, were found to attenuate influenza viral replication in A549 cells. Furthermore, they preferentially inhibited the replication of influenza A virus, including clinical strains isolated in 2009 and 2011 in Taiwan and the laboratory strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1). In addition to inhibiting the expression of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, PC, emodin, and resveratrol also increased the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Moreover, the anti-viral activity of IFN-β or resveratrol was reduced when the A549 cells were treated with neutralizing anti-IFN-β antibodies or a TLR9 inhibitor, suggesting that IFN-β likely acts synergistically with resveratrol to inhibit H1N1 replication. This potential antiviral mechanism, involving direct inhibition of virus replication and simultaneous activation of the host immune response, has not been previously described for a single antiviral molecule. In conclusion, our data support the use of PC, resveratrol or emodin for inhibiting influenza virus replication directly and via TLR-9-induced IFN-β production. ? 2015 PLOS ONE.",,beta interferon; emodin; resveratrol; toll like receptor 9; beta interferon; plant extract; toll like receptor 9; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; embryo; human; human cell; immune response; Influenza A virus A WSN 33 H1N1; Influenza virus A H1N1; luciferase assay; nonhuman; Polygonum cuspidatum; protein expression; Taiwan; virus inhibition; virus replication; virus strain; animal; cell line; dog; drug effects; Influenza A virus; metabolism; physiology; virus replication; Influenza A virus; Orthomyxoviridae; Polygonum cuspidatum; Animals; Cell Line; Dogs; Fallopia japonica; Humans; Influenza A virus; Interferon-beta; Plant Extracts; Toll-Like Receptor 9; Virus Replication,2-s2.0-84922575717

MPL-unmutated myeloproliferative neoplasm, and have become an important clonal marker for the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis. In the present study, we sought to use high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) as a screening method for the detection of CALR mutations. Methods: 32 JAK2/. MPL-unmutated ET patients were retrospectively enrolled and 8 healthy adults were used as wild-type control. CALR exon 9 mutation was independently screened by HRMA with the CFX Connect real-time system and Sanger sequencing. TA-cloning was used to detect CALR exon 9 mutations in patients suspected to have low mutant allele burden. Results: The maximal sensitivity of HRMA in identifying both CALR type 1 and type 2 mutants from patients' genomic DNA was 2.5%. Twenty-two samples were found to have distinct melting curves from wild-type. The presence of CALR mutations in 16 of these 22 samples was confirmed by Sanger sequencing, while the other 6 samples were wild-type by sequencing. After TA-cloning, CALR mutations were detected in 5 of 6 patients from 1 (6%) of 16 clones to 1 (2%) of 50 clones. Therefore, HRMA identified CALR mutations in 21 (65.6%) of 32 ET patients compared to 16 (50%) patients by Sanger sequencing, with a false positive rate of 3% and no false negative. Conclusion: The HRMA developed in our system is a rapid and sensitive technique for the detection of CALR exon 9 mutations. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Calreticulin (CALR); Essential thrombocythemia; High-resolution melting analysis; Mutation; Myeloproliferative neoplasm,"calreticulin; genomic DNA; calreticulin; calreticulin, human; JAK2 protein, human; Janus kinase 2; adult; allele; Article; CALR gene; clinical article; controlled study; DNA extraction; exon; false positive result; gene mutation; high resolution melting analysis; human; molecular cloning; mutant; myelofibrosis; nucleotide sequence; retrospective study; sensitivity analysis; thrombocythemia; wild type; case control study; cohort analysis; exon; genetics; mutation; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; Adult; Calreticulin; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; DNA Mutational Analysis; Exons; Humans; Janus Kinase 2; Mutation; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thrombocythemia, Essential",2-s2.0-84911873614

In the present study, size-segregated biomass burning tracers, including anhydrosugars (levoglucosan (LG) and mannosan (MN)) and non-sea-salt potassium (nss-K+), were determined at an urban and a suburban site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. The size distributions of biomass burning tracers were generally characterized by a unimodal pattern peaking in the particle size range of 0.44-1.0μm, except for MN during the wet season, for which a bimodal pattern (one in fine and one in coarse mode) was observed. These observed biomass burning tracers in the PRD region shifted towards larger particle sizes compared to the typical size distributions of fresh biomass smoke particles. Elevated biomass burning tracers were observed during the dry season when biomass burning activities were intensive and meteorological conditions favored the transport of biomass smoke particles from the rural areas in the PRD and neighboring areas to the sampling sites. The fine mode biomass burning tracers significantly correlated with each other, confirming their common sources. Rather high δLG/δMN ratios were observed at both sites, indicating limited influence from softwood combustion. High δnss-K+/δLG ratios further suggested that biomass burning aerosols in the PRD were predominately associated with burning of crop residues. Using a simplified receptor-oriented approach with an emission factor of 0.075 (LG/TC) obtained from several chamber studies, average contributions of biomass burning emissions to total carbon in fine particles were estimated to be 23% and 16% at the urban and suburban site, respectively, during the dry season. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Anhydrosugars; Biomass combustion; Potassium; Size distribution; Source-receptor study,Agricultural wastes; Atmospheric movements; Combustion; Drought; Health risks; Particle size; Potassium; Rural areas; Size distribution; Smoke; Urban growth; Carbon; Anhydrosugars; Biomass burning emissions; Biomass combustion; Larger particle sizes; Meteorological condition; Non-sea-salt potassiums; Pearl River Delta region; Source-receptor; Relative contribution; Biomass; levoglucosan; mannosan; polysaccharide; potassium; unclassified drug; carbohydrate derivative; carbon; levoglucosan; manganese; mannosan; potassium; radioactive aerosol; tracer; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; carbon emission; combustion; health risk; particle size; pollutant source; size distribution; smoke; crop residue; emission inventory; potassium; sugar; tracer; aerosol; Article; biomass burning; biotechnological procedures; carbon footprint; chemical mass balance; China; combustion; dry season; meteorological phenomena; model; particle size; plant residue; positive matrix factorization; river; rural area; season; seasonal variation; smoke; softwood; suburban area; urban area; wet season; wood; biomass production; dry deposition; ecological procedures; fire ecology; human; particulate matter; radiation measurement; radioisotope distribution; river ecosystem; wetland; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta,2-s2.0-84916893544

The paramagnetic GQDs, named folate-GdGQDs, were successfully prepared by covalently conjugating diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium and folic acid onto the surface of GQDs. The resultant folate-GdGQDs, which showed a longitudinal relaxivity r1 of 11.49 mM-1 s-1, greatly enhanced the brightness of the T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, indicating their potential for use as positive contrast agents for MR imaging (MRI). The feasibility of utilizing the folate-GdGQDs with strong luminescence emissions for targeted imaging of HeLa cells was also evaluated. An in vitro cell (HeLa and HepG2 cells) viability assay and in vivo evaluation of toxicity to the embryonic development of zebrafish showed that these folate-GdGQDs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility within the given range of concentrations. More importantly, strong therapeutic activity was achieved by loading Dox onto the surfaces of folate-GdGQDs through π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions, leading to the formation of folate-GdGQD/Dox multifunctional nanocarriers. Approximately 80% of the loaded Dox was released from the folate-GdGQD/Dox nanocarriers under mild acidic conditions (pH 5.0), whereas only 20% of Dox was released at pH 7.0 after 48 h. Furthermore, these multifunctional nanocarriers could efficiently induce an inhibitory effect on HeLa cells, as confirmed by an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. The combined flow cytometry analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopic observation showed that these nanocarriers were efficiently taken up by the cancer cells overexpressing folate receptors. Taken together, these results suggested that the multifunctional nanocarriers could be used as promising targeted drug delivery vehicles for the diagnosis and image-guided chemotherapy of various cancers.

In this study, novel Paeonol-phenylsulfonyl derivatives were synthesized and their antiviral effect against HBV was evaluated. The experimental results indicated that these compounds process significant antiviral potential, including the inhibition of viral antigen expression and secretion, and the suppression of HBV viral DNA replication.

Epidemiological studies have shown that drinking green tea can reduce the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), yet the underlying mechanism is not well understood. In this study, the inhibitory effect of EGCG was tested on a set of Epstein Barr virus-negative and -positive NPC cell lines. Treatment with EGCG inhibited the proliferation of NPC cells but did not affect the growth of a non-malignant nasopharyngeal cell line, NP460hTert. Moreover, EGCG treated cells had reduced migration and invasive properties. The expression of the cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and β-catenin was found to be up-regulated by EGCG treatment, while the down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were found to be mediated by suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and AP-1 and Sp1 transactivation. Spheroid formation by NPC cells in suspension was significantly inhibited by EGCG. Oral administration of EGCG was capable of suppressing tumor growth in xenografted mice bearing NPC tumors. Treatment with EGCG was found to elevate the expression of p53 and p21, and eventually led to apoptosis of NPC cells via caspase 3 activation. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB and β-catenin was also suppressed by EGCG treatment. These results indicate that EGCG can inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness, and induce apoptosis, of NPC cells, making it a promising agent for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy of NPC. ? 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Apoptosis; Chemoprevention; EGCG; Invasiveness; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"beta catenin; claudin 1; complementary DNA; epidermal growth factor receptor; epigallocatechin gallate; gelatinase; Hermes antigen; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; matrix metalloproteinase; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein p21; protein p53; uvomorulin; cadherin; caspase 3; catechin; cell adhesion molecule; epigallocatechin gallate; gelatinase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell culture; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity assay; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; gene translocation; immunofluorescence; mouse; nasopharynx carcinoma; nonhuman; protein expression; quantitative assay; RNA extraction; transcription initiation; tumor growth; Western blotting; zymography; analogs and derivatives; animal; cell motion; down regulation; drug effects; enzymology; human; metabolism; multicellular spheroid; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; pathology; SCID mouse; signal transduction; tumor cell line; upregulation; xenograft; Human herpesvirus 4; Mus; Animals; Apoptosis; Cadherins; Caspase 3; Catechin; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Gelatinases; Humans; Mice; Mice, SCID; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; NF-kappa B; Signal Transduction; Spheroids, Cellular; Transplantation, Heterologous; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-84921854119

It has been hypothesized that aptamers, which are single-stranded DNAs or RNAs that demonstrate high affinity to a large variety of molecules ranging from small drugs, metabolites, or proteins, could be used for the measurement of HbA1c. Aptamers are selected through an in vitro process called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), and they can be chemically synthesized with high reproducibility at relatively low costs. This study therefore aimed to select HbA1c- and hemoglobin (Hb)-specific single-stranded DNA aptamers using an on-chip SELEX protocol. A microfluidic SELEX chip was developed to continuously and automatically carry out multiple rounds of SELEX to screen specific aptamers for HbA1c and Hb. HbA1c and Hb were first coated onto magnetic beads. Following several rounds of selection and enrichment with a randomized 40-mer DNA library, specific oligonucleotides were selected. The binding specificity and affinity were assessed by competitive and binding assays. Using the developed microfluidic system, the incubation and partitioning times were greatly decreased, and the entire process was shortened dramatically. Both HbA1c- and Hb-specific aptamers selected by the microfluidic system showed high specificity and affinity (dissociation constant, K d = 7.6 ± 3.0 nM and 7.3 ± 2.2 nM for HbA1c and Hb, respectively). With further refinements in the assay, these aptamers may replace the conventional antibodies for in vitro diagnostics applications in the near future. ?

These infectious diseases have no effective treatments and the mortality rate is over 80%, which could cause dramatic economic losses in the aquaculture industry. Conventional diagnostic methods of NNV or iridovirus infected fishes, such as virus culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and nucleic acid assays usually require time-consuming and complex procedures performed by specialized technicians with delicate laboratory facilities. Rapid, simple, accurate and on-site detection of NNV and iridovirus infections would enable timely preventive measures such as immediate sacrifice of infected fishes, and is therefore critically needed for the aquaculture industry. In this study, a microfluidic-based assay that employ magnetic beads conjugated with viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) capturing probes and fluorescent DNA molecular beacons were developed to rapidly detect NNV and iridovirus. Importantly, this new assay was realized in an integrated microfluidic system with a custom-made control system. With this approach, direct and automated NNV and iridovirus detection from infected fishes can be achieved in less than 30. min.

The advantages of GNPs lie in its superior optical property, biocompatibility and versatile conjugation chemistry, which are promising to develop diagnostic probes and drug delivery systems. 198Au is used as a radiotracer because it simultaneously emits beta and gamma radiations with proper energy and half-life; therefore, 198Au can be used for bioanalytical purposes. The 198Au-tagged radioactive gold nanoparticles (198Au-GNPs) were prepared simply by irradiating the GNPs in a nuclear reactor through the 197Au(n,γ)198Au reaction and subsequently the 198Au-GNPs were subjected to surface modification with polyethylene glycol to form PEGylated 198Au-GNPs. The 198Au-GNPs retained physicochemical properties that were the same as those of GNP before neutron irradiation. Pharmacokinetic and biodisposition studies were performed by intravenously injecting three types of 198Au-GNPs with or without PEGylation into mice; the γ radiation in blood specimens and dissected organs was then measured. The 198Au-radiotracer technique enables rapid quantification freed from tedious sample preparation and shows more than 95% recovery of injected GNPs. Clinical gamma scintigraphy was proved feasible to explore spatial- and temporal-resolved biodisposition of 198Au-GNPs in living animals. Moreover, autoradiography, which recorded beta particles from 198Au, enabled visualizing the heterogeneous biodisposition of 198Au-GNPs in different microenvironments and tissues. In this study, the 198Au-radiotracer technique facilitated creating a trimodality analytical platform for tracing, quantifying and imaging GNPs in animals. ? 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Animals; Biocompatibility; Dissection; Drug delivery; Fiber optic sensors; Gamma rays; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Neutron irradiation; Nuclear medicine; Nuclear reactors; Optical properties; Radioactive tracers; Radiography; Tissue; Conjugation chemistry; Drug delivery system; Gamma scintigraphies; Gold Nanoparticles; Gold nanoparticles (GNPs); Physicochemical property; Radiotracer techniques; Sample preparation; Gold; gold; macrogol derivative; metal nanoparticle; tracer; animal; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic use; half life time; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; male; mouse; particle size; procedures; scintiscanning; tissue distribution; Animals; Diagnostic Imaging; Gold; Half-Life; Male; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Particle Size; Polyethylene Glycols; Radioactive Tracers; Radionuclide Imaging; Tissue Distribution",2-s2.0-84920471776

Haplotypes are regions of linked genetic variants that are closely spaced on the genome and tend to be inherited together. Genetics research has revealed SNPs within certain haplotype blocks that introduce few distinct common haplotypes into most of the population. Haplotype block structures are used in association-based methods to map disease genes. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for identifying haplotype blocks in the genome. In chromosomal haplotype data retrieved from the HapMap project website, the proposed algorithm identified longer haplotype blocks than an existing algorithm. To enhance its performance, we extended the proposed algorithm into a parallel algorithm that copies data in parallel via the Hadoop MapReduce framework. The proposed MapReduce-paralleled combinatorial algorithm performed well on real-world data obtained from the HapMap dataset; the improvement in computational efficiency was proportional to the number of processors used. ? 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Cloud computing; Haplotype; MapReduce; Parallel processing; SNPs,"algorithm; allele; Article; chromosome 10; chromosome 7; chromosome 8; chromosome 9; computer program; haplotype; mathematical model; scoring system; single nucleotide polymorphism; biology; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; human; human genome; single nucleotide polymorphism; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Genome, Human; Genome-Wide Association Study; Haplotypes; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-84920518093

Various types of multivalent neoglycoconjugates have been synthesized over the years. The primary focus was frequently to enhance the affinity or amplify the inhibitory potency of these biological systems. Thus, the designed neoglycoconjugates are capable of targeting bacterial cells and bacterial toxins, cancer imaging, targeted delivery, and antiadhesion. This chapter attempts to generate a snapshot of some potential future approaches of glycans to treat diseases.

Pregnant smokers and non-smokers had significantly different perceptions regarding risk of smoking and second-hand smoke during pregnancy. Pregnant non-smokers adopted more behaviors to avoid second-hand smoke both at home and in public than pregnant smokers. We conclude that perceived fetal health risks from smoking and second-hand smoke influenced maternal behavior during pregnancy. Pregnant women’s perceptions of the risk of tobacco smoke depended on whether their focus in the decision-making process was on prevention or promotion.

We have found that a hypomorphic mutation of Tequila (Teqf01792), as well as cell-specific downregulation of Tequila in insulin-producing neurons of the fly, significantly extends life span. Tequila deficiency-induced life-span extension is likely to be associated with reduced insulin-like signaling, because Tequila mutant flies display several common phenotypes of insulin dysregulation, including reduced circulating Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (Dilp2), reduced Akt phosphorylation, reduced body size, and altered glucose homeostasis.

Potential crosstalk network biomarkers for the transition from innate to adaptive immunity were identified based on proteins with larger interaction variations inside the host and pathogen, and at the interface between the host and pathogen. The crosstalk network biomarkers consist of proteins with larger interaction variation scores in the pathogen-host interaction difference network.

To uncover how 14-3-3? contributes to the tumor progression of HCC, we investigated the potential downstream targets regulated by 14-3-3?. We found that 14-3-3? increases expression and nuclear translocation of ?-catenin and that 14-3-3?-induced cell proliferation is attenuated by ?-catenin silencing in HCC cells. Moreover, 14-3-3? induces aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) expression through the activation of ?-catenin signaling. Knockdown of AKR1B10 by siRNAs abolished 14-3-3?-induced in vitro cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth as well as in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, AKR1B10 silencing increased retinoic acid (RA) levels in the serum of tumor-bearing mice and RA treatment attenuated 14-3-3?-induced HCC cell proliferation.

We hypothesized that drug-loaded RBCM droplets (RBCMDs) would undergo a transition from liquid (droplets) to gas (bubbles) upon high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) insonation, resulting in on-demand drug release. The generated microbubbles could also serve as a contrast agent to enhance ultrasound imaging. As-synthesized RBCMDs exhibited uniform size, good dispersity and preservation of RBCM-associated proteins that prevented uptake by macrophages. Camptothecin (CPT), an anti-cancer drug, was successfully loaded in the RBCMDs with a loading efficiency of 2-3% and an encapsulation efficiency of 62-97%. A short (3 min) exposure to HIFU irradiation triggered release of CPT from the RBCMDs and the physical explosion of droplets damaged nearby cancer cells resulting in significant cell death. In addition, the acoustically vaporized RBCMDs significantly increased the ultrasound echo signal to 30 dB. Lastly, we demonstrated that RBCMDs could be acoustically vaporized in vivo in target tissues, and enhancing ultrasound imaging. Taken together, we have developed a new class of naturally derived RBCMDs which show great potential for future application in remotely triggered drug delivery and ultrasound imaging enhancement.",Biomimetic vesicles; Cancer therapy; Red blood cell membrane; Remotely triggerable drug delivery; Ultrasound theranostics,camptothecin; drug carrier; biomimetic material; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; B scan; biomimetics; cell viability; contrast enhancement; controlled study; drug delivery system; drug release; erythrocyte membrane; high intensity focused ultrasound; male; microbubble; molecular imaging; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; particle size; phase transition; signal noise ratio; systematic review (topic); theranostic nanomedicine; cell membrane; drug delivery system; erythrocyte; procedures; sound; theranostic nanomedicine; ultrasound; Biomimetic Materials; Cell Membrane; Drug Delivery Systems; Erythrocytes; Sound; Theranostic Nanomedicine; Ultrasonics,2-s2.0-84948439225

Surface modifications of SPIO NPs are usually required to improve their rapid in vivo clearance profiles. In this study, we prepare novel stem cell membrane (STM)-camouflaged SPIO NPs for biomedical applications. The water-soluble and highly dispersed STM-SPIO NPs were prepared using a simple and mild sonication method. The increased size of STM-SPIO NPs compared to unmodified SPIO NPs suggested successful STM coating onto the SPIO NP surfaces. The STM coating was further confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging and dye retention assay. High preservation of STM-associated proteins on the SPIO NPs was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. Specifically, retention of stem cell-specific marker CD44 was confirmed using an antibody binding assay. As a potential MRI agent, STM-SPIO NPs exhibited good magnetization (65.9 emu g-1) and dose-dependent T2-weighted imaging contrasts (R2 = 653.3 s-1 mM-1) in vitro. In comparison to unmodified SPIO NPs, the macrophage uptake of STM-SPIO NPs was found to be significantly less by Prussian blue staining and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. Under the application of an alternating magnetic field (AMF), STM-SPIO NPs successfully induced cancer cell death via a magnetic hyperthermia mechanism. The results demonstrated good potential for STM-SPIO NPs for future theranostic applications. ? 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Antibodies; Biomimetics; Cell death; Cells; Coatings; Cytology; Electrophoresis; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hyperthermia therapy; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Iron oxides; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetism; Mass spectrometry; Medical applications; Metal nanoparticles; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; Sodium sulfate; Stem cells; Transmission electron microscopy; Alternating magnetic field; Biomedical applications; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometries (ICPMS); Iron oxide nanoparticle; Magnetic hyperthermia; Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles; T2-weighted imaging; Scanning tunneling microscopy,2-s2.0-84948400893

Here we show that in CSCs CD133 contributes to β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation and to the self-renewal capacity of sphere-forming and side-population (SP) cells in cell lines from brain, colon and lung cancers, but not gastric or breast cancers. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, β-catenin binding to the proximal promoter regions of ITGA2-4 and ITGA10-11 in brain, colon and lung cancer cell lines could be triggered by CD133, and β-catenin also bound to the proximal promoter regions of ITGB6 and ITGB8 in cell lines from gastric and breast cancers. CD133 thus induces β-catenin binding and transcriptional activation of diverse targets that are cancer type-specific. Cell migration triggered by wounding CD133 + cells cultured on ECM-coated dishes can induce polarity and lipid raft coalescence, enhancing CD133/integrin signaling and asymmetric cell division. In response to directional cues, integrins, Src and the Par complex were enriched in lipid rafts, and the assembly and activation of an integrated CD133-integrin-Par signaling complex was followed by Src/Akt/GSK3β signaling. The subsequent increase and nuclear translocation of β-catenin may be a regulatory switch to increase drug resistance and stemness properties. Collectively, these findings 1) indicate that a polarized cell migration-induced CD133/integrin/Src/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin axis is required for maintenance of CSC properties, 2) establish a function for CD133 and 3) support the rationale for targeting CD133 in cancer treatment.",Cancer stem cell; CD133; Cell surface marker; Extracellular matrix; β-catenin,"beta catenin; CD133 antigen; fibrinogen receptor; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; integrin; protein kinase B; protein tyrosine kinase; AKT1 protein, human; beta catenin; CD133 antigen; CTNNB1 protein, human; glycogen synthase kinase 3; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; glycoprotein; GSK3B protein, human; Gsk3b protein, mouse; integrin; leukocyte antigen; peptide; PROM1 protein, human; Prom1 protein, mouse; protein kinase B; protein kinase p60; tumor marker; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer stem cell; cell migration; cell renewal; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; fluorescence activated cell sorting; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; ITGA10 gene; ITGA11 gene; ITGA2 gene; ITGA3 gene; ITGA4 gene; lipid raft; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; plasmid; promoter region; protein binding; side population cell; signal transduction; transcription initiation; animal; apoptosis; cancer stem cell; cell adhesion; cell motion; cell proliferation; drug screening; enzyme immunoassay; female; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; SCID mouse; side population cell; tumor cell culture; Western blotting; AC133 Antigen; Animals; Antigens, CD; Apoptosis; beta Catenin; Biomarkers, Tumor; Blotting, Western; Cell Adhesion; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Female; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Glycoproteins; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Integrins; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, SCID; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Peptides; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src); Side-Population Cells; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84947779836

We hypothesised that AGEs reduce insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells by damaging mitochondrial functions and inducing mitophagy. Mitochondrial morphology and the occurrence of autophagy were examined in pancreatic islets of diabetic db/db mice and in the cultured CML-BSA-treated insulinoma cell line RIN-m5F. In addition, the effects of α-lipoic acid (ALA) on mitochondria in AGEdamaged tissues were evaluated. The diabetic db/db mouse exhibited an increase in the number of autophagosomes in damaged mitochondria and receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Treatment of db/db mice with ALA for 12 wk increased the number of mitochondria with wellorganized cristae and fewer autophagosomes. Treatment of RIN-m5F cells with CML-BSA increased the level of RAGE protein and autophagosome formation, caused mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreased insulin secretion. CML-BSA also reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, increased ROS and lipid peroxide production, and caused mitochondrial DNA deletions. Elevated fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) level and mitochondrial fragmentation demonstrated the unbalance of mitochondrial fusion and fission in CML-BSA-treated cells. Additionally, increased levels of Parkin and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 protein suggest that fragmented mitochondria were associated with increased mitophagic activity, and ALA attenuated the CML-BSAinduced mitophage formation. Our study demonstrated that CMLBSA induced mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy in pancreatic β-cells. The findings from this study suggest that increased concentration of AGEs may damage β-cells and reduce insulin secretion. ? 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Advanced glycated end products; Diabetes; Mitochondrial dynamics; Mitophagy,"6 n carboxymethyllysine; adenosine triphosphate; advanced glycation end product; advanced glycation end product receptor; bovine serum albumin; dynamin I; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; lipid peroxide; mitochondrial DNA; mitofusin 1; mitofusin 2; parkin; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase induced putative kinase 1; proinsulin; protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; thioctic acid; topm 20 protein; unclassified drug; advanced glycation end product; advanced glycation end product receptor; advanced glycation end products-bovine serum albumin; Ager protein, mouse; antioxidant; biological marker; bovine serum albumin; insulin; lysine; N(6)-carboxymethyllysine; oxidizing agent; thioctic acid; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; cell aggregation; cell fusion; cellular distribution; confocal microscopy; controlled study; depolarization; diabetes mellitus; flow cytometry; glucose blood level; insulin release; insulinoma cell line; lipid peroxidation; male; membrane biology; microbial morphology; mitochondrial aggregation; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial fission; mitochondrial fusion; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; mitochondrion swelling; mitophagy; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; pathogenesis; priority journal; transmission electron microscopy; Western blotting; wild type; agonists; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; C57BL mouse; diet supplementation; diet therapy; down regulation; drug effects; metabolism; mitochondrial dynamics; mutant mouse strain; pancreas islet beta cell; pathology; phagosome; rat; secretion (process); tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Advanced Glycosylation End Product-Specific Receptor; Animals; Antioxidants; Biomarkers; Cell Line, Tumor; Diabetes Mellitus; Dietary Supplements; Down-Regulation; Glycosylation End Products, Advanced; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Lysine; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Mutant Strains; Mitochondrial Degradation; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Oxidants; Phagosomes; Rats; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Thioctic Acid",2-s2.0-84947230056

In the current study, we used a pair of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549 and the pemetrexed-resistant A549/PEM cells, as a model to monitor resistance-dependent cellular responses and identify potential therapeutic targets. By means of 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), we investigated the global protein expression alterations induced by pemetrexed treatment and resistance. The proteomic result revealed that pemetrexed exposure obviously altered the expression of 81 proteins in the A549 cells, whereas no significant response was observed in the similarly treated A549/PEM cells, hence implying an association between these proteins and the drug-specific response. Moreover, 72 proteins including flavin reductase and calreticulin demonstrated differential expression between the A549 and A549/PEM cells, indicating baseline resistance. Additional tests employed siRNA silencing, protein overexpression, cell viability analysis, and analysis of apoptosis to examine and confirm the potency of flavin reductase and calreticulin proteins in the development of pemetrexed resistance. In summary, by using a proteomic approach, we identified numerous proteins, including flavin reductase and calreticulin, involved in pemetrexed drug resistance-developing mechanisms.

The mechanisms underlying these differences in HBV pathogenesis remain unclear. In HepG2 cells transfected with a mutant HBVG2335A expression plasmid that does not transcribe the 2.2-kb doubly spliced RNA (2.2DS-RNA) expressed by wild-type HBV genotype A, the level of HBV pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) was higher than that in cells transfected with an HBV genotype A expression plasmid. By using cotransfection with HBV genotype D and 2.2DS-RNA expression plasmids, we found that a reduction of pgRNA was observed in the cells even in the presence of small amounts of the 2.2DSRNA plasmid. Moreover, ectopic expression of 2.2DS-RNA in the HBV-producing cell line 1.3ES2 reduced the expression of pgRNA. Further analysis showed that exogenously transcribed 2.2DS-RNA inhibited a reconstituted transcription in vitro. In Huh7 cells ectopically expressing 2.2DS-RNA, RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that 2.2DS-RNA interacted with the TATAbinding protein (TBP) and that nucleotides 432 to 832 of 2.2DS-RNA were required for efficient TBP binding. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that 2.2DS-RNA colocalized with cytoplasmic TBP and the stress granule components, G3BP and poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1), in Huh7 cells. In conclusion, our study reveals that 2.2DS-RNA acts as a repressor of HBV transcription through an interaction with TBP that induces stress granule formation. The expression of 2.2DS-RNA may be one of the viral factors involved in viral replication, which may underlie differences in clinical outcomes of liver disease and responses to interferon alpha therapy between patients infected with different HBV genotypes. ? 2015, American Society for Microbiology.",,"alpha interferon; membrane protein; protein G3BP; protein PABP1; TATA binding protein; unclassified drug; carrier protein; double stranded RNA; G3BP protein, human; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; polyadenylic acid binding protein; RNA binding protein; RNA precursor; TATA binding protein; virus RNA; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell granule; controlled study; embryo; gene expression; gene interaction; gene location; genetic transcription; genetic transfection; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype D; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; immunoprecipitation; mouse; nonhuman; plasmid; priority journal; protein assembly; protein binding; protein function; protein interaction; protein localization; RNA splicing; virus cell interaction; virus transcription; 3T3 cell line; animal; binding site; biosynthesis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; chronic hepatitis B; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; Hepatitis B virus; Liver Neoplasms; metabolism; RNA splicing; tumor cell line; virology; virus replication; 3T3 Cells; Animals; Binding Sites; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; HEK293 Cells; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Plasmids; Poly(A)-Binding Protein I; RNA Precursors; RNA Splicing; RNA, Double-Stranded; RNA, Viral; RNA-Binding Proteins; TATA-Box Binding Protein; Transcription, Genetic; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-84945955156

In Asian traditional medicine, Bai-Hu-Jia-Ren-Shen-Tang (BHJRST) is widely used in diabetes patients to reduce thirst. However, whether it has a therapeutic effect on T2DM or NAFLD is not known. The aim of this study was to examine whether BHJRST had a lipid-lowering effect using a HuS-E/2 cell model of fatty liver induced by palmitate and in a db/db mouse model of dyslipidemia. Incubation of HuS-E/2 cells with palmitate markedly increased lipid accumulation and expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which is involved in lipolysis. BHJRST significantly decreased lipid accumulation and increased ATGL levels and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its primary downstream target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which are involved in fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, after twice daily oral administration for six weeks, BHJRST significantly reduced hepatic fat accumulation in db/db mice, as demonstrated by increased hepatic AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, reduced serum triglyceride levels, and reduced hepatic total lipid content. The results show that BHJRST has a lipid-lowering effect in the liver that is mediated by activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. ??? 2015 Hui-Kang Liu et al.",,acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang decoction; Chinese drug; cholesterol; ginsenoside Rg 3; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; palmitic acid; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; tubulin; unclassified drug; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; dyslipidemia; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; fatty acid oxidation; fatty liver; ginseng; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; rice; signal transduction; triacylglycerol blood level; Western blotting,2-s2.0-84945546486

During clinical radiation therapy, the radiation dose could range from 15 to 60 Gy depending on targets. While 2 Gy radiation has been shown to cause cancer cell death, studies also suggest a protective potential by low dose radiation. In this study, we examined the effect of 0.2-2 Gy radiation on hippocampal neurons. Low dose 0.2 Gy radiation treatment increased the levels of MTT. Since hippocampal neurons are post-mitotic, this result reveals a possibility that 0.2 Gy irradiation may increase mitochondrial activity to cope with stimuli. Maintaining neural plasticity is an energy-demanding process that requires high efficient mitochondrial function. We thus hypothesized that low dose radiation may regulate mitochondrial dynamics and function to ensure survival of neurons. Our results showed that five days after 0.2 Gy irradiation, no obvious changes on neuronal survival, neuronal synapses, membrane potential of mitochondria, reactive oxygen species levels, and mitochondrial DNA copy numbers. Interestingly, 0.2 Gy irradiation promoted the mitochondria fusion, resulting in part from the increased level of a mitochondrial fusion protein, Mfn2, and inhibition of Drp1 fission protein trafficking to the mitochondria. Accompanying with the increased mitochondrial fusion, the expressions of complexes I and III of the electron transport chain were also increased. These findings suggest that, hippocampal neurons undergo increased mitochondrial fusion to modulate cellular activity as an adaptive mechanism in response to low dose radiation.",Hippocampal neurons; Low dose radiation; Mitochondrial fusion; Pathology Section; Radiation therapy,"mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial protein; mitofusin 2; protein Drp1; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; unclassified drug; Drp1 protein, rat; dynamin; membrane protein; mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial protein; mitofusin 2 protein, rat; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; animal cell; Article; brain nerve cell; cell fusion; cell survival; controlled study; electron transport; gene dosage; hippocampus; ionizing radiation; low energy radiation; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial fusion; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitosis; nonhuman; protein expression; radiation dose; rat; synapse; animal; biosynthesis; cell culture; cell plasticity; genetics; hippocampus; metabolism; mitochondrion; nerve cell; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; protein transport; radiation response; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Cell Plasticity; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; DNA, Mitochondrial; Dynamins; Electron Transport Complex I; Electron Transport Complex III; Gene Dosage; Hippocampus; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Membrane Proteins; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Mitochondrial Proteins; Neurons; Oxidation-Reduction; Protein Transport; Radiation, Ionizing; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reactive Oxygen Species",2-s2.0-84945532944

Both prosurvival and proapoptotic roles have been proposed for HSP60, and HSP60 is reportedly involved in the initiation of autoimmune, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases. The role of HSP60 in pathogenesis of these diseases remains unclear, partly because of the lack of mouse models expressing HSP60. In this study we generated HSP60 conditional transgenic mice suitable for investigating in vivo outcomes by expressing HSP60 at the targeted organ in disease models. Ubiquitous HSP60 induction in the embryonic stage caused neonatal death in mice at postnatal day 1. A high incidence of atrial septal defects was observed in HSP60-expressing mice, with increased apoptosis and myocyte degeneration that possibly contributed to massive hemorrhage and sponge-like cardiac muscles. Our results showed that neonatal heart failure through HSP60 induction likely involves developmental defects and excessive apoptosis.

However, conventional methods for screening of these reagents often have drawbacks such as large reagent consumption, the labor-intensive or time-consuming procedures, and the involvement of bulky or expensive equipment. Alternatively, microfluidic platforms could potentially automate the screening process within a shorter period of time and reduce reagent and sample consumption dramatically. It has been demonstrated recently that a subpopulation of tumor cells known as cancer stem cells possess high drug resistance and proliferation potential and are regarded as the main cause of metastasis. Therefore, a peptide that recognizes cancer stem cells and differentiates them from other cancer cells will be extremely useful in early diagnosis and target therapy. This study utilized M13 phage display technology to identify peptides that bind, respectively, to colon cancer cells and colon cancer stem cells using an integrated microfluidic system. In addition to positive selection, a negative selection process was integrated on the chip to achieve the selection of peptides of high affinity and specificity. We successfully screened three peptides specific to colon cancer cells and colon cancer stem cells, namely, HOLC-1, HOLC-2, and COLC-1, respectively, and their specificity was measured by the capture rate between target, control, and other cell lines. The capture rates are 43.40 ± 7.23%, 45.16 ± 7.12%, and 49.79 ± 5.34% for colon cancer cells and colon cancer stem cells, respectively, showing a higher specificity on target cells than on control and other cell lines.

Results: Relative to baseline values, EA significantly reduced plasma levels of glucose at 30 and 60 min. The microarray pathway analysis showed that cell adhesion molecules and type 1 DM gene sets were both upregulated in EA versus non-EA groups (p<0.05).

Thus, therapeutic applications of antagonists of these TLRs for such disorders are being investigated. Bortezomib (Velcade) is a proteasome inhibitor known to suppress activation of these TLRs. To identify novel TLR7-9 inhibitors, we searched the Gene Expression Omnibus database for gene expression profiles of bortezomib-treated cells. These profiles were then used to screen the Connectivity Map database for chemical compounds with similar functions as bortezomib. A natural antibiotic, thiostrepton, was identified for study. Similar to bortezomib, thiostrepton effectively inhibits TLR7-9 activation in cell-based assays and in dendritic cells. In contrast to bortezomib, thiostrepton does not inhibit NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α, IL-1, and other TLRs, and it is less cytotoxic to dendritic cells. Thiostrepton inhibits TLR9 localization in endosomes for activation via two mechanisms, which distinguish it from currently used TLR7-9 inhibitors. One mechanism is similar to the proteasome inhibitory function of bortezomib, whereas the other is through inhibition of endosomal acidification. Accordingly, in different animal models, thiostrepton attenuated LL37- and imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like inflammation. These results indicated that thiostrepton is a novel TLR7-9 inhibitor, and compared with bortezomib, its inhibitory effect is more specific to these TLRs, suggesting the potential therapeutic applications of thiostrepton on immunologic disorders elicited by inappropriate activation of TLR7-9.

In this work, three-dimensional (3D) aggregates of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cord-blood mesenchymal stem cells (cbMSCs) are constructed using a methylcellulose hydrogel system. By maximizing cell-cell and cell-ECM communications and establishing a hypoxic microenvironment in their inner cores, these cell aggregates are capable of forming widespread tubular networks together with the angiogenic marker αvβ3 integrin; they secret multiple pro-angiogenic, pro-survival, and mobilizing factors when grown on Matrigel. The aggregates of HUVECs/cbMSCs are exogenously engrafted into the peri-infarct zones of rats with MI via direct local injection. Multimodality noninvasive imaging techniques, including positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, and echocardiography, are employed to monitor serially the beneficial effects of cell therapy on angiogenesis, blood perfusion, and global/regional ventricular function, respectively. The myocardial perfusion is correlated with ventricular contractility, demonstrating that the recovery of blood perfusion helps to restore regional cardiac function, leading to the improvement in global ventricular performance.

We hypothesized that therapeutic targeting of this pathway can be used to kill intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells. High levels of SPHK1 protein expression, which was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of samples from 96 patients with intrahepatic CCA, correlated with poor overall survival.

Furthermore, SK1-I combined with JTE013, an antagonist of the predominant S1P receptor S1PR2, inhibited the AKT and ERK signaling pathways in CCA cells.

In addition to DSBs induced by ionizing radiation, misrepair of non-DSB clustered damage contributes extra DSBs converted from DNA misrepair via pathways for base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair. This study aimed to quantify the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) when DSB induction and conversion from non-DSB clustered damage misrepair were used as biological endpoints. The results showed that both linear energy transfer (LET) and indirect action had a strong impact on the yields for DSB induction and conversion. RBE values for DSB induction and maximum DSB conversion of helium ions (LET = 120 keV/μm) to 60Co gamma rays were 3.0 and 3.2, respectively. These RBE values increased to 5.8 and 5.6 in the absence of interference of indirect action initiated by addition of 2-M dimethylsulfoxide. DSB conversion was ?1-4% of the total non-DSB damage due to gamma rays, which was lower than the 10% estimate by experimental measurement. Five to twenty percent of total non-DSB damage due to helium ions was converted into DSBs. Hence, it may be possible to increase the yields of DSBs in cancerous cells through DNA repair pathways, ultimately enhancing cell killing. ?

In this study, a promising modality for active hypoxia drug delivery was developed by adopting tumortropic monocytes/macrophages as a cellular vehicle for co-delivery of echogenic polymer/C<inf>5</inf>F<inf>12</inf> bubbles and doxorubicin-loaded polymer vesicles. Through the remote-controlled focused ultrasound (FUS)-triggered drug liberation, therapeutic monocytes show prominent capability of inducing apoptosis of cancer cells. The in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging shows appreciable accumulation of cell-mediated therapeutics in tumor as compared to the nanoparticle counterpart residing mostly in liver. Inhibition of tumor recurrence with γ-ray pre-irradiated Tramp-C1-bearing mice receiving therapeutic monocytes intravenously alongside the FUS activation at tumor site was significantly observed. Immunohistochemical examination of tumor sections confirms successful cellular transport of therapeutic payloads to hypoxic regions and pronounced cytotoxic action against hypoxic cells. Following the intravenous administration, the cellular-mediated therapeutics can penetrate easily to a depth beyond 150 μm from the nearest blood vessels within pre-irradiated tumor while nanoparticles are severely limited to a depth of ca 10-15 μm. This work demonstrates the great promise of cellular delivery to carry therapeutic payloads for improving chemotherapy in hypoxia by combining external trigger for drug release. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Cell-mediated drug delivery; Co-delivery; Tumor hypoxia; Tumortropic monocytes/macrophages,"Amphibious vehicles; Blood vessels; Body fluids; Cell death; Cells; Chemotherapy; Cytology; Gamma rays; Medical nanotechnology; Nanoparticles; Polymers; Remote control; Tumors; Cellular delivery; Cellular transport; Co deliveries; Focused ultrasound; Intravenous administration; Monocytes/macrophages; Tumor hypoxia; Tumor recurrences; Functional polymers; doxorubicin; echogenic polymer bubble; nanoparticle; polymer; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; polymer; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer chemotherapy; cell hypoxia; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug penetration; drug release; ex vivo study; fluorescence imaging; gamma radiation; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; intracellular transport; macrophage; male; monocyte; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; tumor recurrence; ultrasound; animal; C57BL mouse; cell hypoxia; chemistry; drug effects; human; metabolism; monocyte; neoplasm; pathology; tissue distribution; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Hypoxia; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Monocytes; Neoplasms; Polymers; Tissue Distribution",2-s2.0-84941553043

These sessile communities constitute a protected mode of growth that promotes survival in a hostile environment. This study describes a novel and unrecognized role for a synthetic cationic antimicrobial peptide, Nal-P-113, which inhibits and kills periodontal bacteria in planktonic state, inhibits the formation of biofilms and eradicates polymicrobial biofilms. Nal-P-113 is also stable in saliva, serum and saline solution. At a concentration less than 320 μg/mL which is harmless to normal oral cells, Nal-P-113 can kill bacteria in planktonic state. At a concentration of antimicrobial peptide Nal-P-113 (1280 μg/mL) which only causes slight damages to normal oral cells is needed to kill bacteria in biofilm state. It is worth mentioning that this concentration of Nal-P-113 is harmless to rat oral mucosa compared to chlorhexidine. The mechanism of Nal-P-113 inhibiting and killing periodontal bacteria might rely on the abilities to permeabilize and/or to form pores within the cytoplasmic membranes, thus causes the death of bacteria. Here, we provided a novel and stable antimicrobial peptide with very low mammalian cytotoxicity, which can inhibit and kill periodontal bacteria in both planktonic and polymicrobial biofilm states. Statement of Significance Nal-P-113 is a potent antimicrobial peptide with strong antimicrobial ability, improved deficiency compared with other antibacterial peptides, and remains stable in phosphate buffered saline, saliva, brain-heart infusion medium and bovine calf serum. Nal-P-113 exhibits a broad spectrum of bacteriocidal activity with excellent eradicating capability on oral pathogens and the respective biofilms. In this study, we used propidium iodide staining, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to confirm that Nal-P-113 can perforate plasmalemma thereby resulting in the death of oral pathogens and disintegrate the respective biofilms. Nal-P-113 also showed effective anti-plaque biofilms and cytotoxicity in the rat periodontitis model. No adverse effects can be observed on the gingivomucosa tissue. In short, the antimicrobial peptide Nal-P-113 presented to be an effective yet have low mammalian cytotoxicity agent with potential application in the clinic.

In this study, we used a systems biology approach to construct protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) for early-stage and late-stage liver cancer. By comparing the networks of these two stages, we found that the two networks showed some common mechanisms and some significantly different mechanisms. To obtain differential network structures between cancer and noncancer PPINs, we constructed cancer PPIN and noncancer PPIN network structures for the two stages of liver cancer by systems biology method using NGS data from cancer cells and adjacent noncancer cells. Using carcinogenesis relevance values (CRVs), we identified 43 and 80 significant proteins and their PPINs (network markers) for early-stage and late-stage liver cancer. To investigate the evolution of network biomarkers in the carcinogenesis process, a primary pathway analysis showed that common pathways of the early and late stages were those related to ordinary cancer mechanisms. A pathway specific to the early stage was the mismatch repair pathway, while pathways specific to the late stage were the spliceosome pathway, lysine degradation pathway, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway.

We have previously reported a mutant protein of CXCL8/Interleukin-8, CXCL8(3-72)K11R/G31P (G31P), which can act as a selective antagonist towards CXCR1/2 with therapeutic efficacy in both inflammatory diseases and malignancies. In this study, we investigated the effect of this ELR-CXC chemokine antagonist G31P on human non-small cell lung cancer cells and lung tumor progression in an orthotopic xenograft model. We report increased mRNA levels of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in human lung cancer tissues compared to normal counterparts. Expression levels of CXCR1/2 cognate ligands was determined by ELISA. CXCR1/2 receptor antagonism via G31P leads to decreased H460 and A549 cell proliferation and migration in a dosedependent manner. G31P also enhanced apoptosis in lung cancer cells as determined by elevated levels of cleaved PARP, Caspase-8, and Bax, together with a reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In an in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse model of human lung cancer, G31P treatment suppressed tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. At the molecular level, G31P treatment was correlated with decreased expression of VEGF and NFκB-p65, in addition to reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT.

Previous studies have revealed that the endogenous tryptophan metabolite 5-methoxytryptophan (5-MTP) can downregulate cyclooxygenase-2 expression; suppress tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion; and reduce the tumor size. To improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of 5-MTP in the tumorigenesis of oral cancer, we conducted a comparative wound healing and transwell invasion assays. Our results revealed that 5-MTP reduce oral cancer cell migration and invasion ability. In addition, the results of an in vivo assay demonstrated that the growth of primary tumors was significantly inhibited by 5-MTP in OC3 oral cancer cells and in invasive OC3-I5 oral cancer cells. Moreover, enlarged spleens were observed in OC3-I5-implanted severe combined immunodeficiency mice although 5-MTP can inhibit spleen enlargement. Through comparative proteomics, we identified 32 differentially regulated protein spots by using 2D-DIGE/MALDI-TOF MS analyses. Some of the differentially regulated proteins such as amadillo-repeat-containing X-linked protein 1, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, tropomyosin alpha-1, and tropomyosin alpha-4 may be associated with the 5-MTP-dependent inhibition of oral cancer growth and metastasis.

Our analysis showed the width and thickness of the boards had significant effects on walking speed. There is a significant interaction between construction experience and board width on stride width, whereas the interaction between construction experience and acclimation phase affects step length and walking speed. The body sway at the C6/C7 and L5/S1 locations are significantly affected by most of the factors. We also found that once the participants acclimated to the board condition, the sway variability increased. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.",balance control; construction safety; farmer construction worker,"Ergonomics; Physical therapy; Balance control; Construction safety; Construction workers; Construction works; Scaffold boards; Step length; Walking speed; Walking strategy; Scaffolds; adaptation; adult; body equilibrium; building industry; gait; human; male; middle aged; occupational health; physiology; professional competence; surface property; walking; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Construction Industry; Gait; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Health; Postural Balance; Professional Competence; Surface Properties; Walking",2-s2.0-84940439091

We have shown intratumoral hypoxia induced by sorafenib activated C-X-C receptor type 4 (CXCR4)/stromal-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) axis, resulting in polarization toward a tumor-promoting microenvironment and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in HCC. Herein, we formulated sorafenib in CXCR4-targeted lipid-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) modified with a CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 to systemically deliver sorafenib into HCC and sensitize HCC to sorafenib treatment. We demonstrated that CXCR4-targeted NPs efficiently delivered sorafenib into HCCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to achieve cytotoxicity and anti-angiogenic effect in vitro and in vivo. Despite the increased expression of SDF1α upon the persistent hypoxia induced by sorafenib-loaded CXCR4-targeted NPs, AMD3100 attached to the NPs can block CXCR4/SDF1α, leading to the reduced infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages, enhanced anti-angiogenic effect, a delay in tumor progression and increased overall survival in the orthotopic HCC model compared with other control groups.

However, the utility of UDT-Seq in detecting copy number alterations (CNAs) remains unclear. With the goal of improving molecular prognostication and identifying new therapeutic targets, we designed this study to assess whether UDT-Seq may be useful for detecting CNA in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Methods: We sequenced a panel of clinically actionable cancer mutations in 310 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded OSCC specimens. A linear model was developed to overcome uneven coverage across target regions and multiple samples. The 5-year rates of secondary primary tumors, local recurrence, neck recurrence, distant metastases, and survival served as the outcome measures. We confirmed the prognostic significance of the CNA signatures in an independent sample of 105 primary OSCC specimens. Results: The CNA burden across 10 targeted genes was found to predict prognosis in two independent cohorts. FGFR1 and PIK3CA amplifications were associated with prognosis independent of clinical risk factors. Genes exhibiting CNA were clustered in the proteoglycan metabolism, the FOXO signaling, and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, for which targeted drugs are already available or currently under development.

This enzyme complex spans the inner mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the first step of electron transfer by the oxidation of NADH, and thereby provides two electrons for the reduction of quinone to quinol. Complex I deficiency is associated with many severe mitochondrial diseases, including Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and Leigh syndrome. However, to date, conventional treatments for the majority of genetic mitochondrial diseases are only palliative. Developing a reliable and convenient therapeutic approach is therefore considered to be an urgent need. Targeted proteins fused with the protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus 1 transactivator of transcription (TAT) have been shown to enter cells by crossing plasma membranes while retaining their biological activities. Recent developments show that, in fusion with mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTSs), TAT–MTS–bound cargo can be correctly transported into mitochondria and restore the missing function of the cargo protein in patients’ cells. The available evidence suggests that the TAT-mediated protein transduction system holds great promise as a potential therapeutic approach to treat complex I deficiency, as well as other mitochondrial diseases. ? 2015 New York Academy of Sciences.",complex I; enzyme replacement therapy; mitochondria; oxidative phosphorylation; protein transduction domain; transactivator of transcription peptide,mitochondrial DNA; protein; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); transactivator protein; Article; cell membrane; complex I deficiency; disorders of mitochondrial functions; gene mutation; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; membrane binding; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; protein binding; protein domain; protein transport; signal transduction; TAT mediated protein transduction system,2-s2.0-84939221350

MUTYH glycosylase involved in DNA repair pathways may be associated with the risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, the association between polymorphisms in the MUTYH gene and RA was evaluated. Methods. We recruited 192 RA patients and 192 healthy subjects in Taiwan. The 4 MUTYH polymorphisms (rs3219463, rs3219476, rs3219489, and rs3219493) were detected and haplotype analysis was performed using the Bayesian method. The genotype and allelic frequency distributions of the polymorphisms in both RA patients and healthy patients were compared by the chi-square test. Results. Comparison of the genotype/allele frequencies between individuals with RA and the control groups revealed significant differences in 2 MUTYH gene polymorphisms, rs3219463 and rs3219476. After we performed a haplotype-specific analysis, the haplotypes Ht6-GTGC and Ht8-GGCG had lower presenting rates in RA patients than in the control groups. Furthermore, the genotype frequency of rs3219463 G/ was significantly increased among patients with immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factors, whereas that of rs3219476 was not. Conclusion. We demonstrated that the rs3219463 and rs3219476 polymorphisms in RA patients from a Taiwan Chinese population were associated with disease susceptibility.

The interaction variations in the host, pathogen, and host-pathogen regions are evaluated by comparing the two constructed networks. Those proteins of larger interaction variations stand for more pivotal roles in the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. Moreover, in the host-pathogen region, four significantly enriched functional modules are identified. Meanwhile, the interaction variations of these four functional groups imply the corresponding strategy shifts of the host and pathogen from innate to adaptive immunity.

For each treatment condition, the subject was exposed to the specified noise condition in a sound proof cabin for one hour. The physiological measures included blood pressure and heart rate. The subjective measures included noise sensitivity, fatigue and annoyance. RESULTS: The ANOVA results indicate that long-time noise exposure caused significant increase in blood pressure (p< 0.001). Furthermore, the noise intensity by time interaction effect was found to be significant on annoyance and fatigue.

Our results showed that the AA genotype was observed more frequently in SLE patients than in normal control subjects (22.1% vs 9.5%, P < 0.05). The A allele was strongly associated with the occurrence of hair loss, photosensitivity and anti-cardiolipin antibodies; whereas, the G allele was associated with lower frequencies of these clinical presentations. Relative expression levels were significantly lower in patients with the AA genotype [median: 18.86, interquartile range (IQR) 11.36-22.43, P = 0.002] than in those with the GG genotype (35.76, IQR: 19.33-49.71). As expected, we confirmed the A allele as a risk factor for SLE development in a Chinese population, in contrast, the G allele might be a protective factor against the pathogenic autoantibody formation and cutaneous manifestations in SLE patients. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Anti-cardiolipin antibody; Complement component 2; Photosensitivity; Single-nucleotide polymorphism; Systemic lupus erythematosus,"cardiolipin antibody; complement component C2; complement component C3; complement component C4; messenger RNA; cardiolipin antibody; complement component C2; adult; Article; blood cell count; Chinese; comparative study; controlled study; disease duration; female; gene expression; genetic association; genetic susceptibility; genotype; hair loss; human; intron; major clinical study; male; photosensitivity; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; systemic lupus erythematosus; allele; alopecia; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; case control study; ethnology; exon; gene expression profiling; gene frequency; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; immunology; middle aged; pathology; photophobia; systemic lupus erythematosus; Adult; Alleles; Alopecia; Antibodies, Anticardiolipin; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Case-Control Studies; Complement C2; Exons; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Frequency; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Introns; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Middle Aged; Photophobia; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-84937212410

The ongoing scientific progress for understanding the genetic etiology of ASD makes it increasingly important to examine how parents of children with ASD perceive the causes and recurrence risk of having another child with ASD. These perceptions may influence their family planning, attitudes toward genetic services, and willingness to take their children for ASD genetic testing. However, previous studies addressing this issue were conducted primarily in Western countries. As culture might shape an individual's views of genetic/genomic disorders, this first-of-its-kind study examined the perceptions of the genetic etiology for ASD and the recurrence risk among Taiwanese parents of children affected with ASD. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted among 39 parents having at least one child with ASD. Although the majority of participants believed that ASD has a genetic link, less than half perceived genetic factors as the cause of their own child's ASD. Moreover, most participants articulated their recurrence risk incorrectly. Some parents were concerned about their doctors' limited genomic competencies. To provide parents with better education, counseling, and support for making reproductive decisions, ASD-related genomic education among Taiwanese physicians is needed. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Autism; Etiology; Genetics; Risk perceptions; Taiwan,"adult; Article; autism; clinical article; clinical genetics; diseases; family planning; female; genetic association; genetic screening; genetic service; heredity; human; male; priority journal; recurrence risk; semi structured interview; Taiwanese; Asian continental ancestry group; attitude to health; autism; genetic predisposition; genetics; middle aged; parent; psychology; questionnaire; recurrent disease; risk; Taiwan; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parents; Recurrence; Risk; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84935143817

For this purpose, a conceptually new approach, termed active feedback magnetic resonance, was developed. Methods In the presence of the Zeeman field, a dipolar field is induced by the superparamagnetic nanoparticles or aggregates. Such dipolar field creates spatial and temporal (due to water diffusion) variations to the precession frequency of the nearby water 1H magnetization. Sensitive imaging of magnetic nanoparticles or aggregates can be achieved by manipulating the intrinsic spin dynamics by selective self-excitation and fixed-point dynamics under active feedback fields. Results Phantom experiments of superparamagnetic nanoparticles; in vitro experiments of brain tissue with blood clots; and in vivo mouse images of colon cancers, with and without labeling by magnetic nanoparticles, suggest that this new approach provides enhanced, robust, and positive contrast in imaging magnetic nanoparticles or aggregates for cancer detection.

Through the estimation of the transformation models and covariate distribution, we propose a few analytical procedures to estimate the causal survival function. As the data are observational, the unobserved potential outcome (survival time) may be associated with the treatment assignment, and therefore there may exist a systematic imbalance between the data observed from each treatment arm. Further, due to prevalent sampling, subjects are observed only if they have not experienced the failure event when data collection began, causing the prevalent sampling bias. We propose a unified approach, which simultaneously corrects the bias from the prevalent sampling and balances the systematic differences from the observational data. We illustrate in the simulation study that standard analysis without proper adjustment would result in biased causal inference. Large sample properties of the proposed estimation procedures are established by techniques of empirical processes and examined by simulation studies. The proposed methods are applied to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Medicare-linked data for women diagnosed with breast cancer. ? 2014, The International Biometric Society.",Causal estimation; Dependent truncation; Prevalent sampling; Survival analysis,"cancer; covariance analysis; sapling; survival; transformation; aged; biometry; Breast Neoplasms; causality; computer simulation; female; human; mortality; selection bias; statistical model; survival analysis; Aged; Biometry; Breast Neoplasms; Causality; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Models, Statistical; Selection Bias; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-84931386821

For achieving this, AlGaN/GaN HEMT has been used as an Immuno- FET, in which one of the common lung cancer biomarkers, CEA has been used as the target protein to bind with its antibody. This antibody-antigen binding results in excess surface charges that can be measured by the HEMT by applying a short duration pulse at the gate. The capacitive type of current obtained from HEMT, can provide us useful information and can depict dynamic mode of measurement. This method of measurement, combined with the high sensitivity of AlGaN/GaN HEMT can overcome the drawbacks of screening effect that occurs in solution with a high concentration of salt for traditional FET-based biosensors, and offer better limit of detection, sensitivity, repeatability and convenience. ?

Not only can the proposed system work in a solution with a physiological salt concentration but it also detects CRP with ultra-high sensitivity in an automatic fashion. This is the first time that a FET-based biosensor can effectively and automatically detect CRP in a physiological salt concentration without decreasing the sensitivity.

Three widely used radionuclides, 99m Tc, 18 F, and 131 I, were considered in these source models with uniform or organ-dependent distributions. Conducting Monte Carlo simulations with anthropomorphic phantoms is a realistic but time-consuming approach. The point source model is simple but too conservative, overestimating dose rates by approximately a factor of 2 at a distance of 30 cm and by 30-40% at 1 m. Both the line and cylinder source models provided improved estimates, reducing the overestimation of dose rates to 10-20% at distances of interest. The line source model was comparable to the cylinder source model because of the offset of two competing effects (i.e., attenuation and buildup) caused by the source volume. The influence of various photon energies and cylinder sizes on the result of compensating errors was examined to evaluate the effective range of the line source model. The line source model, which is relatively easy to implement and predicts slightly conservative dose rates, is considered the most practical method for calculating dose rates near radioactive patients. An application of the line source model to 51 post-thyroidectomy patients in Taiwan was demonstrated. The consistency between calculations and measurements was satisfactory after considering the room-scattering effect. ? 2015 Health Physics Society.",131 I; Monte Carlo; nuclear medicine; radiopharmaceuticals,"radioactive iodine; anthropometry; comparative study; human; image quality; Monte Carlo method; radiation dose; radiation monitoring; radiation protection; Taiwan; Thyroid Neoplasms; Anthropometry; Humans; Iodine Radioisotopes; Monte Carlo Method; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Monitoring; Radiation Protection; Taiwan; Thyroid Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84930461166

Here, we report that human ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA) plays a role in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A significant increase in RPIA expression was detected both in tumor biopsies of HCC patients and in a liver cancer tissue array. Importantly, the clinicopathological analysis indicated that RPIA mRNA levels were highly correlated with clinical stage, grade, tumor size, types, invasion and alpha-fetoprotein levels in the HCC patients. In addition, we demonstrated that the ability of RPIA to regulate cell proliferation and colony formation in different liver cancer cell lines required ERK signaling as well as the negative modulation of PP2A activity and that the effects of RPIA could be modulated by the addition of either a PP2A inhibitor or activator. Furthermore, the xenograft studies in nude mice revealed that the modulation of RPIA in liver cancer cells regulated tumor growth and that NIH3T3 cells overexpressing RPIA exhibited increased proliferation, enhanced colony formation, elevated levels of p-ERK1/2 and accelerated tumor growth. This study provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which RPIA overexpression can induce oncogenesis in HCC.

Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short-chain peptides developed as functionalized vectors for delivery approaches of impermeable agents. On cell surface negatively charged HS provides the initial attachment of basic CPPs by electrostatic interaction, leading to multiple cellular effects. Here a functional peptide (CPPecp) has been identified from critical HS binding region in hRNase3, a unique RNase family member with in vitro antitumor activity. In this study we analyze a set of HS-binding CPPs derived from natural proteins including CPPecp. In addition to cellular binding and internalization, CPPecp demonstrated multiple functions including strong binding activity to tumor cell surface with higher HS expression, significant inhibitory effects on cancer cell migration, and suppression of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, different from conventional highly basic CPPs, CPPecp facilitated magnetic nanoparticle to selectively target tumor site in vivo. Therefore, CPPecp could engage its capacity to be developed as biomaterials for diagnostic imaging agent, therapeutic supplement, or functionalized vector for drug delivery. ? 2015 Chien-Jung Chen et al.",,"cell penetrating peptide; heparan sulfate; magnetic nanoparticle; ribonuclease; cell penetrating peptide; eosinophil cationic protein; heparan sulfate; RNASE3 protein, human; angiogenesis; animal cell; Article; binding affinity; cell migration; controlled study; internalization; migration inhibition; neoplasm; nonhuman; protein expression; animal; cell membrane; cell motion; chemistry; drug effects; drug screening; human; metabolism; mouse; Neoplasms; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Membrane; Cell Movement; Cell-Penetrating Peptides; Eosinophil Cationic Protein; Heparitin Sulfate; Humans; Mice; Neoplasms; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84929631281

This work presents a chitosan (CS) derivative that contains self-doped polyaniline (PANI) side chains, capable of self-assembling to form micelles and then transforming into hydrogels driven by a local change in pH. Analysis results of small-angle X-ray scattering indicate that the sol-gel transition of this CS derivative may provide the mechanical integrity to maintain its spatial stability in the microenvironment of solid tumors. The micelles formed in the CS hydrogel function as nanoscaled heating sources upon exposure to near-infrared light, thereby enabling the selective killing of cancer cells in a light-treated area. Additionally, photothermal efficacy of the micellar hydrogel is evaluated using a tumor-bearing mouse model; hollow gold nanospheres (HGNs) are used for comparison. Given the ability of the micellar hydrogel to provide spatial stability within a solid tumor, which prevents its leakage from the injection site, the therapeutic efficacy of this hydrogel, as a photothermal therapeutic agent for repeated treatments, exceeds that of nanosized HGNs. Results of this study demonstrate that this in situ-formed micellar hydrogel is a highly promising modality for repeated cancer treatments, providing a clinically viable, minimally invasive phototherapeutic option for therapeutic treatment. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Cancer therapy; Multiple treatment sessions; PH-responsive micellar hydrogel; Photothermal agent; Self-doped conducting polymer,"Conducting polymers; Diseases; Doping (additives); Infrared devices; Mammals; Micelles; Polyaniline; Sol-gels; Tumors; X ray scattering; Cancer therapy; Multiple treatment sessions; PH-responsive; Photo-thermal; Self-doped; Hydrogels; chitosan; gold nanoparticle; nanosphere; polyaniline; self assembled monolayer; hydrogel; metal nanoparticle; micelle; phenylenediamine derivative; polymer; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer radiotherapy; comparative study; controlled study; heating; hydrogel; laser; light exposure; micelle; microenvironment; molecular stability; mouse; near infrared laser; nonhuman; pH; phototherapy; priority journal; repeat procedure; solid tumor; tumor ablation; X ray crystallography; analogs and derivatives; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cancer transplantation; chemistry; human; hydrogel; infrared radiation; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; light; Neoplasms; nude mouse; phase transition; phototherapy; procedures; radiation scattering; tumor cell line; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; viscosity; Mus; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Chitosan; Humans; Hydrogels; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Infrared Rays; Light; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred ICR; Mice, Nude; Micelles; Nanospheres; Neoplasm Transplantation; Neoplasms; Phase Transition; Phenylenediamines; Phototherapy; Polymers; Scattering, Radiation; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Viscosity",2-s2.0-84928410130

In this study, we investigated the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of 5-demethylnobiletin on inhibition of cell growth, apoptosis, cell cycle and autophagy in A549 and CL1-5 lung cancer cells. The results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay suggested that 5-demethylnobiletin inhibited cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry results suggested that 5-demethylnobiletin inhibited proliferation in lung cancer cells by inducing G2/M cell cycle phase arrest but predominantly not through apoptosis. Western blot results illustrated that the blockade of the cell cycle was associated with reduced levels of cdc25 and cdc2. Notably, our results indicated that 5-demethylnobiletin induced significant abnormal microtubule dynamics in A549 and CL1-5 cells, a novel finding. Studies conducted with isolated tubulin and docking models suggest that 5-demethylnobiletin promoted the polymerization of microtubules and bound to the taxol site. Additionally, 5-demethylnobiletin might also induce autophagy via activation of the JNK signaling pathway in A549 and CL1-5 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine significantly potentiated 5-demethylnobiletin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that 5-demethylnobiletin-induced autophagy mitigated cell apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that 5-demethylnobiletin inhibition of CL1-5 lung cancer cell growth was reproducible in a nude mouse model. Taken together, these studies suggest that 5-demethylnobiletin has anti-lung cancer efficacy both in vitro and in vivo possibly through induction of G2/M arrest, autophagy and apoptosis. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",5-Demethylnobiletin; Autophagy; G2/M arrest; JNK; Lung cancer; Tubulin,"5 nornobiletin; antineoplastic agent; caspase 3; cyclin dependent kinase 1; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; nobiletin; protein tyrosine phosphatase; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; 5-demethylnobiletin; flavone derivative; tubulin; A549 cell line; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cancer cell; cell viability; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; flow cytometry; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; immunofluorescence test; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung cancer; lung cancer cell line; microtubule assembly; mitochondrial membrane potential; molecular docking; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; protein expression; Western blotting; autophagy; biosynthesis; cell cycle G2 phase; cell division; chemistry; DNA damage; drug effects; isolation and purification; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; polymerization; tumor cell line; Citrus; Mus musculus; Autophagy; Cell Division; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Damage; Flavones; G2 Phase; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Polymerization; Tubulin",2-s2.0-84928276234

In the ICC microenvironment, although the circulating hormones/factors have been shown to influence ICC activities, the association between ICC and microvessels in the gut wall has not been described. We applied three-dimensional (3D) vascular histology with c-kit staining to identify the perivascular ICC and characterize their morphologic and population features in the human colon wall. Methods: Full-thickness colons were obtained from colectomies performed for colorectal cancer. We targeted the colon wall away from the tumor site. Confocal microscopy with optical clearing (use of immersion solution to reduce scattering in optical imaging) was performed to simultaneously reveal the ICC and vascular networks in space. 3D image rendering and projection were digitally conducted to illustrate the ICC-vessel contact patterns. Results: Perivascular ICC were identified in the submucosal border, myenteric plexus, and circular and longitudinal muscles via high-definition 3D microscopy. Through in-depth image projection, we specified two contact patterns-the intimate cell body-to-vessel contact (type I, 18% of ICC in circular muscle) and the long-distance process-to-vessel contact (type II, 16%)-to classify perivascular ICC. Particularly, type I perivascular ICC were detected with elevated c-kit staining levels and were routinely found in clusters, making them readily distinguishable from other ICC in the network. Conclusions: We propose a new subclass of ICC that closely associates with microvessels in the human colon. Our finding suggests a functional relationship between these mural ICC and microvessels based on the morphologic proximity. ? 2015 The Authors.",3D Histology; C-kit; ICC; Mural Cells,fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; stem cell factor; Article; cell density; colon; confocal microscopy; controlled study; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; interstitial cell of Cajal; myenteric plexus; priority journal,2-s2.0-84928194214

Its polysaccharide capsule is a key virulence factor that promotes bacterial evasion of human phagocytic killing. While S. pneumoniae produces at least 94 antigenically different types of capsule, the genes for biosynthesis of almost all capsular types are arranged in the same locus. The transcription of the capsular polysaccharide (cps) locus is not well understood. This study determined the transcriptional features of the cps locus in the type 2 virulent strain D39. The initial analysis revealed that the cps genes are cotranscribed from a major transcription start site at the -25 nucleotide (G) upstream of cps2A, the first gene in the locus. Using unmarked chromosomal truncations and a luciferasebased transcriptional reporter, we showed that the full transcription of the cps genes not only depends on the core promoter immediately upstream of cps2A, but also requires additional elements upstream of the core promoter, particularly a 59-bp sequence immediately upstream of the core promoter. Unmarked deletions of these promoter elements in the D39 genome also led to significant reduction in CPS production and virulence in mice. Lastly, common cps gene (cps2ABCD) mutants did not show significant abnormality in cps transcription, although they produced significantly less CPS, indicating that the CpsABCD proteins are involved in the encapsulation of S. pneumoniae in a posttranscriptional manner. This study has yielded important information on the transcriptional characteristics of the cps locus in S. pneumoniae. ? 2015, American Society for Microbiology.",,"capsular polysaccharide; nucleotide; polysaccharide; spacer DNA; unclassified drug; core protein, mouse; membrane protein; virulence factor; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterial capsule; biosynthesis; capsule gene operon; cell encapsulation; clinical assessment; clinical feature; controlled study; deletion mutant; gene cluster; gene deletion; gene insertion sequence; gene locus; genetic transcription; genetic variability; genome analysis; host cell; human; human cell; molecular biology; mouse; nonhuman; Northern blotting; operon; pathogenesis; pneumococcal infection; priority journal; promoter region; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Streptococcus pneumoniae; transcription initiation site; virulence; animal; bacterial capsule; disease model; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; pathology; regulatory sequence; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Animals; Bacterial Capsules; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Operon; Pneumococcal Infections; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Transcription, Genetic; Virulence; Virulence Factors",2-s2.0-84928176639

The ND formulation was based on lipid-stabilized low-boiling perfluorocarbon that can undergo acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) under ultrasound (US) exposure. Conjugation of folate enhanced the selective delivery to tumors expressing high levels of folate receptor (FR) under mediation by the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Invitro and invivo studies were performed using FR-positive KB and FR-negative HT-1080 cell lines and mouse xenograft tumor models. Simultaneous therapy and imaging were conducted with a clinical US imaging system at mechanical indices of up to 1.4at a center frequency of 10MHz. The results demonstrated that FA-CPT-NDs selectively attached to KB cells, but not HT-1080 cells. The targeted ADV caused instant and delayed damage via mechanical disruption and chemical toxicity to decrease the viability of KB cells by up to 45%, a much higher decrease than that achieved by the NDs without folate conjugation. The invivo experiments showed that FR-mediated targeting successfully enhanced the EPR of FA-CPT-NDs in KB tumors mainly on the tumor periphery as indicated by immunofluorescence microscopy and US B-mode imaging. Treatments with FA-CPT-NDs at a CPT dose of 50μg/kg inhibited the growth of KB tumors for up to six weeks, whereas treatment with NDs lacking folate produced a 4.6-fold increase in tumor volume. For HT-1080 tumors, neither the treatments with FA-CPT-NDs nor those with the NDs lacking folate presented tumor growth inhibition. In summary, FR-targeted tumor theranostics has been successfully implemented with FA-CPT-NDs and a clinical US unit. The ligand-directed and EPR-mediated accumulation provides active and passive targeting capabilities, permitting the antitumor effects of FA-CPT-NDs to be exerted selectively to FR-positive tumors and simultaneously providing targeted US imaging capabilities. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Acoustic nanodroplet vaporization; Camptothecin; EPR effect; Folate receptor targeting; Targeted tumor theranostics,"Biological materials; Body fluids; Cell culture; Cells; Cytology; Mammals; Vaporization; Camptothecin (CPT); EPR effect; Folate receptor; Nanodroplet; Theranostics; Tumors; camptothecin; fluorocarbon; folate receptor; folic acid; lipid; nanocarrier; nanodroplet; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; camptothecin; folic acid; nanomaterial; acoustic droplet vaporization; acoustic impedance; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; B scan; cancer inhibition; cell viability; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug conjugation; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug penetration; drug retention; drug stability; drug targeting; experimental neoplasm; feasibility study; fibrosarcoma cell line; ht 1080 cell line; human; human cell; immunofluorescence microscopy; in vivo study; KB cell line; molecularly targeted therapy; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nanopharmaceutics; nonhuman; priority journal; real time ultrasound scanner; tumor volume; tumor xenograft; ultrasound transducer; vaporization; animal; chemistry; drug screening; male; Neoplasms; nonobese diabetic mouse; SCID mouse; theranostic nanomedicine; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Camptothecin; Cell Line, Tumor; Folic Acid; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Nanostructures; Neoplasms; Theranostic Nanomedicine; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84927922357

Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board; all subjects gave written informed consent and had both of their hands examined. Ten wrists in 10 healthy volunteers (age range, 35-51 years) and 16 wrists in 12 patients with CTS (age range, 37-55 years) were examined. In the patients, CTS had been confirmed on the basis of clinical symptoms and results of electrophysiologic studies. Raw US signals were acquired and were cross correlated to enable estimation of 2D incremental displacements, from which 2D strains were computed. The median nerve was characterized by the axial normal strain, while the flexor tendons and the flexor retinaculum were characterized by the shear strain. Temporal mean values (mean cumulative strain [MCS] values) and standard deviations (standard deviations of the cumulative strain [SDCS]) of the spatially averaged cumulative strains in each tissue region over the entire cycle of finger motion were compared by using an unpaired two-tailed Student t test. Results: MCS for patients with CTS and volunteers was similar. The SDCS for the shear strain of the flexor retinaculum was significantly lower (P <.001) in patients with CTS than in healthy volunteers, while that for the axial strain of the median nerve was higher in healthy volunteers than in patients with CTS (P =.0065).

The insulin plus tetracosanol enhanced insulin receptor kinase showed that AKT activity was down-regulated by S961 in differentiated L6 myotubes. Meanwhile, insulin plus tetracosanol restored the ability of glucose transporter translocation and glucose uptake in differentiated myotubes with S961-induced insulin resistance in vitro. The modification of carbon chain lengths and the hydroxyl group of tetracosanol showed that it served as a critical chemical structure for the glucostasis effect in vivo. This study provides new evidence to show that tetracosanol can improve glycaemic control via insulin receptor kinase activity induced and leads to the enhancement of glucose transporter translocation to improve glucose uptake. The hydroxyl group of tetracosanol plays a critical role for insulin receptor kinase activity. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Diabetes mellitus; Glucose transporter 4; Insulin receptor kinase; Insulin resistance; Policosanol; Tetracosanol,Saccharum sinense,2-s2.0-84926336631

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) as a label-free method is a promising technology for detection of rare cells for diagnosis or research applications. Short detection depth of SPR (400nm) provides a sensitive method with minimum interference of non-targets in the biological samples. In this work, we developed a novel microfluidic chip integrated with gold nanoslit SPR platform for highly efficient immunomagnetic capturing and detection of rare cells in human blood. Our method offers simple yet efficient detection of target cells with high purity. The approach for detection consists of two steps. Target cells are firs captured on functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with specific antibody I. The suspension containing the captured cells (MNPs-cells) is then introduced into a microfluidic chip integrated with a gold nanoslit film. MNPs-cells bind with the second specific antibody immobilized on the surface of the gold nanoslit and are therefore captured on the sensor active area. The cell binding on the gold nanoslit was monitored by the wavelength shift of the SPR spectrum generated by the gold nanoslits. ? 2015 by the authors.",Double capture; Gold nanoslits; Magnetic nanoparticles; Microfluidic chip; Rare cells; Surface plasmon resonance,gold nanoslit; immobilized antibody; magnetic nanoparticle; nanomaterial; unclassified drug; gold; metal nanoparticle; analytic method; Article; cancer cell; cell suspension; controlled study; film; human; human cell; microfluidics; sensor; surface plasmon resonance; surface property; target cell; blood analysis; blood cell; chemistry; cytology; devices; genetic procedures; lab on a chip; procedures; surface plasmon resonance; Biosensing Techniques; Blood Cells; Blood Chemical Analysis; Gold; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Metal Nanoparticles; Surface Plasmon Resonance,2-s2.0-84925968924

Mitochondrial proteins such as acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT1) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) have not been reported with the roles on the formation of doxorubicin resistance in our knowledge. Further studies have used RNA interference and cell viability analysis to evidence the essential roles of ACAT1 and MDH2 on their potency in the formation of doxorubicin resistance through increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis during doxorubicin treatment.

Progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the main outcome measures. In an exploratory analysis, a standardized uptake value of 2.5 (SUV 2.5) was taken as the cut-off value for the detection of tumour boundaries. A fixed threshold at 42?% of the maximum SUV (SUVmax 42?%) and an adaptive threshold method were then used for validation. Regional textural features were extracted from pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT images using the grey-level run length encoding method and grey-level size zone matrix. The prognostic significance of PET textural features was examined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Cox regression analysis.Purpose: The question as to whether the regional textural features extracted from PET images predict prognosis in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) remains open. In this study, we investigated the prognostic impact of regional heterogeneity in patients with T3/T4 OPSCC.Results: Zone-size nonuniformity (ZSNU) was identified as an independent predictor of PFS and DSS. Its prognostic impact was confirmed using both the SUVmax 42?% and the adaptive threshold segmentation methods. Based on (1) total lesion glycolysis, (2) uniformity (a local scale texture parameter), and (3) ZSNU, we devised a prognostic stratification system that allowed the identification of four distinct risk groups. The model combining the three prognostic parameters showed a higher predictive value than each variable alone.Conclusion: ZSNU is an independent predictor of outcome in patients with advanced T-stage OPSCC, and may improve their prognostic stratification. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",FDG PET/CT; HPV; Oropharyngeal carcinoma; Texture analysis,"fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; adult; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; disease specific survival; female; glycolysis; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; image analysis; imaging software; major clinical study; male; medical record review; oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma; oropharynx carcinoma; outcome assessment; PET-CT scanner; positron emission tomography; predictive value; progression free survival; radiological parameters; receiver operating characteristic; reference value; retrospective study; total lesion glycolysis; zone size nonuniformity; aged; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic use; middle aged; multimodal imaging; oropharynx tumor; pathology; scintiscanning; squamous cell carcinoma; survival; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multimodal Imaging; Oropharyngeal Neoplasms; Positron-Emission Tomography; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiopharmaceuticals; Survival Analysis; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84925507745

Since DM may lead to serious complications, its treatment and care relies on early diagnosis leading to strict glycemic control monitored by the periodic measurement of the patients’ blood glucose levels. However, glucose levels can easily fluctuate due to diet, exercise, insulin resistance, stress, and other factors. Alternatively, the percentage of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood reflects an average glucose concentration over the past 2–3?months with fewer variations due to non-glycemic factors. Therefore, the accurate measurement of the HbA1c in the blood provides a more effective route to diagnose and to monitor DM than a conventional blood glucose measurement. For the measurement of HbA1c, immunoassays have become a widely used method. Therefore, to demonstrate automatic HbA1c measurement, we have developed a microfluidic system to perform a chemiluminescence immunoassay on a single chip automatically except the treatment of samples was undertaken off-chip and required centrifugation. Compared to routine clinical protocols, which rely on bulky benchtop instruments, the developed system is more compact in size (3.8-cm wide and 6.8-cm long) and consumes less samples (volume?=?1?μL) and reagents (volume?=?150?μL). It is also less labor-intensive to perform an immunoassay using this chip. With further refinements in assay development, this device may be a promising replacement for conventional HbA1c measurement in the near future. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Diabetes mellitus; Hb; HbA1c; Immunoassay; MEMS; Microfluidic,Blood; Diagnosis; Fluidic devices; Glucose; Hemoglobin; Immunology; MEMS; Patient treatment; Blood glucose measurements; Chemiluminescence immunoassay; Diabetes mellitus; Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); Hb; HbA1c; Immunoassay; Integrated microfluidic systems; Microfluidics,2-s2.0-84925289667

More effective and easier treatments of NOx than those achieved by the present methods can offer better protection of human health and higher fuel efficiency that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, currently commercialized technologies for automotive NOx emission control cannot effectively treat diesel-like exhausts with high NOx concentrations. Thus, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) has been used extensively, which reduces fuel efficiency and increases particulate emission considerably. Our results show that the electro-catalytic honeycomb (ECH) promotes the decomposition of NOx to nitrogen and oxygen, without consuming reagents or other resources. NOx can be converted to nitrogen and oxygen almost completely. The ECHs are shown to effectively remove NOx from gasoline-fueled diesel-like exhausts. A very high NO concentration is preferred in the engine exhaust, especially during engine cold-start. Promoted NOx decomposition (PND) technology for real-world automotive applications is established in this study by using the ECH. With PND, EGR is no longer needed. Diesel-like engines can therefore achieve superior fuel efficiency, and all major automotive pollutants can be easily treated due to high concentration of oxygen in the diesel-like exhausts, leading to zero pollution. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,Automobile engines; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Emission control; Engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Honeycomb structures; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Pollution; Air pollutants; Automotive applications; Automotive emissions; Cold start; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Fuel efficiency; Human health; NO concentration; Exhaust gas recirculation; nitric oxide; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; oxygen; air pollutant; exhaust gas; gasoline; nitric acid derivative; nitrite; oxygen; atmospheric pollution; automation; catalysis; decomposition; diesel engine; exhaust emission; greenhouse gas; nitrogen oxides; public health; air pollution control; Article; decomposition; desorption; diesel engine; electro catalytic honeycomb device; exhaust gas; general device; oxidation; oxygen concentration; temperature; air pollutant; analysis; catalysis; electrochemistry; exhaust gas; procedures; Air Pollutants; Catalysis; Electrochemistry; Gasoline; Nitrates; Nitrites; Oxygen; Temperature; Vehicle Emissions,2-s2.0-84924999999

Unfortunately, there are currently few high-specificity candidate oligopeptide targeting agents that can be used for early diagnosis of this cancer. It has been suggested that cancer-specific oligopeptides could be screened from a phage display library. However, conventional methods are tedious, labor-intensive, and time consuming. Therefore, a novel, integrated microfluidic system was developed to automate the entire screening process for ovarian cancer cell-specific oligopeptides. An oligopeptide screened with microfluidic chip-based technique was demonstrated to have high affinity to ovarian cancer cells and demonstrated relatively low binding to other cancer cells, indicating a high specificity. Furthermore, the developed method consumed relatively low volumes of samples and reagents; only 70 μL of reactant was used within the whole experimental process. Each panning process was also significantly shortened to only 7.5 hours. Therefore, the screened oligopeptide could be used to isolate ovarian cancer cells in a rapid manner, thus greatly expediting the diagnosis and its application as oligopeptide targeting agent for theranostics of this cancer. ? 2015 Ivyspring International Publisher.",Microfluidic chip; Oligopeptide targeting agent; Ovarian cancer; Phage display library,"oligopeptide; oligopeptide; peptide library; protein binding; Article; automation; binding affinity; cancer cell; cancer diagnosis; cancer screening; cancer therapy; cell isolation; cell specificity; controlled study; human; human cell; microfluidics; ovary cancer; phage display; sample; diagnostic test; female; isolation and purification; microfluidics; Ovarian Neoplasms; peptide library; procedures; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Female; Humans; Microfluidics; Oligopeptides; Ovarian Neoplasms; Peptide Library; Protein Binding",2-s2.0-84924284077

A high amount of microbial diversity was detected, with an average of 1,836 phylotypes per sample. In addition to Acinetobacter, more than 60?% of the bacterial communities present among the top 25 abundant genera were dominated by skin-associated bacteria.

We found that the expression of Sgo1 mRNA was relatively low in normal tissues, but was upregulated in 82% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and correlated with elevated alpha-fetoprotein and early disease onset of HCC. The depletion of Sgo1 reduced cell viability of hepatoma cell lines including HuH7, HepG2, Hep3B, and HepaRG. Using time-lapse microscopy, we showed that hepatoma cells were delayed and ultimately die in mitosis in the absence of Sgo1. In contrast, cell viability and mitotic progression of immortalized cells were not significantly affected. Notably, mitotic cell death induced upon Sgo1 depletion was suppressed upon inhibitions of cyclin-dependent kinase-1 and Aurora kinase-B, or the depletion of mitotic arrest deficient-2. Thus, mitotic cell death induced upon Sgo1 depletion in hepatoma cells is mediated by persistent activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint.

Tylophorine derivatives exhibit anti-cancer activities but their cellular targets remain unknown. We used a biotinylated tylophorine derivative to probe for the interacting cellular target(s) of tylophorine. Tylophorine directly binds to caprin-1 and consequently enhances the recruitment of G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclin D2 mRNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex. Subsequently, this tylophorine targeted ribonucleoprotein complex is sequestered to the polysomal fractions and the protein expressions of the associated mRNA-transcripts are repressed. Caprin-1 depleted carcinoma cells become more resistant to tylophorine, associated with decreased formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex targeted by tylophorine. Consequently, tylophorine downregulates c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2, causing hypophosphorylation of Rb and suppression of both processing-body formation and the Warburg effect. Gene expression profiling and gain-of-c-Myc-function experiments also revealed that the downregulated c-Myc contributes to the anti-oncogenic effects of tylophorine compounds. Furthermore, the potent tylophorine derivative dibenzoquinoline-33b elicited a similar effect, as c-Myc protein levels were also decreased in xenograft tumors treated with dibenzoquinoline-33b. Thus, tylophorine compounds exert anti-cancer activity predominantly by targeting and sequestering the caprin-1 protein and c-Myc mRNA associated ribonucleoprotein complex.",C-Myc; Caprin-1; Cyclin D; G3BP1; Processing body,"caprin 1 protein; cyclin D1; cyclin D2; dibenzoquinoline 33b; guanosine triphosphatase activating protein; messenger RNA; Myc protein; protein G3BP1; quinoline derivative; retinoblastoma protein; ribonucleoprotein; tylophorine; unclassified drug; alkaloid; CAPRIN1 protein, human; carrier protein; cell cycle protein; cyclin D2; G3BP protein, human; indolizine derivative; messenger RNA; multiprotein complex; phenanthrene derivative; protein binding; protein c Myb; ribonucleoprotein; tylophorine; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; carcinoma cell; down regulation; drug protein binding; drug targeting; gain of function mutation; gene expression profiling; human; human cell; lung carcinoma; mouse; nonhuman; protein depletion; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; RNA transcription; tumor growth; tumor xenograft; animal; cell line; chemistry; drug effects; drug screening; genetics; HEK293 cell line; HeLa cell line; HepG2 cell line; MCF 7 cell line; metabolism; Neoplasms; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; tumor cell line; tumor volume; U937 cell line; Western blotting; Alkaloids; Animals; Blotting, Western; Carrier Proteins; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclin D2; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Indolizines; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Multiprotein Complexes; Neoplasms; Phenanthrenes; Protein Binding; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribonucleoproteins; RNA Interference; RNA, Messenger; Tumor Burden; U937 Cells; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84922998508

By assuming that natural light has the best light quality, devising a pseudo-natural light is hence important and critical. Here, an all-weather pseudo-natural light is demonstrated based on a high number of broad-band emitters. By doping six broad-band organic light-emitting dyes in three separate emission layers, for example, the light source can exhibit a 92-96% similarity with the sunlight from dawn to dusk, and a color gamut of 80% in terms of NTSC. By combining six narrow-band light-emitting diodes (LEDs), a much wider gamut of 121% NTSC is achievable, but with a slightly poor daylight similarity, i.e., ranging between 80% and 83%. The daylight similarity, however, can easily be enhanced to at least 94% upon incorporating broad-band phosphors, even with the use of only one or two LEDs.

Oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes regulated by miRNAs mediate cell cycle progression, metabolism, cell death, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression in cancer. Recently, miRNAs have emerged as therapeutic targets or tools and biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy monitoring in cancer. Since miRNAs can regulate multiple cancer-related genes simultaneously, using miRNAs as a therapeutic approach plays an important role in cancer therapy. However, one of the major challenges of miRNA-based cancer therapy is to achieve specific, efficient and safe systemic delivery of therapeutic miRNAs in vivo. This review discusses the key challenges to the development of the carriers for miRNA-based therapy and explores current strategies to systemically deliver miRNAs to cancer without induction of toxicity. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Cancer therapy; Gene delivery; In vivo delivery; MiRNA; Nanotechnology,"Cell death; Cell signaling; Diagnosis; Diseases; Gene expression; Gene expression regulation; Gene transfer; Genes; Nanotechnology; Oncogenic viruses; Oncology; RNA; Cancer therapy; Cell-cycle progression; Gene Delivery; In-vivo; MiRNA; Post-transcriptional; Therapeutic targets; Tumor suppressor genes; Gene therapy; double stranded RNA; drug carrier; microRNA; nanoparticle; polymer; single stranded RNA; microRNA; cancer diagnosis; cancer therapy; cell death; cell metabolism; cell proliferation; chemical modification; drug clearance; drug decomposition; drug delivery system; drug penetration; drug targeting; endosome; gene silencing; human; immunotoxicity; liposomal delivery; liposomal gene delivery system; metastasis; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; nonviral gene delivery system; pharmacodynamics; Review; RNA degradation; signal transduction; tumor vascularization; viral gene delivery system; animal; disease course; gene expression regulation; gene transfer; genetics; Neoplasms; RNA processing; Animals; Disease Progression; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Silencing; Gene Transfer Techniques; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-84922273505

Exome and targeted sequencing in a disease context represent a major NGS clinical application, considering its utility and cost-effectiveness. With the ongoing discovery of disease-associated genes, various gene panels have been launched for both basic research and diagnostic tests. However, the fundamental inconsistencies among the diverse annotation sources, software packages, and data formats have complicated the subsequent analysis. To manage disease-associated NGS data, we developed Vanno, a Web-based application for in-depth analysis and rapid evaluation of disease-causative genome sequence alterations. Vanno integrates information from biomedical databases, functional predictions from available evaluation models, and mutation landscapes from TCGA cancer types. A highly integrated framework that incorporates filtering, sorting, clustering, and visual analytic modules is provided to facilitate exploration of oncogenomics datasets at different levels, such as gene, variant, protein domain, or three-dimensional structure. Such design is crucial for the extraction of knowledge from sequence alterations and translating biological insights into clinical applications. Taken together, Vanno supports almost all disease-associated gene tests and exome sequencing panels designed for NGS, providing a complete solution for targeted and exome sequencing analysis.

Our objective is to evaluate the outcome of these conservative treatments in our patients with mixed urinary incontinence. Methods A retrospective review was conducted in patients with mixed urinary incontinence who were offered sequential conservative treatment modalities comprised of medication and physiotherapy. Outcome was defined as a score of 1 or less for questions 2 and 3 on the six-item Urodynamic Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and seven-item Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, in addition to clinical symptomatic improvement with no urgency, urge incontinence and voiding frequency of less than eight times per 24 h on a 3-day bladder diary after treatment. Treatment outcome of patients opting for medication plus physiotherapy (M + P) were analyzed against patients preferring medication only (M). Results Sixty-two mixed urinary incontinent patients received an initial treatment with conservative measures with mean follow-up of 14 months. A total of 61.2% (30/49) and 56.3% (9/13) subjects had improved symptoms in the M + P and M group, respectively. There was significant improvement in UDI-6 total score in the M + P group after conservative treatment, despite no significant difference when compared to the M group. Only 6.45% required subsequent anti-incontinence surgery after conservative treatment, amongst whom only half showed improvement after the surgery. Conclusion Combined treatment with medication and physiotherapy is highly recommended for patients with mixed urinary incontinence. Conservative measures should still precede any surgical intervention. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy. ? 2014 The Authors.

However, the regulatory mechanism of combinatorial Ras and WNT signaling in advanced prostate cancer is still unclear. TCF7, a WNT signaling-related gene, has been implicated as a critical factor in bone metastasis, and here we show that TCF7 is a direct target of miR-34a. In samples of prostate cancer patients, miR-34a levels are inversely correlated with TCF7 expression and a WNT dependent gene signature. Ectopic miR-34a expression inhibited bone metastasis and reduced cancer cell proliferation in a Ras-dependent xenograft model. We demonstrate that miR- 34a can directly interfere with the gene expression of the anti-proliferative BIRC5, by targeting BIRC5 3'UTR. Importantly, BIRC5 overexpression was sufficient to reconstitute anti-apoptotic signaling in cells expressing high levels of miR-34a. In prostate cancer patients, we found that BIRC5 levels were positively correlated with a Ras signaling signature expression.

LncRNA PTENP1 is a pseudogene of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN but its roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have yet to be explored. Here we confirmed that PTENP1 and PTEN were downregulated in several HCC cells, thus we constructed Sleeping Beauty (SB)-based hybrid baculovirus (BV) vectors for sustained PTENP1 lncRNA expression. Co-transduction of HCC cells with the SB-BV vector expressing PTENP1 elevated the levels of PTENP1 and PTEN, which suppressed the oncogenic PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibited cell proliferation, migration/invasion as well as induced autophagy and apoptosis. The overexpressed PTENP1 decoyed oncomirs miR-17, miR-19b and miR-20a, which would otherwise target PTEN, PHLPP (a negative AKT regulator) and such autophagy genes as ULK1, ATG7 and p62, indicating that PTENP1 modulated the HCC cell behavior and gene networks by miRNA regulation. Injection of the PTENP1-expressing SB-BV vector into mice bearing HCC tumors effectively mitigated the tumor growth, suppressed intratumoral cell proliferation, elicited apoptosis, autophagy and inhibited angiogenesis. These data collectively unveiled the molecular mechanisms of how PTENP1 repressed the tumorigenic properties of HCC cells and demonstrated the potential of the SB-BV hybrid vector for PTENP1 lncRNA modulation and HCC therapy. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Baculovirus; Cancer therapy; Hepatocellular carcinoma; LncRNA; MiRNA; PTENP1,"Cell death; Cell proliferation; Cells; Cytology; Diseases; Genes; Nucleic acids; Tumors; Vectors; Baculovirus; Cancer therapy; Hepatocellular carcinoma; LncRNA; MiRNA; PTENP1; RNA; microRNA; untranslated RNA; virus vector; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; sleeping beauty transposase, human; transposase; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; Baculoviridae; cancer therapy; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; human; liver cell carcinoma; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; animal; Baculoviridae; Bagg albino mouse; cell survival; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); nude mouse; pathology; signal transduction; vascularization; Mus; Animals; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Baculoviridae; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Survival; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; RNA, Long Noncoding; Signal Transduction; Transposases",2-s2.0-84921265137

A safe and competent nano-delivery system is thus in urgent demand to facilitate the simultaneous transport of various therapeutic agents to cancer cells and a tumor region to achieve synergistic effect. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSNs) were fabricated herein as potential candidates for drug delivery. Serving as gatekeepers, GNPs (5nm in diameter) were attached onto the amino-functionalized MSNs (denoted as NMSNs) via a relatively weak gold-nitrogen bonding. The resulting nanohybrids (denoted as GCMSNs) were uptaken by cells, and the detachment of GNPs and subsequent intracellular drug release from NMSNs were achieved by competitive binding of intracellular glutathione to GNPs. In addition to the function of gatekeeping, GNPs also play another role as the oxidative stress elicitor. Our invitro studies revealed that GCMSNs induced higher oxidative stress in lung cancer cells (A549) than in normal cells (3T3-L1). This growth inhibitory effect found in the cancer cells was likely induced by mitochondria dysfunction originated from the GCMSN-induced, oxidative stress-triggered mitochondria-mediated autophagy. The redox-responsive nanohybrids were further loaded with camptothecin and the intensified synergistic therapeutic effects were observed associated with combined chemotherapy and oxidative stress strategy. The results clearly demonstrate that such unique nanohybrids hold great promise for selective and effective cancer treatments. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Autophagy; Chemotherapy; Glutathione-mediated intracellular release; Gold nanoparticles capping; Mesoporous silica nanohybrid; Oxidative stress strategy,"Biological organs; Chemotherapy; Cytology; Diseases; Drug delivery; Fiber optic sensors; Gold; Metal nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Oxidative stress; Peptides; Silica; Autophagy; Glutathiones; Gold Nanoparticles; Gold nanoparticles (GNPs); Mesoporous silica nanoparticles; Mitochondria dysfunctions; Nano hybrids; Nano-delivery systems; Cells; amino functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticle; camptothecin; glutathione; gold; gold nanoparticle; gold nanoparticle capped mesoporous silica nanoparticle; nitrogen; silica nanoparticle; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; camptothecin; glutathione; malonaldehyde; nanoparticle; silicon dioxide; 3T3 cell line; A549 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; autophagy; binding competition; cancer chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell level; chemical binding; controlled study; disorders of mitochondrial functions; drug delivery system; drug megadose; drug potentiation; drug release; human; human cell; in vitro study; internalization; lung cancer; male; mouse; multiple cycle treatment; nanofabrication; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; particle size; therapy effect; animal; autophagy; biological model; chemistry; drug effects; drug screening; energy metabolism; intracellular space; lipid peroxidation; metabolism; mitochondrion; Neoplasms; nude mouse; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; pathology; porosity; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; 3T3-L1 Cells; Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Autophagy; Camptothecin; Cell Line, Tumor; Energy Metabolism; Glutathione; Humans; Intracellular Space; Lipid Peroxidation; Malondialdehyde; Mice; Mice, Nude; Mitochondria; Models, Biological; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Porosity; Silicon Dioxide; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84919703762

Here we demonstrated that both GO and the chemotherapy drug cisplatin (CDDP) induced autophagy but elicited low degrees of CT26 cell death. Strikingly, GO combined with CDDP (GO/CDDP) potentiated the CT26 cell killing via necrosis. GO/CDDP not only elicited autophagy, but induced the nuclear import of CDDP and the autophagy marker LC3. The nuclear LC3 did not co-localize with p62 or Lamp-2, neither did blocking autolysosome formation significantly hinder the nuclear import of LC3/CDDP and necrosis, indicating that autophagosome and autolysosome formation was dispensable. Conversely, suppressing phagophore formation and importin-α/β significantly alleviated the nuclear import of LC3/CDDP and necrosis. These data suggested that GO/CDDP diverted the LC3 flux in the early phase of autophagy, resulting in LC3 trafficking towards the nucleus in an importin-α/β-dependent manner, which concurred with the CDDP nuclear import and necrosis. Intratumoral injection of GO/CDDP into mice bearing CT26 colon tumors potentiated immune cell infiltration and promoted cell death, autophagy and HMGB1 release, thereby synergistically augmenting the antitumor effects.

Nephrotoxicity caused due to endothelial cell dysfunction and neutrophils infiltration in kidneys. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an ELR+ chemokine binds with CXCR1/2 receptors and its role is primarily in neutrophils recruitment and also involved in invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis of different solid tumors including liver cancer. G31P, a CXCR1/2 antagonist, binds with CXCR1/2 with high affinity, and acts as an anti-inflammatory and antitumor agent. In the present study, we examined the antitumor effects of G31P and DDP on mouse liver cancer cells, and the effects exerted by G31P on cisplatin-induced renal injury. In vitro, effects of the G31P and DDP regimen on H22 cell proliferation were investigated by MTT assay.

Using high-throughput simultaneously quantified time-course transcriptomics, this study constructed host-pathogen interspecies interaction networks between C. albicans and zebrafish during the adhesion, invasion, and damage stages. Given that iron and glucose have been identified as crucial resources required during the infection process between C. albicans and zebrafish, we focused on the construction of the interspecies networks associated with them. Furthermore, a randomization technique was proposed to identify differentially regulated proteins that are statistically eminent for the three infection stages. The behaviors of the highly connected or differentially regulated proteins identified from the resulting networks were further investigated. ""Robustness"" is an important system property that measures the ability of the system tolerating the intrinsic perturbations in a dynamic network. This characteristic provides a systematic and quantitative view to elucidate the dynamics of iron and glucose competition in terms of the interspecies interaction networks. Here, we further estimated the robustness of our constructed interspecies interaction networks for the three infection stages. The constructed networks and robustness analysis provided significant insight into dynamic interactions related to iron and glucose competition during infection and enabled us to quantify the system's intrinsic perturbation tolerance ability during iron and glucose competition throughout the three infection stages. Moreover, the networks also assist in elucidating the offensive and defensive mechanisms of C. albicans and zebrafish during their competition for iron and glucose. Our proposed method can be easily extended to identify other such networks involved in the competition for essential resources during infection. ? 2014 Lin et al.",,"glucose; iron; animal; biological model; Candida albicans; candidiasis; computer simulation; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; microbiology; organismal interaction; physiology; signal transduction; species difference; zebra fish; Animals; Candida albicans; Candidiasis; Computer Simulation; Glucose; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Iron; Microbial Interactions; Models, Biological; Signal Transduction; Species Specificity; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-84961589858

This study proposes installing a nose-on-a-chip at the proximal end of an expiratory circuit of a ventilator to monitor and to detect metabolite of pneumonia in the early stage. The nose-on-a-chip was designed and fabricated in a 90-nm 1P9M CMOS technology in order to downsize the gas detection system. The chip has eight on-chip sensors, an adaptive interface, a successive approximation analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC), a learning kernel of continuous restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM), and a RISC-core with low-voltage SRAM. The functionality of VAP identification was verified using clinical data. In total, 76 samples infected with pneumonia (19 Klebsiella, 25 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 Staphylococcus aureus, and 16 Candida) and 41 uninfected samples were collected as the experimental group and the control group, respectively. The results revealed a very high VAP identification rate at 94.06% for identifying healthy and infected patients. A 100% accuracy to identify the microorganisms of Klebsiella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida from VAP infected patients was achieved.

However, some nonideal effects are often distributed in ECG. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is efficient for nonstationary signal analysis. In this paper, the Symlets sym5 is chosen as the wavelet function to decompose recorded ECG signals for noise removal. Soft-thresholding method is then applied for feature detection. To detect ECG features, R peak of each heart beat is first detected, and the onset and offset of the QRS complex are then detected. Finally, the signal is recon-structed to remove high frequency interferences and applied with adaptive searching window and threshold to detect P and T waves. We use the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database for algorithm verification. For noise reduction, the SNR improvement is achieved at least 10dB at SNR 5dB, and most of the improvement SNR are better than other methods at least 1dB at different SNR. When applying to the real portable ECG device, all R peaks can be detected when patients walk, run, or move at the speed below 9km/h. The performance of delineation on database shows in our algorithm can achieve high sensitivity in detecting ECG features.

However, the biological effects of rhein on the behavior of breast cancers are not completely elucidated. To evaluate whether rhein might be useful in the treatment of breast cancer and its cytotoxic mechanism, we analyzed the impact of rhein treatment on differential protein expression as well as redox regulation in a non-invasive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, and an invasive breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, using lysine- and cysteine-labeling two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. This proteomic study revealed that 73 proteins were significantly changed in protein expression; while 9 proteins were significantly altered in thiol reactivity in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The results also demonstrated that rhein-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells mostly involves dysregulation of cytoskeleton regulation, protein folding, the glycolysis pathway and transcription control. A further study also indicated that rhein promotes misfolding of cellular proteins as well as unbalancing of the cellular redox status leading to ER-stress. Our work shows that the current proteomic strategy offers a high-through-put platform to study the molecular mechanisms of rhein-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells.

The known tyrosinase inhibitors show numerous adverse side effects, and there is a lack of safety regulations governing their use. As a result, there is a need to develop novel inhibitors with no toxicity and long-term stability. In this study, we use molecular docking and pharmacophore modeling to construct a reasonable and reliable pharmacophore model, called Hypo 1, that could be used for identifying potent natural products with crucial complementary functional groups for mushroom tyrosinase inhibition. It was observed that, out of 47 263 natural compounds, A5 structurally resembles a dipeptide (WY) and natural compound B16 is the equivalent of a tripeptide (KFY), revealing that the C-terminus tyrosine residues play a key role in tyrosinase inhibition. Tripeptides RCY and CRY, which show high tyrosinase inhibitory potency, revealed a positional and functional preference for the cysteine residue at the N-terminus of the tripeptides, essentially determining the capacity of tyrosinase inhibition. CRY and RCY used the thiol group of cysteine residues to coordinate with the Cu ions in the active site of tyrosinase and showed reduced tyrosinase activity. We discovered the novel tripeptide CRY that shows the most striking inhibitory potency against mushroom tyrosinase (IC50 = 6.16 μM); this tripeptide is more potent than the known oligopeptides and comparable with kojic acid-tripeptides.

Previous epidemiological studies have suggested the carcinogenic potential of environmental exposure to ELF-EMFs, specifically at 50 or 60 Hz. However, the biological mechanism facilitating the effects of ELF-EMFs remains unclear. Cellular studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding the biological effects of ELF-EMFs. The inconsistent results might have been due to diverse cell types. In our previous study, we indicated that 1.5 mT, 60 Hz ELF-EMFs will cause G1 arrest through the activation of the ATM-Chk2-p21 pathway in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether ELF-EMFs cause similar effects in a distinct epidermal keratinocyte, primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK), by using the same ELF-EMF exposure system and experimental design. We observed that ELF-EMFs exerted no effects on cell growth, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and the activation of ATM signaling pathway in NHEK cells. We demonstrated that the 2 epidermal keratinocytes responded to ELF-EMFs differently. To further validate this finding, we simultaneously exposed the NHEK and HaCaT cells to ELF-EMFs in the same incubator for 168 h and observed the cell growths. The simultaneous exposure of the two cell types results showed that the NHEK and HaCaT cells exhibited distinct responses to ELF-EMFs. Thus, we confirmed that the biological effects of ELF-EMFs in epidermal keratinocytes are cell type specific. Our findings may partially explain the inconsistent results of previous studies when comparing results across various experimental models. ? 2014 Huang et al.",,"ATM protein; checkpoint kinase 2; protein p21; ATM protein; ATM protein, human; checkpoint kinase 2; CHEK2 protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; hydrogen peroxide; Article; biological activity; cell culture; cell cycle assay; cell cycle parameters; cell function; cell growth; cell line; cell proliferation; cell stimulation; cellular distribution; cellular stress response; colony formation; controlled study; electromagnetic field; environmental exposure; epidermis cell; frequency modulation; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; general device; human; human cell; incubation time; intermethod comparison; keratinocyte; magnetic and electromagnetic equipment; magnetic chamber; protein determination; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; quality control; radiation exposure; signal transduction; ultraviolet B radiation; cytology; drug effects; epidermis; keratinocyte; metabolism; phosphorylation; radiation response; ultraviolet radiation; Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Checkpoint Kinase 2; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21; Electromagnetic Fields; Epidermis; G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Keratinocytes; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Ultraviolet Rays",2-s2.0-84914695677

To form a functional gp41 complex, the protein undergoes hairpin formation and self-assembly. The fusion event can be inhibited by gp41-derived peptides at nanomolar concentration and is highly dependent on the time of addition, implying a role of folding kinetics on the inhibitory action. Oligomerization of the gp41 ectodomain was demonstrated by light scattering measurements. Kinetic study by stopped-flow fluorescence and absorption measurements (i) revealed a multistate folding pathway and stable intermediates; (ii) showed a dissection of fast and slow components for early and late stages of folding, respectively, with 3 orders of magnitude difference in the time scale; (iii) showed the slow process was attributed to misfolding and unzipping of the hairpin; and (iv) showed retardation of the native hairpin formation is assumed to lead to coupling of the correctly registered hairpin and self-assembly. This coupling allows the deduction on the time scale of intrachain folding (0.1-1 s) for the protein. The folding reaction was illustrated by a free energy profile to explain the temporal dichotomy of fast and slow steps of folding as well as effective inhibition by gp41-derived peptide.

It has relatively few side effects and has therefore been extensively investigated for a variety of medical applications in internal medicine and surgery. The EMT system applies a high-frequency alternating electromagnetic field to heat up the needles which are inserted into the target tumor to cause tumor ablation. In this study, a new synchronized-coil EMT system was demonstrated, which was equipped with two synchronized coils and magnetic field generators to provide a long-range, penetrated electromagnetic field to effectively heat up the needles. The heating effect of the needles at the center of the two coils was first explored. The newly designed two-section needle array combined with the synchronized-coil EMT system was thus demonstrated in the in vitro and in vivo animal experiments. Experimental data showed that the developed system is promising for minimally invasive surgery since it might provide superior performance for thermotherapy in cancer treatment. ? 2014 IEEE.",Ablation; electromagnetic thermotherapy (EMT) system; minimally invasive surgery (MIS); needle arrays; synchronized-coil system.,"Ablation; Diseases; Electromagnetic fields; Medical applications; Physical therapy; Surgery; Synchronization; Tumors; Alternating electromagnetic field; Animal experiments; Coil systems; Electromagnetic thermotherapy; High frequency HF; Internal medicine; Magnetic field generator; Minimally invasive surgery; Needles; ablation therapy; alternating current; animal experiment; Article; cauterization; controlled study; electromagnetic field; heating; high temperature; human; hyperthermic therapy; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver; magnetotherapy; minimally invasive surgery; needle; nonhuman; room temperature; synchronized coil electromagnetic thermotherapy system; target organ; temperature measurement; animal; devices; electromagnetic field; equipment design; hyperthermic therapy; needle; pathology; procedures; radiation response; surgery; swine; Ablation Techniques; Animals; Electromagnetic Fields; Equipment Design; Hyperthermia, Induced; Liver; Needles; Swine",2-s2.0-84908110433

We recently demonstrated potent induction of the humoral and cell-mediated immune response in monkeys immunized with EV71 virus-like particles (VLPs), with a morphology resembling that of infectious EV71 virions but not containing a viral genome, which could potentially be safe as a vaccine for EV71. To elucidate the mechanisms through which EV71 VLPs induce cell-mediated immunity, we studied the immunomodulatory effects of EV71 VLPs on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), which bind to and incorporate EV71 VLPs. DC treatment with EV71 VLPs enhanced the expression of CD80, CD86, CD83, CD40, CD54, and HLA-DR on the cell surface; increased the production of interleukin (IL)-12 p40, IL-12 p70, and IL-10 by DCs; and suppressed the capacity of DCs for endocytosis. Treatment with EV71 VLPs also enhanced the ability of DCs to stimulate na?ve T cells and induced secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ by T cells and Th1 cell responses. Neutralization with antibodies against Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 suppressed the capacity of EV71 VLPs to induce the production of IL-12 p40, IL-12 p70, and IL-10 by DCs and inhibited EV71 VLPs binding to DCs. Our study findings clarified the important role for TLR4 signaling in DCs in response to EV71 VLPs and showed that EV71 VLPs induced inhibitor of kappaB alpha (IκBα) degradation and nuclear factor of kappaB (NF-κB) activation. ? 2014 Lin et al.",,"B7 antigen; CD40 antigen; CD83 antigen; CD86 antigen; HLA DR antigen; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin kappa chain; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 12p70; toll like receptor 4; cytokine; I kappa B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; NF-kappaB inhibitor alpha; TLR4 protein, human; toll like receptor 4; antigen expression; Article; cell activation; cell maturation; cell surface; cellular immunity; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; dendritic cell; endocytosis; Enterovirus 71; human; human cell; immunomodulation; monocyte; monocyte derived dendritic cell; nonhuman; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; Th1 cell; virus attachment; virus like agent; virus neutralization; biological model; biosynthesis; cell differentiation; cytology; dendritic cell; Enterovirus A; immunology; metabolism; monocyte; virion; Human enterovirus 71; Cell Differentiation; Cytokines; Dendritic Cells; Endocytosis; Enterovirus A, Human; Humans; I-kappa B Proteins; Immunomodulation; Models, Biological; Monocytes; NF-kappa B; Proteolysis; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocytes; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Virion",2-s2.0-84910148849

More seriously, the prognosis for survival is relatively poor if an early OvCa diagnosis is not achieved. However, it is extremely challenging to diagnose very early stage OvCa, when treatments are the most effective, because of the lack of specific and sensitive biomarkers. Therefore, in order to achieve early detection of OvCa, screening and identifying biomarkers with high specificity and affinity are greatly needed. In this study, an integrated microfluidic system capable of performing cell-based systematic evolution of ligands by an exponential enrichment (Cell-SELEX) process was developed for automatic, high-throughput screening of multiple cell lines to competitively select aptamer-based biomarkers for OvCa. This on-chip Cell-SELEX process only required five rounds of aptamer selection, which is much faster than using a conventional SELEX process (22 rounds). Using this on-chip process, 13 aptamers specific to OvCa cells were successfully screened and three of them showed high affinity towards target cells with dissociation constants of 1.8 nM, 8.3 nM, and 1.3 nM. Analysis of stained fluorescence images and competitive testing against multiple cancer cell lines (cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and liver cancer) were performed to verify the specificity of these selected aptamers. The results demonstrated that this developed system could perform the on-chip Cell-SELEX selection successfully and could be applied for personalized aptamer screening or targeted therapy monitoring in the near future. ? the Partner Organisations 2014.",,"aptamer; biological marker; aptamer; ligand; Article; cancer cell; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer screening; cancer survival; cell selection; dissociation constant; early diagnosis; fluorescence; fluorescence imaging; high throughput screening; histology; microfluidics; multiple cancer; on chip cell selex process; ovary cancer; target cell; 3T3 cell line; animal; automation; cell culture; cell separation; chemistry; devices; female; HepG2 cell line; human; lab on a chip; MCF 7 cell line; microfluidic analysis; mouse; ovary tumor; pathology; procedures; Animals; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Automation; Cell Separation; Cells, Cultured; Female; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Ligands; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; NIH 3T3 Cells; Ovarian Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84907821919

Previously, we have reported the toxicological effects of tt-DDE in vitro and in vivo. However, the metabolic pathways of tt-DDE in vivo remain unclear. In our present study, we combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with triple quadrupole and time-of-flight to identify tt-DDE metabolites in the urine of mice orally administered tt-DDE. We identified two tt-DDE metabolites, 2,4-decadienoic acid and cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol, in the urine of mice gavaged with tt-DDE and in human hepatoma cell cultures. The structure of 2,4-decadienoic acid was confirmed upon comparison of its tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectrum and retention time with those of synthetic standards. The moieties of cysteine and alcohol on cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol were validated by treating cell cultures with stable-isotope-labeled cysteine and 4-methylpyrazole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor. The MS/MS spectra of a cysteine standard and ionized cysteine detached from cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol were identical. Two metabolic pathways for the biotransformation of tt-DDE in vivo are proposed: (i) the oxidation of tt-DDE to the corresponding carboxylic acid, 2,4-decadienoic acid, in liver cells and (ii) glutathione (GHS) conjugation, GSH breakdown, and aldehyde reduction, which generate cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol in both liver and lung cells. In conclusion, this platform can be used to identify tt-DDE metabolites, and cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol can serve as a biomarker for assessing exposure to tt-DDE.

In recent years, biomedical imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and ultrasound have been greatly developed and have served pivotal roles in clinical cancer management. Molecular imaging (MI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that monitors biological processes at the cellular and sub-cellular levels. To achieve these goals, MI uses targeted imaging agents that can bind targets of interest with high specificity and report on associated abnormalities, a task that cannot be performed by conventional imaging techniques. In this respect, MI holds great promise as a potential therapeutic tool for the early diagnosis of cancer. Nevertheless, the clinical applications of targeted imaging agents are limited due to their inability to overcome biological barriers inside the body. The use of nanoparticles has made it possible to overcome these limitations. Hence, nanoparticles have been the subject of a great deal of recent studies. Therefore, developing nanoparticle-based imaging agents that can target tumors via active or passive targeting mechanisms is desirable. This review focuses on the applications of various functionalized nanoparticle-based imaging agents used in MI for the early detection of cancer. ? 2014 Sivasubramanian, Hsia and Lo.",Cancer early diagnostics; Gadolinium; Gold nanoparticles; Iron oxide nanoparticles; Molecular imaging; Nanoparticle; Polymeric nanoparticles; Quantum dots,,2-s2.0-84982172794

In this work, we present a strategy to compute the free energy for releasing Zn2+ from MTs using a combination of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) minimizations, and continuum dielectric calculations. The methodology is shown to reproduce the experimental observations that (1) the Zn-binding sites do not have equal Zn2+ affinity and (2) the isolated β domain is thermodynamically less stable and releases Zn2+ faster with oxidizing agents than the isolated α domain. It was used to compute the free energies for Zn2+ release from the metal cluster in the absence and presence of the protein matrix (protein architecture and coupled protein-water interactions) to yield the respective disulfide-bonded product.

A major shortcoming of traditional radiation therapy is the set of side effect associated with its long-range interaction with nearby tissues. Low-energy Auger electrons have the advantage of an extremely short effective range, minimizing damage to healthy tissue. Consequently, the isotope 99mTc, an Auger electron source, is currently being studied for its beneficial potential in cancer treatment. We examined the dose effect of a pyrene derivative 99mTc complex on plasmid DNA by using gel electrophoresis in both aqueous and methanol solutions. In aqueous solutions, the average yield per decay for double-strand breaks is 0.011±0.005 at low dose range, decreasing to 0.0005±0.0003 in the presence of 1 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The apparent yield per decay for single-strand breaks (SSB) is 0.04±0.02, decreasing to approximately a fifth with 1 M DMSO. In methanol, the average yield per decay of DSB is 0.54±0.06 and drops to undetectable levels in 2 M DMSO. The SSB yield per decay is 7.2±0.2, changing to 0.4±0.2 in the presence of 2 M DMSO. The 95% decrease in the yield of DSB in DMSO indicates that the main mechanism for DSB formation is through indirect effect, possibly by cooperative binding or clustering of intercalators. In the presence of non-radioactive ligands at a near saturation concentration, where radioactive Tc compounds do not form large clusters, the yield of SSB stays the same while the yield of DSB decreases to the value in DMSO. DSBs generated by 99mTc conjugated to intercalators are primarily caused by indirect effects through clustering. ? 2014 Chung et al.",,"agarose; dimethyl sulfoxide; methanol; plasmid DNA; pyrene derivative tc 99m; radiopharmaceutical agent; unclassified drug; DNA; pyrene; pyrene derivative; solution and solubility; technetium complex; water; aqueous solution; Article; controlled study; dosimetry; double stranded DNA break; gel electrophoresis; quantitative analysis; agar gel electrophoresis; DNA damage; drug effects; solution and solubility; DNA; DNA Damage; Electrophoresis, Agar Gel; Organotechnetium Compounds; Pyrenes; Solutions; Water",2-s2.0-84907916670

Specific changes in protein expression can provide a diagnostic marker. In our present study, we investigated changes in protein expression during urothelial carcinogenesis. The carcinogen BBN was used to induce mouse bladder tumor formation. Mouse bladder mucosa proteins were collected and analyzed by 2D electrophoresis from 6 to 20. weeks after commencing continuous BBN treatment. By histological examination, the connective layer of the submucosa showed gradual thickening and the number of submucosal capillaries gradually increased after BBN treatment. At 12-weeks after the start of BBN treatment, the urothelia became moderately dysplastic and tumors arose after 20-weeks of treatment. These induced bladder lesions included carcinoma in situ and connective tissue invasive cancer. In protein 2D analysis, the sequentially downregulated proteins from 6 to 20. weeks included GSTM1, L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain, keratin 8, keratin 18 and major urinary proteins 2 and 11/8. In contrast, the sequentially upregulated proteins identified were GSTO1, keratin 15 and myosin light polypeptide 6. Western blotting confirmed that GSTM1 and NQO-1 were decreased, while GSTO1 and Sp1 were increased, after BBN treatment. In human bladder cancer cells, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased the GSTM1 mRNA and protein expression. These data suggest that the downregulation of GSTM1 in the urothelia is a biomarker of bladder carcinogenesis and that this may be mediated by DNA CpG methylation. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Biomarker; Bladder cancer; DNA CpG methylation; Glutathione S-transferase; Nitrosamines; Protein 2D electrophoresis,"5 aza 2' deoxycytidine; biological marker; cytokeratin 18; cytokeratin 8; glutathione transferase M1; glutathione transferase O1; lactate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; myosin VI; n butyl n (4 hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine; transcription factor Sp1; unclassified drug; cytokeratin 15; glutathione transferase; glutathione transferase 01; oxidoreductase; quinone oxidoreductase 1; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bladder carcinogenesis; bladder injury; bladder mucosa; carcinoma in situ; connective tissue tumor; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; down regulation; female; gene silencing; histology; human; human tissue; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; submucosa; transitional cell carcinoma; tumor growth; two dimensional electrophoresis; upregulation; Western blotting; Article; bladder cancer; cancer cell; cancer growth; down regulation; human cell; protein analysis; protein urine level; Biomarker; Bladder cancer; DNA CpG methylation; Glutathione S-transferase; Nitrosamines; Protein 2D electrophoresis; Animals; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Azacitidine; Blotting, Western; Body Weight; Butylhydroxybutylnitrosamine; Carcinogens; Cell Line, Tumor; Coloring Agents; Down-Regulation; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Female; Glutathione Transferase; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mucous Membrane; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Urinary Bladder; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84907161207

A formalin-inactivated EV71 candidate vaccine (EV71vac) based on B4 subgenotype has previously been developed and found to elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses in mice and humans. In this study, we evaluated the long-term immunogenicity and safety of this EV71vac in a non-human primate model. Juvenile macaques were immunized at 0, 3 and 6 weeks either with 10 or 5 mg doses of EV71vac formulated with AlPO4 adjuvant, or PBS as control. During the 56 weeks of studies, no fever nor local redness and swelling at sites of injections was observed in the immunized macaques. After single immunization, 100% seroconversion based on 4-fold increased in neutralization titer (Nt) was detected in EV71vac immunized monkeys but not PBS controls. A dose-dependent IgG antibody response was observed in monkeys receiving EV71vac immunization. The Nt of EV71vac immunized macaques had reached the peak after 3 vaccinations, then decreased gradually; however, the GMT of neutralizing antibody in the EV71vac immunized macaques were still above 100 at the end of the study. Correspondingly, both dose- and time-dependent interferon-c and CD4+ T cell responses were detected in monkeys receiving EV71vac. Interestingly, similar to human responses, the dominant T cell epitopes of macaques were identified mainly in VP2 and VP3 regions. In addition, strong cross-neutralizing antibodies against most EV71 subgenotypes except some C2 and C4b strains, and Coxsackievirus A16 were observed. In summary, our results indicate that EV71vac elicits dose-dependent T-cell and antibody responses in macaques that could be a good animal model for evaluating the long-term immune responses elicited by EV71 vaccines. ? 2014 Liu et al.",,"formaldehyde; neutralizing antibody; virus vaccine; animal; Enterovirus A; immunology; Macaca; T lymphocyte; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Enterovirus A, Human; Formaldehyde; Macaca; T-Lymphocytes; Viral Vaccines",2-s2.0-84908688873

Thus, this study aims to evaluate the risk of WMSDs among the operators of a TFT-LCD manufacturing company in Taiwan by using the subjective questionnaire and ergonomic assessment tools. First, the NMQ survey was conducted among 393 operators, accounting for 94% of all operators in the TFT-LCD plant. The results showed that the prevalence of WMSDs was 31.8%. Among the various body parts, the highest prevalence of WMSDs was found in neck and shoulders (20.4%), while upper limbs were with the lowest prevalence (9.2%). Besides, the prevalence of WMSDs tends to be affected by both work factors and operator factors. Those who were more experienced, working in day shift and involved in the Array process tend to have a higher prevalence of WMSDs. Further, female and domestic operators reported a higher prevalence of WMSDs than male and foreign operators. Moreover, the jobs of 50 employees were analyzed using ergonomic assessment tools including OSHA MSDs, BRIEF, OWAS, 3D SSPP, and NIOSH lifting equation. The findings indicated that inadequate working height, restricted working space, awkward postures, overweight load, and high repetition were the major risk factors of WMSDs. Thus, countermeasures such as redesigning the workstations and material handling carts, proactive training of manual material handling, and providing safety clearance are recommended to enhance the occupational health and safety of the TFT-LCD operators. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",3D SSPP; BRIEF; NIOSH lifting equation; NMQ survey; OSHA MSDs; OWAS,Diseases; Ergonomics; Industrial hygiene; Liquid crystal displays; Manufacture; Materials handling; Musculoskeletal system; Personnel training; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Surveys; Thin film transistors; 3D SSPP; BRIEF; NIOSH lifting equation; OSHA MSDs; OWAS; Occupational risks; adult; arm; Article; body posture; employee; ergonomics; female; health survey; human; industry; major clinical study; male; materials handling; musculoskeletal disease; neck; occupational disease; occupational health; occupational safety; operator; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; shift worker; shoulder; Taiwan; thin film transistor liquid crystal display industry; work related musculoskeletal disorder,2-s2.0-84940056109

WNK1 causes hypertension and hyperkalemia when overexpressed and cardiovascular defects when ablated in mice. In this study, the role of Wnk1 in angiogenesis was explored using the zebrafish model. There are two zebrafish wnk1 isoforms, wnk1a and wnk1b, and both contain all the functional domains found in the human WNK1 protein. Both isoforms are expressed in the embryo at the initiation of angiogenesis and in the posterior cardinal vein (PCV), similar to fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (flt4). Using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides against wnk1a and wnk1b, we observed that wnk1 morphants have defects in angiogenesis in the head and trunk, similar to flk1/vegfr2 morphants. Furthermore, both wnk1a and wnk1b mRNA can partially rescue the defects in vascular formation caused by flk1/vegfr2 knockdown. Mutation of the kinase domain or the Akt/PI3K phosphorylation site within wnk1 destroys this rescue capability. The rescue experiments provide evidence that wnk1 is a downstream target for Vegfr2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2) and Akt/PI3K signaling and thereby affects angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (flk1 /vegfr2 ) or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (flt4/vegfr3) results in a decrease in wnk1a expression, as assessed by in situ hybridization and q-RT-PCR analysis. Thus, the Vegf/Vegfr signaling pathway controls angiogenesis in zebrafish via Akt kinase-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Wnk1 as well as transcriptional regulation of wnk1 expression. ? 2014 Lai et al.",,"antisense oligonucleotide; messenger RNA; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein kinase WNK1; protein kinase WNK1a; protein kinase WNK1b; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; vasculotropin receptor 2; vasculotropin receptor 3; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein serine threonine kinase; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin receptor 2; vasculotropin receptor 3; VEGFR-2 protein, zebrafish; zebrafish protein; adult; amino acid sequence; angiogenesis; animal experiment; article; controlled study; down regulation; embryo; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; female; gene expression regulation; gene silencing; in situ hybridization; intracellular signaling; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; transcription regulation; transgenic zebrafish; wild type; angiogenesis; animal; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); phosphorylation; physiology; signal transduction; zebra fish; Animals; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Phosphorylation; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-84909604309

A pinpoint ionization chamber, Monte Carlo code MCNPX, and treatment planning system are used to evaluate the dose distribution for a single Ir-192 source positioned in the tandem and ovoid. For dose distribution in water with the presence of the tandem, differences among measurement, MCNPX calculation and treatment planning system results are <5%. For dose distribution in water with the presence of the ovoid, the MCNPX result agrees with the measurement. But the doses calculated from treatment planning system are overestimated by up to a factor of 4. This is due to the shielding effect of the metal materials in the applicator not being considered in the treatment planning system. This result suggests that the treatment planning system should take into account corrections for the metal materials of the applicator in order to improve the accuracy of the radiation dose delivered. ? 2014 Wu et al.",,"iridium 192; metal; stainless steel; water; anisotropy; article; brachytherapy; comparative study; equipment design; ionization chamber; materials testing; Monte Carlo method; radiation applicator; radiation dose distribution; radiation shield; radiotherapy planning system; validation process; brachytherapy; devices; human; image quality; radiometry; Brachytherapy; Humans; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiometry; Stainless Steel",2-s2.0-84929138448

Recently, SOX2 was found overexpressed in the majority of the lung squamous cell carcinoma (SQC), in which it acts as a lineage-survival oncogene. However, downstream targets/pathways of SOX2 in lung SQC cells remain to be identified. Here, we show that BMP4 is a downstream target of SOX2 in lung SQC. We found that SOX2-silencing-mediated inhibition of cell growth was accompanied by upregulation of BMP4 mRNA and its protein expression. Meta-analysis with 293 samples and qRT-PCR validation with 73 clinical samples revealed an inversely correlated relationship between levels of SOX2 and BMP4 mRNA, and significantly lower mRNA levels in tumor than in adjacent normal tissues. This was corroborated by immunohistochemistry analysis of 35 lung SQC samples showing lower BMP4 protein expression in tumor tissues. Cell-based experiments including siRNA transfection, growth assay and flow cytometry assay, further combined with a xenograft tumor model in mice, revealed that reactivation of BMP4 signaling could partially account for growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest in lung SQC cells upon silencing SOX2. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that SOX2 could negatively regulate BMP4 promoter activity, possibly through binding to the promoter located in the first intron region of BMP4. Collectively, our findings suggest that BMP4 could act as a tumor suppressor and its downregulation by elevated SOX2 resulting in enhanced growth of lung SQC cells. ? 2014 UICC.",BMP4; lung cancer; lung squamous cell carcinoma; SOX2,"bone morphogenetic protein 4; messenger RNA; transcription factor Sox2; animal experiment; animal model; article; BMP4 gene; cancer growth; cell cycle arrest; cell growth assay; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; down regulation; flow cytometry; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; luciferase assay; lung squamous cell carcinoma; major clinical study; mitosis inhibition; molecular pathology; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; SOX2 gene; tumor xenograft; BMP4; lung cancer; lung squamous cell carcinoma; SOX2; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Databases, Genetic; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Silencing; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Neoplasm Transplantation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Signal Transduction; SOXB1 Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-84902285847

Preventing the formation of this S100P-RAGE complex is an effective strategy to treat various disease conditions. Despite its importance, the detailed structural characterization of the S100P-RAGE complex has not yet been reported. In this study, we report that S100P preferentially binds to the V domain of RAGE. Furthermore, we characterized the interactions between the RAGE V domain and Ca 2+-bound S100P using various biophysical techniques, including isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence spectroscopy, multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, functional assays and site-directed mutagenesis. The entropy-driven binding between the V domain of RAGE and Ca +2-bound S100P was found to lie in the micromolar range (K d of ?6 μM). NMR data-driven HADDOCK modeling revealed the putative sites that interact to yield a proposed heterotetrameric model of the S100P-RAGE V domain complex.

Early-life BPA exposure may impact brain development and contribute to childhood neurological disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate molecular target genes of neuronal development in trans-placental exposure to BPA. Methodology: A meta-analysis of three public microarray datasets was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in exposure to BPA. The candidate genes of neuronal development were identified from gene ontology analysis in a reconstructed neuronal sub-network, and their gene expressions were determined using real-time PCR in 20 umbilical cord blood samples dichotomized into high and low BPA level groups upon the median 16.8 nM. Principal Findings: Among 36 neuronal transcripts sorted from DAVID ontology clusters of 457 DEGs using the analysis of Bioconductor limma package, we found two neuronal genes, sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2) and paired box 6 (Pax6), had preferentially down-regulated expression (Bonferroni correction p-value &lt;10-4 and log2-transformed fold change ?-1.2) in response to BPA exposure. Fetal cord blood samples had the obviously attenuated gene expression of Sox2 and Pax6 in high BPA group referred to low BPA group. Visualized gene network of Cytoscape analysis showed that Sox2 and Pax6 which were contributed to neural precursor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation might be downregulated through sonic hedgehog (Shh), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and Notch signaling. Conclusions: These results indicated that trans-placental BPA exposure down-regulated gene expression of Sox2 and Pax6 potentially underlying the adverse effect on childhood neuronal development. ? 2014 Yang et al.",,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; Notch receptor; sonic hedgehog protein; transcription factor PAX6; transcription factor Sox2; vasculotropin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; endocrine disruptor; eye protein; homeodomain protein; paired box transcription factor; phenol derivative; repressor protein; SOX2 protein, human; transcription factor PAX6; transcription factor Sox; transcriptome; article; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene cluster; gene expression; gene identification; gene ontology; gene targeting; genetic variability; human; human experiment; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system development; normal human; prenatal drug exposure; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; umbilical cord blood; central nervous system; drug effects; embryology; environmental exposure; fetomaternal transfusion; gene regulatory network; genetics; meta analysis; metabolism; pregnancy; Benzhydryl Compounds; Central Nervous System; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Eye Proteins; Female; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Networks; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Paired Box Transcription Factors; Phenols; Pregnancy; Repressor Proteins; SOXB1 Transcription Factors; Transcriptome",2-s2.0-84904694461

In this study, we sought to investigate the prognostic significance of miRNAs in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In a discovery phase, RNA was extracted from 58 OSCC tumor samples and paired normal tissues. MiRNAs expression was evaluated with TaqMan Array Card and TaqMan MicroRNA assays. The prognostic significance of the miRNA signature identified in the discovery phase was validated by qRT-PCR in a replication set consisting of 141 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. We identified a miRNA regulatory network centered on the three hub genes (SP1, MYC, and TP53) that predicted distinct clinical endpoints. Three miRNAs (miR-218, miR-125b, and let-7g) and their downstream response genes had a concordant prognostic significance on disease-free survival and disease-specific survival rates. In addition, patients with a reduced expression of miR-218, miR-125b, and let-7g have a higher risk of poor outcomes in presence of specific risk factors (p-stage III-IV, pT3-4, or pN+).

Besides, the photochemothermal therapy of PGP capsules eradicates tumor cells not only in the light-treating area but also widely light-omitted tumor cells, overcoming the tumor recurrence due to efficient cell killing efficacy.

Direct intracerebral injections of high doses of recombinant glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) have been shown to protect adult nigral dopaminergic neurons. Because GDNF does not cross the blood-brain barrier, intracerebral gene transfer is an ideal option. Chitosan (CHI) is a naturally derived material that has been used for gene transfer. However, the low water solubility often leads to decreased transfection efficiency. Grafting of highly water-soluble polyethylene imines (PEI) and polyethylene glycol onto polymers can increase their solubility. The purpose of this study was to design a non-viral gene carrier with improved water solubility as well as enhanced transfection efficiency for treating Parkinsonism. Two molecular weights (Mw =600 and 1,800 g/mol) of PEI were grafted onto CHI (PEI600-g-CHI and PEI1800-g-CHI, respectively) by opening the epoxide ring of ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EX-810). This modification resulted in a non-viral gene carrier with less cytotoxicity. The transfection efficiency of PEI600-g-CHI/deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polyplexes was significantly higher than either PEI1800-g-CHI/DNA or CHI/DNA polyplexes. The maximal GDNF expression of PEI600-g-CHI/DNA was at the polymer:DNA weight ratio of 10:1, which was 1.7-fold higher than the maximal GDNF expression of PEI1800-g-CHI/DNA. The low toxicity and high transfection efficiency of PEI600-g-CHI make it ideal for application to GDNF gene therapy, which has potential for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. ? 2014 Peng et al.",Chitosan; Gene transfection; Glial cell; Parkinson's disease; Polyethylene imine,chitosan; copolymer; ethylene glycol derivative; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; macrogol; plasmid DNA; poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether; polyethyleneimine; unclassified drug; chitosan; chitosan-graft-polyethylenimine; DNA; drug carrier; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; nanoparticle; polyethyleneimine; article; blood brain barrier; cell viability; confocal laser microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; deacetylation; drug solubility; endosome; gene delivery system; genetic transfection; human; human cell; molecular weight; neuroprotection; Parkinson disease; particle size; plasmid; polymerization; protein expression; transmission electron microscopy; viscosity; zeta potential; analogs and derivatives; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effects; genetics; metabolism; procedures; solubility; toxicity; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Chitosan; DNA; Drug Carriers; Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Humans; Nanoparticles; Polyethyleneimine; Solubility; Transfection,2-s2.0-84903625404

Yet the development of novel drugs against MTB has been lagging. One potentially powerful approach to drug development is computation-aided repositioning of current drugs. However, the effectiveness of this approach has rarely been examined. Here we select the ""TB drugome"" approach - a protein structure-based method for drug repositioning for tuberculosis treatment - to (1) experimentally validate the efficacy of the identified drug candidates for inhibiting MTB growth, and (2) computationally examine how consistently drug candidates are prioritized, considering changes in input data. Twenty three drugs in the TB drugome were tested. Of them, only two drugs (tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen) effectively suppressed MTB growth at relatively high concentrations. Both drugs significantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of three first-line anti-TB drugs (rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol). However, tamoxifen is not a top-listed drug in the TB drugome, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen is not approved for use in humans. Computational re-examination of the TB drugome indicated that the rankings were subject to technical and data-related biases. Thus, although our results support the effectiveness of the TB drugome approach for identifying drugs that can potentially be repositioned for stand-alone applications or for combination treatments for TB, the approach requires further refinements via incorporation of additional biological information. Our findings can also be extended to other structure-based drug repositioning methods. ? 2014 Chen et al.",,"afimoxifene; amantadine; cytarabine; darunavir; dexamethasone; estradiol; ethambutol; fluconazole; indinavir; indometacin; isoniazid; isotretinoin; levothyroxine; liothyronine; lopinavir; methotrexate; nelfinavir; penicillamine; progesterone; propofol; raloxifene; rifampicin; ritonavir; spironolactone; tamoxifen; trimethoprim; afimoxifene; bacterial protein; drug combination; ethambutol; isoniazid; rifampicin; tamoxifen; tuberculostatic agent; antibacterial activity; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug inhibition; drug repositioning; empirical research; methodology; minimum inhibitory concentration; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; tuberculosis; tuberculosis drugome approach; analogs and derivatives; antagonists and inhibitors; antibiotic resistance; drug combination; drug effects; human; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; tuberculosis; Antitubercular Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Drug Combinations; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Ethambutol; Humans; Isoniazid; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Rifampin; Tamoxifen; Tuberculosis",2-s2.0-84903398730

We previously reported that an infectious clone-derived dengue type 4 virus (DENV-4) passaged in MRC-5 cells acquired a Glu345Lys (E-E345K) substitution in the E protein domain III (E-DIII). The same cloned DENV-4 was found to yield a single E-Glu 327Gly (E-E327G) mutation after passage in FRhL cells and cause the loss of immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys. Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate the E-E345K and E-E327G mutants from DENV-4 and DENV-4Δ30 infectious clones and propagated in Vero or MRC-5 cells. The E-E345K mutations were consistently presented in viruses recovered from MRC-5 cells, but not Vero cells. Recombinant E-DIII proteins of E345K and E327G increased heparin binding correlated with the reduced infectivity by heparin treatment in cell cultures. Different from the E-E327G mutant viruses to lose the immunogencity in rhesus monkeys, the E-E345K mutant viruses were able to induce neutralizing antibodies in rhesus monkeys with an almost a 10-fold lower level of viremia as compared to the wild type virus. Monkeys immunized with the E-E345K mutant virus were completely protected with no detectable viremia after live virus challenges with the wild type DENV-4.

Early and rapid diagnosis of the virus is therefore crucial in preventing and controlling any influenza outbreaks. Recently, novel nucleic acid-based affinity reagents called aptamers have emerged as promising candidates for diagnostic assays as they offer several advantages over antibodies, including in vitro selection, chemical synthesis, thermal stability and relatively low costs. Aptamers with high sensitivity and specificity are generated via Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), a process that is currently time-consuming, as well as labor- and resource-intensive. In this study, an integrated microfluidic system was developed and was successfully applied to screen a specific aptamer for the influenza A/H1N1 (InfA/H1N1) virus in an automated and highly efficient manner. The selected aptamer was implemented in a magnetic-bead assay, which demonstrated specific and sensitive detection of the InfA/H1N1 virus, even in biological samples such as throat swabs. Consequently, this specific aptamer presents a promising affinity reagent for clinical diagnosis of InfA/H1N1. This is the first demonstration of screening influenza virus-specific aptamers using the microfluidic SELEX technology, which may be expanded for the rapid screening of aptamers against other pathogens for future biomedical applications. ? 2014 the Partner Organisations.",,"aptamer; plasmid DNA; virus antibody; virus RNA; aptamer; article; atmospheric pressure; binding affinity; controlled study; Dengue virus 2; dissociation constant; DNA extraction; Enterovirus 71; flow cytometry; fluid transport; gel electrophoresis; influenza A (H1N1); Influenza virus A H1N1; Influenza virus A H3N2; laboratory automation; limit of detection; microfluidics; nonhuman; nucleic acid amplification; priority journal; protein secondary structure; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; screening; serum; sputum; throat culture; virus detection; virus strain; chemistry; combinatorial chemistry; devices; genetics; human; Influenza virus A H1N1; Influenza, Human; microfluidic analysis; procedures; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; SELEX Aptamer Technique",2-s2.0-84901019991

The ability to measure human behaviors quantitatively has been a core component and a major research direction in both fields of engineering and psychology - though often with distinct approaches designed for different targeted applications. Engineering methods often strive to achieve high predictive accuracies using behavioral informatics techniques; these techniques employ a combination of behavior measures derived using automated signal based descriptors, and of statistical frameworks modeled using machine learning techniques. These approaches are often distinct from the observational approaches the gold standard for the past three decades in the study of psychology, even in clinical settings. The observational approaches are largely based on human subjective judgments.

Due to multifactorial nature of secondary injury and subsequent complex cellular responses, much of the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study used an adult zebrafish cerebellum injury model to investigate the phenotypes and the secondary injury responses for recovery mechanisms of injured brain. Using the time course microarray analysis, a candidate protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was refined as cerebellar wound healing PPI network by dynamic modeling and big data mining. Pathway enrichment and ontological analysis were incorporated into the refined network to highlight the main molecular scheme of cerebellar wound healing. Several significant pathways, including chemokine, Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases, and axon guidance signaling pathway and their cross-talks through PI3K, PAK2, and PLXNA3 were identified to coordinate for neurogenesis and angiogenesis, which are essential for the restoration of the injured brain. Our finding provides an insight into the molecular restoration mechanisms after traumatic brain injury, and open up new opportunity to devise the treatment for traumatic brain injury in human. ? 2014 Wu et al.",,"chemokine; p21 activated kinase 2; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; plexin; plexin A3; unclassified drug; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; zebrafish protein; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; article; cerebellum cortex; controlled study; microarray analysis; molecular interaction; nerve fiber; nervous system development; nonhuman; ontology; phenotype; protein analysis; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; traumatic brain injury; wound healing; zebra fish; animal; biological model; brain injury; cerebellum; disease model; human; metabolism; pathophysiology; procedures; protein microarray; proteomics; Animals; Brain Injuries; Cerebellum; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neurogenesis; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Protein Array Analysis; Protein Interaction Maps; Proteomics; Signal Transduction; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-84903140739

Hence, identifying the accurate position and the type of CNV is currently a critical issue. There are many tools targeting on detecting CNV regions, constructing haplotype phases on CNV regions, or estimating the numerical copy numbers. However, none of them can do all of the three tasks at the same time. This paper presents a method based on Hidden Markov Model to detect parent specific copy number change on both chromosomes with signals from SNP arrays. A haplotype tree is constructed with dynamic branch merging to model the transition of the copy number status of the two alleles assessed at each SNP locus. The emission models are constructed for the genotypes formed with the two haplotypes. The proposed method can provide the segmentation points of the CNV regions as well as the haplotype phasing for the allelic status on each chromosome. The estimated copy numbers are provided as fractional numbers, which can accommodate the somatic mutation in cancer specimens that usually consist of heterogeneous cell populations. The algorithm is evaluated on simulated data and the previously published regions of CNV of the 270 HapMap individuals. The results were compared with five popular methods: PennCNV, genoCN, COKGEN, QuantiSNP and cnvHap. The application on oral cancer samples demonstrates how the proposed method can facilitate clinical association studies. The proposed algorithm exhibits comparable sensitivity of the CNV regions to the best algorithm in our genome-wide study and demonstrates the highest detection rate in SNP dense regions. In addition, we provide better haplotype phasing accuracy than similar approaches. The clinical association carried out with our fractional estimate of copy numbers in the cancer samples provides better detection power than that with integer copy number states. ? 2014 Lin et al.",,"accuracy; algorithm; allele; article; cancer tissue; chromosome; cluster analysis; controlled study; copy number variation; disease association; gene locus; genotype; haplotype; hidden Markov model; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; mouth cancer; sensitivity analysis; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; somatic mutation; cluster analysis; computer program; DNA microarray; gene dosage; genetics; human chromosome; human genome; mouth tumor; pathology; probability; Algorithms; Alleles; Chromosomes, Human; Cluster Analysis; DNA Copy Number Variations; Gene Dosage; Genome, Human; Haplotypes; Humans; Markov Chains; Mouth Neoplasms; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Software",2-s2.0-84901362868

Later on, HP-NAP was also found to be involved in the protection of H. pylori from DNA damage, supporting the survival of H. pylori under oxidative stress. This protein is highly conserved and expressed by virtually all clinical isolates of H. pylori. The majority of patients infected with H. pylori produced antibodies specific for HP-NAP, suggesting its important role in immunity. In addition to acting as a pathogenic factor by activating the innate immunity through a wide range of human leukocytes, including neutrophils, monocytes, and mast cells, HP-NAP also mediates adaptive immunity through the induction of T helper cell type I responses. The pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of HP-NAP not only make it play an important role in disease pathogenesis but also make it a potential candidate for clinical use. Even though there is no convincing evidence to link HP-NAP to a disease outcome, recent findings supporting the pathogenic role of HP-NAP will be reviewed. In addition, the potential clinical applications of HP-NAP in vaccine development, clinical diagnosis, and drug development will be discussed. ? 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

Detection of autoantibodies targeting the noncollagenous 16A (NC16A) domain of type XVII collagen using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing BP. We have developed a rapid, low-cost, and widely applicable ELISA-based system to detect the NC16A autoimmune antibody and then diagnose and monitor BP disease activity using a piece of filter paper, a wax-printer, and NC16A antigens. Both sera and/or blister fluids from 14 untreated BP patients were analyzed. The control group included healthy volunteers and patients with other blistering disorders such as pemphigus vulgaris. In our established paper-based ELISA (P-ELISA) system, only 2 μL of serum or blister fluid and 70 min were required to detect anti-NC16A autoimmune antibodies. The relative color intensity was significantly higher in the BP group than in the control groups when using either serum (P < 0.05) or blister fluid (P < 0.001) specimens from BP patients. The results of P- ELISA were moderately correlated with the titer of the commercial ELISA kit (MBL, Japan) (rho = 0.5680, P = 0.0011).

By using microcomputed tomography and histology, here we further demonstrated that transplanting the hybrid BV-engineered ASCs into the massive defects (10mm in length) at the femoral diaphysis of NZW rabbits resulted in trabecular bone formation in the interior via endochondral ossification and bone remodeling at 3 months post-transplantation. The progression of bone remodeling gave rise to the resorption of trabecular bone and conspicuous reconstruction of medullary cavity and cortical bone with lamellar structure at 8 months post-transplantation, hence conferring mechanical properties that were comparable to those of nonoperated femora. Importantly, X-ray, positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans, and histopathology revealed no signs of heterotopic bone formation and tumor formation. These data altogether attested that the genetically engineered ASCs and prolonged BMP2/VEGF expression not only healed and remodeled the stringent segmental defects, but also revitalized the defects into living bone tissues that structurally and biomechanically resembled intact bones without appreciable side effects, making it one step closer to translate this technology to the clinical setting. ? 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Computerized tomography; Defects; Endothelial cells; Genetic engineering; Histology; Mechanical properties; Positron emission tomography; Stem cells; Adipose derived stem cells; Bone morphogenetic protein-2; Endochondral ossification; Endothelial growth factor; Long-term tracking; Microcomputed tomography; Positron emission tomography/computed tomographies; Segmental defects; Bone; bone morphogenetic protein 2; vasculotropin; BMP2 protein, human; bone morphogenetic protein 2; vasculotropin A; VEGFA protein, human; adipose derived stem cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bone density; bone mass; bone remodeling; callus; cell engineering; computer assisted emission tomography; controlled study; cortical bone; diaphysis; enchondral ossification; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fracture healing; histochemistry; histology; histopathology; micro-computed tomography; New Zealand white (rabbit); nonhuman; ossification; priority journal; protein expression; trabecular bone; adipocyte; animal; bone remodeling; cell culture; cytology; Femoral Fractures; fracture healing; gene therapy; genetic transfection; genetics; longitudinal study; metabolism; multimodality cancer therapy; physiology; procedures; protein engineering; rabbit; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; treatment outcome; Adipocytes; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Bone Remodeling; Cells, Cultured; Combined Modality Therapy; Femoral Fractures; Fracture Healing; Genetic Therapy; Longitudinal Studies; Protein Engineering; Rabbits; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells; Transfection; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",2-s2.0-84899843689

Combination of Au NRs-mediated PTT and organic photosensitizers-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) were also reported to achieve synergistic PTT and PDT effects on killing cancer cells. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that Au NRs alone can sensitize formation of singlet oxygen (1O2) and exert dramatic PDT effects on complete destrcution of tumors in mice under very low LED/laser doses of single photon NIR (915 nm, &lt;130 mW/cm2) light excitation. By changing the NIR light excitation wavelengths, Au NRs-mediated phototherapeutic effects can be switched from PDT to PTT or combination of both. Both PDT and PTT effects were confirmed by measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat shock protein (HSP 70), singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) sensing, and sodium azide quenching in cellular experiments. In vivo mice experiments further show that the PDT effect via irradiation of Au NRs by 915 nm can destruct the B16F0 melanoma tumor in mice far more effectively than doxorubicin (a clinically used anti-cancer drug) as well as the PTT effect (via irradiation of Au NRs by 780 nm light). In addition, we show that Au NRs can emit single photon-induced fluorescence to illustrate their in vivo locations/distribution. Gold nanorods (Au NRs)-mediated photodynamic therapy effects on destruction of tumors were demonstrated upon single photon NIR light excitation without additional organic photosensitizers, and simultaneously act as fluorescent markers. ? 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Recent studies have reported that ECs reveal distinct markers for molecular pathogenesis, which in turn is linked to the various histological types of ECs. To understand further the molecular events contributing to ECs and endometrial tumorigenesis in general, a more precise identification of cancer-associated molecules and signaling networks would be useful for the detection and monitoring of malignancy, improving clinical cancer therapy, and personalization of treatments.Results: ECs-specific gene co-expression networks were constructed by differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Important pathways and putative cancer hub genes contribution to tumorigenesis of ECs were identified. An elastic-net regularized classification model was built using the cancer hub gene signatures to predict the phenotypic characteristics of ECs. The 19 cancer hub gene signatures had high predictive power to distinguish among three key principal features of ECs: grade, type, and stage. Intriguingly, these hub gene networks seem to contribute to ECs progression and malignancy via cell-cycle regulation, antigen processing and the citric acid (TCA) cycle.Conclusions: The results of this study provide a powerful biomarker discovery platform to better understand the progression of ECs and to uncover potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of ECs. This information might lead to improved monitoring of ECs and resulting improvement of treatment of ECs, the 4th most common of cancer in women. ? 2014 Chou et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Endometrial cancer; Hub gene, TCA cycle; WGCNA, Network analysis",biological marker; citric acid; article; ATP5B gene; aurkb gene; BUB1 gene; cancer classification; cancer grading; cancer growth; cancer staging; carcinogenesis; CDC20 gene; CDC6 gene; cell cycle regulation; cenpa gene; controlled study; E2F2 gene; endometrium cancer; female; FEN1 gene; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; gene ontology; gene regulatory network; genetic analysis; genetic model; human; human tissue; IDH3G gene; KIF20A gene; KIF23 gene; molecularly targeted therapy; NDUFV2 gene; phenotype; PRC1 gene; PSMB3 gene; PSMB7 gene; TP53 gene; citric acid cycle; endometrium tumor; gene regulatory network; genetics; Citric Acid Cycle; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans,2-s2.0-84900857597

In addition, a decrease in catalase activity or accumulation of hydrogen peroxide correlates with cancer metastasis. Recent studies indicate that cathepsin activation and expression can be modulated via H2O2 treatment. However, the actual relationship between catalase and cathepsins is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we found that catalase expression (or activity) was higher, while intracellular and extracellular Cat S, Cat L, and Cat K activities were lower in the non-invasive CL1-0 cells compared to the highly invasive CL1-5 cells. After CL1-0 cells were transfected with catalase-shRNA, the corresponding ROS (H2O2) level and Cat S, Cat L, or Cat K expression (or activity) was up-regulated, accompanied by an increase in cell migration and invasion.

After 10 cycles of isothermal carbonation/calcination at 750°C, the greatest CO2 uptake (0.19g CO2/g sorbent) was that for the sorbent featuring 70wt% of PMMA, which was almost three times higher than that (0.07g CO2/g sorbent) of untreated waste oyster shell. The greater CO2 uptake was likely a result of particle size reduction and afterwards surface basicity enhancement and an increase in the volume of mesopores and macropores. Following simplified life cycle assessment, whose all input values were collected from our experimental results, suggested that a significant CO2 emission reduction along with lesser human health and ecosystems impacts would be achieved immediately once waste is reutilized. Most importantly, the CO2 uptake efficiency must be greater than 20% or sorbents prepared from limestone mining would eventually produce a net positive CO2 emission. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Calcium oxide-based adsorbents; Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration; Life cycle analysis; Poly(methyl methacrylate); Template; Three-dimensional ordered mesoporous (3DOM) materials,Calcium oxide-based adsorbents; Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration; Life cycle analysis; Poly(methyl methacrylate); Template; Three-dimensional ordered mesoporous (3DOM) materials; Adsorption; Air Pollutants; Animal Shells; Animals; Calcium Compounds; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Nanospheres; Ostreidae; Oxides; Particle Size; Polymethyl Methacrylate; Recycling; Surface Properties; Waste Management; Waste Products,2-s2.0-84894124655

We report here a novel non-UV-based technique to quickly micropattern a poly-(ethylene) glycol diacrylate (PEGDA)-based hydrogel on top of modified glass substrates, which were then used to control the growth patterns of breast cancer cells. Previously, the fabrication of micropatterned substrates required relatively complicated steps, which made it impractical for researchers to rapidly and systematically investigate the effects of different cell growth patterns. The technique presented herein operates on the principle of optically-induced electrokinetics (OEKs) and uses computer-generated projection light patterns to dynamically pattern the hydrogel on a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin-film, atop an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate. This technique allows us to pattern lines, circles, pentagons, and more complex shapes in the hydrogel with line widths below 3 μm and thicknesses of up to 6 μm within 8 s by simply controlling the projected illumination pattern and applying an appropriate AC voltage between the two ITO glass substrates. After separating the glass substrates to expose the patterned hydrogel, we experimentally demonstrate that MCF-7 breast cancer cells will adhere to the bare a-Si:H surface, but not to the hydrogel patterned in various geometric shapes and sizes. Theoretical analysis and finite-element model simulations reveal that the dominant OEK forces in our technique are the dielectrophoresis (DEP) force and the electro-osmosis force, which enhance the photo-initiated cross-linking reaction in the hydrogel. Our preliminary cultures of breast cancer cells demonstrate that this reported technique could be applied to effectively confine the growth of cancer cells on a-Si:H surfaces and affect individual cell geometry during their growth. ?

Therefore, the simultaneous induction of cancer-specific CTLs and reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment may be more effectively achieved through a single therapeutic vaccine. A recombinant lipoprotein with intrinsic Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist activity containing a mutant form of E7 (E7m) and a bacterial lipid moiety (rlipo-E7m) has been demonstrated to induce robust CTL responses against small tumors. This treatment in combination with other TLR agonists is able to eliminate large tumors.Methods: Mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were employed to determine the synergistic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon combination of rlipo-E7m and other TLR agonists. Antigen-specific CTL responses were investigated using immunospots or in vivo cytolytic assays after immunization in mice. Mice bearing various tumor sizes were used to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of the formulation. Specific subpopulations of immunosuppressive cells in the tumor infiltrate were quantitatively determined by flow cytometry.Results: We demonstrate that a TLR9 agonist (unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, CpG ODN) enhances CTL responses and eradicates large tumors when combined with rlipo-E7m. Moreover, combined treatment with rlipo-E7m and CpG ODN effectively increases tumor infiltration by CTLs and reduces the numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment.Conclusion: These findings suggest that the dramatic anti-tumor effects of the recombinant lipoprotein together with CpG ODN may reflect the amplification of CTL responses and the repression of the immunosuppressive environment. This promising approach could be applied for the development of additional therapeutic cancer vaccines. ? 2014 Chang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Human papillomavirus; Immunotherapy; Innate receptor; Vaccine,"antineoplastic agent; CpG oligodeoxynucleotide; cytokine; recombinant lipoprotein; toll like receptor 9 agonist; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; article; cancer immunization; controlled study; cytokine production; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; dendritic cell; female; flow cytometry; human; human cell; in vivo study; mouse; mutant; nonhuman; regulatory T lymphocyte; suppressor cell; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor immunity; tumor microenvironment; tumor volume; uterine cervix cancer; Animals; Cancer Vaccines; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Flow Cytometry; Lipoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Recombinant Proteins; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; Toll-Like Receptor 9; Tumor Microenvironment; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84899535581

COX-2 expression in response to diverse stimuli is tightly controlled to avoid persistent overexpression. 5-methoxyindole metabolites of L-tryptophan represent a new class of compounds that control COX-2 expression at the transcriptional level. Two of the metabolites, the newly discovered 5-methoxytryptophan (5-MTP, also known as cytoguardin) and N-acetyl 5-methoxytryptamine (melatonin) are the focus of this review. 5-MTP is produced by mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts via 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). It inhibits COX-2 transcriptional activation induced by diverse proinflammatory and mitogenic factors. Cancer cells are deficient in cytoguardin production which contributes to COX-2 overexpression. Fibroblast-generated 5-MTP is capable of restoring the control of COX-2 overexpression in cancer cells. 5-MTP blocks cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and inhibits tumor growth and cancer metastasis in a xenograft model. Melatonin possesses similar COX-2 suppressing and anti-cancer properties albeit at supra-pharmacological concentrations. By contrast, 5-hydroxyindole metabolites of L-tryptophan such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), 5-hydroxytryptophol and other serotonin catabolites do not control COX-2 expression. 5-hydroxytryptophan inhibits COX-2 expression through conversion to 5-MTP. The physiological relevance of 5-MTP as an endogenous regulator of inflammation and cancer metastasis remains to be investigated.

Thus, understanding the molecular and cellular control of neurite outgrowth will benefit patients with neurological diseases. We have previously shown that overexpression of the signaling adaptor protein SH2B1β promotes fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1)-induced neurite outgrowth (W. F. Lin, C. J. Chen, Y. J. Chang, S. L. Chen, I. M. Chiu, and L. Chen, Cell. Signal. 21:1060 -1072, 2009). SH2B1β also undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and regulates a subset of neurotrophin-induced genes. Although these findings suggest that SH2B1β regulates gene expression, the nuclear role of SH2B1β was not known. In this study, we show that SH2B1β interacts with the transcription factor, signal transducer, and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in neuronal PC12 cells, cortical neurons, and COS7 fibroblasts. By affecting the subcellular distribution of STAT3, SH2B1β increased serine phosphorylation and the concomitant transcriptional activity of STAT3. As a result, overexpressing SH2B1β enhanced FGF1-induced expression of STAT3 target genes Egr1 and Cdh2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further reveal that, in response to FGF1, overexpression of SH2B1β promotes the in vivo occupancy of STAT3-Sp1 heterodimers at the promoter of Egr1 and Cdh2. These findings establish a central role of SH2B1β in orchestrating signaling events to transcriptional activation through interacting and regulating STAT3-containing complexes during neuronal differentiation. ? 2014, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Animals; Cadherins; Carrier Proteins; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cercopithecus aethiops; COS Cells; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Fibroblast Growth Factor 1; Gene Expression; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neurons; PC12 Cells; Phosphorylation; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic",2-s2.0-84894282317

EV71 virus-like particle (VLP) is the empty capsid consisting of viral structural proteins but can elicit potent immune responses, rendering VLP a promising EV71 vaccine candidate. To evaluate whether VLP remains stable after long-term storage, which is crucial for advancing the VLP vaccine to the clinical setting, we evaluated the effects of NaCl concentration, buffers and temperatures on the VLP stability. We first validated the use of dynamic light scattering (DLS) for measuring the hydrodynamic diameter (?30-35nm) of VLP, which was close to the VLP diameter (?25-27nm) as measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using these techniques, we found that EV71 VLP remained stable for 5 months in sodium phosphate (NaPi) buffers with various NaCl concentrations. EV71 VLP also remained morphologically stable in NaPi, citrate and TE+ buffers for 5 months, yet the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that the VLP stored in citrate and TE+ buffers partially lost the immunogenicity after 5 months. In contrast, the VLP stored in the NaPi buffer at 4°C remained stable macroscopically and microscopically for 5 months, as judged from the DLS, TEM and ELISA. The VLP stored at 25°C and 37°C also retained stability for 1 month, which would obviate the need of a cold chain during the shipping. These data altogether proved the stability of EV71 VLP and suggested that the VLP is amenable to bioprocessing and storage. ? 2013 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.",Baculovirus; Enterovirus 71; Insect cell; Stability; Virus-like particle,"Baculovirus; Enterovirus 71; Insect cell; Stability; Virus-like particle; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Cell Line; Enterovirus; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Insects; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Particle Size; Protein Stability; Sodium Chloride; Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle; Viral Structural Proteins; Viral Vaccines",2-s2.0-84893798501

Recent studies indicated that the aging, human neurodegenerative diseases and cancers resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction and OS. The purpose of this study is to provide a probabilistic risk assessment model to quantify the atmospheric diesel exhaust particles (DEP)-induced pre-cancer biomarker response and cancer incidence risk for residents in south Taiwan. We conducted entirely monthly particulate matter sampling data at five sites in Kaohsiung of south Taiwan in the period 2002-2003. Three findings were found: (i) the DEP dose estimates and cancer risk quantification had heterogeneously spatiotemporal difference in south Taiwan, (ii) the pre-cancer DNA damage biomarker and cancer incidence estimates had a positive yet insignificant association, and (iii) all the estimates of cancer incidence in south Taiwan populations fell within and slight lower than the values from previous cancer epidemiological investigations. In this study, we successfully assessed the tumor incidence for residents posed by DEP exposure in south Taiwan compared with the epidemiological approach. Our approach provides a unique way for assessing human health risk for residences exposed to atmospheric DEP depending on specific combinations of local and regional conditions. Our work implicates the importance of incorporating both environmental and health risk impacts into models of air pollution exposure to guide adaptive mitigation strategies. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Diesel exhaust particles; DNA damage; Particulate matter; Probabilistic risk assessment; Tumor incidence,Air pollution exposures; Diesel exhaust particles; DNA damages; Environmental and health risks; Mitigation strategy; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Particulate Matter; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Air pollution; DNA; Estimation; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Risk assessment; Tumors; Diseases; biological marker; adaptive management; atmospheric pollution; biomarker; cancer; data set; diesel engine; disease incidence; dose-response relationship; exhaust emission; genotoxicity; health impact; health risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; resident population; risk assessment; temporal analysis; tumor; air pollutant; air pollution; article; atmospheric dispersion; cancer incidence; cancer risk; controlled study; diesel exhaust particle; DNA damage; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; health hazard; human; particulate matter; precancer; priority journal; risk assessment; Taiwan; Kaohsiung; Taiwan,2-s2.0-84891113129

It is often stated in the literature that a nanomaterial is non-toxic and biocompatible. In this study, we show that the short term cytotoxicity of a nanomaterial is determined by the surface functionality, rather than the core nanomaterial. A so-called ""non-toxic and biocompatible"" nanomaterial, such as core/shell iron-filled carbon nanoparticles (Fe@CNPs) and nanodiamonds (NDs), can become cytotoxic when a cationic surface functionality, such as imidazolium (IM) and tertiary methyl ammonium ethyl methacrylate (TMAEA) moieties, was grafted onto the surface. To investigate the contributions of surface functionalities and the core nanomaterials on cytotoxicity, two ""non-toxic and biocompatible"" Fe@CNPs and NDs were surface-modified with different surface functionalities, including anionic COOH, zwitterionic PVP, neutral OH, cationic IM and TMAEA, and investigated for their cytotoxicities in both in vitro cancer cells (HeLa and U-87MG cells) and in vivo embryo development of zebrafish. Among these surface functionalities, cationic IM and TMAEA functionalities of both Fe@CNPs and NDs cause acute cytotoxicity to a similar extent in the in vitro cancer cell experiments, as well as affect severely the embryonic development and survival rates of zebrafish. Other surface functionalities do not show particularly strong cytotoxicities. To obtain information regarding the origins of cytotoxicities, the effects of surface functionalities were also examined on the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, cellular ROS generation, apoptosis, and changes in lysosomal membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, the intracellular pH (pH i), and cell cycles. Our results clearly point out that surface functionality, rather than the core nanomaterials, plays a critical role in dictating the short-term cytotoxicities. ? 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Carbon nano-materials; Carbon Nano-Particles; Embryonic development; Ethyl methacrylates; Lactate dehydrogenase; Mitochondrial membrane potential; Photothermal therapy; Surface functionalities; Biocompatibility; Carbon; Cell death; Magnetic resonance imaging; Nanodiamonds; Nanostructured materials; Cytotoxicity,2-s2.0-84893460847

However, iAs has not been adequately studied in the general population with respect to iAs exposure during pregnancy and its impact on the health status of newborns. The aims of this study were to 1) elucidate the association between arsenic exposure and oxidative/methylated DNA damage in pregnant women, and 2) determine the association with birth outcomes. A birth cohort study of 299 pregnant mother-newborn pairs was recruited during 2001-2002 in Taiwan. We collected maternal urine samples during the 3rd trimester for measuring iAs and its metabolites. We used high-performance liquid chromatography/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) for quantifications of the arsenic species. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) was used to measure the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′- deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and N7- methylguanosine (N7-MeG) DNA damage biomarkers. Birth outcomes were collected to assess the associations with maternal arsenic exposure and the DNA damage biomarkers. Multiple regression analyses showed that maternal urinary iAs had positive associations with the methylated N7-MeG (beta = 0.35, p&lt;0.001) and oxidative 8-oxodG (beta = 0.24, p&lt;0.001) DNA damage biomarkers, and a decreased one-minute (1-min) Apgar score (beta = -0.23, p = 0.041). Maternal N7-MeG was also associated with a decreased 1-min Apgar score (beta = -0.25, p = 0.042). Mutual adjustment for iAs and N 7-MeG showed an independent and significant prediction for a decreased 1-min Apgar score of iAs (beta = -0.28, p = 0.036). Maternal iAs exposure was associated with both maternal DNA damage and adverse newborn health. Maternal N7-MeG levels might be a novel biomarker for monitoring fetal health related to iAs. ? 2014 Chou et al.",,"7 methylguanosine; 8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine; arsenic; biological marker; 8-oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine; arsenic; biological marker; deoxyguanosine; oxygen; Apgar score; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlation coefficient; covariance; DNA damage; DNA methylation; environmental exposure; female; health status; high performance liquid chromatography; human; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; mass spectrometry; metabolite; multiple linear regression analysis; multiple regression; newborn; population; prediction; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; quantitative analysis; sex difference; Taiwan; third trimester pregnancy; urinalysis; adult; analogs and derivatives; animal; chemistry; liquid chromatography; methylation; pregnancy; tandem mass spectrometry; toxicity; urine; Adult; Animals; Arsenic; Biological Markers; Chromatography, Liquid; Cohort Studies; Deoxyguanosine; DNA Damage; DNA Methylation; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Exposure; Methylation; Oxygen; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Taiwan; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",2-s2.0-84897791444

We confirmed that the cells still expressed pluripotent markers, had the ability to differentiate into three germ layers, and maintained a normal karyotype after 10 passages of subculture. Next, we reported an efficient protocol for deriving nearly 86% definitive endoderm cells from hESCs under serum-free conditions. Moreover, we were able to obtain insulin-producing cells within 21 days following a simple three-step protocol. The results of immunocytochemical and quantitative gene expression analysis showed that the efficiency of induction was not significantly different between the Synthemax surface and the Matrigel-coated surface.

The first was to develop an hDHODH pharma-similarity index approach (PhSIA) using integrated molecular dynamics calculations, pharmacophore hypothesis, and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) contour information techniques. The approach, for the discovery and design of novel inhibitors, was based on 25 diverse known hDHODH inhibitors. Three statistical methods were used to verify the performance of hDHODH PhSIA. Fischer's cross-validation test provided a 98% confidence level and the goodness of hit (GH) test score was 0.61. The q2, r2, and predictive r2 values were 0.55, 0.97, and 0.92, respectively, for a partial least squares validation method. In our approach, each diverse inhibitor structure could easily be aligned with contour information, and common substructures were unnecessary. For our second aim, we used the proposed approach to design 13 novel hDHODH inhibitors using a scaffold-hopping strategy. Chemical features of the approach were divided into two groups, and the Vitas-M Laboratory fragment was used to create de novo inhibitors. This approach provides a useful tool for the discovery and design of potential inhibitors of hDHODH, and does not require docking analysis; thus, our method can assist medicinal chemists in their efforts to identify novel inhibitors. ? 2014 Shih et al.",,"dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor; dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; enzyme inhibitor; oxidoreductase; article; comparative molecular similarity indices analysis; controlled study; drug conformation; drug design; drug structure; human; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; pharma similarity index approach; pharmacophore; predictive value; quantitative structure activity relation; static electricity; statistical analysis; validation study; antagonists and inhibitors; chemical structure; chemistry; hydrogen bond; IC50; metabolism; reproducibility; Drug Design; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Hydrogen Bonding; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors; Reproducibility of Results",2-s2.0-84895146144

A new two-section needle-array apparatus was further demonstrated to encompass the tumor to prevent the tumor cells to spread after the treatment process. By using the needle-array insertion apparatus, there is no limitation of the treatment area; this method could, therefore, be applied for tumors that are larger than 6 cm. It was first successfully demonstrated in the in vitro experiments on porcine livers. Then an in vivo experiment was directly conducted on pigs.

Accordingly, rattus cardiomyocytes were treated with H2O2 as a heart ischemia reperfusion model prior to incubation with/without 5-MTP and proteomic analysis was performed to investigate the physiologic protection of 5-MTP in H2O2-induced ischemia reperfusion in cardiomyocyte. Our data demonstrated that 5-MTP treatment does protect cardiomyocyte in the ROS-induced ischemia reperfusion model. 5-MTP has also been shown to significantly facilitate cell migration and wound healing via cytoskeletal regulations. Additionally, two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) analysis showed that 5-MTP might modulate growth-associated proteins, cytoskeleton regulation, redox regulation and protein folding to stimulate wound healing as well as prevent these ischemia reperfusion-damaged cardiomyocytes from cell death through maintaining cellular redox-balance and reducing ER-stress.

The GII.4 subtype was predominant and could be divided further into the 2004 (Hunter), 2006b, and 2010 (New Orleans) subtypes. Regarding clinical manifestations, convulsive disorder occurred only in cases caused by NoV GII.4 2006b. Patients affected by NoV GII.4 2006b presented with a higher frequency of diarrhea (P=0.0204), longer duration of diarrhea (P=0.0215), more frequent hypoglycemia (P=0.038), and electrolyte imbalance (P=0.0487) than acute gastroenteritis caused by NoV GII.4 2010.

Dose distributions were calculated for the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with the intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Ten NPC IMRT plans were evaluated by comparing their dose distributions with those obtained from the in-house MBMC programs for the same CT images and beam geometry. To reconstruct the fluence distribution of the IMRT field, an efficiency map was obtained by dividing the energy fluence of the intensity modulated field by that of the open field, both acquired from an aS1000 electronic portal imaging device. The integrated image of the non-gated mode was used to acquire the full dose distribution delivered during the IMRT treatment. This efficiency map redistributed the particle weightings of the open field phase-space file for IMRT applications. Dose differences were observed in the tumor and air cavity boundary. The mean difference between MBMC and TPS in terms of the planning target volume coverage was 0.6% (range: 0.0-2.3%). The mean difference for the conformity index was 0.01 (range: 0.0-0.01). In conclusion, the MBMC method serves as an independent IMRT dose verification tool in a clinical setting. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Anisotropic analytical algorithm; Intensity modulated radiotherapy; Measurement-based Monte Carlo simulation; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Anisotropic analytical algorithms; Electronic portal imaging devices; Intensity modulated radiation therapy; Intensity-modulated radiotherapy; Measurement-based; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Planning target volumes; Radiotherapy treatment planning; Algorithms; Anisotropy; Computerized tomography; Patient monitoring; Phase space methods; Physical therapy; Radiotherapy; Monte Carlo methods; accuracy; algorithm; anisotropy; article; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; electronics; energy; gated imaging; geometry; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; measurement; Monte Carlo method; nasopharynx carcinoma; radiation beam; radiation dose distribution; treatment planning,2-s2.0-84889600002

Here, we devised Functional Module Connectivity Map (FMCM) for the discovery of repurposed drug compounds for systems treatment of complex diseases, and applied it to colorectal adenocarcinoma. FMCM used multiple functional gene modules to query the Connectivity Map (CMap). The functional modules were built around hub genes identified, through a gene selection by trend-of-disease-progression (GSToP) procedure, from condition-specific gene-gene interaction networks constructed from sets of cohort gene expression microarrays. The candidate drug compounds were restricted to drugs exhibiting predicted minimal intracellular harmful side effects. We tested FMCM against the common practice of selecting drugs using a genomic signature represented by a single set of individual genes to query CMap (IGCM), and found FMCM to have higher robustness, accuracy, specificity, and reproducibility in identifying known anti-cancer agents. Among the 46 drug candidates selected by FMCM for colorectal adenocarcinoma treatment, 65% had literature support for association with anti-cancer activities, and 60% of the drugs predicted to have harmful effects on cancer had been reported to be associated with carcinogens/immune suppressors. Compounds were formed from the selected drug candidates where in each compound the component drugs collectively were beneficial to all the functional modules while no single component drug was harmful to any of the modules. In cell viability tests, we identified four candidate drugs: GW-8510, etacrynic acid, ginkgolide A, and 6-azathymine, as having high inhibitory activities against cancer cells. Through microarray experiments we confirmed the novel functional links predicted for three candidate drugs: phenoxybenzamine (broad effects), GW-8510 (cell cycle), and imipenem (immune system). We believe FMCM can be usefully applied to repurposed drug discovery for systems treatment of other types of cancer and other complex diseases. ? 2014 Chung et al.",,"6 azathymine; 8 azaguanine; alsterpaullone; antineoplastic agent; apigenin; camptothecin; chrysin; cycloserine; daunorubicin; doxazosin; ellipticine; etacrynic acid; ginkgolide A; gw 8510; ifenprodil; imipenem; luteolin; medrysone; meticrane; phenoxybenzamine; phthalylsulfathiazole; pyrvinium embonate; RNA; sulconazole; thapsigargin; thioguanosine; thiostrepton; trifluoperazine; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vorinostat; accuracy; article; cancer cell; cancer cell line; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation assay; cell viability; clinical article; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; functional module connectivity map; gene expression; gene identification; gene interaction; genetic analysis; genetic procedures; human; human cell; microarray analysis; RNA extraction; Adenocarcinoma; Algorithms; Colorectal Neoplasms; Drug Repositioning; Epistasis, Genetic; Ethacrynic Acid; Gene Regulatory Networks; Ginkgolides; Humans; Imipenem; Indoles; Lactones; Microarray Analysis; Phenoxybenzamine; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thymine",2-s2.0-84900341330

In the present study, we fed a water extract of gardenia to steroid-induced insulin-resistant (SIIR) rats and observed changes in signaling proteins in order to elucidate the mechanisms of the insulin-sensitizing effect of GJ and evaluate its possibility as an insulin-sensitizing agent.Methods: Normal Wistar rats were randomly divided into a control group (i.e., saline) and experimental groups (GJ 100 and 200 mg/kg). Blood samples were taken at 0, 30, and 60 min for plasma glucose assay in order to determine the optimal dose to induce the hypoglycemic effect. SIIR rats were then randomly divided into a control group (i.e., saline) and an experimental group (optimal dose of gardenia extract) to observe the insulin-sensitizing effect of the extract. Finally, western blot analysis was performed to detect intracellular signaling proteins to elucidate the mechanisms of the insulin-sensitization effect of GJ.Results: The normal Wistar rats in the GJ 200 mg/kg group exhibited significant hypoglycemic activity. Meanwhile, the SIIR rats had higher plasma glucose levels than normal rats. There was no obvious change in insulin level, but the insulin sensitivity index and homeostasis model assessment index were significantly elevated. Meanwhile, a significant hypoglycemic effect was observed with GJ 200 mg/kg. In addition, intracellular signaling proteins including insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) were elevated in muscle cells.Conclusions: The optimal dose of GJ aqueous extract of 200 mg/kg exerts a PPARγ-activating hypoglycemic effect and improves insulin resistance in SIIR rats.

Here, we show that JMJD5 is up-regulated by hypoxia and is crucial for hypoxiainduced cell proliferation. JMJD5 interacts directly with pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme (PKM)2 to modulate metabolic flux in cancer cells. The JMJD5-PKM2 interaction resides at the intersubunit interface region of PKM2, which hinders PKM2 tetramerization and blocks pyruvate kinase activity. This interaction also influences translocation of PKM2 into the nucleus and promotes hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1α-mediated transactivation. JMJD5 knockdown inhibits the transcription of the PKM2-HIF-1α target genes involved in glucose metabolism, resulting in a reduction of glucose uptake and lactate secretion in cancer cells. JMJD5, along with PKM2 and HIF-1α, is recruited to the hypoxia response element site in the lactate dehydrogenase A and PKM2 loci and mediates the recruitment of the latter two proteins.

Endothelin 1 (Edn1) has been identified as a gene that is significantly up-regulated in HBx-induced HCC in mice. In this study, we further investigated the role of edn1 in hepatocarcinogenesis using a transgenic zebrafish model and a cell culture system. Liver-specific edn1 expression caused steatosis, fibrosis, glycogen accumulation, bile duct dilation, hyperplasia, and HCC in zebrafish. Overexpression of EDN1 in 293T cells enhanced cell proliferation and cell migration in in vitro and xenotransplantation assays and was accompanied with up-regulation of several cell cycle/proliferation- and migration-specific genes. Furthermore, expression of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathwayrelated mediators, such as spliced XBP1, ATF6, IRE1, and PERK, was also up-regulated at both the RNA and protein levels. In the presence of an EDN1 inhibitor or an AKT inhibitor, these increases were diminished and the EDN1-induced migration ability also was disappeared, suggesting that the EDN1 effects act through activation of the AKT pathway to enhance the UPR and subsequently activate the expression of downstream genes. Additionally, p-AKT is enhanced in the edn1 transgenic fish compared to the GFP-mCherry control. The micro RNA miR-1 was found to inhibit the expression of EDN1. We also observed an inverse correlation between EDN1 and miR-1 expression in HCC patients. In conclusion, our data suggest that EDN1 plays an important role in HCC progression by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and is regulated by miR-1. ? 2014 Lu et al.",,"activating transcription factor 6; endothelin 1; fluorescent dye; glycogen; mCherry; microRNA 1; protein IRE1; protein kinase; protein kinase B; protein PERK; RNA; unclassified drug; X box binding protein 1; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bile duct dilatation; cancer growth; cancer patient; cell culture; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; embryo; fatty liver; gene expression regulation; glycogen metabolism; in vitro study; liver cancer; liver carcinogenesis; liver fibrosis; liver hyperplasia; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; RNA splicing; signal transduction; tissue specificity; transgenic animal; unfolded protein response; upregulation; xenotransplantation; zebra fish; Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Endothelin-1; Fatty Liver; Gene Expression; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Unfolded Protein Response; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-84896916006

Findings. We constructed two knockout mutants of K. pneumoniae to investigate how perturbations to capsule biosynthesis alter the cellular phenotype. In the first mutant, we deleted the entire gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of the extracellular polysaccharide capsule. In the second mutant, we deleted the capsule export subsystem within this cluster. We find that both knockout mutants have lower amounts of capsule but produce greater amounts of biofilm. Moreover, one of the two mutants abolishes fimbriae expression as well.

Identification of new molecular targets is clearly needed to improve therapeutic outcomes of this devastating human disease. Activating mutations in K-Ras oncogene and increased expression of FOXM1 protein are associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Transgenic expression of activated KrasG12D in mouse respiratory epithelium is sufficient to induce lung adenocarcinomas; however, transcriptional mechanisms regulated by K-Ras during the initiation of lung cancer remain poorly understood. Foxm1 transcription factor, a downstream target of K-Ras, stimulates cellular proliferation during embryogenesis, organ repair and tumor growth, but its role in tumor initiation is unknown. In the present study, we used transgenic mice expressing KrasG12D under control of Sftpc promoter to demonstrate that Foxm1 was induced in type II epithelial cells before the formation of lung tumors. Conditional deletion of Foxm1 from KrasG12D-expressing respiratory epithelium prevented the initiation of lung tumors in vivo. The loss of Foxm1 inhibited expression of K-Ras target genes critical for the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, including Ikbkb, Nfkb1, Nfkb2, Rela, Jnk1, N-Myc, Pttg1 and Cdkn2a. Transgenic overexpression of activated FOXM1 mutant was sufficient to induce expression of these genes in alveolar type II cells. FOXM1 directly bound to promoter regions of Ikbkb, Nfkb2, N-Myc, Pttg1 and Cdkn2a, indicating that these genes are direct FOXM1 targets.

Around nasopharyngeal cavity, there exists many small volume organs-at-risk (OARs) such as the optic nerves, auditory nerves, cochlea, and semicircular canal which necessitate the use of a high definition phantom for accurate and correct dose evaluation. The aim of this research was to study the advantages of using an HD phantom for MBMC simulation in NPC patients treated with IMRT. The MBMC simulation in this study was based on the IMRT treatment plan of three NPC patients generated by the anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) of the Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using a calculation grid of 2 mm2. The NPC tumor was treated to a cumulative dose of 7000 cGy in 35 fractions using the shrinking-field sequential IMRT (SIMRT) method. The BEAMnrc MC Code was used to simulate a Varian EX21 linear accelerator treatment head. The HD phantom contained 0.5 x 0.5 x 1 mm3 voxels for the nasopharyngeal area and 0.5 x 0.5 x 3 mm3 for the rest of the head area. An efficiency map was obtained for the amorphous silicon aS1000 electronic portal imaging device (EPID) to adjust the weighting of each particle in the phase-space file for each IMRT beam. Our analysis revealed that small volume organs such as the eighth cranial nerve, semicircular canal, cochlea and external auditory canal showed an absolute dose difference of ?200 cGy, while the dose difference for larger organs such as the parotid glands and tumor was negligible for the MBMC simulation using the HD phantom. The HD phantom was found to be suitable for Monte Carlo dose volume analysis of small volume organs. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

With their carcinogenesis relevance values (CRVs), we identified 152 and 50 significant proteins and their PPI networks (network markers) for early and late stage bladder cancer by statistical assessment. To investigate the evolution of network biomarkers in the carcinogenesis process, primary pathway analysis showed that the significant pathways of early stage bladder cancer are related to ordinary cancer mechanisms, while the ribosome pathway and spliceosome pathway are most important for late stage bladder cancer. Their only intersection is the ubiquitin mediated proteolysis pathway in the whole stage of bladder cancer. The evolution of network biomarkers from early to late stage can reveal the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer.

The number of B cells did not differ between essential thrombocythaemia patients, irrespective of the presence of Janus activated kinase-2 V617F mutation or wild type, and age-matched healthy adults. However, the number of IL-1beta/IL-6-producing B cells was significantly higher in essential thrombocythaemia patients than that in healthy controls. The relatively high level of IL-1beta/IL-6 production by B cells was associated with serum B cell-activating factor and expression of Toll-like receptor 4 on B cells. A high level of B cell-activating factor was present in essential thrombocythaemia patients with both Janus activated kinase-2 genotypes. Incubation with B cell-activating factor enhanced the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 on B cells. IL-1beta and IL-6 production was not stimulated by B cell-activating factor alone; Toll-like receptor 4 was activated by lipopolysaccharide or patients’ sera to produce IL-1beta and IL-6 in B cells. Moreover, essential thrombocythaemia patient B cells facilitated megakaryocyte differentiation when co-cultured with CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells.

The clinical antitumor action of gefitinib is primarily the inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Gefitinib is indicated as a first-line therapy for lung cancer, although the occurrence of chemoresistance limits the longterm results of this drug. This study was divided into two research directions. The first part is to generate the drug-resistant cancer cell line as a platform to understand the mechanism of drug inactivation of gefitinib for lung cancer. The second part is to collect cell secretomes to findpotential biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer by using minimally invasive assays. Therefore, the non-small-cell lung carcinoma line PC9 and gefitinib-resistant cancer cell line PC9/gef were used in this study.

The purpose of this study was to simulate the physiological condition of diabetes in the human body by culturing human microvascular endothelial cell 1 (HMEC-1) cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5.5mM glucose, 25mM glucose, and 50mM glucose. The cell viability of HMEC-1 cells at the indicated glucose concentrations was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The specific epithelial cell junction N-cadherin was measured by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, monocytic initiation of inflammatory reactions was studied by using Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Based on our results, hyperglycemia treatment influenced the distribution of N-cadherin-containing structures in HMEC-1 cells, whereas the change of the inflammatory profiles in HMEC-1 cells was affected after their coculture with the supernatant of diabetic THP-1 monocytes. In this study, we conclude that the removal of endothelial N-cadherin caused by hyperglycemia (at the 25mM glucose and 50mM glucose concentrations) may lead to endothelial dysfunction and subsequently endothelial cell death in the late stage of diabetes.

Substantial efficiency gains can be achieved by incorporating the information about the truncation time distribution in the estimation procedure [Wang (1989) Journal of the American Statistical Association 84, 742-748; Wang (1996) Biometrika 83, 343-354]. Under the semiparametric transformation models, the maximum likelihood method is expected to be fully efficient, yet it is difficult to implement because the full likelihood depends on the nonparametric component in a complicated way. Moreover, its asymptotic properties have not been established. In this article, we extend the martingale estimating equation approach [Chen et al. (2002) Biometrika 89, 659-668; Kim et al. (2013) Journal of the American Statistical Association 108, 217-227] and the pseudo-partial likelihood approach [Severini and Wong (1992) The Annals of Statistics 4, 1768-1802; Zucker (2005) Journal of the American Statistical Association 100, 1264-1277] for semiparametric transformation models with right-censored data to handle left-truncated and right-censored data. In the same spirit of the composite likelihood method [Huang and Qin (2012) Journal of the American Statistical Association 107, 946-957], we further construct another set of unbiased estimating equations by exploiting the special probability structure of length-biased sampling. Thus the number of estimating equations exceeds the number of parameters, and efficiency gains can be achieved by solving a simple combination of these estimating equations. The proposed methods are easy to implement as they do not require additional programming efforts. Moreover, they are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of HBV tumorigenesis, including inflammation and liver regeneration associated with cytotoxic immune injuries and transcriptional activators of mutant HBV gene products. The mutant viral oncoprotein-driven tumorigenesis is prevailed at the advanced stage or anti-HBe-positive phase of chronic HBV infection. Besides HBx, the pre-S2 (deletion) mutant protein represents a newly recognized oncoprotein that is accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and manifests as type II ground glass hepatocytes (GGH). The retention of pre-S2 mutant protein in ER can induce ER stress and initiate an ER stress-dependent VEGF/Akt/mTOR and NFκB/ COX-2 signal pathway. Additionally, the pre-S2 mutant large surface protein can induce an ER stress-independent pathway to transactivate JAB-1/p27/RB/cyclin A,D pathway, leading to growth advantage of type II GGH. The pre-S2 mutant protein-induced ER stress can also cause DNA damage, centrosome overduplication, and genomic instability. In 5-10% of type II GGHs, there is co-expression of pre-S2 mutant protein and HBx antigen which exhibited enhanced oncogenic effects in transgenic mice. The mTOR signal cascade is consistently activated throughout the course of pre-S2 mutant transgenic livers and in human HCC tissues, leading to metabolic disorders and HCC tumorigenesis. Clinically, the presence of pre-S2 deletion mutants in sera frequently develop resistance to nucleoside analogues anti-virals and predict HCC development. The pre-S2 deletion mutants and type II GGHs therefore represent novel biomarkers of HBV-related HCCs. A versatile DNA array chip has been developed to detect pre-S2 mutants in serum. Overall, the presence of pre-S2 mutants in serum has implications for anti-viral treatment and can predict HCC development. Targeting at pre-S2 mutant protein-induced, ER stress-dependent, mTOR signal cascade and metabolic disorders may offer potential strategy for chemoprevention or therapy in high risk chronic HBV carriers. ? 2014 Su et al.",Chronic hbv infection; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; Ground glass hepatocytes; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Pre-S mutants,"mutant protein; antiviral resistance; cancer risk; chemoprophylaxis; deletion mutant; DNA damage; DNA microarray; endoplasmic reticulum stress; genomic instability; Hepatitis B virus; human; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; oxidative stress; prediction; priority journal; protein blood level; Review; virus carcinogenesis; animal; gene deletion; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; mouse; nucleotide sequence; pathology; virology; virus cell transformation; Animals; Base Sequence; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Transformation, Viral; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Sequence Deletion",2-s2.0-84925884313

From a phage-display library of artificial ankyrins, we have isolated AnkGAG1D4, a trimodular ankyrin which binds to the HIV-1 capsid protein N-terminal domain (NTDCA) and has an antiviral effect at the late steps of the virus life cycle. In this study, the determinants of the AnkGAG1D4-NTDCA interaction were analyzed using peptide scanning in competition ELISA, capsid mutagenesis, ankyrin crystallography and molecular modeling. We determined the AnkGAG1D4 structure at 2.2 ? resolution, and used the crystal structure in molecular docking with a homology model of HIV-1 capsid. Our results indicated that NTDCA alpha-helices H1 and H7 could mediate the formation of the capsid-Ank GAG1D4 binary complex, but the interaction involving H7 was predicted to be more stable than with H1. Arginine-18 (R18) in H1, and R132 and R143 in H7 were found to be the key players of the AnkGAG1D4-NTDCA interaction. This was confirmed by R-to-A mutagenesis of NTDCA, and by sequence analysis of trimodular ankyrins negative for capsid binding. In AnkGAG1D4, major interactors common to H1 and H7 were found to be S45, Y56, R89, K122 and K123. Collectively, our ankyrin-capsid binding analysis implied a significant degree of flexibility within the NTDCA domain of the HIV-1 capsid protein, and provided some clues for the design of new antivirals targeting the capsid protein and viral assembly. ? 2014 Springer International Publishing.",Ankyrins; Antivirals; CA protein; HIV-1; Modeling; Molecular docking; Viral assembly,"ankyrin; arginine; capsid protein; ankyrin; antivirus agent; capsid protein; protein binding; recombinant protein; alpha helix; amino terminal sequence; antiviral activity; article; bacterial cell; controlled study; crystal structure; crystallography; drug protein binding; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; molecular docking; molecular model; nonhuman; priority journal; protein targeting; sequence analysis; SF9 cell line; site directed mutagenesis; virus capsid; amino acid sequence; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effects; genetics; growth, development and aging; HIV Infections; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutation; protein analysis; protein conformation; protein tertiary structure; sequence homology; virology; virus assembly; X ray crystallography; Amino Acid Sequence; Ankyrins; Antiviral Agents; Capsid Proteins; Crystallography, X-Ray; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Virus Assembly",2-s2.0-84925284821

TDP-43 proteinopathies, consisting of several neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by inclusion bodies formed by polyubiquitinated and hyperphosphorylated full-length and truncated TDP-43. The structural properties of TDP-43 aggregates and their relationship to pathogenesis are still ambiguous. Here we demonstrate that the recombinant full-length human TDP-43 forms structurally stable, spherical oligomers that share common epitopes with an anti-amyloid oligomer-specific antibody. The TDP-43 oligomers are stable, have exposed hydrophobic surfaces, exhibit reduced DNA binding capability and are neurotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TDP-43 oligomers are capable of cross-seeding Alzheimer's amyloid-β to form amyloid oligomers, demonstrating interconvertibility between the amyloid species. Such oligomers are present in the forebrain of transgenic TDP-43 mice and FTLD-TDP patients.

In this study, a systems biology approach was used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of four cancers and the non-cancers by their corresponding microarray data, PPI modeling and database-mining. By comparing PPI networks between cancer and non-cancer samples to find significant proteins with large PPI changes during carcinogenesis process, core and specific network markers were identified by the intersection and difference of significant proteins, respectively, with carcinogenesis relevance values (CRVs) for each cancer. A total of 28 significant proteins were identified as core network markers in the carcinogenesis of four types of cancer, two of which are novel cancer-related proteins (e.g., UBC and PSMA3). Moreover, seven crucial common pathways were found among these cancers based on their core network markers, and some specific pathways were particularly prominent based on the specific network markers of different cancers (e.g., the RIG-I-like receptor pathway in bladder cancer, the proteasome pathway and TCR pathway in liver cancer, and the HR pathway in lung cancer). Additional validation of these network markers using the literature and new tested datasets could strengthen our findings and confirm the proposed method.

The selectivity filter (SF), the narrowest part of the channel's open pore, lined with amino acid residues that specifically interact with the permeating ion, plays a major role in determining Na+ selectivity. Different sodium channels have different SFs, which vary in the symmetry, number, charge, arrangement, and chemical type of the metal-ligating groups and pore size: epithelial/degenerin/acid-sensing ion channels have generally trimeric SFs lined with three conserved neutral serines and/or backbone carbonyls; eukaryotic sodium channels have EKEE, EEKE, DKEA, and DEKA SFs with an invariant positively charged lysine from the second or third domain; and bacterial voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels exhibit symmetrical EEEE SFs, reminiscent of eukaryotic voltage-gated calcium channels. How do these different sodium channel SFs achieve high selectivity for Na+ over its key rivals, K+ and Ca2+? What factors govern the metal competition in these SFs and which of these factors are exploited to achieve Na+ selectivity in the different sodium channel SFs? The free energies for replacing K+ or Ca2+ bound inside different model SFs with Na+, evaluated by a combination of density functional theory and continuum dielectric calculations, have shed light on these questions. The SFs of epithelial and eukaryotic Nav channels select Na+ by providing an optimal number and ligating strength of metal ligands as well as a rigid pore whose size fits the cognate Na+ ideally. On the other hand, the SFs of bacterial Nav channels select Na+, as the protein matrix attenuates ion-protein interactions relative to ion-solvent interactions by enlarging the pore and allowing water to enter, so the ion interacts indirectly with the conserved glutamates via bridging water molecules. This shows how these various SFs have adapted to the specific physicochemical properties of the native ion, using different strategies to select Na+ among its contenders. ? 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"ion; sodium channel; cell membrane; chemical structure; chemistry; metabolism; transport at the cellular level; Biological Transport; Cell Membrane; Ions; Models, Molecular; Sodium Channels",2-s2.0-84918502576

Our description is symmetrical, but creates a descriptive equivocation in which ‘Western’ analytical terms are used to describe a ‘Chinese’ medical reality. Drawing on the history of Chinese Medicine, we argue that the latter is not analytical, but ‘correlative’ in a specifically ‘Chinese’ manner that explores patternings, flows, and propensities in local collections of things and symptoms. In particular, it both handles difference without seeking to unearth stable causal mechanisms and absorbs new elements including relevant features of biomedicine. We conclude by briefly considering the scope of a possible post-colonial and ‘correlative’ STS and show that a ‘correlative’ description of the same Chinese Medical consultation would differ markedly from one making use of ‘Western’ analytical assumptions. ?

However, the identification of the normal physiological function of LRRK2 remains elusive. Here, we show that LRRK2 protects neurons against apoptosis induced by the Drosophila genes grim, hid and reaper. Genetic dissection reveals that Akt is the critical downstream kinase of LRRK2 that phosphorylates and inhibits FOXO1, and thereby promotes survival. Like human LRRK2, Drosophila lrrk also promotes neuron survival; lrrk loss-of-function mutant displays reduced cell numbers, which can be rescued by LRRK2 expression. Importantly, LRRK2 G2019S and LRRK2 R1441C mutants impair the ability of LRRK2 to activate Akt, and fail to prevent apoptotic death. Ectopic expression of a constitutive active form of Akt hence is sufficient to rescue this functional deficit. These data establish that LRRK2 can protect neurons from apoptotic insult through a survival pathway in which LRRK2 signals to activate Akt, and then inhibits FOXO1.

Ultrasound-targeted microbubbles destruction (UTMD) has been approved to achieve local blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), enhancing therapeutic agents into the brain. Besides, UTMD has been employed to deliver tumor-killing gene for cancer therapy. Recently, folate receptor (FR), a small molecule with no immunogenicity protein, has been found to be overexpressed in GBM which benefits tumor-specific targeting therapy. Based on the natural high affinity of FR, folate microbubbles (MBs) could effectively conjugate around FR overexpressing tumor. In this study, we fabricated folate-targeted cationic MBs (FCMBs) for improving gene delivery by loading DNA on MBs shell and actively attaching on cancer cell. By the trigger of focus ultrasound (FUS) (center frequency = 1 MHz; pulse length = 10 ms; burst rate = 5 Hz; duty cycle = 5%; acoustic pressure = 0.28-0.7 MPa; exposure time, 60 sec), 1 × 108 pGFP loaded-FCMBs were added in C6 glioma cells. Gene expression and cell viability were assessed using cell counting assay and alarma blue assay, respectively. Results confirmed that FCMBs enable to load DNA via electrostatic interaction on MBs shell and target gene delivery on cancer. Moreover, the gene transfection of FCMBs in C6 glioma cells was significantly higher than MBs without folate and cationic lipid under FUS exposure. In addition, increasing acoustic pressure and inertial cavitation could improve gene delivery by enhancing permeability of cell membrane. ? 2014 IEEE.",cationic microbubble; folate receptor targeting; glioblastoma multiforme; targeted gene therapy; ultrasound-targeted microbubbles destruction,Cell membranes; Cells; Chemotherapy; Cytology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Gene expression; Gene transfer; Genes; Loading; Molecular biology; Tumors; Ultrasonics; Blood-brain barrier; Folate receptor; Glioblastoma multiforme; Inertial cavitation; Micro-bubble; Targeted microbubbles; Tumor-specific targeting; Ultrasound-mediated gene delivery; Gene therapy,2-s2.0-84910026857

Screening of target cell-surface specific affinity reagents with bench-top methods has some drawbacks, including time-consuming, labor-intensive and requirement of large-scale instrument. Microfluidic platforms may overcome these drawbacks because they could automate and complete the screening process within a shorter period of time. Phage display is a promising technology in selection of cell-surface specific peptides. In recent years, a subpopulation of tumor cells named cancer stem cells is believed to be the tumorigenic cells and closely associated with metastasis. A specific peptide that can recognize and differentiate cancer stem cells from the rest of cancer cell population is therefore useful for early diagnosis and targeted therapy. In this study, selection of M13 phage displayed peptides that bind with colon cancer cells and colon cancer stem cells using an integrated microfluidic system was successfully demonstrated. Compared with the traditional methods, the total selection process was shortened to 36 hours while traditional method needs almost a month. More importantly, the screening process can be automated and performed on a single microfluidic chip.

The delivery of EGF and bFGF in the early stage is expected to accelerate epithelialization and vasculature sprouting, while the release of PDGF and VEGF in the late stage is with the aim of inducing blood vessels maturation. The physiochemical characterizations indicate that the Col-HA-GN nanofibrous membrane possesses mechanical properties similar to human native skin.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the direct anti-proliferative activity of IFN-γ are poorly understood. In the present study, we examined the in vitro antitumor activity of IFN-γ on two human non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines, H322M and H226. Our findings indicated that IFN-γ treatment caused a time-dependent reduction in cell viability and induced apoptosis through a FADD-mediated caspase-8/tBid/mitochondria-dependent pathway in both cell lines. Notably, we also postulated that IFN-γ increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression and enzymatic activity in H322M and H226 cells. In addition, inhibition of IDO activity by the IDO inhibitor 1-MT or tryptophan significantly reduced IFN-γ-induced apoptosis and death receptor 5 (DR5) expression, which suggests that IDO enzymatic activity plays an important role in the anti-NSCLC cancer effect of IFN-γ. These results provide new mechanistic insights into interferon-γ antitumor activity and further support IFN-γ as a potential therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of NCSLC.","Apoptosis; Death receptor 5; Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; Non-small-cell lung carcinoma; Nterferon-γ","antivirus agent; cytochrome c; gamma interferon; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor; adenocarcinoma; apoptosis; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; cell cycle; cell proliferation; drug effects; human; Lung Neoplasms; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane potential; pathology; tumor cell culture; Western blotting; Adenocarcinoma; Antiviral Agents; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Cytochromes c; Humans; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Interferon-gamma; Lung Neoplasms; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-84908030064

Although induction of autophagy by nanomaterials is reported, the underlying signaling mechanism in cancer cells and how this implicates the potential of GO in cancer therapy remain obscure. Here, it is shown that GO itself can induce the toll-like receptors (TLRs) responses and autophagy in cancer cells and confer antitumor effects in mice. GO can be phagocytosed by CT26 colon cancer cells, simultaneously triggering autophagy as well as TLR-4 and TLR-9 signaling cascades. By dissecting the crosstalk between the TLRs and autophagy pathways, it is uncovered that the GO-activated autophagy is regulated through the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)- and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-associated TLR-4/9 signaling pathways. Injection of GO alone into immunocompetent mice bearing the CT26 colon tumors not only suppresses the tumor progression but also enhances cell death, autophagy, and immune responses within the tumor bed.

Chronic HBV infection is currently managed with either nucleoside/nucleotide-based or interferon-based therapies, but fails to clear infection in a substantial proportion of cases, and antiviral strategies targeting the early stages of infection are therefore required for the prevention of HBV infection. In this study, we examined some common phytochemicals and identified epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as a new inhibitor of HBV entry. EGCG, a flavonoid present in green tea extract, belongs to the subclass of catechins. We demonstrated that EGCG at a concentration of 50 μM inhibited HBV entry into immortalized human primary hepatocytes by more than 80%, whereas the other four catechins tested had much weaker inhibitory effects. DMSO-differentiated HuS-E/2 cells expressed sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), which is a receptor for HBV. Application of EGCG during HBV inoculation markedly inhibited infection in both DMSO-differentiated HuS-E/2 cells and HA-NTCP-expressing Huh7 cells. Interestingly, EGCG induced clathrin-dependent endocytosis of NTCP from the plasma membrane followed by protein degradation. In addition, EGCG inhibited the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin. Treatment of cells with EGCG had no effect on HBV genome replication or virion secretion. Moreover, the characteristic of HBV virion and the expression of known HBV entry factors were unaltered by EGCG. Finally, the antiviral activity of EGCG on HBV entry was observed using four different genotypes, A to D. These results show that the green tea-derived molecule EGCG potently inhibits HBV entry and could be used in prevention of HBV reinfection. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Two human glutaminase genes have been identified, GLS (GLS1) and GLS2. Two alternative transcripts arise from each glutaminase gene: first, the kidney isoform (KGA) and glutaminase C (GAC) for GLS; and, second, the liver isoform (LGA) and glutaminase B (GAB) for GLS2. While GLS1 is considered as a cancer therapeutic target, the potential role of GLS2 in cancer remains unclear. Here, we discovered a series of alkyl benzoquinones that preferentially inhibit glutaminase B isoform (GAB, GLS2) rather than the kidney isoform of glutaminase (KGA, GLS1). We identified amino acid residues in an allosteric binding pocket responsible for the selectivity. Treatment with the alkyl benzoquinones decreased intracellular glutaminase activity and glutamate levels. GLS2 inhibition by either alkyl benzoquinones or GLS2 siRNA reduced carcinoma cell proliferation and anchorageindependent colony formation, and induced autophagy via AMPK mediated mTORC1 inhibition.

The release patterns of the two drugs can be regulated by manipulating the surface charges and drug-loading ratios, providing the capability for a stepwise adjuvant release to treat cancer cells. The results demonstrate that the dual (Dox+Cur)-drug-loaded nanocapsule can be effectively delivered into RG2 glioma cells to enhance the cytotoxicity against the cells through a synergistic effect. The combined targeting, i.e., magnetic guidance and incorporation of Lf ligands, of these Lf-MDCs results in significantly elevated cellular uptake in the RG2 cells that overexpress the Lf receptor.

However, following injections, retention of transplanted cells in engrafted areas remains problematic, and can be deleterious to cell-transplantation therapy. In this Progress Report, a thermoresponsive hydrogel system composed of aqueous methylcellulose (MC) blended with phosphate-buffered saline is constructed to grow cell sheet fragments and cell bodies for the treatment of ischemic diseases. The as-prepared MC hydrogel system undergoes a sol-gel reversible transition upon heating or cooling at ?32 °C. Via this unique property, the grown cell sheet fragments (cell bodies) can be harvested without using proteolytic enzymes; consequently, their inherent extracellular matrices (ECMs) and integrative adhesive agents remain well preserved. In animal studies using rats and pigs with experimentally created myocardial infarction, the injected cell sheet fragments (cell bodies) become entrapped in the interstices of muscular tissues and adhere to engraftment sites, while a minimal number of cells exist in the group receiving dissociated cells. Moreover, transplantation of cell sheet fragments (cell bodies) significantly increases vascular density, thereby improving the function of an infarcted heart. These experimental results demonstrate that cell sheet fragments (cell bodies) function as a cell-delivery construct by providing a favorable ECM environment to retain transplanted cells locally and consequently, improving the efficacy of therapeutic cell transplantation. ? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To ensure patient privacy, in 2013, Hao et al. proposed a chaotic map based authentication scheme with user anonymity for TMIS. Later, Lee showed that Hao et al.'s scheme is in no provision for providing fairness in session key establishment and gave an efficient user authentication and key agreement scheme using smart cards, in which only few hashing and Chebyshev chaotic map operations are required. In addition, Jiang et al. discussed that Hao et al.'s scheme can not resist stolen smart card attack and they further presented an improved scheme which attempts to repair the security pitfalls found in Hao et al.'s scheme. In this paper, we found that both Lee's and Jiang et al.'s authentication schemes have a serious security problem in that a registered user's secret parameters may be intentionally exposed to many non-registered users and this problem causing the service misuse attack. Therefore, we propose a slight modification on Lee's scheme to prevent the shortcomings. Compared with previous schemes, our improved scheme not only inherits the advantages of Lee's and Jiang et al.'s authentication schemes for TMIS but also remedies the serious security weakness of not being able to withstand service misuse attack. ?

Clinical data have shown that inhibition of MIF, especially its tautomerase activity, with small compounds has been beneficial in some disease models. A virtual screening (VS) experiment is conducted for searching some active compounds to inhibit the tautomerase activity of MIF from the ZINC database. By using an x-ray-determined structure OXIM-11 as the query and an in-house developed two-dimensional scaffold comparing method designated as Sfilter, we have screened out some 1500 compounds for ranking by our previously published docking method ADDock. After further ranking by ADDock on 119 compounds screened, we have decided to choose 17 of them for measuring their inhibitory activity IC50 against the MIF tautomerase experimentally. The IC50's are measured using both human monocytic THP-1 cell lysate and purified recombinant human MIF protein. We have found that the IC50's measured for three searched compounds (namely, ZINC02693801, ZINC00141102, and ZINC12368346) are better than that determined for ISO-1, a known MIF tautomerase inhibitor and standard used throughout our VS experiment.

It is a homodimeric protein that belongs to the S100 protein family. S100A13 is co-expressed with acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF1) and interleukin-1α which are key angiogenesis inducers. The S100 proteins have been shown to be involved in several cellular functions such as calcium homeostasis, cell growth and differentiation dynamic of cytoskeleton. Its biological functions are mainly mediated through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) signaling. RAGE is involved in inflammatory processes and is associated with diabetic complications, tumor outgrowth, and neurodegenerative disorders. RAGE induces cellular signaling upon binding of different ligands, such as S100 proteins, glycated proteins, and HMGB1. RAGE signaling is complex, and it depends on the cell type and concentration of the ligand. Molecular level interactions of RAGE and S100 proteins are useful to understand the RAGE signaling diversity. In this report we focus on the molecular level interactions of S100A13 and RAGE C2 domain. The binding between RAGE C2 and S100A13 is moderately strong (Kd ? 1.3 μM). We have solved the solution structure of the S100A13-RAGE C2 complex and pronounce the interface regions in S100A13-RAGE C2 complex which are helpful for drug development of RAGE induced diseases. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Isothermal titration calorimetry; NMR spectroscopy; RAGE dimerization; Receptor for advanced glycation end products; S100A13,"advanced glycation end product; protein S 100; protein S100A13; unclassified drug; article; complex formation; priority journal; protein binding; protein domain; protein protein interaction; protein structure; Isothermal titration calorimetry; NMR spectroscopy; RAGE dimerization; Receptor for advanced glycation end products; S100A13; Calorimetry; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Models, Molecular; Molecular Docking Simulation; Protein Binding; Protein Multimerization; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Receptors, Immunologic; Recombinant Proteins; S100 Proteins",2-s2.0-84904582394

Redundant checks occur in the cycles in which no command would be issued by the command scheduler. By predicting effective cycles, the proposed method diminishes redundancy and speed up simulation by up to 40% in multi-program real workloads, while introducing zero error in simulation compared to the cycle-based simulator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work which leverages the redundancy of memory command scheduling to accelerate simulation. ? 2014 IEEE.",DRAM Simulator; Electronic System Level Design; System Modeling and Simulation; SystemC DRAM Modeling,Computer simulation; Redundancy; Scheduling; Cycle-based simulators; Electronic system level design; Full-system simulation; Optimized configuration; System modeling and simulation; System simulations; SystemC; Transaction level modeling; Dynamic random access storage,2-s2.0-84904444267

The expression of MMPs and behavior change were examined in UT-MUC-1 cells. The effect of Axl signaling on co-cultured cancer cells was further investigated by knockdown Axl expression and suppression by Axl-specific inhibitor R428. Results: Activation of Axl signaling and increased expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 along with increased invasion/migration ability in MEC cells were observed when co-cultured with TAMs. Upon knockdown of Axl in MEC or addition of R428 in the co-cultured system, these co-cultured effects were diminished.

Group members' perceptions of their group's climate has been linked with important group member outcomes, including session attendance. On the basis of the writings of Curran and Bauer (2011), the current study examined group members' longitudinal ratings of session engagement and decomposed them into between-groups, between-members, and betweensessions components. These components were then used to examine the relationship between group members' ratings of an engaged group climate in the previous session and their attendance the following session. Session attendance in 573 group sessions for 91 group members in 14 Taiwanese counseling groups was modeled in a 3-level hierarchical model (sessions within group members, within groups). Contrary to our hypotheses, between-groups, between-members, and betweensessions components of engagement were not related to session attendance. However, there was a significant interaction between the between-members and between-sessions components of session engagement and group size in predicting session attendance. The likelihood of attendance increased when group members who, on average, rated sessions as being low in engagement uncharacteristically rated a previous session as high in engagement. The likelihood of attendance also increased when group members who, on average, rated sessions as high in engagement uncharacteristically rated the previous session as low in engagement.

Moreover, after 15 Hz EA stimulation at the bilateral Zusanli acupoints, although enhanced insulin activity mainly acts on the insulin-sensitive target organs, the muscles must be considered. In addition, 15 Hz EA stimulation at the bilateral Zusanli acupoints has the combined effect of enhancing cholinergic nerve activity and increasing nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity to enhance insulin activity.

However, the discontinuous detector blocks cause gaps in the sinogram. This study proposes an adaptive discrete cosine transform-based (aDCT) filter for gap-inpainting. Methods: The gap-corrupted sinogram was morphologically closed and subsequently converted to the DCT domain. A certain number of the largest coefficients in the DCT spectrum were identified to determine the low-frequency preservation region. The weighting factors for the remaining coefficients were determined by an exponential weighting function. The aDCT filter was constructed and applied to two digital phantoms and a simulated phantom introduced with various levels of noise. Results: For the Shepp-Logan head phantom, the aDCT filter filled the gaps effectively. For the Jaszczak phantom, no secondary artifacts were induced after aDCT filtering. The percent mean square error and mean structure similarity of the aDCT filter were superior to those of the DCT2 filter at all noise levels.

The prM helical (prM-H) domain is topologically close to and may interact with domain II of the E protein (EDII). In this study, we investigated prM-H domain amino acid residues facing Japanese encephalitis virus EDII using site-directed mutagenesis to determine their roles in prM-E interaction and VLP production. Our results indicate that negatively charged prM-E125 residue at the prM-H domain affected VLP production via one or more interactions with positively charged E-K93 and E-H246 residues at EDII. Exchanges of oppositely charged residue side chains at prM-E125/E-K93 and prM-E125/E-H246 are recoverable for VLP production. The prM-E125 and E-H246 residues are conserved and that the positive charge of the E-K93 residue is preserved in different flavivirus groups. These findings suggest that the electrostatic attractions of prM-E125, E-K93, and E-H246 residues are important to flavivirus VLP production and that inhibiting these interactions is a potential strategy for blocking flavivirus infections. ? 2014, American Society for Microbiology.",,"glutamic acid; unclassified drug; virus E protein; virus prM protein; virus protein; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; article; binding affinity; controlled study; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 2; Dengue virus 3; Dengue virus 4; human; human cell; Japanese encephalitis virus; Kunjin virus; Murray Valley encephalitis virus; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein binding; protein conformation; protein content; protein determination; protein domain; protein expression; protein protein interaction; protein secretion; static electricity; Tick borne encephalitis flavivirus; virogenesis; virus particle; West Nile flavivirus; Yellow fever flavivirus; Amino Acids; Animals; Cell Line; DNA Mutational Analysis; Encephalitis Virus, Japanese; Humans; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutant Proteins; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Interaction Mapping; Viral Envelope Proteins; Virosomes; Virus Assembly",2-s2.0-84903894965

The e-nose system primarily comprises two self-developed chips, a multiple-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT)-polymer based microsensor array, and a low-power signal-processing chip. The microsensor array was fabricated on a silicon wafer by using standard photolithography technology. The microsensor array comprised eight interdigitated electrodes surrounded by SU-8 ""walls,"" which restrained the material-solvent liquid in a defined area of 650?×?760 μm2. To achieve a reliable sensor-manufacturing process, we used a two-layer deposition method, coating the MWNTs and polymer film as the first and second layers, respectively. The low-power signal-processing chip included array data acquisition circuits and a signal-processing core. The MWNT-polymer microsensor array can directly connect with array data acquisition circuits, which comprise sensor interface circuitry and an analog-to-digital converter; the signal-processing core consists of memory and a microprocessor. The core executes the program, classifying the odor data received from the array data acquisition circuits. The low-power signal-processing chip was designed and fabricated using the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 0.18-μm 1P6M standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor process. The chip consumes only 1.05 mW of power at supply voltages of 1 and 1.8 V for the array data acquisition circuits and the signal-processing core, respectively. The miniature e-nose system, which used a microsensor array, a low-power signal-processing chip, and an embedded k-nearest-neighbor-based pattern recognition algorithm, was developed as a prototype that successfully recognized the complex odors of tincture, sorghum wine, sake, whisky, and vodka.

DOX and a graft copolymer comprising acrylic acid (AAc) and 2-methacryloyloxyethyl acrylate (MEA) units as the backbone and with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) as the grafts at pH 7.4 and 4 C undergo electrostatically induced co-association into copolymer/DOX nanocomplexes. After being crosslinked by polymerization of the MEA moieties, the complex nanoconstructs exhibit a unique nanogel-like architecture. Taking advantage of the extensive electrostatic attraction of the DOX molecules with ionized AAc residues and π-π stacking among copolymer-bound DOX molecules, the DOX-loaded nanogels show a relatively high payload content. With the milieu pH being reduced from 7.4 to 4.7, the drug release is appreciably promoted due to the massive disruption of ionic AAc/DOX pairings. The thermo-evolved phase transition of the PNIPAAm grafts further accelerates drug elution, particularly at pH 4.7. In vitro characterization indicates that the DOX-embedded nanogels endocytosed by HeLa cells can progressively release DOX within acidic organelles. As a result, the viability of cancer cells treated with DOX-loaded nanoparticles can be further reduced by prolonging incubation time. This work demonstrates the great potential of the DOX-loaded nanogel assemblies for effective intracellular drug delivery. ? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

If the impact of visual scanning patterns on a pilot's situation awareness could be identified in flight operations, then eye-tracking tools could be integrated with flight simulators to improve training efficiency. Method: Participating in this research were 18 qualified, mission-ready fighter pilots. The equipment included high-fidelity and fixed-base type flight simulators and mobile head-mounted eyetracking devices to record a subject's eye movements and SA while performing air-to-surface tasks. Results: There were significant differences in pilots'percentage of fixation in three operating phases: preparation (M = 46.09, SD = 14.79), aiming (M = 24.24, SD = 11.03), and release and break-away (M = 33.98, SD = 14.46). Also, there were significant differences in pilots'pupil sizes, which were largest in the aiming phase (M = 27,621, SD = 6390.8), followed by release and break-away (M = 27,173, SD = 5830.46), then preparation (M = 25,710, SD = 6078.79), which was the smallest. Furthermore, pilots with better SA performance showed lower perceived workload (M = 30.60, SD = 17.86), and pilots with poor SA performance showed higher perceived workload (M = 60.77, SD = 12.72). Pilots'percentage of fixation and average fixation duration among five different areas of interest showed significant differences as well. Discussion: Eye-tracking devices can aid in capturing pilots' visual scan patterns and SA performance, unlike traditional flight simulators. Therefore, integrating eye-tracking devices into the simulator may be a useful method for promoting SA training in flight operations, and can provide in-depth understanding of the mechanism of visual scan patterns and information processing to improve training effectiveness in aviation. ?

A pure compound butylidenephthalide (BP), isolated from Angelica sinensis, has been shown the activities to arrest the growth and initiate apoptosis of GBM in our previous reports. In this study, we further demonstrated that BP treatment accelerates the cell senescence in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), a proto-oncogene, is generally upregulated in cancer. We found that it was downregulated in BP-treated GBM cells. The downregulation of Skp2 is parallel with increasing p16 and p21 expression which causes G0/G1 arrest and tumor cell senescence. We also found that restoring the Skp2 protein level by exogenous overexpression prevents the BP-induced cell senescence. Therefore, the linkage between cell senescence and Skp2 expression is strengthened. Promoter binding analysis further detailed that the BP-mediated SP1 reduction might involve in the Skp2 downregulation. In summary, these results emphasize that BP-triggered senescence in GBMcells is highly associated with its control on Skp2 regulation. ?

The tissue temperature and the blood temperatures in artery and vein vessels are solved with a multi-grid system. The mean temperature of the tissue over the cross-section of the unit skin area is evaluated. The resulting one-dimensional function is regarded as the temperature of healthy tissue (or injured skin but the blood perfusion is still normally working) for large area of skin in view of the symmetric and periodic structure of the paired artery-vein vessels in nature. A three-dimensional bioheat equation then is formulated by the superposition of the skin burn wound effect and the healthy skin temperature with and without thermal radiation exposure. When this bioheat equation is employed to simulate ADT process on burn wounds, the decaying factor of the skin surface temperature is found to be a sharply decreasing function of time in the self-cooling stage after a thermal radiation heating. Nevertheless, the boundary of non-healing (needing surgery) and healing regions in a large burn wound can be estimated by tracking the peak of the gradient of decaying factor within 30 s after the thermal radiation is turned off.

METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 90 consecutive patients with unilateral primary pterygium were enrolled from January 2010 to June 2012. Corneal ECD was measured in both eyes, and the fellow eyes were considered as controls. The relationship between the percentage of pterygium to cornea and a decrease in the ECD was analyzed. An increase in astigmatism in eyes with pterygium was evaluated for association with decreased ECD using the Pearson correlation test. RESULTS: The percentage of pterygium to cornea ranged from 3.5% to 65.2%, with a median of 12.35%. The difference in the corneal ECD between eyes with pterygium and control eyes ranged from +9.6% to -37.7%, with a median of -9.75%. The results of the Pearson correlation statistical test showed a strong logarithmic correlation between a decrease in the corneal ECD and the percentage of pterygium to cornea (R = 0.688, P < 0.001). An increase in astigmatism was correlated with a decrease in the ECD in eyes with pterygium. CONCLUSIONS: Pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal ECD. Surgical intervention should be considered in patients with extensive pterygium involvement in the cornea or a significant increase in astigmatism.

However, the plasma tau levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been well studied. We investigated plasma tau by using an immunomagnetic reduction assay in 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, 10 early AD dementia, and 30 healthy elders (HE). All received a 3D-brain MRI scan and a set of cognitive function test. We explored their relationships with both brain structure and cognitive functions. Images were analyzed to determine the brain volumes and gray matter densities. Patients with MCI or early AD had significantly increased plasma tau levels compared with HE. Plasma tau levels were negatively associated with the performance of logical memory, visual reproduction, and verbal fluency; also negatively associated with volume of total gray matter, hippocampus, amygdala; and gray matter densities of various regions. Regression analyses indicated that logical memory explained 0.394 and hippocampus volume predicted. 608 of the variance of plasma tau levels, both P < 0.001. Education years were negatively associated with the gray matter densities of the supramarginal (r = -0.407), middle temporal gyrus (r = -0.40) and precuneus (r = -0.377; all P < 0.05) in HE; and negatively associated with plasma tau levels in patients (r = -0.626). We propose that plasma tau may serve as a window to both structure and function of the brain. Higher education is a protective factor against AD and is associated with lower plasma tau levels in patients. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; Hippocampus; Immunomagnetic reduction; MRI volumetry; Plasma total tau; Voxel-based morphometry,"magnetic nanoparticle; tau protein; apolipoprotein E; nanoparticle; tau protein; aged; Alzheimer disease; amygdaloid nucleus; article; brain function; brain region; brain size; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; disease association; educational status; female; gray matter; gray matter density; heredity; hippocampus; human; image processing; inferior frontal gyrus; language ability; male; memory; middle temporal gyrus; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; nervous system parameters; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; precuneus; priority journal; protein blood level; superior frontal gyrus; superior temporal gyrus; supramarginal gyrus; Taiwan; three dimensional imaging; vision; volumetry; voxel based morphometry; blood; brain; complication; diagnostic use; genetics; Memory Disorders; middle aged; neuropsychological test; pathology; regression analysis; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoproteins E; Brain; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory Disorders; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Nanoparticles; Neuropsychological Tests; Regression Analysis; tau Proteins",2-s2.0-84902168439

We also tested the effects of rutin treatment in insulin-resistant mice using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Methods and results: Rutin potentiated insulin receptor kinase (IRK) phosphorylation when IRK autophosphorylation was triggered by insulin in differentiated myotubes. Co-treatment of cells with rutin and insulin attenuated S961-mediated inhibition of insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation. In S961-treated C57BL/6 mice, an in vivo model of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, rutin treatment showed a normoglycemic effect in the OGTT. Conclusion: This study shows evidence that rutin may serve as a potential agent for glycemic control through enhancement of IRK activity, thereby inducing the insulin signaling pathway causing increased GLUT4 translocation and increased glucose uptake. ? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, human cells appear to be less plastic and have a higher epigenetic hurdle for reprogramming to both iPSCs and iNs. Here, we show that SH2B adaptor protein 1β (SH2B1) can enhance neurite outgrowth of iNs reprogrammed from human fibroblasts as early as day 14, when combined with miR124 and transcription factors BRN2 and MYT1L (IBM) under defined conditions. These SH2B1-enhanced iNs (S-IBM) showed canonical neuronal morphology, and expressed multiple neuronal markers, such as TuJ1, NeuN, and synapsin, and functional proteins for neurotransmitter release, such as GABA, vGluT2, and tyrosine hydroxylase. Importantly, SH2B1 accelerated mature process of functional neurons and exhibited action potentials as early as day 14; without SH2B1, the IBM iNs do not exhibit action potentials until day 21. Our data demonstrate that SH2B1 can enhance neurite outgrowth and accelerate the maturation of human iNs under defined conditions. This approach will facilitate the application of iNs in regenerative medicine and in vitro disease modeling. ?

This study investigated the use of a strain-compounding technique with speckle factor (SF) imaging to analyze the degree of scatterer redistributions in breast tissues under strain conditions for identifying microcalcifications and false microcalcifications. The efficacy of the proposed method was tested by collecting raw data of ultrasound backscattered signals from 26 lesions at BI-RADS category 4 or 5 with suspicious microcalcifications. The different strain conditions were created by applying manual compression to deform the breast lesion. For each region in which microcalcifications were suspected, estimates of the SNR of the strain-compounding B-scan images and estimates of the mean SF (SFavg) in the strain-compounding SF images were calculated. Compared with microcalcifications, the severity of speckle of the false microcalcifications would be easily degraded under compressive strain conditions. The results demonstrated that the SNR estimates in the strain-compounding B-scan images for microcalcifications and false microcalcifications were 5.22 ± 1.04 (mean ± standard deviation) and 4.62 ± 1.09, respectively; the corresponding SFavg estimates in the strain-compounding SF images were 0.47 ± 0.10 and 0.22 ± 0.10 (p < 0.01). The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using the SNR estimate was 0.71, whereas that using the SFavg estimate was 0.94. These findings indicate that the strain-compounding SF imaging method is more effective at discriminating between microcalcifications and false microcalcifications. ? 2014 IEEE.",,"Medical imaging; Signal to noise ratio; Speckle; Ultrasonic applications; Backscattered signal; Breast microcalcifications; Compressive strain; Fibrocystic changes; Microcalcifications; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Standard deviation; Ultrasound speckle; Calcification (biochemistry); algorithm; breast disease; calcinosis; computer assisted diagnosis; echography; echomammography; elastography; female; human; image enhancement; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Young modulus; Algorithms; Breast Diseases; Calcinosis; Elastic Modulus; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ultrasonography, Mammary",2-s2.0-84901474722

Here we present nanoparticles of poly(amidoamine) dendrimer-grafted gadolinium-functionalized nanographene oxide (Gd-NGO) as effective carriers to deliver both chemotherapeutic drugs and highly specific gene-targeting agents such as microRNAs (miRNAs) to cancer cells. The positively charged surface of Gd-NGO was capable of simultaneous adsorption of the anti-cancer drug epirubicin (EPI) and interaction with negatively charged Let-7g miRNA. Using human glioblastoma (U87) cells as a model, we found that this conjugate of Let-7g and EPI (Gd-NGO/Let-7g/EPI) not only exhibited considerably higher transfection efficiency, but also induced better inhibition of cancer cell growth than Gd-NGO/Let-7g or Gd-NGO/EPI. The concentration of Gd-NGO/Let-7g/EPI required for 50% inhibition of cellular growth (IC50) was significantly reduced (to the equivalent of 1.3μg/mL EPI) compared to Gd-NGO/EPI (3.4μg/mL EPI). In addition, Gd-NGO/Let-7g/EPI could be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging to identify the location and extent of blood-brain barrier opening and quantitate drug delivery to tumor tissues. These results suggest that Gd-NGO/Let-7g/EPI may be a promising non-viral vector for chemogene therapy and molecular imaging diagnosis in future clinical applications. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Dendrimer; Drug delivery; MiRNA delivery; MR imaging; Nanographene oxide,"Dendrimers; Diagnosis; Diseases; Drug delivery; Gadolinium; Magnetic resonance imaging; Molecular biology; Molecular imaging; Tumors; Anti-cancer therapeutics; Chemotherapeutic drugs; Clinical application; Effective concentration; MiRNA delivery; MR imaging; Positively charged surfaces; Transfection efficiency; RNA; epirubicin; gadolinium; graphite; microRNA; mirnlet7 microRNA, human; nanoparticle; oxide; atomic force microscopy; cell death; chemistry; drug delivery system; drug effects; gene transfer; genetic transfection; human; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; static electricity; thermogravimetry; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Cell Death; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Delivery Systems; Epirubicin; Gadolinium; Gene Transfer Techniques; Graphite; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; MicroRNAs; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Nanoparticles; Oxides; Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Static Electricity; Thermogravimetry; Transfection",2-s2.0-84901430296

The interaction of these two oncoproteins in hepatocytes and its significance in tumorigenesis remain to be elucidated. In this study, we observed the co-expression of HBx with surface antigens in ground-glass hepatocytes in 5 of 20 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive livers. In vitro, hepatocytes co-expressing HBx and a pre-S2 mutant showed enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, phosphorylated Akt 1/2/3, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin signals. Transgenic mice harboring both HBx and pre-S2 mutant construct plasmids developed HCCs at an average of 15.1 months, earlier than animals carrying either HBx (16.9 months) or pre-S2 mutant (24.5 months) alone. The oncogenic signals of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, phosphorylated Akt 1/2/3, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin were sequentially and differentially activated at different stages in tumorigenesis. Phosphorylated mTOR was consistently activated in transgenic and human HCCs. We conclude that ground-glass hepatocytes co-expressing HBx and surface antigens exhibit enhanced oncogenic effects and tumorigenesis in chronic HBV infections.

The results showed that the dose-rate constant, radial dose function, and anisotropy function in water were highly consistent with data in the literature. However, the lung dose near the source would be overestimated by up to 12%, if the lung tissue is assumed to be water, and, hence, if a tumor is located in the lung, the tumor dose will be overestimated, if the material density is not taken into consideration. In contrast, the lung dose far from the source would be underestimated by up to 30%. Radial dose functions were found to depend not only on the phantom size but also on the material density. The phantom size affects the radial dose function in bone more than those in the other tissues. On the other hand, the anisotropy function in lung tissue was not dependent on the radial distance.

The percentage of fertility-related patients in sub-Saharan African countries is higher than that for the developed countries. In low-resource countries, examination of sperm characteristics for male infertility cannot be undertaken because of poor clinical access. To evaluate male fertility in assisted reproductive medicine laboratories, the numbers of motile human sperm, the degree of sperm motility, and sperm morphology have been commonly analyzed using a microscope. It is challenging to monitor the health status of human sperm in resource-limited or remote settings for two primary reasons: (1) high capital cost (equipment for currently accepted procedural standard), and (2) complexity of the currently accepted procedural standard used to simultaneously measure human sperm concentration and motility by skillful embryologists. Determining the health status of human sperm in order to evaluate fertilization capacity using various types of low-cost, easy-to-use, and rapid devices (or systems) is a longstanding but interesting biotechnologically relevant issue in various scientific communities such as male reproduction. Furthering such efforts will inherently influence birth rate in both developed and developing nations. We have demonstrated an inexpensive but robust and easy-to-handle device for monitoring the health status of human sperm made by patterning a piece of paper and measuring the activity of a specific enzyme - a simple and elegant solution. After applying semen to the hydrophilic center circle of our patterned paper, a thiazine assay can be used to suggest sperm concentration in semen, and a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT assay) data can be used to help estimate the percentage of motile human sperm (sperm motility) in semen based on the character that motile human sperm moved in and on the paper. Using this paper-based device, we can evaluate fertility levels without consulting doctors and use our assay to compare results with World Health Organization (WHO) reference values for sperm concentration (&gt;2×107) and motility (&gt;50 %). The duration and cost of one entire test are 30 min and 0.1 USD, respectively. We believe that this paper-based assay system would be useful for fertility checks based on WHO references, without need of a microscope, at home. Using this assay method, males in developed or developing countries who are reluctant or unable to consult assisted reproductive technologies clinics can self-analyze their sperm characteristics. We further note that our approach adheres to WHO regulations, especially in regard to in vitro diagnostic device performance with an associated diagnostic algorithm to enhance diagnostic accuracy (compared with just one diagnostic output), and we wish to emphasize that our research could significantly advance a broad range of diagnostic developments including paper-based diagnostic devices, in vitro diagnostic devices, and diagnosis of other diseases in various divisions of translational medicine. These results, we believe, will be of interest to a wide scientific audience working in materials science (biomaterials), chemistry (analytical and clinical), lab-on-a-chip technologies (the development of diagnostic tools), reproductive medicine, bioengineering, and translational medicine. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Enzymatically based paper diagnostic devices; Fertility; Human sperm; Sperm motility,Biodegradation; Body fluids; Chemical analysis; Costs; Developing countries; Enzyme activity; Health; Assisted reproductive technologies; Diagnostic device; Fertility; Human sperm; Lab-on-a-chip technology; Sperm motility; Translational medicine; World Health Organization; Diagnosis,2-s2.0-84899993306

For example, a portable instrument capable of biomedical analyses (e.g., blood sample analysis) and immediate recording, whether the patients are in the hospital or home, would be a considerable benefit to human health with an excellent commercial viability. Digital microfluidic (DMF) system based on the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) mechanism is an especially promising candidate for such point-of-care systems. The EWOD-based DMF system processes droplets in a thin space or on an open surface, unlike the usual microfluidic systems that process liquids by pumping them in microchannels. Droplets can be generated and manipulated on EWOD chip only with electric signals without the use of pumps or valves, simplifying the chip fabrication and the system construction. Microfluidic operations by EWOD actuation feature precise droplet actuation, less contamination risk, reduced reagents volume, better reagents mixing efficiency, shorter reaction time, and flexibility for integration with other elements. In addition, the simplicity and portability make the EWOD-based DMF system widely popular in biomedical or chemical fields as a powerful sample preparation platform. Many chemical and biomedical researches, such as DNA assays, proteomics, cell assays, and immunoassays, have been reported using the technology. In this paper, we have reviewed the recent developments and studies of EWOD-based DMF systems for biomedical applications published mostly during the last 5 years. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Biomedical application; Chemical application; Digital microfluidic system; Electrowetting-on-dielectric; Lab-on-a-chip device,BioMEMS; Dielectric materials; Digital microfluidics; Drops; Fluidic devices; Lab-on-a-chip; Medical applications; Molecular biology; Wetting; Biomedical applications; Chemical applications; Digital microfluidic system; Electro-wetting on dielectrics; Lab-on-a-chip devices; Dielectric devices,2-s2.0-84899980581

Moreover, we have shown that this complex can be triggered by laser irradiation to create a ""nanoblast"" and induce cell death in the A549 non-small-cell lung cancer cell line via the apoptotic pathway. This laser-mediated, cancer-targeting platform can be widely used in cancer therapy. Small but significant: A new nanosurgery platform was formed using a laser-mediated, cancer-targeting nanodiamond (ND) complex.

This method is inexpensive, robust, easy-to-use (easy-to-prepare), and compatible with downstream analyses, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and transcriptome analysis. EVs are small membranous vesicles shed from both healthy and diseased cells and contain nucleic acid and protein cargo. EVs have been increasingly recognized as a means of cell-cell communication and hold a great potential for clinical applications. However, current protocols for isolation of EVs are often lengthy, cumbersome and require expensive equipment. Here, we have isolated EVs from small volumes of both human serum and aqueous humor samples using paper-based immunoaffinity devices. Captured EVs were analyzed morphologically using SEM and appeared statistically different in size (p value &lt; 2.4 × 10-22) and circularity (p value &lt; 3.6 × 10-9) between subsets of EVs bearing different surface markers. Assessing the amount of EVs captured using paper-based ELISA using antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase to produce a colorimetric readout was accomplished within 10 min. RNAs contained in EVs can be extracted to provide information for disease management. These paper-based immunoaffinity devices, we believe, open opportunities for a wide range of applications in both basic biology and clinical medicine. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Aqueous humor; Chemical conjugation; Exosomes; Extracellular vesicles; Paper microfluidics,Antigen-antibody reactions; Body fluids; Microfluidics; Nucleic acids; Scanning electron microscopy; Aqueous humor; Cell-cell communications; Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Exosomes; Extracellular; Horse-radish peroxidase; Isolation and characterization; Transcriptome analysis; Paper; Antibodies; Fluidics; Nucleic Acids; Scanning Electron Microscopy,2-s2.0-84899957353

In addition, the nucleus is the primary targets of doxorubicin treatment. In the current study, low-abundance nuclear proteins were enriched for proteomic analysis by using a state-of-the-art two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) andmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) strategy to compare and identify the nuclear protein profiling changes responsible for the development of doxorubicin resistance in human uterine cancer cells. The results of the nuclear proteomic analysis indicated that more than 2100 protein features were resolved from an equal pooled amount of three purified nuclear proteins and 117 differentially expressed spots were identified. Of these 117 identified proteins, 48 belonged to nuclear proteins and a positive correlation was observed between the expression levels of 32 of these nuclear proteins and an increase in drug resistance. According to our review of relevant research, nuclear proteins such as DNA repair protein XRCC3 (XRCC3) have not been reported to play roles in the formation of doxorubicin resistance. Previous studies have used RNA interference and cell viability analysis to evidence the essential roles of XRCC3 on its potency in the formation of doxorubicin resistance. To sum up, our nuclear proteomic approaches enabled us to identify numerous proteins, including XRCC3, involved in various drug-resistance-forming mechanisms. Our results provide potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic candidates for treating doxorubicin-resistant uterine cancer. ? The Author 2014.

Mutations in human senataxin (SETX), an ortholog yeast protein of Sen1, have been identified to cause the syndrome of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) and juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS4), two types of progressive motor neuron degeneration. However, the relationship between the SETX gene, which is involved in the regulation of RNA processing and DNA repair, and the predisposition for AD remains unclear. In this research, potential association of polymorphisms in the SETX gene with AD was investigated. A case-control study of a Chinese Han population in Taiwan was performed. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3455T>G (rs3739922), 3576T>G (rs1185193) and 7759A>G (rs1056899) were studied. The experimental data showed that upon genotyping of the exonic polymorphism in the SETX gene, the T allele appeared at a lower rate than the G allele at position 3455 in AD patients compared with normal groups (P < 0.05, odds ratio (OR), 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40-0.89). Subjects with the GA genotype at position 7759 have higher incidences of AD development than with the AA genotype (P < 0.05, OR, 6.45, 95% CI, 1.24 to 33.70). Our results also showed that with six haplotypes (Hts) observed from the analyzed polymorphisms, distributions of the Ht4-GAA and Ht5-GCA haplotypes appeared to be significant 'risk' haplotypes between AD patients and controls (both P < 0.05, OR, 8.44, 95% CI, 1.07-66.60). These observations suggest that genetic variations in the SETX gene may contribute to AD pathogenesis in the Taiwanese Han population. ? 2014 by The Chinese Physiological Society and Airiti Press Inc.",Alzheimer's disease; DNA repair; Polymorphism; Senataxin; Transcription,"aged; Alzheimer disease; article; case control study; Chinese; controlled study; exon; female; gene; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; genotype; haplotype; human; major clinical study; male; pathogenesis; SETX gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; Taiwan; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Case-Control Studies; China; DNA Damage; Female; Genotype; Haplotypes; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; RNA Helicases; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84899738117

With survival rates as low as &lt;5 % after five years, it remains a poorly treated cancer. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an antioxidant, was previously proven effective against cancer cells. Nitroimidazole derivatives convert into reactive compounds under hypoxic conditions. In this study, eight methylated NDGAs containing a 2- or 4-nitroimidazole moiety were synthesized as leads against HCC. Four of these conjugates, possessing a poly(ethylene glycol) tether, had superior aqueous solubility. These four NDGA-nitroimidazole conjugates were found to inhibit the proliferation HCC Hep3B cells with IC 50 values between 10 and 15 μM. Furthermore, nitroimidazole- conjugated NDGA derivatives exhibit better antiproliferative activity under hypoxic conditions. High performance at low O2: Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is a natural product that has been used in many medical research fields. A series of novel nitroimidazole-conjugated NDGA compounds were synthesized and shown to possess good activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Hep3B cells.

However, because of the dispersed nature of blood vessels and nerves, global visualization of the graft neurovascular network has been difficult. In this research we revealed the neurovascular network by preparing transparent mouse islet grafts under the kidney capsule with optical clearing to investigate the sympathetic reinnervation via three-dimensional confocal microscopy. Normoglycemic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were used in syngeneic islet transplantation, with both groups maintaining euglycemia after transplantation. Triple staining of insulin/glucagon, blood vessels, and tyrosine hydroxylase (sympathetic marker) was used to reveal the graft microstructure, vasculature, and sympathetic innervation. Three weeks after transplantation, we observed perigraft sympathetic innervation similar to the peri-islet sympathetic innervation in the pancreas. Six weeks after transplantation, prominent intragraft, perivascular sympathetic innervation was achieved, resembling the pancreatic intraislet, perivascular sympathetic innervation in situ. Meanwhile, in diabetic recipients, a higher graft sympathetic nerve density was found compared with grafts in normoglycemic recipients, indicating the graft neural plasticity in response to the physiological difference of the recipients and the resolving power of this imaging approach. Overall, this new graft imaging method provides a useful tool to identify the islet neurovascular complex in an ectopic environment to study islet engraftment. ? 2014 the American Physiological Society.",Graft innervation; Islet transplantation; Neural plasticity; Sympathetic nerves; Three dimensional,glucagon; insulin; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; glucagon; insulin; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; blood vessel; confocal microscopy; kidney capsule; male; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; pancreas islet; pancreas islet alpha cell; pancreas islet transplantation; priority journal; reinnervation; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; sympathetic innervation; sympathetic nerve; adrenergic system; animal; graft innervation; innervation; islet transplantation; kidney; metabolism; pancreas islet; physiology; sympathetic nerves; three dimensional; graft innervation; islet transplantation; neural plasticity; sympathetic nerves; three dimensional; Animals; Glucagon; Insulin; Islets of Langerhans; Islets of Langerhans Transplantation; Kidney; Mice; Neuronal Plasticity; Sympathetic Nervous System,2-s2.0-84899576396

Main Outcome Measures 50-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale, 37-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale, and 12-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale. Results The patients were assessed with the original 50-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale 4 times, at 14, 30, 90, and 180 days after stroke onset. The patients' responses were used for estimating the Rasch scores of the 37-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale and 12-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale. The effect size, standardized response mean, and paired t test were used to compare the group-based responsiveness of the 3 forms (50-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale, 37-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale, 12-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale). Individual-level responsiveness was compared based on the significance of change between the 37-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale and 12-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale. Because up to 13 items of the 50-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale did not meet the Rasch model's assumptions, the significance of change of the 50-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale was not calculated. At the group level, the FM-37 and FM-12 Fugl-Meyer motor scale had sufficient and similar responsiveness. At the individual level, the FM-37 Fugl-Meyer motor scale detected more patients with significant improvement than the FM-12 Fugl-Meyer motor scale. The SC values and category distribution of the FM-37 Fugl-Meyer motor scale were significantly better than those of the FM-12 Fugl-Meyer motor scale (P<.001). Conclusions Although the group-level responsiveness of the 12-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale was sufficient and very similar to that of the 37-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale, the 37-item Fugl-Meyer motor scale had better individual-level responsiveness.

We hypothesized that minoxidil may influence the AR or its downstream signaling. These tests revealed that minoxidil suppressed AR-related functions, decreasing AR transcriptional activity in reporter assays, reducing expression of AR targets at the protein level, and suppressing AR-positive LNCaP cell growth. Dissecting the underlying mechanisms, we found that minoxidil interfered with AR-peptide, AR-coregulator, and AR N/C-terminal interactions, as well as AR protein stability. Furthermore, a crystallographic analysis using the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) revealed direct binding of minoxidil to the AR in a minoxidil-AR-LBD co-crystal model, and surface plasmon resonance assays demonstrated that minoxidil directly bound the AR with a Kd value of 2.6 μM. Minoxidil also suppressed AR-responsive reporter activity and decreased AR protein stability in human hair dermal papilla cells. The current findings provide evidence that minoxidil could be used to treat both cancer and age-related disease, and open a new avenue for applications of minoxidil in treating androgen-AR pathway-related diseases.",Androgen; Androgen receptor; Androgenetic alopecia; Minoxidil,"androgen receptor; minoxidil; androgen receptor; antihypertensive agent; AR protein, human; minoxidil; protein binding; amino terminal sequence; article; carboxy terminal sequence; cell growth; controlled study; crystallography; downstream processing; drug protein binding; human; human cell; ligand binding; nucleotide sequence; protein domain; protein function; protein stability; protein targeting; cell proliferation; drug effects; genetic transfection; male; metabolism; prostate tumor; protein quaternary structure; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; surface plasmon resonance; transcription initiation; tumor cell line; Western blotting; Antihypertensive Agents; Blotting, Western; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Humans; Male; Minoxidil; Prostatic Neoplasms; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Receptors, Androgen; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Transcriptional Activation; Transfection",2-s2.0-84899497916

The 99mTc-labeled PL-PEG-GONRs demonstrated a unique biodistribution pattern of rapid accumulation in and excretion from the liver. Moreover, we determined that the PL-PEG-GNORs were excreted from the body through the renal route in urine, and we used hematological analysis to show that the PL-PEG-GNORs were not toxic in vivo. Furthermore, doxorubicin-loaded PL-PEG-GONRs had IC50 values for chemo-photothermal therapy toward U87 glioma cells that were 6.7-fold lower than the IC50 values in traditional chemotherapy. With these advantages, PL-PEG-GONRs could be used as drug nanocarriers to develop an efficient cancer-therapy strategy that would not only improve the efficacy of the therapy, but would also reduce the risk of side effects of the nanocarrier in the body. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we show that in addition to the nanomaterial-mediated photothermal effects (NmPTT), gold nanoshells (including, nanocages, nanorod-in-shell and nanoparticle-in-shell) not only are able to absorb NIR light, but can also emit fluorescence, sensitize formation of singlet oxygen and exert nanomaterial-mediated photodynamic therapeutic (NmPDT) complete destruction of solid tumors in mice. The modes of NmPDT and NmPTT can be controlled and switched from one to the other by changing the excitation wavelength. In the invitro experiments, gold nanocages and nanorod-in-shell show larger percentage of cellular deaths originating from NmPDT along with the minor fraction of NmPTT effects. In contrast, nanoparticle-in-shell exhibits larger fraction of NmPTT-induced cellular deaths together with minor fraction of NmPDT-induced apoptosis. Fluorescence emission spectra and DPBF quenching studies confirm the generation of singlet O2 upon NIR photoirradiation. Both NmPDT and NmPTT effects were confirmed by measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent sodium azide quenching, heat shock protein expression (HSP 70), singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) sensing, changes in mitochondria membrane potential and apoptosis in the cellular experiments. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that upon irradiation at 980nm under ultra-low doses (~150mW/cm2), gold nanocages mostly exert NmPDT effect to effectively suppress the B16F0 melanoma tumor growth. The combination of NmPDT and NmPTT effects on destruction of solid tumors is far better than pure NmPTT effect by 808nm irradiation and also doxorubicin. Overall, our study demonstrates that gold nanoshells can serve as excellent multi-functional theranostic agents (fluorescence imaging+NmPDT+NmPTT) upon single photon NIR light excitation under ultra-low laser doses. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Cancer treatment; Fluorescent probe; Gold nanoshells; Photodynamic therapy; Photothermal therapy; Singlet oxygen,"Cell death; Diseases; Emission spectroscopy; Experiments; Fluorescence; Gold; Infrared devices; Irradiation; Laser excitation; Mammals; Nanoparticles; Nanorods; Nanoshells; Oncology; Oxygen; Photodynamic therapy; Quenching; Shells (structures); Tumors; Excitation wavelength; Fluorescence emission spectra; Fluorescent probes; Gold nano-shells; Mitochondria membrane potentials; Photothermal therapy; Reactive oxygen species; Singlet oxygen; Nanostructured materials; doxorubicin; gold; heat shock protein 70; nanoshell; nanotube; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; genetics; heat; HeLa cell line; human; laser; light; male; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane potential; mouse; Neoplasms; Animals; Doxorubicin; Gold; HeLa Cells; Hot Temperature; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Lasers; Light; Male; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nanoshells; Nanotubes; Neoplasms; Reactive Oxygen Species",2-s2.0-84899485205

The key focus of this study was the discovery and development of a potential agent for this disease. Materials and Methods Several pharmacological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the apoptotic signaling pathways of moniliformediquinone, a natural product, in hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Results Moniliformediquinone induced cell cycle arrest at the S-phase and subsequent apoptosis in the hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145. Further examination showed that moniliformediquinone induced a DNA damage response associated with Chk1, Chk2, c-Jun and JNK activation. Mitochondrial apoptosis pathways were also activated, including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase-9 and 3. The antioxidant and glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine, and the antioxidant Trolox? completely abolished moniliformediquinone induced generation of reactive oxygen species. However, N-acetylcysteine but not Trolox blocked moniliformediquinone mediated apoptosis and related signaling cascades. Further identification showed that moniliformediquinone alone did not conjugate glutathione but significantly decreased cellular glutathione levels. The in vivo study revealed that moniliformediquinone completely inhibited tumor growth with no weight loss. Conclusions Our data suggest that moniliformediquinone is a potential anticancer agent for hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer by decreasing cellular glutathione, leading to a DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest at the S-phase. Mitochondrial stress also occurs due to moniliformediquinone action through loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, which in turn induce the activation of caspase cascades and apoptotic cell death. ? 2014 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",apoptosis; castration-resistant; Dendrobium; glutathione; mitochondria; prostatic neoplasms,"acetylcysteine; antineoplastic agent; caspase 3; caspase 9; checkpoint kinase 1; checkpoint kinase 2; cytochrome c; glutathione; moniliformediquinone; protein c jun; reactive oxygen metabolite; stress activated protein kinase; trolox C; unclassified drug; acetylcysteine; antineoplastic agent; caspase 2; caspase 7; caspase 8; DNA A; moniliformediquinone; natural product; paclitaxel; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; article; cancer cell culture; cancer inhibition; castration resistant prostate cancer; cell cycle S phase; cell proliferation; cell stress; cell synchronization; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA strand breakage; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; in vitro study; in vivo study; mitochondrial gene; mitochondrial membrane potential; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein secretion; S phase cell cycle checkpoint; tumor volume; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer size; castration resistant prostate cancer; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle progression; cell level; cellular stress response; cytotoxicity; glutathione metabolism; human; human cell; male; mitochondrial stress; mitochondrion; prostate cancer cell line; signal transduction; weight reduction; apoptosis; castration-resistant; Dendrobium; glutathione; mitochondria; prostatic neoplasms; Antineoplastic Agents; DNA Damage; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Glutathione; Humans; Male; Mitochondria; Phenanthrenes; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; Quinones; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-84899044681

We introduce a method to reconstruct causal networks based on exploring phenotype-specific modules in the human interactome and including the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that underlie the joint expression variation of each module. Closely associated eQTLs help anchor the orientation of the network. To overcome the inherent computational complexity of causal network reconstruction, we first deduce the local causality of individual subnetworks using the selected eQTLs and module transcripts. These subnetworks are then integrated to infer a global causal network using a randomfield ranking method, which was motivated by animal sociology. We demonstrate how effectively the inferred causality restores the regulatory structure of the networks that mediate lymph node metastasis in oral cancer. Network rewiring clearly characterizes the dynamic regulatory systems of distinct disease states. This study is the first to associate an RXRB-causal network with increased risks of nodal metastasis, tumor relapse, distant metastases and poor survival for oral cancer. Thus, identifying crucial upstream drivers of a signal cascade can facilitate the discovery of potential biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets. ?

Timely diagnosis of the disease is therefore an extensive research area. Toward this end, C-reactive protein (CRP) has become a reliable biomarker for evaluating risks of cardiovascular diseases. For commercial methods of CRP detection, the diagnosis of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol and the high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) were relatively time-consuming and the sensitivity and the detection limit of the above methods were not satisfactory. Recently, a CRP-specific aptamer (DNA-based) with high sensitivity and specificity was used to detect CRP in a microfluidic system, which was capable of performing the detection in an automated fashion while consuming tiny volumes of reagents and samples. Alternatively, AlGaN/GaN HEMT-based field-effect transistor (FET) sensors have emerged as promising biosensors to detect small molecules, proteins and even viruses, and have demonstrated rapid and highly sensitive detection in a compact system. To date, however, the combination of the microfluidic system, CRP-specific aptamer and high sensitivity FET sensors has not yet attempted.

In normal cells, TDP-43 is primarily an RNA-binding protein; however, how the dimeric TDP-43 binds RNA via its two RNA recognition motifs, RRM1 and RRM2, is not clear. Here we report the crystal structure of human TDP-43 RRM1 in complex with a single-stranded DNA showing that RRM1 binds the nucleic acid extensively not only by the conserved β-sheet residues but also by the loop residues. Mutational and biochemical assays further reveal that both RRMs in TDP-43 dimers participate in binding of UG-rich RNA or TG-rich DNA with RRM1 playing a dominant role and RRM2 playing a supporting role. Moreover, RRM1 of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked mutant D169G binds DNA as efficiently as the wild type; nevertheless, it is more resistant to thermal denaturation, suggesting that the resistance to degradation is likely linked to TDP-43 proteinopathies. Taken together all the data, we suggest a model showing that the two RRMs in each protomer of TDP-43 homodimer work together in RNA binding and thus the dimeric TDP-43 recognizes long clusters of UG-rich RNA to achieve high affinity and specificity. ? 2014 The Author(s).

They have been the primary treatment for cardiovascular diseases since the 1990s. However, after stenting, potential risks associated with restenosis may occur, and several studies have shown that stent design could be one of the critical factors in this process. Computational modeling has been widely used as an important tool to predict the clinical performance of stents and hemodynamic behavior in stented arteries. In this study, computational fluid dynamics models were developed to investigate the effects of cardiovascular stent design on the wall shear stress distribution in straight and curved coronary arteries. Results showed that the stent design pattern alone did not have a significant impact on stent hemodynamics; however, stenting in curved arteries increased the low shear stress area, the region where wall shear stress is less than 5 dynes/cm2, which may lead to a higher restenosis rate. The total surface area of low wall shear stress almost doubled when the angle of artery curvature increased from 0° to 90°. The implication is that stent implantation in a tortuous artery greatly increases the risk of restenosis. The proposed methodology and findings show that the presence of a stent in straight or curved arteries alters the flow field and wall shear stress distribution within arteries, providing great insight for the future design optimization and physician practice to help achieve the best possible clinical outcomes. ? 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",Computational Fluid Dynamics; Coronary Stent; Curved Arteries; Hemodynamics; Restenosis; Wall Shear Stress,Biomedical equipment; Blood vessels; Computational fluid dynamics; Diseases; Hemodynamics; Optimization; Shear stress; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardiovascular stents; Clinical performance; Computational fluid dynamics models; Coronary stents; Curved Arteries; Restenosis; Wall shear stress; Stents; artery blood flow; article; computational fluid dynamics; coronary artery; coronary stent; hemodynamic parameters; priority journal; restenosis; risk factor; risk reduction; shear rate; shear stress; simulation; surface property,2-s2.0-84897396422

However, the effects of sorafenib on tumor desmoplasia-and its consequences on treatment resistance-remain unknown. We demonstrate that sorafenib has differential effects on tumor fibrosis versus liver fibrosis in orthotopic models of HCC in mice. Sorafenib intensifies tumor hypoxia, which increases stromal-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1α) expression in cancer and stromal cells and, subsequently, myeloid differentiation antigen-positive (Gr-1+) myeloid cell infiltration. The SDF-1α/C-X-C receptor type 4 (CXCR4) pathway directly promotes hepatic stellate cell (HSC) differentiation and activation through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. This is consistent with the association between SDF-1α expression with fibrotic septa in cirrhotic liver tissues as well as with desmoplastic regions of human HCC samples. We demonstrate that after treatment with sorafenib, SDF-1α increased the survival of HSCs and their alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen I expression, thus increasing tumor fibrosis. Finally, we show that Gr-1+ myeloid cells mediate HSC differentiation and activation in a paracrine manner. CXCR4 inhibition, using AMD3100 in combination with sorafenib treatment, prevents the increase in tumor fibrosis-despite persistently elevated hypoxia-in part by reducing Gr-1+ myeloid cell infiltration and inhibits HCC growth. Similarly, antibody blockade of Gr-1 reduces tumor fibrosis and inhibits HCC growth when combined with sorafenib treatment. Conclusion: Blocking SDF-1α/CXCR4 or Gr-1+ myeloid cell infiltration may reduce hypoxia-mediated HCC desmoplasia and increase the efficacy of sorafenib treatment. ? 2014 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,"alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; alpha smooth muscle actin; aminotransferase; antigen; aspartate aminotransferase; caspase 3; chemokine receptor CXCR4; collagen type 1; glial fibrillary acidic protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; myeloid differentiation antigen; platelet derived growth factor; plerixafor; selumetinib; sorafenib; stromal cell derived factor 1alpha; unclassified drug; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bone marrow cell; cancer inhibition; cell activation; cell differentiation; cell hypoxia; cell infiltration; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; drug efficacy; enzyme inhibition; experimental liver fibrosis; extracellular matrix; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammatory cell; liver cell carcinoma; male; mouse; myofibroblast; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; stellate cell; stroma cell; tissue oxygenation; Animals; Antigens, CD11b; Carbon Tetrachloride; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Chemokine CXCL12; Disease Models, Animal; Hepatocyte Growth Factor; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C3H; Mice, Knockout; Myeloid Cells; Niacinamide; Phenylurea Compounds; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Receptors, Chemokine; Receptors, CXCR4; Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-84896492282

To make the theranostic strategy effective, single light induced photothermal and photodynamic reagent with dual modal imaging capability is highly desired. Herein, a simple non-covalent approach was adopted to immobilize hydrophobic silicon napthalocyanine bis (trihexylsilyloxide) (SiNc4) photosensitizer onto water dispersible magnetic and fluorescent graphene (MFG) via π-π stacking to yield MFG-SiNc4 functioned as a theranostic nanocarrier. Taking the advantage of broad near infra-red absorption (600-1200nm) by graphene, photosensitizer of any wavelength within this range will facilitate the single light induced phototherapy. Phosphorescence spectra, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) experiments, and 1,3-diphenyl isobenzofuran quenching studies confirm the generation of singlet 1O2 upon photoirradiation. Confocal microscopic images reveal successful internalization of MFG-SiNc4 in HeLa cells; whereas T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of MFG reveal a significant concentration dependent darkening effect. Invitro photodynamic/photothermal therapeutic studies on HeLa cells have demonstrated that the killing efficacy of MFG-SiNc4 using a single light source is ~97.9%, presumably owing to the combined effects of generating reactive oxygen species, local heating, and induction of apoptosis. The developed MFG-SiNc4 may thus be utilized as a potential theranostic nanocarrier for dual modal imaging and phototherapy of cancer cells with single light source for time and cost effective treatments with a minimal therapy dose. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Fluorescence imaging; Graphene; Magnetic resonance imaging; Photodynamic therapy; Photothermal therapy,Cell death; Enzyme inhibition; Fluorescence; Light sources; Magnetic resonance imaging; Photodynamic therapy; Photosensitizers; Concentration-dependent; Confocal microscopic image; Cost effective treatments; Dual-modal imaging; Fluorescence imaging; Phosphorescence spectra; Photothermal therapy; Reactive oxygen species; Graphene; buffer; carbon; graphene; magnetic nanoparticle; nanocarrier; photosensitizing agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; silicon napthalocyanine bis (trihexylsilyloxide); singlet oxygen; unclassified drug; article; cancer cell; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; fluorescence; fluorescence imaging; heating; HeLa cell; human; human cell; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; light; near infrared spectroscopy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phosphorescence; photochemical internalization; photochemical quenching; photodynamic therapy; phototherapy; priority journal; Fluorescence imaging; Graphene; Magnetic resonance imaging; Photodynamic therapy; Photothermal therapy; Fluorescent Dyes; Graphite; HeLa Cells; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neoplasms; Optical Imaging; Organosilicon Compounds; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Porphyrins,2-s2.0-84896032535

Paper-based ELISA (specific to serotype-2 dengue fever), which builds off of our previous studies and a revised previous ELISA procedure, owns multiple advantages: 1) high sensitivity (about 40 times higher than the current ELISA-based approaches, due to our therapeutic-based monoclonal antibody) and specificity (specific to dengue virus serotype-2 nonstructural protein-1 antigens); 2) tiny amount of sample and reagent used for single tests; 3) short operating duration (i.e., rapid diagnostic device); and, 4) inexpensiveness (appropriate for use in all developing and underdeveloped nations of the world). Due to the higher sensitivity and shorter operating duration of paper-based ELISA (compared with conventional ELISA, and lateral flow immunoassays also performed in this study), this study has not only been able to perform the diagnosis of dengue virus serotype-2 nonstructural protein-1 antigens in both buffer system and human serum but also to evaluate dengue virus serotype-2 envelope proteins in the buffer system, thus successfully achieving the first such use of these proteins as the target antigen for the development of diagnostic tools.

Besides enhancing transfection efficiency, the difficulty in gene therapy is how to deliver sufficient gene molecules to the site of interest. Herein, the rational design of surfactant-free lipo-polymersomes (LPPs) to overcome these problems is reported, simultaneously using a lipid-stabilized double emulsion approach. The LPPs are designed to conceal the cationic lipids and plasmid DNA inside the core along with iron oxide nanoparticles/polymer interlayer and a relatively neutral lipid shell to avoid the undesired interaction during circulation, leading to high accumulation in the tumors of mice. Furthermore, guided by an external magnetic field and the folic acid (FA) that target tumors via folate receptor-mediated endocytosis on the cell surface, the vectors demonstrate a 30-40-fold increase in cell uptake. Moreover, this synergistic tumor-targeted approach can enhance a 10-fold increase in in vivo transfection efficacy by promoting the delivery of LPPs to cancer cells and facilitating the endosomal escape of gene molecules. The new insights and capabilities represent a major step in nanovector engineering for safe and efficient gene delivery. ? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A subregional analysis of striatal uptake enables the diagnostic performance to be more powerful. However, the partial volume effect (PVE) induces an underestimation of the true radioactivity concentration in small structures. This work proposes a simple algorithm for subregional analysis of striatal uptake with partial volume correction (PVC) in dopaminergic PET imaging. Methods: The PVC algorithm analyzes the separate striatal subregions and takes into account the PVE based on the recovery coefficient (RC). The RC is defined as the ratio of the PVE-uncorrected to PVE-corrected radioactivity concentration, and is derived from a combination of the traditional volume of interest (VOI) analysis and the large VOI technique. The clinical studies, comprising 11 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 6 healthy subjects, were used to assess the impact of PVC on the quantitative measurements. Simulations on a numerical phantom that mimicked realistic healthy and neurodegenerative situations were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed PVC algorithm. In both the clinical and the simulation studies, the striatal-to-occipital ratio (SOR) values for the entire striatum and its subregions were calculated with and without PVC. Results: In the clinical studies, the SOR values in each structure (caudate, anterior putamen, posterior putamen, putamen, and striatum) were significantly higher by using PVC in contrast to those without. Among the PD patients, the SOR values in each structure and quantitative disease severity ratings were shown to be significantly related only when PVC was used. For the simulation studies, the average absolute percentage error of the SOR estimates before and after PVC were 22.74 % and 1.54 % in the healthy situation, respectively; those in the neurodegenerative situation were 20.69 % and 2.51 %, respectively. Conclusions: We successfully implemented a simple algorithm for subregional analysis of striatal uptake with PVC in dopaminergic PET imaging. The PVC algorithm provides an accurate measure of the SOR in the entire striatum and its subregions, and improves the correlation between the SOR values and the clinical disease severity of PD patients. ? 2013 The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.",Dopaminergic system; Partial volume correction; PET; Striatum; Subregion,"carbidopa; algorithm; article; caudate nucleus; clinical article; clinical study; controlled study; corpus striatum; disease severity; dopaminergic system; female; human; male; mathematical analysis; occipital lobe; Parkinson disease; partial volume correction algorithm; PET-CT scanner; positron emission tomography; priority journal; putamen; quantitative analysis; radioactivity; radiological parameters; simulation; Algorithms; Biological Transport; Dopamine; Dopaminergic Neurons; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Monte Carlo Method; Neostriatum; Occipital Lobe; Parkinsonian Disorders; Positron-Emission Tomography; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-84893184497

Selective internal radiation therapy has been increasingly used as an alternative therapy option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and combined with biodegradable drug carrier systems to improve drug delivery and systemic toxicity. The C-based thermosensitive hydrogel (C/GP), an injectable thermogelling solution crosslinked between C and β-glycerophosphate (GP), was induced as an implanted carrier to combine the 188Re-Tin colloid and Dox as a novel treatment strategy. The compounded hydrogel characteristics, including the gelation time, controlled release of Dox, and morphology, were examined. In the animal study, the biodistribution, scintigraphy, therapeutic efficacy, and histopathology were also evaluated. The characterization results reveal that C/GP/Dox hydrogels have similar gelation times of 4-4.5 min and pore sizes of as small as 10 μm compared with C/GP hydrogels. The C/GP/Dox/ 188Re-Tin colloids have the longest release time for Dox at 2-3 days. In the in vivo experiments, both the biodistribution and scintigraphy studies have the highest hydrogel uptakes in the tumor at different time points, as well as localized radioactivities for a certain time. The therapeutic evaluation indicates that C/GP/Dox/188Re-Tin colloids can more significantly inhibit tumors compared with the control group at 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment.

We previously demonstrated that SCUBE2 is a novel breast-tumor suppressor and could be a useful prognosticmarker. However, the role of SCUBE2 in breast-cancer cellmigration and invasion and how it is regulated during theepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remain undefined. In thisstudy, we showed that ectopic SCUBE2 overexpression couldenhance the formation of E-cadherin-containing adherens junctionsby b-catenin-SOX-mediated induction of forkhead box A1 (apositive regulator of E-cadherin) and upregulation of E-cadherin, which in turn led to epithelial transition and inhibited migration and invasion of aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast-carcinoma cells. SCUBE2 expression was repressed together with that of E-cadherinin TGF-b-induced EMT; direct expression of SCUBE2 alone was sufficient to inhibit the TGF-b-induced EMT. Furthermore, quantitative DNA methylation, methylation-specific PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that SCUBE2 expression was inactivated by DNA hypermethylation at the CpG islands by recruiting and binding DNA methyltransferase 1 during TGF-b-induced EMT. Together, our results suggest that SCUBE2 plays a key role in suppressing breast-carcinoma-cell mobility and invasiveness by increasing the formation of the epithelial E-cadherin-containing adherens junctions to promote epithelial differentiation and drive the reversal of EMT. ? 2014.

Results indicated that the E7(d) get higher immunogenicity than its wild type and the E6 fusion proteins augmented the immunogenicity and antitumor effects of their E7 counterparts. Furthermore, the bivalent vaccine system E7(d) plus E6(d), in the presence of cisplatin, showed the best tumoristatic and tumoricidal effects against established tumors in vivo. Therefore, it can be concluded that this novel therapeutic vaccine system, upon further optimization, may shed new light on clinical management of HPV-related carcinomas. ? 2013 The Author.",cancer vaccine; cisplatin; papillomavirus E6 protein; papillomavirus E7 protein; uterine cervical neoplasms,"antineoplastic agent; bacterial toxin; cancer vaccine; cisplatin; DNA binding protein; E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 18; exotoxin; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; oncogene protein E7, Human papillomavirus type 16; oncoprotein; Papillomavirus E6 protein; protein E7; toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; virulence factor; Wart virus vaccine; animal; article; drug potentiation; immunology; mouse; tumor cell line; uterine cervix tumor; cancer vaccine; cisplatin; papillomavirus E6 protein; papillomavirus E7 protein; uterine cervical neoplasms; ADP Ribose Transferases; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Bacterial Toxins; Cancer Vaccines; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drug Synergism; Exotoxins; Mice; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Oncogene Proteins, Viral; Papillomavirus E7 Proteins; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Virulence Factors",2-s2.0-84891369874

A dose deposition routine to store the deposited energy of the photons during their flights was embedded in the widely used SimSET Monte Carlo code and a user-friendly interface for reading PET and CT images was developed. Dose calculated on ORNL phantom was used to validate the accuracy of this system. The ratios of S value for 99mTc, 18F and 131I computed by this system to those obtained with OLINDA for various organs were ranged from 0.93 to 1.18, which were comparable to that obtained from MCNPX2.6 code (0.88-1.22). Our system developed provides opportunity for tumor dose estimation which cannot be known from the MIRD. The radiation dose can provide useful information in the amount of radioisotopes to be administered in radioimmunotherapy. ? The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

When PMASH was attached to the shell of the DENCs, enhanced dual drug release of PTX/Dox was detected, specifically in intracellular acidic pH environments. The targeting ability of these Trastuzumab-conjugated DENCs was demonstrated with confocal images, which revealed a significantly elevated cellular uptake in HER-2 overexpressing SkBr3 cells. More importantly, an intravenous injection of this co-delivery system followed by magnetic targeting (MT) chemotherapy suppressed cancer growth in vivo more efficiently than the delivery of either PTX or Dox alone. The integration of the functionalities makes this combination therapy system a powerfully new tool for in vitro/in vivo cancer therapy, especially for in HER-2 positive cancers. From the Clinical Editor: Trastuzumab-conjugated pH-sensitive nanocapsules were used in this study for simultaneous targeted delivery of hydrophobic (PTX) and hydrophilic (Dox) anti-cancer agents to HER-2 positive cancer cells. Additional use of magnetic targeting demonstrated superior efficacy of this delivery system compared to PTX or Dox alone. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Co-delivery; Emulsion; HER-2 positive breast cancer; PH sensitive; Trastuzumab,"Breast Cancer; Co deliveries; Hydrophilic and hydrophobic; Intravenous injections; Magnetic nano-particles; pH sensitive; Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Trastuzumab; Chemotherapy; Diseases; Emulsification; Emulsions; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Nanocapsules; Oncology; Monoclonal antibodies; double emulsion nanocapsule; doxorubicin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; nanocapsule; paclitaxel; trastuzumab; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; controlled study; drug conjugation; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug release; drug targeting; female; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; magnetotherapy; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; pH; protein expression; therapy effect; Co-delivery; Emulsion; HER-2 positive breast cancer; pH sensitive; Trastuzumab; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Emulsions; Female; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Mice; Nanocapsules; Neoplasms; Paclitaxel; Receptor, erbB-2",2-s2.0-84891005610

This study was designed to investigate the genetic use of pKillerRed-mem, delivered using complexes of chitosan (CS) and poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γPGA), to intracellularly express a membrane-targeted KillerRed protein that can be used as a potential PS for PDT. Following transfection with CS/pKillerRed/γPGA complexes, a red fluorescence protein of KillerRed was clearly seen at the cellular membranes. When exposed to green-light irradiation, the KillerRed-positive cells produced an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a time-dependent manner. Data from viability assays indicate that ROS have an important role in mediating KillerRed-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and anti-proliferation, suggesting that KillerRed can be used as an intrinsically generated PS for PDT treatments. Notably, the phototoxic reaction of KillerRed toward cells gradually became negligible over time, presumably because of its intracellular degradability. These experimental results demonstrate that this genetically encoded KillerRed is biodegradable and has potential for PDT-induced destruction of diseased cells. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Degradable photosensitizer; Fluorescence protein; Gene therapy; Photocytotoxicity; Reactive oxygen species,Cellular membranes; Degradability; Fluorescence proteins; Photocytotoxicity; Photodynamic therapy (PDT); Reactive oxygen species; Red fluorescence; Therapeutic treatments; Amino acids; Cell death; Cell membranes; Diseases; Gene therapy; Molecular biology; Oxygen; Photodynamic therapy; Proteins; Photosensitizers; chitosan; KillerRed protein; photosensitizing agent; polyglutamic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; apoptosis; article; cell membrane; cell proliferation; cell viability; confocal laser microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; embryo; human; human cell; irradiation; photoactivation; photodynamic therapy; phototoxicity; priority journal; protein expression; protein targeting; skin toxicity; Degradable photosensitizer; Fluorescence protein; Gene therapy; Photocytotoxicity; Reactive oxygen species; Apoptosis; Cell Proliferation; Green Fluorescent Proteins; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Reactive Oxygen Species,2-s2.0-84887016390
