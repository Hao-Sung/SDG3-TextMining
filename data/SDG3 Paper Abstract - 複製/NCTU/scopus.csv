"Graphene Quantum Dots Decorated Gold-Polyaniline Nanowire for Impedimetric Detection of Carcinoembryonic Antigen",2019,"A label-free impedimetric immunosensor based on N, S-graphene quantum dots@Au-polyaniline (N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI) nanowires was fabricated for the quantitative detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The N, S-GQDs and Au-PANI were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal pyrolysis and interfacial polymerization, respectively. Subsequently, 2–9 nm N, S-GQDs are successfully decorated onto 30–50 nm Au-PANI nanowires by Au-thiol linkage to serve as the bifunctional probe for amplifying the electrochemical activity as well as anchoring anti-CEA. The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI nanowires are excellent conducting materials to accelerate the electron transfer, while the formation of CEA antibody-antigen bioconjugates after the addition of CEA significantly increase the charge transfer resistance, and subsequently provides a highly stable and label-free immunoassay platform for the impedimetric detection of CEA. The label-free immunosensor exhibits a wide linear range from 0.5 to 1000 ng mL ?1 with a low detection limit of 0.01 ng mL ?1 . The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI based immunosensor also shows high selectivity and stability over other cancer makers and amino acids. Moreover, this promising platform is successfully applied to the detection of CEA in human serum samples with excellent recovery of (96.0 ± 2.6)–(103 ± 3.8)%. These results clearly demonstrate a newly developed highly efficient and label-free impedimetric immunosensor for the detection of CEA using N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI nanowires as the biosensing probe, which can pave the gateway for the fabrication of high performance and robust impedimetric immunosensor to detect cancer makers in early stage of cancer diagnosis and therapy. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Resistin enhances monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production in human synovial fibroblasts and facilitates monocyte migration",2019,"Background/Aims: The adipocyte-secreting adipokine, resistin, may play a critical role in the modulation of inflammatory diseases. Migration and infiltration of mononuclear cells into inflammatory sites are critical events during the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also known as chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), plays a critical role in the regulation of monocyte migration and infiltration. In this study, we show how resistin promotes MCP-1 expression in OA synovial fibroblasts and monocyte migration. Methods: We used qPCR to detect MCP-1 and miRNA expression. THP-1 migration was investigated by Transwell assay. The Western blotting was used to examine the resistin-mediated signaling pathways. Results: Resistin activated the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, while PI3K, Akt and mTOR inhibitors or small interfering RNAs diminished resistin-induced MCP-1 expression and monocyte migration. We also demonstrate that resistin stimulates MCP-1mediated monocyte migration by suppressing microRNA (miR)-33a and miR-33b via the PI3K, Akt and mTOR signaling pathways. Conclusion: These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of resistin action that may have therapeutic implications for patients with OA. ? 2019 The Author(s).","monocyte chemotactic protein 1; resistin; antagomir; microRNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; MTOR protein, human; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; recombinant protein; resistin; small interfering RNA; target of rapamycin kinase; Akt signaling; Article; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemoluminescence; chemotaxis assay; controlled study; down regulation; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; monocyte; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; synovial fluid; synovium; upregulation; Western blotting; 3' untranslated region; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; cell culture; cell motion; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; fibroblast; gene expression; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; monocyte; osteoarthritis; pathology; RNA interference; signal transduction; synovium; 3' Untranslated Regions; Antagomirs; Cell Movement; Cells, Cultured; Chemokine CCL2; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression; Humans; MicroRNAs; Monocytes; Osteoarthritis; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Recombinant Proteins; Resistin; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Synovial Membrane; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"
"EpiRank: Modeling Bidirectional Disease Spread in Asymmetric Commuting Networks",2019,"Commuting network flows are generally asymmetrical, with commuting behaviors bi-directionally balanced between home and work locations, and with weekday commutes providing many opportunities for the spread of infectious diseases via direct and indirect physical contact. The authors use a Markov chain model and PageRank-like algorithm to construct a novel algorithm called EpiRank to measure infection risk in a spatially confined commuting network on Taiwan island. Data from the country’s 2000 census were used to map epidemic risk distribution as a commuting network function. A daytime parameter was used to integrate forward and backward movement in order to analyze daily commuting patterns. EpiRank algorithm results were tested by comparing calculations with actual disease distributions for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak and enterovirus cases between 2000 and 2008. Results suggest that the bidirectional movement model outperformed models that considered forward or backward direction only in terms of capturing spatial epidemic risk distribution. EpiRank also outperformed models based on network indexes such as PageRank and HITS. According to a sensitivity analysis of the daytime parameter, the backward movement effect is more important than the forward movement effect for understanding a commuting network’s disease diffusion structure. Our evidence supports the use of EpiRank as an alternative network measure for analyzing disease diffusion in a commuting network. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Specific drug delivery efficiently induced human breast tumor regression using a lipoplex by non-covalent association with anti-tumor antibodies",2019,"Background: A cationic liposome-PEG-PEI complex (LPPC) was employed as a carrier for achieving targeted delivery of drug to human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/neu)-expressing breast cancer cells. LPPC can be easily loaded with an anti-tumor drug and non-covalently associated with an anti-tumor antibody such as Herceptin that is clinically used to rapidly form immunoparticles within 1 h. Results: Drug-loaded LPPC have an average size about 250 nm and a zeta potential of about 40 mV. Herceptin was complexed onto surface of the LPPC to form the drug/LPPC/Herceptin complexes. The size of curcumin/LPPC/Herceptin complexes were 280 nm and the zeta potentials were about 23 mV. Targeting ability of this delivery system was demonstrated through specific binding on surface of cells and IVIS images in vivo, which showed specific binding in HER2-positive SKBR3 cells as compared to HER2-negative Hs578T cells. Only the drug/LPPC/Herceptin complexes displayed dramatically increased the cytotoxic activity in cancer cells. Both in vitro and in vivo results indicated that Herceptin adsorbed on LPPC directed the immunocomplex towards HER2/neu-positive cells but not HER2/neu-negative cells. The complexes with either component (curcumin or doxorubicin) used in the LPPC-delivery system provided a better therapeutic efficacy compared to the drug treatment alone and other treatment groups, including clinical dosages of Herceptin and LipoDox, in a xenografted model. Conclusions: LPPC displays important clinical implications by easily introducing a specific targeting characteristic to drugs utilized for breast cancer therapy. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Antibodies; Cells; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Diseases; Drug delivery; Drug dosage; Liposomes; Tumors; Zeta potential; Breast cancer cells; Curcumin; Cytotoxic activities; Doxorubicin; Herceptin; Human epidermal growth factor; Lipo-peg-pei complexes; Therapeutic efficacy; Targeted drug delivery; curcumin; lipoplex; macrogol; polyethyleneimine; rituximab; trastuzumab; antineoplastic agent; curcumin; doxorubicin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; liposome; macrogol; poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(ethyleneimine); polyethyleneimine; trastuzumab; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; Bagg albino mouse; BALB/c nude mouse; breast cancer; cancer inhibition; cancer survival; cell viability; controlled study; drug absorption; drug binding; drug clearance; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug megadose; drug structure; drug targeting; female; Hs 578T cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nanoencapsulation; NOD SCID mouse; nonhuman; particle size; SK-BR-3 cell line; tumor regression; tumor xenograft; zeta potential; analogs and derivatives; animal; breast tumor; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug release; immunology; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; pathology; surface property; xenograft; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Curcumin; Doxorubicin; Drug Liberation; Female; Heterografts; Humans; Liposomes; MCF-7 Cells; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Particle Size; Polyethylene Glycols; Polyethyleneimine; Receptor, ErbB-2; Surface Properties; Trastuzumab"
"Image-based EEG signal processing for driving fatigue prediction",2019,"This study proposes a EEG-based prediction system that transform the measured EEG record into an image-liked data for estimating the drowsiness level of drivers. Drowsy driving is one of the main factors to the occurrence of traffic accident. Since drivers themselves may not always immediately recognize that they are in the drowsy state, the risk of traffic accident increases while the driver is in the low vigilance state. In order to address this problem, the estimation of drowsy driving state via brain-computer interfaces (BCI) becomes a major concern in the driving safety field. This study transforms the measured EEG record into a image-liked feature maps, and then passes these feature maps to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn the discriminative representations. The proposed drowsiness prediction system is evaluated by leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The results indicate that our approach provides impressive and robust prediction performance on the EEG dataset without artifact removal process. ? 2018 IEEE.","Accidents; Automation; Brain computer interface; Fatigue of materials; Forecasting; Human computer interaction; Interface states; Neural networks; Process control; Artifact removal; Convolutional neural network; Cross validation; Driving fatigue; Drowsy driving; EEG signal processing; Prediction systems; Robust predictions; Biomedical signal processing"
"Colorimetric and Fluorescent Dual-Mode Immunoassay Based on Plasmon-Enhanced Fluorescence of Polymer Dots for Detection of PSA in Whole Blood",2019,"Although enormous efforts have been devoted to the development of new types of fluorometric immunochromatographic test strip (ICTS) with improved sensitivity over the past years, it still remains a big challenge to design ICTS with colorimetric and fluorescent bimodal signal readout for rapid yet accurate detection of cancer markers in a clinic. Scientists have tried to prepare bimodal reporters by combining fluorescent dyes with metal nanomaterials, but their fluorescence was easily quenched by metal nanomaterials through surface energy transfer, making dual colorimetric and fluorometric ICTS very difficult to be achieved. As compared to conventional fluorescent probes, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) exhibit extraordinary fluorescence brightness and facile surface functionalization, which are very suitable to be engineered as bimodal signal reporting reagents. Here, we integrated highly fluorescent Pdots with strongly plasmonic Au nanorods to form Pdot-Au hybrid nanocomposites with dual colorimetric and fluorescent readout abilities. We further utilized these nanohybrids in ICTS for qualitatively fast screening (colorimetry) as well as quantitatively accurate determination (fluorometry) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) within 10 min. By taking advantage of the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence of Pdots on Au nanorods, this immunoassay possesses much better detection sensitivity of 1.07 pg/mL for PSA, which is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional fluorometric ICTS. Moreover, the direct detection of PSA from human whole blood collected without sample pretreatment makes this Pdot-based ICTS platform promising for on-site point-of-care diagnostics. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Antigens; Biomarkers; Blood; Color; Colorimetry; Energy transfer; Gold; Immunology; Nanorods; Nanostructured materials; Plasmonics; Plasmons; Polymers; Detection sensitivity; Dual modes; Enhanced fluorescence; Hybrid nanocomposites; Point of care diagnostic; Prostate specific antigen; Surface Functionalization; Whole blood; Fluorescence; fluorescent dye; nanocomposite; polymer; prostate specific antigen; quantum dot; chemistry; colorimetry; fluorescent antibody technique; human; immunoassay; isolation and purification; limit of detection; procedures; semiconductor; Colorimetry; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Immunoassay; Limit of Detection; Nanocomposites; Polymers; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Quantum Dots; Semiconductors"
"A novel AURKA mutant-induced early-onset severe hepatocarcinogenesis greater than wild-type via activating different pathways in Zebrafish",2019,"Aurora A kinase (AURKA) is an important regulator in mitotic progression and is overexpressed frequently in human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Many AURKA mutations were identified in cancer patients. Overexpressing wild-type Aurka developed a low incidence of hepatic tumors after long latency in mice. However, none of the AURKA mutant animal models have ever been described. The mechanism of mutant AURKA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis is still unclear. A novel AURKA mutation with a.a.352 Valine to Isoleucine (V352I) was identified from clinical specimens. By using liver-specific transgenic fish overexpressing both the mutant and wild-type AURKA, the AURKA(V352I)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis was earlier and much more severe than wild-type AURKA. Although an increase of the expression of lipogenic enzyme and lipogenic factor was observed in both AURKA(V352I) and AURKA(WT) transgenic fish, AURKA(V352I) has a greater probability to promote fibrosis at 3 months compared to AURKA(WT). Furthermore, the expression levels of cell cycle/proliferation markers were higher in the AURKA(V352I) mutant than AURKA(WT) in transgenic fish, implying that the AURKA(V352I) mutant may accelerate HCC progression. Moreover, we found that the AURKA(V352I) mutant activates AKT signaling and increases nuclear β-catenin, but AURKA(WT) only activates membrane form β-catenin, which may account for the differences. In this study, we provide a new insight, that the AURKA(V352I) mutation contributes to early onset hepatocarcinogenesis, possibly through activation of different pathways than AURKA(WT). This transgenic fish may serve as a drug-screening platform for potential precision medicine therapeutics. ? 2019 by the authors.","aurora A kinase; beta catenin; carbohydrate responsive element binding protein; cell protein; connective tissue growth factor; cycline; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; fatty acid synthase; heparanase; isoleucine; mammalian target of rapamycin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatidate phosphatase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase B; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; unclassified drug; valine; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; AURKA gene; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cell cycle; cell proliferation; cola1a1 gene; controlled study; ctgfa gene; disease severity; fibrosis; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; gene overexpression; hpse gene; liver carcinogenesis; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; transgenic fish; upregulation; zebra fish"
"Andrographolide and its potent derivative exhibit anticancer effects against imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cells by downregulating the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein",2019,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is clinically treated with imatinib, which inhibits the kinase activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. However, imatinib resistance remains a common clinical issue. Andrographolide, the major compound of the medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata, was reported to exhibit anticancer activity. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of andrographolide and its derivative, NCTU-322, against both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant human CML cell lines. Both andrographolide and NCTU-322 downregulated the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in imatinib-resistant CML cells through an Hsp90-dependent mechanism similar to that observed in imatinib-sensitive CML cells. In addition, NCTU-322 had stronger effects than andrographolide on downregulation of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, induction of Hsp90 cleavage and cytotoxicity of CML cells. Notably, andrographolide and NCTU-322 could induce differentiation, mitotic arrest and apoptosis of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells. Finally, the anticancer activity of NCTU-322 against imatinib-resistant CML cells was demonstrated in vivo. In summary, our data demonstrated that andrographolide and NCTU-322 inhibit Bcr-abl function via a mechanism different from that of imatinib, and they induced multiple anticancer effects in both imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML cells. Our findings demonstrate that andrographolide and NCTU-322 are potential therapeutic agents again CML. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","alanine aminotransferase; andrographolide; antineoplastic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; BCR ABL protein; caspase 3; creatinine; diterpenoid; glycoprotein E1; heat shock protein 90; histone H3; imatinib; nctu 322; STAT5 protein; unclassified drug; andrographolide; antineoplastic agent; diterpene; imatinib; Andrographis paniculata; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer resistance; cell cycle; cell differentiation; cell viability; chronic myeloid leukemia; controlled study; cytoplasm; down regulation; drug mechanism; human; human cell; IC50; in vivo study; K-562 cell line; KBM-5 cell line; leukemia cell; metaphase; missense mutation; mitosis inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein function; urea nitrogen blood level; Western blotting; cell cycle checkpoint; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; chronic myeloid leukemia; drug effect; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; mononuclear cell; oncogene; physiology; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Diterpenes; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, abl; Humans; Imatinib Mesylate; Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Molecular Structure"
"Label-free chemical imaging flow cytometry by high-speed multicolor stimulated Raman scattering",2019,"Combining the strength of flow cytometry with fluorescence imaging and digital image analysis, imaging flow cytometry is a powerful tool in diverse fields including cancer biology, immunology, drug discovery, microbiology, and metabolic engineering. It enables measurements and statistical analyses of chemical, structural, and morphological phenotypes of numerous living cells to provide systematic insights into biological processes. However, its utility is constrained by its requirement of fluorescent labeling for phenotyping. Here we present label-free chemical imaging flow cytometry to overcome the issue. It builds on a pulse pair-resolved wavelength-switchable Stokes laser for the fastest-to-date multicolor stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy of fast-flowing cells on a 3D acoustic focusing microfluidic chip, enabling an unprecedented throughput of up to ?140 cells/s. To show its broad utility, we use the SRS imaging flow cytometry with the aid of deep learning to study the metabolic heterogeneity of microalgal cells and perform marker-free cancer detection in blood. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"Experimental investigation of sterilization efficacy of green nails symptom and gray nails using an argon-based round atmospheric-pressure plasma jet",2019,"In recent years, plasma biomedicine has attracted increasing attention as a promising method of sterilization and other biomedical applications. This research aims to develop and characterize an argon-based non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) with an application of sterilization and nail disease treatment. We characterized the electric properties by an electrical measurement system and quantified the active species in APPJ by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The gas temperature of plasma jet is below 37°C, which is generally free of thermal damage for the human body. The results of OES measurement indicate that this APPJ has a high intensity of hydroxyl radicals (OH?), which has shown promise in killing microorganisms. The preliminary result from inactivation experiments also show that APPJ efficiently kills bacteria (P. aeruginosa) and yeast (C. albicans). Furthermore, we used bovine hoof as a surrogate model for human nails for penetration tests. The results demonstrated that argon APPJ is good in inhibition of P. aeruginosa (90% in 5 min) and C. albicans (76% in 5 min) on agar plates. In addition, antimicrobial tests showed that approximately 2-log and 4-log reduction can be reached for P. aeruginosa and C. albicans in 5 min, respectively, when the argon APPJ was applied with them deposited at the back of the bovine hoof. We attribute the latter which contradicts with the former may be caused by many possible factors, which include the biofilm formation of the P. aeruginosa on the bovine hoof, the nature and the size difference of these two pathogens. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agar; hydroxyl radical; animal experiment; Article; bovine; Candida albicans; green nail syndrome; hoof and claw; human; low level laser therapy; nail disease; nonhuman; optical emission spectroscopy; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; scanning electron microscopy; spectroscopy; temperature"
"Large-area blade-coated organic solar cells processed from halogen-free solvent",2019,"High performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are generally prepared by halogenated solvents, which are detrimental to the environment and human health. The replacement of hazardous halogenated solvents is a priority in the commercialization of solution-processed OSCs. In this study, poly[4,8?bis(5?(2?ethylhexyl)thiophen?2?yl)benzo[1,2?b;4,5?b’]dithiophene?2,6?diyl?alt?(4?(2?ethylhexyl)?3?fluorothieno[3,4?b]thiophene?)?2?carboxylate?2?6-diyl)] (PBDTTT?EFT):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)-based device processed with binary halogen-free solvents (toluene and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) is fabricated by blade-coating method. Through the combination of morphological manipulation of active layer and interfacial engineering, the resulting OSCs deliver a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.09%. Importantly, large-area (216 cm2) blade-coated bulk-heterojunction OSCs is also demonstrated, and the resulting devices deliver a high PCE up to 5.03%, which is comparable to those of the devices processed with halogenated solvents (PCE = 5.20%). Additionally, the devices processed with halogen-free solvents also exhibit superior stability, maintaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 3960 h of continuous operation. More encouragingly, halogen-free solvents-based manufacturing process can also be performed under ambient conditions, and a moderate PCE of 3.67% is attained for large-area (216 cm2) OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 3.67% represents the highest efficiency ever reported for air-processed large-area OSCs. This work paves the way towards the realization of environmentally-friendly large-area OSCs with high performance and long-term stability. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Butyric acid; Carboxylation; Coatings; Efficiency; Halogenation; Heterojunctions; Organic solvents; Air processing; Blade coatings; Halogen-free; Large area; Manufacturing process; Morphological manipulations; N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; Power conversion efficiencies; Organic solar cells"
"Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A overexpression promotes liver cancer development in transgenic zebrafish via activation of ERK and β-catenin pathways",2019,"Dysregulation of the enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is known to promote tumorigenesis. Our recent study demonstrated that ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPIA), a key regulator of the PPP, regulates hepatoma cell proliferation and colony formation. Our studies in zebrafish reveal that RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and β-catenin signaling. To further investigate RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis, two independent lines of transgenic zebrafish expressing human RPIA in the liver were generated. These studies reveal that RPIA overexpression triggers lipogenic factor/enzyme expression, steatosis, fibrosis and proliferation of the liver. In addition, the severity of fibrosis and the extent of proliferation are positively correlated with RPIA expression levels. Furthermore, RPIA-mediated induction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires the ERK and β-catenin signaling pathway but is not dependent upon transaldolase levels. Our study presents a mechanism for RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis and suggests that RPIA represents a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","beta catenin; isomerase; mitogen activated protein kinase; ribose 5 phosphate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; enzyme activation; fatty liver; human; human cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transgenic zebrafish; xenotransplantation"

"Lost in style: Gaze-driven Adaptive Aid for VR Navigation",2019,"A key challenge for virtual reality level designers is striking a balance between maintaining the immersiveness of VR and providing users with on-screen aids after designing a virtual experience. These aids are often necessary for wayfnding in virtual environments with complex paths. We introduce a novel adaptive aid that maintains the effectiveness of traditional aids, while equipping designers and users with the controls of how often help is displayed. Our adaptive aid uses gaze patterns in predicting user’s need for navigation aid in VR and displays mini-maps or arrows accordingly. Using a dataset of gaze angle sequences of users navigating a VR environment and markers of when users requested aid, we trained an LSTM to classify user’s gaze sequences as needing navigation help and display an aid. We validated the efcacy of the adaptive aid for wayfnding compared to other commonly-used wayfnding aids. ? 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Classification (of information); Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Navigation; Virtual reality; Games/Play; Gaze angles; Immersiveness; Navigation aids; Virtual/Augmented reality; Eye tracking"
"Increased brain entropy of resting-state fMRI mediates the relationship between depression severity and mental health-related quality of life in late-life depressed elderly",2019,"Background: Entropy analysis is a computational method used to quantify the complexity in a system, and loss of brain complexity is hypothesized to be related to mental disorders. Here, we applied entropy analysis to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signal in subjects with late-life depression (LLD), an illness combined with emotion dysregulation and aging effect. Methods: A total of 35 unremitted depressed elderly and 22 control subjects were recruited. Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis was performed in the entire brain, 90 automated anatomical labeling-parcellated ROIs, and five resting networks in each study participant. Limitations: Due to ethical concerns, all the participants were under medication during the study. Results: Regionally, subjects with LLD showed decreased entropy only in the right posterior cingulate gyrus but had universally increased entropy in affective processing (putamen and thalamus), sensory, motor, and temporal nodes across different time scales. We also found higher entropy in the left frontoparietal network (FPN), which partially mediated the negative correlation between depression severity and mental components of the quality of life, reflecting the possible neural compensation during depression treatment. Conclusion: MSE provides a novel and complementary approach in rs-fMRI analysis. The temporal-spatial complexity in the resting brain may provide the adaptive variability beneficial for the elderly with depression. ? 2019","adult; aged; aging; Article; brain; clinical article; controlled study; emotion; entropy; female; frontoparietal cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Geriatric Depression Scale; geriatric patient; human; late life depression; male; mental health; posterior cingulate; priority journal; putamen; quality of life; thalamus; brain; brain mapping; cingulate gyrus; depression; entropy; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychology; quality of life; rest; antidepressant agent; Aged; Antidepressive Agents; Brain; Brain Mapping; Depressive Disorder; Entropy; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Rest; Thalamus"
"Vaccinia viral A26 protein is a fusion suppressor of mature virus and triggers membrane fusion through conformational change at low pH",2019,"Vaccinia mature virus requires A26 envelope protein to mediate acid-dependent endocytosis into HeLa cells in which we hypothesized that A26 protein functions as an acid-sensitive membrane fusion suppressor. Here, we provide evidence showing that N-terminal domain (aa1-75) of A26 protein is an acid-sensitive region that regulates membrane fusion. Crystal structure of A26 protein revealed that His48 and His53 are in close contact with Lys47, Arg57, His314 and Arg312, suggesting that at low pH these His-cation pairs could initiate conformational changes through protonation of His48 and His53 and subsequent electrostatic repulsion. All the A26 mutant mature viruses that interrupted His-cation pair interactions of His48 and His 53 indeed have lost virion infectivity. Isolation of revertant viruses revealed that second site mutations caused frame shifts and premature termination of A26 protein such that reverent viruses regained cell entry through plasma membrane fusion. Together, we conclude that viral A26 protein functions as an acid-sensitive fusion suppressor during vaccinia mature virus endocytosis. ? 2019 Chang et al.","granulocyte marker monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody; mutant protein; recombinant protein; selenomethionine; trypsin; unclassified drug; viral A26 protein; virus envelope protein; viral protein; affinity chromatography; amino acid sequence; animal cell; Article; BSC40 cell line; circular dichroism; column chromatography; controlled study; crystal structure; electron microscopy; endocytosis; endosome; expression vector; gene cassette; gene deletion; gene mutation; human; human cell; immunoblotting; membrane fusion; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; pH; phenotype; protein expression; protein function; protein purification; RNA translation; sequence analysis; sequence homology; site directed mutagenesis; vaccinia; Vaccinia virus; virus assembly; virus core; virus infectivity; virus isolation; virus load; virus plaque; virus replication; whole genome sequencing; animal; Chlorocebus aethiops; endocytosis; genetics; HeLa cell line; metabolism; mouse; pH; virus entry; Animals; Cercopithecus aethiops; Endocytosis; HeLa Cells; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Membrane Fusion; Mice; Vaccinia virus; Viral Proteins; Virus Internalization"
"Equal treatment efficacy of direct-acting antivirals in patients with chronic hepatitis C and hepatocellular carcinoma? A prospective cohort study",2019,"Objective The treatment outcome of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in chronic hepatitis C patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. The current study aimed to address the treatment efficacy and safety of DAAs in patients with curative or active HCC, compared with those of patients without HCC. Design A prospective cohort study Setting A medical centre and two regional hospitals in Taiwan Participants A total of 713 Taiwanese patients (601 non-HCC, 74 curative HCC and 38 active HCC patients) who received standard-of-care DAAs were consecutively enrolled in the study. Main outcome measurement The primary objective was to determine treatment efficacy, defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA throughout 12 weeks of the post-treatment follow-up period (sustained virological response 12 [SVR12]). Results The overall SVR12 rate was 96.9%. The SVR12 rate was similar between the patients with HCC and those without HCC (95.5% vs 97.2%, p=0.37). The HCC patients were divided into two groups, those with curative HCC and those with viable HCC; a substantially but not significantly lower SVR rate, 92.1% (35/38), was observed in the patients with viable HCC compared with the SVR rate, 97.3% (72/74), in those with curative HCC (p=0.33). Compared with the patients with curative HCC, the patients with viable HCC had a significantly higher proportion of serious adverse events (10.5% vs 1.0%, p=0.002), early treatment discontinuation (10.5% vs 2.8%, p=0.03) and mortality (5.3% vs 0.1%, p=0.008). Conclusions An equivalently high SVR rate was observed in patients with either past or active HCC compared with those without HCC. The safety concerns in the HCC patients did not compromise treatment efficacy. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"Alternative splicing in human cancer cells is modulated by the amiloride derivative 3,5-diamino-6-chloro-N-(N-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)carbamimidoyl)pyrazine-2-carboxide",2019,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a process that enables the generation of multiple protein isoforms with different biological properties from a single mRNA. Cancer cells often use the maneuverability conferred by AS to produce proteins that contribute to growth and survival. In our previous studies, we identified that amiloride modulates AS in cancer cells. However, the effective concentration of amiloride required to modulate AS is too high for use in cancer treatment. In this study, we used computational algorithms to screen potential amiloride derivatives for their ability to regulate AS in cancer cells. We found that 3,5-diamino-6-chloro-N-(N-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)carbamimidoyl)pyrazine-2-carboxamide (BS008) can regulate AS of apoptotic gene transcripts, including HIPK3, SMAC, and BCL-X, at a lower concentration than amiloride. This splicing regulation involved various splicing factors, and it was accompanied by a change in the phosphorylation state of serine/arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins). RNA sequencing was performed to reveal that AS of many other apoptotic gene transcripts, such as AATF, ATM, AIFM1, NFKB1, and API5, was also modulated by BS008. In?vivo experiments further indicated that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with BS008 resulted in a marked decrease in tumor size. BS008 also had inhibitory effects in?vitro, either alone or in a synergistic combination with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents sorafenib and nilotinib. BS008 enabled sorafenib dose reduction without compromising antitumor activity. These findings suggest that BS008 may possess therapeutic potential for cancer treatment. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Noise Rejection for Wearable ECGs Using Modified Frequency Slice Wavelet Transform and Convolutional Neural Networks",2019,"Progress in wearable techniques makes the long-term daily electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring possible. However, the long-term wearable ECGs can be significantly contaminated by various noises, which affect the detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The situation becomes more serious for wearable ECG screening, where the data are huge, and doctors have no way to visually check the signal quality episode-by-episode. Therefore, automatic and accurate noise rejection for the wearable big-data ECGs is craving. This paper addressed this issue and proposed a noise rejection method for wearable ECGs based on the combination of modified frequency slice wavelet transform (MFSWT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Wearable ECGs were recorded using the newly developed 12-lead Lenovo smart ECG vest with a sample rate of 500 Hz and a resolution of 16 bit. One thousand 10-s ECG segments were picked up and were manually labeled into three quality types: clinically useful segments with good signal quality (type A), clinically useful segments with poor signal quality (type B), and clinically useless segments (pure noises, type C). Each of the 1,000 10-s ECG segments were transformed into a 2-D time-frequency (T-F) image using the MFSWT, with a pixel size of 200 × 50. Then, the 2-D grayscale images from MFSWT were fed into a 13-layer CNN model for training the classification models. Results from the standard 5-folder cross-validation showed that the proposed combination method of MFSWT and CNN achieved a highest classification accuracy of 86.3%, which was higher than the comparable methods from continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The combination of MFSWT and CNN also had a good calculation efficiency. This paper indicated that the combination of MFSWT and CNN is a potential method for automatic identification of noisy segments from wearable ECG recordings. ? 2013 IEEE.","Automation; Biomedical signal processing; Convolution; Data visualization; Electrocardiography; Neural networks; Wearable technology; Automatic identification; Cardio-vascular disease; Classification accuracy; Continuous wavelet transforms; Convolutional neural network; Frequency slice wavelet transforms; Signal quality assessment; Wearable ECG; Wavelet transforms"
"A silicon-based coral-like nanostructured microfluidics to isolate rare cells in human circulation: Validation by SK-BR-3 cancer cell line and its utility in circulating fetal nucleated red blood cells",2019,"Circulating fetal cells (CFCs) in maternal blood are rare but have a strong potential to be the target for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD). ""Cell Reveal TM system"" is a silicon-based microfluidic platform capable to capture rare cell populations in human circulation. The platform is recently optimized to enhance the capture efficiency and system automation. In this study, spiking tests of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells were used for the evaluation of capture efficiency. Then, peripheral bloods from 14 pregnant women whose fetuses have evidenced non-maternal genomic markers (e.g., de novo pathogenic copy number changes) were tested for the capture of circulating fetal nucleated red blood cells (fnRBCs). Captured cells were subjected to fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on chip or recovered by an automated cell picker for molecular genetic analyses. The capture rate for the spiking tests is estimated as 88.1%. For the prenatal study, 2-71 fnRBCs were successfully captured from 2 mL of maternal blood in all pregnant women. The captured fnRBCs were verified to be from fetal origin. Our results demonstrated that the Cell Reveal TM system has a high capture efficiency and can be used for fnRBC capture that is feasible for the genetic diagnosis of fetuses without invasive procedures. ? 2019 by the authors.","Biochips; Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Diagnosis; Diseases; Efficiency; Microfluidics; Nanostructures; Silicon; Breast cancer cells; Capture efficiency; cbNIPD; Fluorescent in situ hybridization; FnRBC; Microfluidic platforms; Nucleated red blood cells; System automa-tion; Blood"
"Assessment and Optimization of the Circadian Performance of Smartphone-Based Virtual Reality Displays",2019,"The non-visual effects of blue light in displays mean that excessive use of smartphones can disturb the human circadian rhythm. Thus, the impact of virtual reality (VR) headsets, which are worn closer to the human eye, may be even more serious. In this paper, based on non-visual parameters, such as the circadian action factor (CAF) and circadian illuminance, the circadian performance of smartphone-based VR displays is quantitatively evaluated by an evaluation system we designed. Moreover, we investigate the improvements in the circadian performance of VR headsets resulting from three practical methods for reducing the blue light content. Finally, a theoretical method of shifting the green-light wavelength of the screen close to 555 nm to optimize the CAF of VR headsets is proposed. Overall, the results of this paper are of significant value in quantifying the effects of VR displays on circadian rhythms and improving the safety of VR headsets with regard to human health. ? 2019 IEEE.","Display devices; Measurement; Room and pillar mining; Smartphones; Spectrum analysis; Action factors; Circadian rhythms; Green light; Human health; Optimization method; Practical method; Theoretical methods; Virtual-reality display; Virtual reality"
"Design of a wearable 12-lead noncontact electrocardiogram monitoring system",2019,"A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important tool in the diagnosis of heart diseases. Here, Ag/AgCl electrodes with conductive gels are usually used in a 12-lead ECG system to access biopotentials. However, using Ag/AgCl electrodes with conductive gels might be inconvenient in a prehospital setting. In previous studies, several dry electrodes have been developed to improve this issue. However, these dry electrodes have contact with the skin directly, and they might be still unsuitable for patients with wounds. In this study, a wearable 12-lead electrocardiogram monitoring system was proposed to improve the above issue. Here, novel noncontact electrodes were also designed to access biopotentials without contact with the skin directly. Moreover, by using the mechanical design, this system allows the user to easily wear and take off the device and to adjust the locations of the noncontact electrodes. The experimental results showed that the proposed system could exactly provide a good ECG signal quality even while walking and could detect the ECG features of the patients with myocardial ischemia, installation pacemaker, and ventricular premature contraction. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Lipo-PEG-PEI complex as an intracellular transporter for protein therapeutics",2019,"Background: Protein or peptide drugs are emerging therapeutics for treating human diseases. However, current protein drugs are typically limited to acting on extracellular/cell membrane components associated with the diseases, while intracellular delivery of recombinant proteins replaces or replenishes faulty/missing proteins and remains inadequate. In this study, we developed a convenient and efficient intracellular protein delivery vehicle. Materials and methods: A cationic liposomal polyethylenimine and polyethylene glycol complex (LPPC) was developed to noncovalently capture proteins for protein transfer into cells via endocytosis. β-glucuronidase (βG) was used in vitro and in vivo as a model enzyme to demonstrate the enzymatic activity of the intracellular transport of a protein. Results: The endocytosed protein/LPPC complexes escaped from lysosomes, and the bound protein dissociated from LPPC in the cytosol. The enzymatic activity of βG was well preserved after intracellular delivery in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Using LPPC as an intracellular protein transporter for protein therapeutics, we illustrated that LPPC may be an effective and convenient tool for studying diseases and developing therapeutics. ? 2019 Lin et al.","beta glucuronidase; bovine serum albumin; fluorescein isothiocyanate; liposome polyethylene glycol polyethyleneimine complex; polymer; unclassified drug; beta glucuronidase; enhanced green fluorescent protein; green fluorescent protein; liposome; macrogol; poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(ethyleneimine); polyethyleneimine; protein; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cytosol; cytotoxicity; dissociation; drug activity; drug distribution; drug stability; drug tissue level; drug transport; endocytosis; female; in vitro study; in vivo study; lysosome; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; tissue distribution; zeta potential; 3T3 cell line; adsorption; analogs and derivatives; animal; Bagg albino mouse; bovine; cell death; chemistry; fluorescence; Hep-G2 cell line; human; intracellular space; metabolism; protein stability; static electricity; 3T3 Cells; Adsorption; Animals; Cattle; Cell Death; Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate; Fluorescence; Glucuronidase; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Intracellular Space; Liposomes; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Particle Size; Polyethylene Glycols; Polyethyleneimine; Protein Stability; Proteins; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Static Electricity"

"Deep learning with evolutionary and genomic profiles for identifying cancer subtypes",2019,"Cancer subtype identification is an unmet need in precision diagnosis. Recently, evolutionary conservation has been indicated to contain informative signatures for functional significance in cancers. However, the importance of evolutionary conservation in distinguishing cancer subtypes remains largely unclear. Here, we identified the evolutionarily conserved genes (i.e. core genes) and observed that they are primarily involved in cellular pathways relevant to cell growth and metabolisms. By using these core genes, we developed two novel strategies, namely a feature-based strategy (FES) and an image-based strategy (IMS) by integrating their evolutionary and genomic profiles with the deep learning algorithm. In comparison with the FES using the random set and the strategy using the PAM50 classifier, the core gene set-based FES achieved a higher accuracy for identifying breast cancer subtypes. The IMS and FES using the core gene set yielded better performances than the other strategies, in terms of classifying both breast cancer subtypes and multiple cancer types. Moreover, the IMS is reproducible even using different gene expression data (i.e. RNA-seq and microarray). Comprehensive analysis of eight cancer types demonstrates that our evolutionary conservation-based models represent a valid and helpful approach for identifying cancer subtypes and the core gene set offers distinguishable clues of cancer subtypes. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.",""
"System accuracy assessments with a blood glucose meter with combined glucose and ?-hydroxybutyrate measurement capabilities",2019,"Background: We evaluated the Wellion Galileo GLU/KET blood and ketone (?-Hydroxybutyrate, ?-OHB) meter to demonstrate that it meets ISO15107:2015 regulatory approval criteria. Research Design and Methods: A total of 100 subjects (52 female, age: 30 to 84?years, diabetes: 10 type 1/90 type 2) with blood glucose levels distributed over the entire measurement range as required by the ISO15197 protocol were tested (double determinations with 3 strip lots and two devices). A similar test protocol was followed to test ?-OHB strip performance (reference devices: YSI 2300plus for glucose and STANBIO ?-HOB LiquiColor TestKit for ?-OHB). Precision was tested for glucose with 3 blood glucose concentrations (?-OHB: 2 control solutions). Results: All glucose test-strip lots met the strict ISO acceptance criteria. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) was 4.9% and all data pairs were in zone A of the consensus error grid. The ?-OHB test-strips also met the pre-defined acceptance criteria. Within-run and between-run precision was calculated to be 2.3% and 0.7% for the glucose strips (3.7%/0.8% for the ketone strips).

"Association between neighborhood greenspace and fasting plasma glucose from a large cohort study in Taiwan",2019,"Growing evidence suggests that greenness exposure improves health status, but few studies address diabetes, and research mainly comes from Western countries. This study hypothesizes that higher greenness exposure benefits glucose control with increased intensity of physical activity. We used data from a longitudinal health examination database in Taiwan during 2000–2014. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as an objective indicator of greenness in the neighborhood. Fasting plasma glucose served as an indicator of early diabetes diagnosis. A metabolic equivalent value (MET) based on a compendium of physical activities was used to estimate the intensity of physical activity. We applied a linear mixed-effect model with an individual-level random effect to investigate the relationship between neighborhood greenness and the fasting plasma glucose value stratified by four levels of physical activity. There are 341,211 participants with no diabetes, and 773,602 check-up visits included here. The fasting glucose among participants living in areas with higher green space was lower than that of those living in less green areas. The beneficial effects of greenspace on glucose were stronger for those with more physical activity, especially in the 500-m buffer. In the physically inactive group, compared with the lowest quantile (Q1) of cumulative average greenness, people living in the highest quantile (Q4) of greenness had 0.35 mg less glucose in each dl of plasma [95% confidence interval: ?0.50, ?0.20]. In the physically active group, people residing in the highest quantile (Q4) of greenness had 0.48 mg less glucose in each dl of plasma [95% confidence interval: ?0.73, ?0.23]. Higher residential greenness appears to be associated with lower glucose. Higher physical activity can mediate this association. Our results provide evidence that ensuring access to greenspace in residential neighborhoods may provide positive health outcomes and improve public health, and should be implemented in urban planning. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH","diabetes; glucose; greenspace; NDVI; neighborhood; physical activity; urban planning"
"Neutralized chimeric DNA probe for the improvement of GC-rich RNA detection specificity on the nanowire field-effect transistor",2019,"Silicon nanowire (SiNW) field-effect transistors (FETs) is a powerful tool in genetic molecule analysis because of their high sensitivity, short detection time, and label-free detection. In nucleic acid detection, GC-rich nucleic acid sequences form self- and cross-dimers and stem-loop structures, which can easily obtain data containing signals from nonspecific DNA binding. The features of GC-rich nucleic acid sequences cause inaccuracies in nucleic acid detection and hinder the development of precision medicine. To improve the inaccurate detection results, we used phosphate-methylated (neutral) nucleotides to synthesize the neutralized chimeric DNA oligomer probe. The probe fragment originated from a primer for the detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3b, and single-mismatched and perfect-matched targets were designed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) detection on the SiNW FET device. Experimental results revealed that the HCV-3b chimeric neutralized DNA (nDNA) probe exhibited better performance for SNP discrimination in 10 mM bis-tris propane buffer at 25 °C than a regular DNA probe. The SNP discrimination of the nDNA probe could be further improved at 40 °C on the FET device. Consequently, the neutralized chimeric DNA probe could successfully distinguish SNP in the detection of GC-rich target sequences under optimal operating conditions on the SiNW FET device. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Mechanical stretch induces hair regeneration through the alternative activation of macrophages",2019,"Tissues and cells in organism are continuously exposed to complex mechanical cues from the environment. Mechanical stimulations affect cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, as well as determining tissue homeostasis and repair. By using a specially designed skin-stretching device, we discover that hair stem cells proliferate in response to stretch and hair regeneration occurs only when applying proper strain for an appropriate duration. A counterbalance between WNT and BMP-2 and the subsequent two-step mechanism are identified through molecular and genetic analyses. Macrophages are first recruited by chemokines produced by stretch and polarized to M2 phenotype. Growth factors such as HGF and IGF-1, released by M2 macrophages, then activate stem cells and facilitate hair regeneration. A hierarchical control system is revealed, from mechanical and chemical signals to cell behaviors and tissue responses, elucidating avenues of regenerative medicine and disease control by demonstrating the potential to manipulate cellular processes through simple mechanical stimulation. ? 2019, The Author(s).","beta catenin; bone morphogenetic protein 2; fibroblast growth factor 10; fibroblast growth factor 2; interleukin 4; Ki 67 antigen; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; Wnt protein; bone morphogenetic protein 2; chemokine; recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2; recombinant protein; scatter factor; somatomedin C; transforming growth factor beta; cell; genetic analysis; hair; homeostasis; instrumentation; mechanical property; molecular analysis; regrowth; repair; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; cell maturation; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; female; flow cytometry; gene expression; genetic analysis; hair follicle; hair growth; hair regeneration; homeostasis; immune response; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; macrophage; mechanical stimulation; mechanical stretch; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; real time polymerase chain reaction; regeneration; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; stretching; tissue reaction; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cell differentiation; cell motion; cytology; genetics; growth, development and aging; hair; macrophage; mechanical stress; metabolism; physiology; regeneration; skin; stem cell; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Chemokines; Female; Hair; Hair Follicle; Hepatocyte Growth Factor; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Macrophages; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Recombinant Proteins; Regeneration; Skin; Stem Cells; Stress, Mechanical; Transforming Growth Factor beta"
"Development of an inflammatory tissue-selective chimeric TNF receptor",2019,"Background: Inhibiting TNF-α is an effective therapy for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, systemic, nondiscriminatory neutralization of TNF-α is associated with considerable adverse effects. Methods: Here, we developed a trimeric chimeric TNF receptor by linking an N-terminal mouse Acrp30 trimerization domain and an MMP-2/9 substrate sequence to the mouse extracellular domain of TNF receptor 2 followed by a C-terminal mouse tetranectin coiled-coil domain (mouse Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn). Results: Here, we show that the Acrp30 trimerization domain inhibited the binding activity of TNFR, possibly by closing the binding site of the trimeric receptor. Cleavage of the substrate sequence by MMP-9, an enzyme highly expressed in inflammatory sites, restored the binding activity of the mouse TNF receptor. We also constructed a recombinant human chimeric TNF receptor (human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn) in which an MMP-13 substrate sequence was used to link the human Acrp and the human TNF receptor 2. Human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn showed reduced binding activity, and MMP-13 digestion recovered its binding activity with TNF-α. Conclusion: Acrp-masked chimeric TNF receptors may be able to be used for inflammatory tissue-selective neutralization of TNF-α to reduce the adverse effects associated with systemic neutralization of TNF-α. ? 2018","adiponectin; chimeric protein; collagenase 3; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; tetranectin; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor receptor; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2; amino terminal sequence; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; chemical modification; controlled study; extracellular matrix; inflammation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein folding; protein purification; protein structure; trimerization"

"A potential peptide derived from cytokine receptors can bind proinflammatory cytokines as a therapeutic strategy for anti-inflammation",2019,"Chronic inflammation is a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, restenosis, and coronary artery disease. The efficacy of current treatment or preventive strategies for such inflammation is still inadequate. Thus, new anti-inflammatory strategies are needed. In this study, based on molecular docking and structural analysis, a potential peptide KCF18 with amphiphilic properties (positively charged and hydrophobic residues) derived from the receptors of proinflammatory cytokines was designed to inhibit cytokine-induced inflammatory response. Simulations suggested that KCF18 could bind to cytokines simultaneously, and electrostatic interactions were dominant. Surface plasmon resonance detection showed that KCF18 bound to both tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6, which is consistent with MM/PBSA binding free energy calculations. The cell experiments showed that KCF18 significantly reduced the binding of proinflammatory cytokines to their cognate receptors, suppressed TNF-α mRNA expression and monocyte binding and transmigration, and alleviated the infiltration of white blood cells in a peritonitis mouse model. The designed peptide KCF18 could remarkably diminish the risk of vascular inflammation by decreasing plasma cytokines release and by directly acting on the vascular endothelium. This study demonstrated that a combination of structure-based in silico design calculations, together with experimental measurements can be used to develop potential anti-inflammatory agents. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"On identification of agonistic interaction: Hepatitis B and C interaction on hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Agonistic interaction is one of the most important types of mechanistic interaction, which is difficult to be distinguished from synergistic interaction by empirical data. In this study, we propose four approaches that suffice to identify and estimate the agonistic interaction: (1) to make a strong assumption that synergism does not exist; (2) to exploit information from a third factor by assuming that this factor is a necessary component for the background condition of synergistic interaction but is not involved in other mechanisms; (3) to consider a third factor necessary for the background condition of agonistic interaction but not involved in other mechanisms; and (4) similar to (3) but to allow flexibility that the third factor may have a main effect on the outcome and/or a synergistic effect with the two risk factors of interest. We applied the proposed methods to quantify the agonism of Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) infections on liver cancer using a Taiwanese cohort study (n?=?23 820; HBV carrier n?=?4149 (17.44%), HCV carrier n?=?1313 (5.52%)). The result demonstrated that agonistic interaction is more dominant compared with synergistic interaction, which explains the findings that the dual infected patients do not have a significantly higher risk of liver cancer than those with single infection. By exploiting an additional risk factor that satisfies certain assumptions, these approaches potentially fill the gap between mechanistic and causal interactions, contributing the comprehensive understanding of causal mechanisms. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; aged; agonistic interaction; Article; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; risk factor; statistical parameters; Taiwanese"
"Single-Step Per-O-Sulfonation of Sugar Oligomers with Concomitant 1,6-Anhydro Bridge Formation for Binding Fibroblast Growth Factors",2019,"Many circulating cancer-related proteins, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), associate with glycosaminoglycans—particularly heparan sulfate—at the cell surface. Disaccharide analogues of heparan sulfate had previously been identified as the shortest components out of the sugars that bind to FGF-1 and FGF-2. Taking note of the typical pose of l-iduronic acid, we conceived of per-O-sulfonated analogues of such disaccharides, and devised a single-step procedure for per-O-sulfonation of unprotected sugars with concomitant 1,6-anhydro bridge formation to achieve such compounds through direct use of SO 3 ?Et 3 N as sulfonation reagent and dimethylformamide as solvent. The synthesized sugars based on the oligomaltose backbone bound FGF-1 and FGF-2 mostly at the sub-micromolar level, although the tetrasaccharide analogue achieved low-nanomolar binding with FGF-2. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this report, we demonstrated a low-cost easy-operated real-time sensing system (optical fiber-urea-sensing, OFUS, system) to detect salivary urea. We aim to make the system easily reproduced by the community to stimulate abundant clinical tests worldwide. The OFUS system is composed of a simple three-dimensional printed tank to link with two optical fibers, one connecting with a commercial light-emitting diode to deliver the input light signal, the other connecting with a commercial cadmium sulfide photo-conductive cell to detect the sensing signal. To allow on-site detection without any sample pretreatment, only 1 μl saliva is needed to be mixed with 10 μl urease solution and 90 μl pH indicator solution in the reaction tank and the detection time is only 20 s. A stable and reproducible calibration curve can be easily built with a detection range as 24–300 mg/dL. The OFUS system successfully detected saliva with added synthetic urea and samples from chronic kidney disease patients. A good agreement between the OFUS system and the ?commercial kit was obtained. A good correlation between salivary urea and the blood urea nitrogen was also confirmed. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","3D printers; Biomarkers; Blood; Cadmium sulfide; Costs; II-VI semiconductors; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Optical fibers; Sulfur compounds; Tanks (containers); Blood urea nitrogens; Calibration curves; Chronic kidney disease; Good correlations; Non-invasive; Point of care; Real time; Sample pretreatment; Urea; biological marker; cadmium sulfide; nitrogen; urea; urease; Article; blood analysis; calculation; calibration; catalysis; chronic kidney failure; correlational study; cost effectiveness analysis; human; point of care testing; saliva analysis; three dimensional printing; urea nitrogen blood level"
"Modulated electro-hyperthermia-enhanced liposomal drug uptake by cancer cells",2019,"Purpose: Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) stands to be a significant technological advancement in the hyperthermia field, utilizing autofocusing electromagnetic power on the cell membrane to create massive apoptosis. Since mEHT possesses the unique ability to excite cell membranes, we hypothesized that mEHT could enhance the uptake of liposomal drugs by enhancing phagocytic activity. Materials and methods: Water bath control and mEHT were used to compare the enhancement of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (Lipodox?) uptake by cancer cells. Cancer cells were made visible by doxorubicin fluorescence to investigate drug uptake. Viable cell yield was determined via the Trypan Blue exclusion method. Various substrates were used to investigate the mechanism of drug-uptake enhancement. The murine colon carcinoma model, CT26, was used to confirm the tissue infiltration of Lipodox? and its therapeutic effect. Results: mEHT treatment showed a significant enhancement of Lipodox? uptake of doxorubicin fluorescence compared with 37°C or 42°C water bath treatment. Tumor tissue sections also confirmed that mEHT treatment achieved the highest doxorubicin concentration in vivo (1.44±0.32 ?g/g in mEHT group and 0.79±0.32 ?g/g in 42°C water bath). Wortmannin was used to inhibit the macropinocytosis effect and 70 kDa dextran-FITC served as uptake substance. The uptake of dextran-FITC by cancer cells significantly increased after mEHT treatment whereas such enhancement was significantly inhibited by wortmannin. Conclusion: The result showed mEHT-induced particle-uptake through macropinocytosis. mEHT-enhanced uptake of Lipodox? may amplify the therapeutic effect of liposomal drugs. This novel finding warrants further clinical investigation. ? 2019 Tsang et al.","doxorubicin; wortmannin; antineoplastic antibiotic; doxorubicin; macrogol; Article; cancer cell; cancer growth; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; drug screening; drug uptake; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liposomal delivery; macropinocytosis; modulated electro hyperthermia; outcome assessment; thermotherapy; A-549 cell line; analogs and derivatives; animal; apoptosis; Bagg albino mouse; cell membrane; cell survival; colon tumor; disease model; drug effect; Hep-G2 cell line; neoplasm; particle size; pathology; pinocytosis; signal transduction; A549 Cells; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Apoptosis; Cell Membrane; Cell Survival; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Doxorubicin; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neoplasms; Particle Size; Pinocytosis; Polyethylene Glycols; Signal Transduction"
"The effects of different dynamic culture systems on cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells",2019,"The culture environment plays an important role for stem cells’ cultivation. Static or dynamic culture preserve differential potentials to affect human mesenchymal stem cells’ (hMSCs) proliferation and differentiation. In this study, hMSCs were seeded on fiber disks and cultured in a bidirectional-flow bioreactor or spinner-flask bioreactor with a supplement of osteogenic medium. The hMSCs’ proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition of mineralization were demonstrated. The results showed that the spinner flask improved cell viability at the first two weeks while the bidirectional-flow reactor increased the cell proliferation of hMSCs through the four-week culture period. Despite the flow reactor having a higher cell number, a lower lactose/glucose ratio was noted, revealing that the bidirectional-flow bioreactor provides better oxygen accessibility to the cultured cells/disk construct. The changes of calcium ions in the medium, the depositions of Ca2+ in the cells/disk constructs, and alkaline phosphate/osteocalcin activities showed the static culture of hMSCs caused cells to mineralize faster than the other two bioreactors but without cell proliferation. Otherwise, cells were distributed uniformly with abundant extracellular matrix productions using the flow reactor. This reveals that the static and dynamic cultivations regulated the osteogenic process differently in hMSCs. The bidirectional-flow bioreactor can be used in the mass production and cultivation of hMSCs for applications in bone regenerative medicine. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Major bleeding risk of endoscopic sphincterotomy versus endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation in hemodialysis patients",2019,"Background/Aims: Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation (EPBD) are used for therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The postprocedure bleeding rate for EPBD is low in the normal population; however, this bleeding rate in a group of patients prone to bleeding, such as patients with end-stage renal disease, is not well-established. We therefore evaluated the post-EST and post-EPBD bleeding rate among hemodialysis (HD) patients based on data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Patients and Methods: The NHIRD entries for a population of 2 million were screened for patients who had a catastrophic illness card for HD between 1 st January 2004 and 31 st December 2011 and these patients were enrolled as research subjects. The rates of major gastrointestinal tract bleeding events appearing within 14 days after EST or EPBD were compared between HD and non-HD patients. Results: A total of 3561 patients, over 18 years of age and without liver cirrhosis or hematologic diseases, underwent 3826 EST and 280 EPBD procedures during the 8 calendar years selected for our analysis. The total post-ERCP major bleeding rate was much higher in HD than in non-HD patients (8.64% vs. 2.16%, P &lt; 0.0001). The rate of postprocedure major bleeding events was lower for non-HD patients who underwent EPBD than those who underwent EST (0.75% vs. 2.26%; P = 0.049), whereas the postprocedure major bleeding event rates were similar in HD patients who underwent either EPBD or EST (8.70% vs. 8.33%; P = 0.484). Conclusion: Post-ERCP, post-EST, and post-EPBD major bleeding rates were all higher in HD patients in this study. EPBD resulted in lower postprocedure major bleeding events than EST in the non-HD population, but it failed to provide the reduction in bleeding events needed to perform endoscopic hemostasis in HD patients. ? 2019 Saudi Journal of Gastroenterology.","adult; aged; Article; balloon dilatation; cohort analysis; controlled study; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic sphincterotomy; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; hemodialysis patient; hemostasis; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; middle aged; postoperative hemorrhage; register; Taiwan; very elderly; bleeding; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; devices; dilatation; endoscopic sphincterotomy; gastrointestinal tract; hemodialysis; pathology; postoperative hemorrhage; procedures; retrospective study; standards; statistics and numerical data; vascularization; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde; Dilatation; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Hemorrhage; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Hemorrhage; Renal Dialysis; Retrospective Studies; Sphincterotomy, Endoscopic; Taiwan"
"Who is better adapted in learning online within the personal learning environment? Relating gender differences in cognitive attention networks to digital distraction",2019,"In response to increasing concerns about digital distraction, we bridged people's cognitive attention to digital distraction within the personal learning environment (PLE). Gender differences were investigated in college students’ media-related perceived attention problems (PAP) and their attention self-regulatory strategies (SRS). Also examined were the gender moderating effects on the correlations of attention problems and regulatory strategies with six dimensions of social media usage and four cognitive- and adjustment-related criteria: online search strategies, media-multitasking self-efficacy (MMSE), positive/negative self-esteems, and academic achievement. Participants were 771 undergraduate and graduate students from 10 universities in Taiwan. Gender measurement invariance was established in the research instrument. Males exhibited higher PAP than females. Females demonstrated more versatile strategy use to regulate their attention with increased social media use, while males applied more behavioral strategies over social media use as disorientation increased during online searches. Higher MMSE was associated with higher executive and orienting problems for females, and higher alerting problems for males. Higher orienting problems was associated with more negative self-esteem for males. Females with higher PAP reported poorer academic achievement. Implications for practical intervention of PAPs are discussed for each gender group to promote college students’ psychological well-being with regard to social media use and learning performance. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Interactive computer systems; Multitasking; Online searching; Social networking (online); Digital distraction; Gender studies; Meta-attention; Self efficacy; Self esteem; Social media; Students"
"Development of novel hearing aids by using image recognition technology",2019,"Speech is easily affected by different background noise in real environment to reduce the speech intelligibility, in particular, for hearing impaired listeners. In order to improve the above issue, several hearing aids have been developed to enhance the speech signal in noisy environment. Most of current hearing aids were designed to enhance the component of speech and suppress the component of noise. However, it is difficult to separate other speech sources. Adaptive signal enhancement with the beamforming technique might improve the above issue. However, how to distinguish the location of the desired speaker effectively is still a difficult challenge for adaptive beamforming method. A novel concept of hearing aid was proposed in this study. Different from the beamforming-based hearing aids, which use the cross-correlation-coefficient method to estimate time difference of arrival (TDOA), an image recognition technology was used to estimate the location of the desired speaker to obtain the more precise TDOA. An adaptive signal enhancement was also used to enhance the noisy speech sound. From the experimental results, the proposed system could provide a smaller absolute error of TDOA less than 1.25 × 10 -4 ms, and a clear speech sound from the target speaker who the user wants to listen to. ? 2018 IEEE.","Acoustic noise; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Beamforming; Biomedical signal processing; Hearing aids; Image enhancement; Image recognition; Medical imaging; Microphones; Speech communication; Speech enhancement; Speech intelligibility; Speech recognition; System buses; Time difference of arrival; Biomedical imaging; Cross-correlation coefficient; Image recognition technology; Noise measurements; Universal serial bus; Audition; algorithm; Article; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; equipment design; facial recognition; image enhancement; image processing; image recognition; information processing; mathematical analysis; noise; signal noise ratio; signal processing; sound detection; sound transmission; speech intelligibility; devices; hearing aid; human; image processing; physiology; procedures; speech; Algorithms; Hearing Aids; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Noise; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sound Spectrography; Speech"
"Functional Gold Nanoparticles as Sensing Probes for Concanavalin A and as Imaging Agents for Cancer Cells",2019,"Concanavalin A (ConA), which exists in jack bean, can specifically bind to either mannose or glucose units. Given that ConA is a potential anticancer agent for antihepatoma therapy, analytical methods that can be used for ConA detection in plant extracts or biological fluids are important. Labeling agents that can be used to distinguish cancer cells from noncancer cells are also useful for cancer diagnostics. In this study, maltose-directed synthesis of Au nanoparticles (NPs; Au@Maltose NPs) were generated from one-pot reactions and used as sensing probes toward ConA tetrameric forms. Results showed that the binding affinity between Au@Maltose NPs and ConA was desirable with a dissociation constant as low as ?6.66 × 10-8 M. Moreover, the limit of detection against ConA was estimated to be ?23 pM, which was the lowest ever reported when Au NPs were used as sensing probes against ConA. Moreover, Au@Maltose NPs were used as imaging agents for ConA-treated cancer cells, such as human hepatoma HepG2 cells and human breast T-47D cancer cells, which can overexpress mannose N-glycan units on the cell membrane. NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, which are noncancer cells, were used for comparison. Results demonstrated that the imaging agent made from combined ConA and Au@Maltose NPs can be used to distinguish cancer cells from noncancer cells. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Binding energy; Cell culture; Diseases; Dissociation; Fiber optic sensors; Gold nanoparticles; Maltose; Medical imaging; Metal nanoparticles; Plant extracts; Probes; Surface plasmon resonance; Synthesis (chemical); Cancer cells; Concanavalin A; Imaging agent; Localized surface plasmon resonance; LSPR; Cells"
"Targeting EGFR of triple-negative breast cancer enhances the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel- and cetuximab-conjugated nanodiamond nanocomposite",2019,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). However, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in most of the TNBCs, which may provide a potential target for EGFR targeting therapy. Nanodiamond (ND) is a carbon-based nanomaterial with several advantages, including fluorescence emission, biocompatibility, and drug delivery applications. In this study, we designed a nanocomposite by using ND conjugated with paclitaxel (PTX) and cetuximab (Cet) for targeting therapy on the EGFR-positive TNBC cells. ND-PTX inhibited cell viability and induced mitotic catastrophe in various human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BT474); in contrast, ND alone did not induce cell death. ND-PTX inhibited the xenografted human breast tumors in nude mice. We further investigated ND-PTX-Cet drug efficacy on the TNBC of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. ND-PTX-Cet could specifically bind to EGFR and enhanced the anticancer effects including drug uptake levels, mitotic catastrophe, and apoptosis in the EGFR-expressed MDA-MB-231 cells but not in the EGFR-negative MCF-7 cells. In addition, ND-PTX-Cet increased the protein levels of active caspase-3 and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10). Furthermore, ND-PTX-Cet showed more effective on the reduction of TNBC tumor volume by comparison with ND-PTX. Taken together, these results demonstrated that ND-PTX-Cet nanocomposite enhanced mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis by targeting EGFR of TNBC cells, which can provide a feasible strategy for TNBC therapy. Statement of significance: Current TNBC treatment is ineffective against the survival rate of TNBC patients. Therefore, the development of new treatment strategies for TNBC patients is urgently needed. Here, we have designed a nanocomposite by targeting on the EGFR of TNBC to enhance therapeutic efficacy by ND-conjugated PTX and Cet (ND-PTX-Cet). Interestingly, we found that the co-delivery of Cet and PTX by ND enhanced the apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe and tumor inhibition in the EGFR-expressed TNBC in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, this nanocomposite ND-PTX-Cet can be applied for targeting EGFR of human TNBC therapy. ? 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.","caspase 3; cetuximab; epidermal growth factor receptor; histone H3; nanocomposite; nanodiamond; paclitaxel; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; binding affinity; BT-474 cell line; cancer inhibition; controlled study; drug conjugation; drug efficacy; drug receptor binding; drug uptake; human; human cell; male; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein targeting; triple negative breast cancer"
"Gold nanorod-encapsulated biodegradable polymeric matrix for combined photothermal and chemo-cancer therapy",2019,"Purpose: A biocompatible nanocomplex system co-encapsulated with gold nanorods (AuNRs) and doxorubicin (DOX) was investigated for its potentials on the combined photothermal-and chemotherapy. Materials and methods: Hydrophobic AuNRs were synthesized by the hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB)-mediated seed growth method, and then, they received two-step surface modifications of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dodecane. The AuNR/DOX/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocomplexes were prepared by emulsifying DOX, AuNR, and PLGA into aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution by sonication. Human serum albumin (HSA) was used to coat the nanocomplexes to afford HSA/AuNR/DOX–PLGA (HADP). Size and surface potential of the HADP nanocomplexes were determined by using a Zetasizer. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of the HADP were analyzed by using MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. In vitro anticancer effects of the HADP were studied on various cancer cell lines. To assess the therapeutic efficacy, CT26 tumor-bearing mice were intravenously administered with HADP nanocomplexes and laser treatments, followed by monitoring of the tumor growth and body weight. Results: Size and surface potential of the HADP nanocomplexes were 245.8 nm and-8.6 mV, respectively. Strong photothermal effects were verified on the AuNR-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) in vitro. Rapid and repeated drug release from the HADP nanocomplexes was successfully achieved by near-infrared (NIR) irradiations. HSA significantly promoted cellular uptake of the HADP nanocomplexes to murine colon cancer cells as demonstrated by cell imaging and flow cytometric studies. By combining photothermal and chemotherapy, the HADP nanocomplexes exhibited strong synergistic anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: An NIR-triggered drug release system by encapsulating hydrophobic AuNR and DOX inside the PLGA NPs has been successfully prepared in this study. The HADP NPs show promising combined photothermal-and chemotherapeutic effects without inducing undesired side effects on a murine colon cancer animal model. ? 2019 Chuang et al.","cetrimide; dodecane; doxorubicin; gold nanorod; human serum albumin; macrogol; polyglactin; polymer; polyvinyl alcohol; antineoplastic agent; biomaterial; doxorubicin; gold; nanotube; polymer; serum albumin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; biodegradability; body weight; cancer chemotherapy; cancer growth; chemical modification; colon adenocarcinoma; controlled study; CT26 cell line; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug release; emulsion; flow cytometry; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; material coating; mouse; MTT assay; nanoencapsulation; near infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; particle size; photothermal therapy; surface property; synthesis; ultrasound; animal; chemical phenomena; chemistry; disease model; endocytosis; human; neoplasm; phototherapy; static electricity; thermotherapy; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Biocompatible Materials; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Doxorubicin; Drug Liberation; Endocytosis; Gold; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Hyperthermia, Induced; Mice; Nanotubes; Neoplasms; Particle Size; Phototherapy; Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer; Polymers; Serum Albumin; Static Electricity"
"Intelligent whole-blood imaging flow cytometry for simple, rapid, and cost-effective drug-susceptibility testing of leukemia",2019,"Drug susceptibility (also called chemosensitivity) is an important criterion for developing a therapeutic strategy for various cancer types such as breast cancer and leukemia. Recently, functional assays such as high-content screening together with genomic analysis have been shown to be effective for predicting drug susceptibility, but their clinical applicability is poor since they are time-consuming (several days long), labor-intensive, and costly. Here we present a highly simple, rapid, and cost-effective liquid biopsy for ex vivo drug-susceptibility testing of leukemia. The method is based on an extreme-throughput (>1 million cells per second), label-free, whole-blood imaging flow cytometer with a deep convolutional autoencoder, enabling image-based identification of the drug susceptibility of every single white blood cell in whole blood within 24 hours by simply flowing a drug-treated whole blood sample as little as 500 μL into the imaging flow cytometer without labeling. Our results show that the method accurately evaluates the drug susceptibility of white blood cells from untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our method holds promise for affordable precision medicine. ?

"Assessing sustainable effectiveness of the adjustment mechanism of a ubiquitous clinic recommendation system",2019,"Advances in computer and communication technologies have engendered opportunities for developing an improved ubiquitous health care environment. One of the crucial applications is a ubiquitous clinic recommendation system, which entails recommending a suitable clinic to a mobile patient based on his/her location, hospital department, and preferences. However, patients may not be willing or able to express their preferences. To overcome this problem, some ubiquitous clinic recommendation systems mine the historical data of patients to learn their preferences, and they apply an algorithm to adjust the recommendation algorithm after receiving more patient data. Such an adjustment mechanism may operate for several periods; however, this raises a question regarding the sustainability (i.e., long-term effectiveness) of such an adjustment mechanism. To address this question, this study modeled the improvement in the successful recommendation rate of a ubiquitous clinic recommendation system that adopts an adjustment mechanism as a learning process. Both the asymptotic value and learning speed of the learning process provide valuable information regarding the long-term effectiveness of the adjustment mechanism. The proposed methodology was applied in a regional study to a ubiquitous clinic recommendation system that adjusts the recommendation mechanism by solving an integer nonlinear programming problem on a rolling basis. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method exhibited a considerably higher level of accuracy in forecasting the successful recommendation rate compared with several existing methods. Although the adjustment mechanism exhibits long-term effectiveness, the learning speed requires improvement. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; article; comparative effectiveness; forecasting; human; learning; patient coding; velocity"
"Functional correlates of resting-state connectivity in the default mode network of heroin users on methadone treatment and medication-free therapeutic community program",2019,"The treatment of heroin addiction is a complex process involving changes in addictive behavior and brain functioning. The goal of this study was to explore the brain default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and decision-making performance based on the Cambridge gambling task in heroin-dependent individuals undergoing methadone treatment (MT, n = 11) and medication-free faith-based therapeutic community program (TC, n = 11). The DMN involved the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left inferior parietal lobe (IPLL), right inferior parietal lobe (IPLR), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) subregions for all participants inboth the MT and TC groups. Compared with MT, TC had an increased functional connectivity in IPLL-IPLR and IPLR-PCC and decreased functional connectivity in mPFC-IPLL and IPLL-PCC. Both groups exhibited no significant difference in the regional rs-fMRI metric [i.e., amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)]. In the analysis of the neural correlates for decision-making performance, risk adjustment was positively associated with ALFF in IPLL for all participants considering the group effects. The involvement of IPL in decision-making performance and treatment response among heroin-dependent patients warrants further investigation.

"In Vitro and in Vivo Approach of Hydrogen-Sulfide-Responsive Drug Release Driven by Azide-Functionalized Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles",2019,"Cancer has become a major cause of human death in many countries. Generally, chemotherapy is the main treatment for cancer, but it may kill both cancerous cells as well as normal cells that cause serious side effects in the patient due to lack of specific targeting for cancerous cells. In order to achieve better efficiency in the cancer treatment, the development of targeted drug delivery platform has been a goal for a long time. Herein, we constructed folic acid decorated azide functionalized biocompatible mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) to target tumor cells through folate receptor (FR), a widely expressed receptor in cancer cells. In colon and ovarian cancer cells, high endogenous H2S levels are found. They can be used as a trigger for the azide reduction, which leads to the cleavage of ester linkage and results in DOX release from MSNP nanocarriers. Additionally, confocal cell images of HCT-116, HT-29, A2780, SKOV3, and HeLa cells treated with nanoparticles revealed an effective internalization of MSNPs in these cells. Interestingly, DOX-loaded MSNP-N3-FA-treated HT-29 cells showed a significant decrease in the cell viability, whereas, there was no substantial change in HeLa cells. We also demonstrated that DOX-loaded MSNP-N3-FA has superior in vivo chemotherapy efficacy compared to free DOX. These observations indicated that the designed nanocarriers on MSNP-N3-FA specifically respond in the presence of H2S. MSNP-N3-FA is the first potential nanocarrier for endogenous H2S-based efficient DOX release for colon and ovarian cancers.

"Enterotype-based Analysis of Gut Microbiota along the Conventional Adenoma-Carcinoma Colorectal Cancer Pathway",2019,"The dysbiosis of human gut microbiota is strongly associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The dysbiotic features of the transition from advanced polyp to early-stage CRC are largely unknown. We performed a 16S rRNA gene sequencing and enterotype-based gut microbiota analysis study. In addition to Bacteroides- and Prevotella-dominated enterotypes, we identified an Escherichia-dominated enterotype. We found that the dysbiotic features of CRC were dissimilar in overall samples and especially Escherichia-dominated enterotype. Besides a higher abundance of Fusobacterium, Enterococcus, and Aeromonas in all CRC faecal microbiota, we found that the most notable characteristic of CRC faecal microbiota was a decreased abundance of potential beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria. Notably, Oscillospira was depleted in the transition from advanced adenoma to stage 0 CRC, whereas Haemophilus was depleted in the transition from stage 0 to early-stage CRC. We further identified 7 different CAGs by analysing bacterial clusters. The abundance of microbiota in cluster 3 significantly increased in the CRC group, whereas that of cluster 5 decreased. The abundance of both cluster 5 and cluster 7 decreased in the Escherichia-dominated enterotype of the CRC group. We present the first enterotype-based faecal microbiota analysis. The gut microbiota of colorectal neoplasms can be influenced by its enterotype. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Risk of psychiatric disorders in overactive bladder syndrome: A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan",2019,"Population-based cohort study investigating the risk of depression and other psychiatric disorders for patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is unavailable. This study investigated the subsequent risk of psychiatric disorders among patients with OAB in an Asian population. Using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, we established a cohort with 811 patients in an exposed group with OAB between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2000, and a non-exposed group, without OAB, of 2433 patients without OAB matched by age and year of diagnosis. The occurrence of psychiatric disorders and Cox regression model measured adjusted HRs (aHR) were monitored until the end of 2013. The overall incidence of psychiatric disorders was 41.7% higher in the exposed group with OAB than in the non-exposed group without OAB (14.2% vs 10.1%, p<0.001), with an aHR of 1.34 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.80, p<0.001) for the OAB cohort. OAB was associated with the increased risk of dementia, anxiety, depressive, sleep, and psychotic disorders, with aHRs as 1.53 (p=0.040), 1.61 (p<0.001), 2.10 (p<0.001), 1.43 (p<0.001), and 2.49 (p=0.002), respectively. The risk of psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, is significantly higher in patients with OAB than in those without OAB.

"Association of serial serum major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A measurements with hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis C patients after viral eradication",2019,"Background and Aim: Major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A (MICA) genetic variants and their serum levels (sMICA) were associated with the development of hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in untreated cohorts. The dynamic changes in serial sMICA levels and their association with HCC in the post-curative status are elusive. Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphism rs2596542 of MICA and serial sMICA levels were analyzed in chronic hepatitis C patients with a sustained virologic response after antivirals. Forty-two patients who developed HCC and 84 age-matched, gender-matched, and cirrhosis propensity score-matched non-HCC controls were compared. Serial sMICA levels were measured within 6?months before treatment initiation (pre-sMICA), 6?months after the end of treatment (post-sMICA), and on the last visit before the development (or not) of HCC (last-sMICA). Results: Cox regression analysis revealed that last-sMICA was the only predictive factor of HCC development (hazard ratio/95% confidence interval: 2.27 (per 1 log pg/mL increase)/1.672–3.082, P?<?0.001). Patients without HCC development showed a significantly reduced trend of sMICA levels during follow-up (trend P?=?0.001), which was observed only in GG genotype (trend P?<?0.001) but not A allele carriers (P?=?0.88). In contrast, patients with HCC showed an increased trend of sMICA levels (trend P?=?0.024). However, only the GG genotype “high expressors” (trend P?=?0.06) but not A allele carriers (P?=?0.18) showed a correlation of substantially increased trend of sMICA levels and HCC development. Conclusions: Serial sMICA levels were associated with HCC development in SVR patients.

"Cardiorespiratory and autonomic-nervous-system functioning of drug abusers treated by Zen meditation",2019,"Addicted drugs like nicotine affect autonomic nervous system that results in arrhythmia and other cardiovascular diseases. Notable effects of Zen meditation on autonomic nervous system have been reported during the past decade. Holistic Detox Association (HDA) in Taiwan offered Zen-meditation program to drug addicts as the core scheme among a variety of drug addiction treatments. This paper reports the results of quantifying the cardiorespiratory interactions and autonomic nervous system function to evaluate the on-site effect of Zen meditation on drug rehab. Methods and schemes for quantifying time-domain heart rate variability were employed to electrocardiograph and respiratory signals. Peak-valley method was developed to quantify the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) behavior. Poincar? Plot Analysis was adopted to evaluate the cardiorespiratory functioning. Among 18 voluntary drug addicts during the 10-minute Zen meditation session, about two-third subjects have significant improvement in autonomic nervous system function characterized by heart rate variability (SDNN, RMSSD and pNN50). Group average of RSA increases from 33.43 ms(Rest) to 69.14 ms(AR Zen meditation). Poincar?-plot analysis reveals the improvement of SD1, SD2 and SD2/SD1 by respectively 14.7%, 19.8% and 8.8%. The group averages of all the parameters exhibit significantly positive changes in the 10-minute session of abdominal-respiration Zen meditation. Even the subject with heart transplant showed the improvement of all the quantitative indicators during the AR Zen meditation. ? 2018 Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan University",""
"HDAC1 and HDAC2 double knockout triggers cell apoptosis in advanced thyroid cancer",2019,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) and squamous thyroid carcinoma (STC) are both rare and advanced thyroid malignancies with a very poor prognosis and an average median survival time of 5 months and less than 20% of affected patients are alive 1 year after diagnosis. The clinical management of both ATC and STC is very similar because they are not particularly responsive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This inspired us to explore a novel and effective clinically approved therapy for ATC treatment. Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) drugs are recently FDA-approved drug for malignancies, especially for blood cell cancers. Therefore, we investigated whether an HDACi drug acts as an effective anticancer drug for advanced thyroid cancers. Cell viability analysis of panobinostat treatment demonstrated a significant IC50 of 0.075 ?M on SW579 STC cells. In addition, panobinostat exposure activated histone acetylation and triggered cell death mainly through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-related protein activation. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out HDAC1 and HDAC2 genes in SW579 cells, we observed that the histone acetylation level and cell cycle arrest were enhanced without any impact on cell growth. Furthermore, HDAC1 and HDAC2 double knockout (KO) cells showed dramatic cell apoptosis activation compared to HDAC1 and HDAC2 individual KO cells. This suggests expressional and biofunctional compensation between HDAC1 and HDAC2 on SW579 cells. This study provides strong evidence that panobinostat can potentially be used in the clinic of advanced thyroid cancer patients. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Mediation analysis for new recognition criteria, working hours and overwork-related disease: A nationwide ecological study using 11-year follow-up data in Taiwan",2019,"Objectives Taiwan revised its criteria for overwork-related cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease (CCVD) in 2010. A new definition of overwork increased the number of recognised cases. Meanwhile, actual average working hours decreased. We estimated the effects of the revised criteria on the number of overwork-related CCVD cases and the mediation effect through reduced working hours. Methods From the Labor Insurance of Taiwan, we collected data on the total number of overwork-related CCVD cases from 2006 to 2016 and average monthly working hours for 13 industry groups. We conducted causal mediation analysis to investigate the mechanism of the effect of new criteria on CCVD mediated by working hours. Results From 2006 to 2016, 594 overwork-related cases of CCVD were recognised across 13 industry groups. After introducing the new criteria, overwork-related CCVD increased by 8.40 cases (per one million person-years) (95% CI 4.53 to 15.05), which resulted from a decrease of 1.54 (95% CI 0.22 to 3.82) cases due to reduced working hours (mediation effect) and an increase of 9.93 (95% CI 5.24 to 18.17) cases related to the effect of the criteria change and other covariates excluding working hours (alternative effect). Conclusions Working hours are an important mediator of the effect of policy on the rate of overwork-related CCVD. Introducing new criteria for recognising overwork-related disease might raise awareness and prompt reductions in working hours, which also help to reduce CCVD. Our findings suggest that understanding mediation effects is important to evaluating national health policies. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"The evaluation of a better intubation strategy when only the epiglottis is visible: A randomized, cross-over mannequin study",2019,"Background: The Cormack-Lehane (C-L) grade III airway is considered to be a challenging airway to intubate and is associated with a poor intubation success rate. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the holding position, shapes, bend angles of the endotracheal tube (ET) and the stylet-assisted lifting of the epiglottis could improve the success rate of intubation. Methods: Thirty-two participants, 26 physicians, 2 residents, and 4 nurse practitioners, with 12.09 ± 5.38 years of work experience in the emergency department and more than 150 annual intubation events, were enrolled in this randomized, cross-over mannequin study. We investigated the effects of straight-to-cuff ET shapes with 35° and 50° bend angles, banana-shaped ET with longitudinal distances of 28 cm and 26 cm, two methods of holding the ET (either on the top or in the middle), and lifting or not the epiglottis, on the intubation duration, its success rate, and its subjective difficulty. The aim of the study is to provide optimized intubation strategies for difficult airway with C-L IIb or III grades, when the inlet of the trachea cannot be visualized. Results: The two groups that lifted the epiglottis using the stylets, in bend angles of 35° and 50°, had the shortest duration of intubation (23.75 ± 14.24 s and 20.72 ± 6.90 s, hazard ratios 1.54 and 1.85 with 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] of 1.01-2.34 and 1.23-2.78, respectively) and a 100% success rate in intubations. In the survival analysis, lifting of the epiglottis was the only significant factor (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) associated with the success rate of intubation. Conclusions: The use of the epiglottic lift as an adjunctive technique can facilitate the intubation and improve its success rate without increasing procedure difficulty, in C-L III airway, when only the epiglottis is seen.

"Design of Novel Field Programmable Gate Array-Based Hearing Aid",2019,"Hearing loss is one of the most common chronic diseases. For people with hearing loss, communicating with other people, particularly in an environment with considerable background noise, is difficult. Recently, several hearing aids have been developed to improve speech comprehension in a noisy environment. The use of an adaptive beamformer is one of the alternative methods for improving speech intelligibility. However, the adaptive beamformer requires the location of the desired speaker to estimate the time differences of arrival (TDOAs) of speech sources to numerous spatially separated sensors in acoustics. In general, the technique of steered response power source localization was used to estimate the TDOA; however, this technique was easily affected by environmental reverberation. To overcome the aforementioned concern, a novel hearing aid is proposed in this paper. By using an image processing technology, the location of the desired speaker could be manually selected to provide precise information on the TDOA. Moreover, adaptive signal enhancements were implemented in a field-programmable gate array to enhance the speech of interest in real time. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system could improve speech intelligibility in various noisy environments. Therefore, the proposed system may be employed to improve the daily lives of people with hearing the loss in the future. ? 2013 IEEE.","Beamforming; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hearing aids; Image processing; Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Microphones; Speech intelligibility; Time difference of arrival; Adaptive beamformer; Adaptive signal enhancements; Background noise; Chronic disease; Hearing aid; Image processing technology; Noisy environment; Time-differences; Audition"
"Co-placement optimization in sensor-reusable cyber-physical digital microfluidic biochips",2019,"Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) facilitate modern healthcare applications. One of the most important applications is point-of-care (POC) clinical diagnosis which is directly related to human health. However, biochemical experiments are usually error-prone, which makes monitoring intermediate results during bioassay execution be required to ensure the correctness of POC clinical diagnosis. To tackle this problem, cyber-physical digital microfluidic biochips with integrated sensors have been proposed and have attracted attention recently. In order to fully utilize the sensors for detection, the reusability of sensors should be taken into consideration during the module placement stage of cyber-physical DMFBs synthesis flow. Moreover, excessive actuation of electrodes may cause reliability degradation and this issuse should also be taken care of during module placement stage. In order to deal with the aforementioned problems, this paper presents the first co-optimization method for both module and sensor placement. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively minimize bioassay completion time while meeting all constraints from sensors and electrodes. ? 2018","Biochips; Cyber Physical System; Diagnosis; Electrodes; Reliability; Reusability; Sensors; Biochemical experiments; Cyber physicals; Digital microfluidic biochips; Health care application; Intermediate results; Placement; Placement optimization; Reliability degradation; Digital microfluidics"
"Characteristics of scrub typhus, murine typhus, and Q fever among elderly patients: Prolonged prothrombin time as a predictor for severity",2019,"Background/purpose: The clinical manifestations of scrub typhus, murine typhus and acute Q fever in the elderly are not clear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to identify the characteristics of the elderly aged ?65 years with a comparison group aged 18–64 years among patients with scrub typhus, murine typhus, or acute Q fever who were serologically confirmed at three hospitals in Taiwan during 2002–2011. Results: Among 441 cases, including 187 cases of scrub typhus, 166 acute Q fever, and 88 murine typhus, 68 (15.4%) cases were elderly patients. The elderly had a higher severe complication rate (10.3% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.022), but did not have a significantly higher mortality rate (1.47% vs. 0.54%, p = 0.396). Compared with those without severe complications, we found the elderly (p = 0.022), dyspnea (p = 0.006), less relative bradycardia (p = 0.004), less febrile illness (p = 0.004), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (p = 0.002), higher levels of initial C-reactive protein (p = 0.039), blood leukocyte counts (p = 0.01), and lower platelet counts (p = 0.012) are significantly associated with severe complications. Only prolonged prothrombin time was associated with severe complications in multivariate analysis (p = 0.018, CI 95% 0.01–0.66). Among clinical symptoms and laboratory data, multivariate analysis revealed chills was less frequently occurred in the elderly (p = 0.012, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33–9.99). Conclusion: The elderly cases with scrub typhus, murine typhus, or acute Q fever would be more likely to have severe complications, for which prothrombin time prolongation is an important predictor for severe complications. ? 2017","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; C reactive protein; lactate dehydrogenase; activated partial thromboplastin time; acute kidney failure; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; arthralgia; Article; bradycardia; chill; controlled study; coughing; diarrhea; disease severity; disseminated intravascular clotting; dizziness; dyspnea; female; fever; geriatric patient; headache; human; leukocyte count; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; male; meningitis; middle aged; murine typhus; pancreatitis; platelet count; prothrombin time; Q fever; retrospective study; rhinorrhea; scrub typhus; septic shock; sputum; Taiwan; clinical trial; complication; multicenter study; murine typhus; pathophysiology; prothrombin time; Q fever; scrub typhus; severity of illness index; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Prothrombin Time; Q Fever; Retrospective Studies; Scrub Typhus; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan; Typhus, Endemic Flea-Borne"
"The potential role of betatrophin in hepatocellular carcinoma and metabolic syndrome",2019,"Metabolic syndrome is a fundamental health problem worldwide induced by obesity and T2DM. Obesity linked long-standing diabetes was established as a crucial event in cancer development. The recent findings improved that betatrophin, regulates lipid and glucose metabolism. However, the potential function of betatrophin activity in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to metabolic syndrome is not fully understood. This preliminary study aimed to elucidate the fundamental role of betatrophin in HCC linked metabolic syndrome. This study was conducted by in vivo model by using miR-122a-/- mouse induced by a high-fat diet. The alteration of liver betatrophin expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR method, while the histological section examination was done to observe the change of liver anatomy. Importantly, our study found that diet-induced obesity (DIO) was able to accelerate metabolic syndrome. The long-term treatment of DIO exacerbate portal inflammation, fatty liver and liver fibrosis accelerate liver tumorigenesis or precancer symptoms. The expression of betatrophin significantly increased in our metabolic syndrome mouse model indicate the involvement of betatrophin in lipid metabolism disorder to induce liver injury and hepatoma. Hence, this preliminary study proves a hallmark of the primary contribution of betatrophin in the early incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma linked metabolic syndrome. ?

"MAL-PDT inhibits oral precancerous cells and lesions via autophagic cell death",2019,"Background: Oral cancer is a common cancer with a high mortality rate. While surgery is the most effective treatment for oral cancer, it frequently causes deformity and dysfunction in the orofacial region. In this study, methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) as a prevention tool against progression of precancerous lesion to oral cancer was explored. Methods: For in vitro studies, we evaluated the effects of MAL-PDT on viability of DOK oral precancerous cells by XTT, cell morphology by TEM, and intracellular signaling pathways by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. For in vivo study, DMBA was used to induce oral precancerous lesions in hamsters followed by MAL-PDT treatment. We measured tumor size and body weight weekly. After sacrifice, buccal pouch lesions were processed for H&amp;E stain and immunohistochemistry analysis. Results: MAL-PDT induced autophagic cell death in DOK oral precancerous cells. The autophagy-related markers LC3II and p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosome formation in DOK cells were increased after MAL-PDT treatment. In vivo, Metvix ? -PDT treatment decreased tumor growth and enhanced LC3II expression in hamster buccal pouch tumors induced by DMBA. Conclusions: Our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that MAL-PDT may provide an effective therapy for oral precancerous lesions through induction of autophagic cell death. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"FFT-Based multirate signal processing for 18-band Quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-Octave Filter Bank",2019,"For characteristic analysis of the 24 KHz audio, the 10-ms, 18-band quasi-ANSI filter bank has been proposed and designed for advanced hearing aids. To greatly reduce the computation complexity, several time-domain multirate signal processing techniques, such as the up- and down-sampling rate conversions and the interpolated finite impulse response (IFIR) filters, were investigated. However, it is well known that using fast Fourier transform (FFT) to perform the linear convolution can dramatically reduce the computational complexity. Taking both advantages, in this brief we investigated the FFT-based multirate signal-processing technique and explored their efficient architecture. To demonstrate the success of the proposed architecture, we implemented a real-valued FFT-based 10.7-ms, 18-band quasi-ANSI 1/3-octave filter bank using TSMC 90-nm CMOS high-VT technology. We found that, for each input sample, the proposed FFT-based quasi-ANSI 1/3-octave filter bank used approximately 77% fewer multiplications than the previous time-domain design. The proposed FFT-based quasi-ANSI filter bank was operated at 13 MHz to process the 24-KHz audio in real time, and it consumed only 14 μW (@0.9V) of dynamic power. ? 2004-2012 IEEE.","Audition; Fast Fourier transforms; Filter banks; Frequency domain analysis; Hearing aids; Impulse response; Signal sampling; Characteristic analysis; Computation complexity; Efficient architecture; Interpolated finite impulse response; Low latency; Multirate signal processing; Proposed architectures; Time domain designs; Time domain analysis"
"Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae: An update on therapeutic options",2019,"Carbapenems are considered as last-resort antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. With the increasing use of carbapenems in clinical practice, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant pathogens now poses a great threat to human health. Currently, antibiotic options for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are very limited, with polymyxins, tigecycline, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides as the mainstays of therapy. The need for new and effective anti-CRE therapies is urgent. Here, we describe the current understanding of issues related to CRE and review combination therapeutic strategies for CRE infections, including high-dose tigecycline, high-dose prolonged-infusion of carbapenem, and double carbapenem therapy. We also review the newly available antibiotics which have potential in the future treatment of CRE infections: ceftazidime/avibactam, which is active against KPC and OXA-48 producers; meropenem/vaborbactam, which is active against KPC producers; plazomicin, which is a next-generation aminoglycoside with in vitro activity against CRE; and eravacycline, which is a tetracycline class antibacterial with in vitro activity against CRE. Although direct evidence for CRE treatment is still lacking and the development of resistance is a concern, these new antibiotics provide additional therapeutic options for CRE infections. Finally, we review other potential anti-CRE antibiotics in development: imipenem/relebactam and cefiderocol. Currently, high-dose and combination strategies that may include the new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors should be considered in severe CRE infections to maximize treatment success. In the future, when more treatment options are available, therapy for CRE infections should be individualized and based on molecular phenotypes of resistance, susceptibility profiles, disease severity, and patient characteristics. More high-quality studies are needed to guide effective treatment for infections caused by CRE. ? 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Direct-acting antivirals response in hepatocellular carcinoma: Does the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma matter?",2019,"During the clinical trial development of directly acting antivirals (DAAs), evidence regarding the treatment efficacy in chronic hepatitis C patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was scarce because these patients have always been excluded. Apart from the clinical trials, more HCC patients are currently being treated in daily practice, given that these treatments are highly effective and involve well-tolerated regimens. Large scale, real-world studies have demonstrated potentially suboptimal antiviral treatment efficacy in HCC patients who received DAAs. It is postulated that the impairment of the bioavailability of DAAs may account for the inferior treatment response. However, the results could not be generalized across all studies. The differing results were attributed to diverse patient characteristics, suboptimal regimens or imprecise definitions of active cancer statuses at the time of treatment initiation. Additional large-scale studies that utilize the treatment of choice in clearly defined HCC patients with different disease severities are warranted to clarify the issue. ? 2019 by Korean Association for the Study of the Liver.","ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; chronic hepatitis C; disease severity; drug bioavailability; drug efficacy; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; pilot study; Review; treatment response"
"Thermopneumatic suction integrated microfluidic blood analysis system",2019,"Blood tests provide crucial diagnostic information regarding several diseases. A key factor that affects the precision and accuracy of blood tests is the interference of red blood cells; however, the conventional methods of blood separation are often complicated and time consuming.

Parameters, such as flow rate, design of the filter trench, and the relative positions of the filter trench and channel, were optimized through microscopic monitoring. Moreover, this air-difference-driven device uses a cost-effective and easy-to-use heater device that creates a low-pressure environment in the microchannel within minutes. With the aforementioned advantages, this blood separation device could be another platform choice for point-of-care testing. ? 2019 Yang et al.

"HapticSphere: Physical support to enable precision touch interaction in mobile mixed-reality",2019,"This work presents HapticSphere, a wearable spherical surface enabled by bridging a finger and the head-mounted display (HMD) with a passive string. Users perceive a physical support on a finger attached to a string, when extending their arm and reaching out to the string's maximum extension. This physical support assists users in precise touch interaction in the context of stationary and walking virtual or mixed-reality experiences. We propose three methods of attachment of the haptic string (directly on the head or on the body), and illustrate a novel single-step calibration algorithm that supports these configurations by estimating a grand haptic sphere, once a head-coordinated touch interaction is established. Two user studies were conducted to validate our approach and to compare the touch performance with physical support in sitting and walking conditions in the context of mobile mixed-reality scenarios. The results show that, in the walking condition, touch interaction with physical support significantly outperformed the visual-only condition. ? 2019 IEEE.","Flow visualization; Helmet mounted displays; Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Visualization; Walking aids; Wearable technology; Centered computing; Human; Tree-maps; Visualization designs; Visualization technique; Mixed reality"

"Obstructive sleep apnea in children and adolescents and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events: A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan",2019,"Study Objectives: This study has investigated the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and acute stroke, among children and adolescents (age younger than 20 years) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: In this study, the population-based National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan was used to identify patients in whom OSA had been frst diagnosed between 2000 and 2015. Children and adolescents with OSA (n = 6,535) were included with 1:3 ratio by age, sex, and index year of control participants without OSA (n = 19,605). The Cox proportional regression model was used to evaluate the risk of MACEs in this cohort study. Results: After a 15-year follow-up, the incidence rate of MACEs was higher in the OSA cohort when compared with the non-OSA control cohort (15.97 and 8.20 per 100,000 person-years, respectively). After adjusting for covariates, the risk of MACEs among children and adolescents with OSA was still signifcantly higher (hazard ratio = 2.050; 95% confdence interval = 1.312 3.107; P = .010). No MACEs were found in the children and adolescents with OSA who received continuous airway positive pressure treatment or pharyngeal surgery. Conclusions: This study found a signifcantly higher risk of MACEs in children and adolescents with OSA. These fndings strongly suggest that clinicians should provide careful follow-up and medical treatment for children and adolescents with OSA. ? 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

"Enhancing early stage of hepatocellular carcinoma: Does correlate to MicroRNA 122 and miR196a interaction?",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a representative of almost 85-90% of liver cancer in the recent global incidence. HCC is the second leading cause of mortality in subjects with cancer. The higher prevalence of this disease significantly increased in the Asia Pacific region in the last decades. Fatty liver (steatosis) linked cirrhosis showed a substantial contribution to the acceleration of HCC in patients. Importantly, another primary inducer of fatty liver, a short non-coding RNA miR-122, and miR196a are the essential miRNAs that predicted enhance the progression of HCC in the younger age. However, the lack of information about HCC related liver-derived hormone and miRNA remains. This study was conducted by using miR-122+/--miR-196 (+) to generate miR-122-/--miR 196 (+). In the current data, the significant morphological alteration of the liver with the early formation of nodule-like in the surface area was observed. Based on the histological section, the chronic portal inflammation also occurred in the liver of this double genetic modification mouse model. In summary, the interaction of miR-122 and miR196a may accelerate liver fibrosis due to chronic inflammation within the liver progress to cirrhosis in the early stage of hepatocellular carcinoma. ? 2019 Author(s).",""

In this study, we investigated the heating characteristics of spherical-, urchin-, and rod-like AuNPs of a similar 50 nm size upon exposure to a 13.56 MHz radiofrequency using the LabEHY-105CL, an in vivo mEHT device. We found that, regardless of the AuNPs' sphere-, urchin- or rod-like shape, purified gold nanoparticle solution would not promote heat generation. The temperature elevation during radiofrequency irradiation was solely attributed to the ionic background of the solution. The AuNPs present in the medium (?25 ppm) showed no effect on selective cell killing of malignant cells, whereas the AuNPs incorporated in the cells diminished the cell selectivity as well as cell death and acted as protectors in mEHT cancer treatment. Our study suggested that (1) the temperature elevation induced by 50 nm AuNPs in the 13.56 MHz radiofrequency field was negligible and was shape-independent, and (2) the presence of AuNPs would alter the cell-killing effect of modulated electro-hyperthermia. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell death; Diseases; Hyperthermia therapy; Metal nanoparticles; Spheres; Cell-selectivity; Malignant cells; modulated electro-hyperthermia; Radio frequencies; Radio-frequency fields; Radiofrequency irradiation; Temperature elevation; Urchin-like; Gold nanoparticles"
"Investigation of functional brain network reconfiguration during vocal emotional processing using graph-theoretical analysis",2019,"Vocal expression is essential for conveying the emotion during social interaction. Although vocal emotion has been explored in previous studies, little is known about how perception of different vocal emotional expressions modulates the functional brain network topology. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional brain networks under different attributes of vocal emotion by graph-theoretical network analysis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were performed on 36 healthy participants.We utilized the Power-264 functional brain atlas to calculate the interregional functional connectivity (FC) from fMRI data under resting state and vocal stimuli at different arousal and valence levels. The orthogonal minimal spanning trees method was used for topological filtering. The paired-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction across all regions and arousal-valence levels were used for statistical comparisons. Our results show that brain network exhibits significantly altered network attributes at FC, nodal and global levels, especially under high-arousal or negative-valence vocal emotional stimuli. The alterations within/between well-known large-scale functional networks were also investigated. Through the present study, we have gained more insights into how comprehending emotional speech modulates brain networks. These findings may shed light on how the human brain processes emotional speech and how it distinguishes different emotional conditions. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; arousal; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; filtration; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; male; rest; speech; stimulus; theoretical study; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; emotion; image processing; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; voice; young adult; Adult; Arousal; Brain Mapping; Emotions; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Voice; Young Adult"
"Three Nurse-administered Protocols Reduce Nutritional Decline and Frailty in Older Gastrointestinal Surgery Patients: A Cluster Randomized Trial",2019,"Objective: To evaluate the effects of the modified Hospital Elder Life Program (mHELP)comprising 3 nurse-administered protocols in older patients undergoing gastrointestinal (GI)surgery. Design: Cluster randomized trial. Setting: Two 36-bed GI wards at a university-affiliated medical center in Taiwan. Participants: Older patients (?65 years, N = 377)were recruited if they were scheduled for elective GI surgery with an expected length of hospital stay >6 days. After transferring to the GI ward after surgery, participants were randomly assigned to the mHELP or control group (1:1)by room rather than individually because most patient units are double- or triple-occupancy rooms. Intervention: The mHELP protocols (early mobilization, oral and nutritional assistance, and orienting communication)were administered daily with usual care by a trained nurse until hospital discharge. The control group received usual care only. Measures: Outcomes were in-hospital nutritional decline, measured by body weight and Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA)scores, and Fried's frailty phenotype. Return of GI motility was examined as a potential mechanism contributing to observed outcomes. Results: Participants (mean age = 74.5 years; 56.8% male)primarily underwent colorectal (56.5%), gastric (21.2%), and pancreatobiliary (13.8%)surgery. Participants who received the mHELP [for a median of 7 days (interquartile range = 6–10 days)]had significantly lower in-hospital weight loss and decline in MNA scores (weight ?2.1 vs ?4.0 lb, P =.002; score ?3.2 vs ?4.0, P =.03)than the control group. The mHELP group also had significantly lower rates of incident frailty during hospitalization (12.0% vs 21.7%, P =.022), and persistent frailty (50.0% vs 92.9%, P =.03). Participants in the mHELP group had trends toward an accelerated return of GI motility. Conclusion and Implications: The mHELP effectively reduced nutritional decline, prevented new frailty, and promoted recovery of frailty present before admission. These nurse-administered protocols might be useful in other settings, including conditions managed at home or in nursing facilities. ? 2018 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","aged; Article; body weight; body weight loss; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical protocol; colorectal cancer; controlled study; defecation; elective surgery; female; frailty; gastrointestinal motility; gastrointestinal surgery; hospital discharge; human; intestine motility; laparoscopy; length of stay; long term care; major clinical study; male; Mini Mental State Examination; mobilization; nurse; nursing care; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; operation duration; ostomy; outcome assessment; pancreas cancer; postoperative care; randomized controlled trial; stomach cancer; surgical patient"
"Enhancing the Hybrid BCI Performance with the Common Frequency Pattern in Dual-Channel EEG",2019,"The brain-computer interface establishes a direct communication pathway between the human brain and an external device by recognizing specific patterns in cortical activities. The principle of hybridization stands for combining at least two different BCI modalities into a single interface with the aim of improving the information transfer rate by increasing the recognition accuracy and number of choices available for the user. This study proposes a simultaneous hybrid BCI system that recognizes the motor imagery (MI) and the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) using the EEG signals from a dual-channel EEG setting with sensors placed over the central area (C3 and C4 channels). The data processing implements a supervised optimization algorithm for the feature extraction, named the common frequency pattern, which finds the optimal spectral filter that maximizes the separability of the data by classes. The experiment compares the classification accuracy in a two-class task using the MI, SSVEP and hybrid approaches on seventeen healthy 18-29 years old subjects with various dual-channel setups and complete set of thirty EEG electrodes. The designed system reaches a high accuracy of 97.4 ± 1.1% in the hybrid task using the C3-C4 channel configuration, which is marginally lower than the 98.8 ± 0.5% accuracy achieved with the complete set of channels while applying the support vector classifier; in the plain SSVEP task the accuracy drops from 91.3 ± 3.9% to 86.0 ± 2.5% while moving from the occipital to central area under the dual-channel condition. The results demonstrate that by combining the principles of hybridization and data-driven spectral filtering for the feature selection it is feasible to compensate a lack of spatial information and implement the proposed BCI using a portable few channel EEG device even under sub-optimal conditions for the sensors placement. ? 2001-2011 IEEE.","Brain; Data handling; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Feature extraction; Information filtering; Interface states; Channel reduction; Frequency patterns; Information transfer rate; Motor imagery; Optimization algorithms; Steady state visual evoked potentials; Steady state visually evoked potentials; Support vector classifiers; Brain computer interface; adult; algorithm; Article; brain computer interface; classification accuracy; clinical article; cognition; common frequency pattern; cross validation; data processing; diagnostic accuracy; electroencephalogram; electrophysiology; endotracheal intubation; event related spectral perturbation; female; Fourier transformation; human; human experiment; imagery; machine learning; male; mathematical analysis; measurement accuracy; motor cortex; normal human; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; signal processing; visual evoked potential; visual stimulation; young adult"
"Optimizing influenza vaccine policies for controlling 2009-like pandemics and regular outbreaks",2019,"Background. This study examined the effectiveness of various vaccine policies against influenza. The transmission rate was calculated by use of the time-series influenza-like illness case during the year of 2009 and recent epidemics in Taiwan. Methods. We developed a stochastic compartmental model to analyze the transmission of influenza, where the population was stratified by location and age group, and the vaccine distribution was considered using the current policy. The simulation study compared the previous vaccine policy and a new policy with expanded coverage and various lengths of the vaccination campaign. The sensitivity analysis investigated different levels of vaccine efficacy to confirm the robustness of the recommended policies. Results. Doubling vaccine coverage can decrease the number of infections effectively in the regular epidemic scenario. However, a peak of infections occurs if the duration of implementing vaccination is too long. In the 2009-like pandemic scenario, both increasing vaccine doses and reducing the program's duration can mitigate infections, although the early outbreak restricts the effectiveness of vaccination programs. Conclusions. The finding indicates that only increasing vaccine coverage can reduce influenza infections. To avoid the peak of infections, it is also necessary to execute the vaccination activity immediately. Vaccine efficacy significantly impacts the vaccination policy's performance. When vaccine efficacy is low, neither increasing vaccination doses nor reducing vaccination timeframe prevents infections. Therefore, the variation in vaccine efficacy should be taken into account when making immunization policies against influenza. ? 2019 Chen et al.","influenza vaccine; 2009 H1N1 influenza; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; disease model; disease surveillance; disease transmission; drug efficacy; epidemic; human; infant; infection prevention; infection rate; influenza; influenza vaccination; mathematical model; mortality rate; pandemic; sensitivity analysis; simulation; treatment duration; vaccination; vaccination coverage; validation process"
"Hepatitis C virus leaves an epigenetic signature post cure of infection by direct-acting antivirals",2019,"The increasing worldwide prevalence of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), characterized by resistance to conventional chemotherapy, poor prognosis and eventually mortality, place it as a prime target for new modes of prevention and treatment. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the predominant risk factor for HCC in the US and Europe. Multiple epidemiological studies showed that sustained virological responses (SVR) following treatment with the powerful direct acting antivirals (DAAs), which have replaced interferon-based regimes, do not eliminate tumor development. We aimed to identify an HCV-specific pathogenic mechanism that persists post SVR following DAAs treatment. We demonstrate that HCV infection induces genome-wide epigenetic changes by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for histone post-translational modifications that are epigenetic markers for active and repressed chromatin. The changes in histone modifications correlate with reprogramed host gene expression and alter signaling pathways known to be associated with HCV life cycle and HCC. These epigenetic alterations require the presence of HCV RNA or/and expression of the viral proteins in the cells. Importantly, the epigenetic changes induced following infection persist as an ""epigenetic signature"" after virus eradication by DAAs treatment, as detected using in vitro HCV infection models. These observations led to the identification of an 8 gene signature that is associated with HCC development and demonstrate persistent epigenetic alterations in HCV infected and post SVR liver biopsy samples. The epigenetic signature was reverted in vitro by drugs that inhibit epigenetic modifying enzyme and by the EGFR inhibitor, Erlotinib. This epigenetic “scarring” of the genome, persisting following HCV eradication, suggest a novel mechanism for the persistent pathogenesis of HCV after its eradication by DAAs. Our study offers new avenues for prevention of the persistent oncogenic effects of chronic hepatitis infections using specific drugs to revert the epigenetic changes to the genome. ? 2019 Perez et al.","antivirus agent; dasabuvir; erlotinib; kruppel like factor 4; ombitasvir; paritaprevir; proprotein convertase 9; ritonavir; transcription factor JunB; viral protein; virus RNA; Wnt10a protein; antivirus agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; histone; interferon; histone; nonstructural protein 2; antiviral therapy; Article; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; EDN1 gene; epigenetic signature; epigenetics; FOSL2 gene; gene; gene expression; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; histone modification; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; JUNB gene; KLF4 gene; liver biopsy; liver cell carcinoma; MYCN gene; next generation sequencing; PCSK9 gene; protein expression; signal transduction; sustained virologic response; TNFAIP3 gene; viral clearance; WNT10A gene; aged; biopsy; chromatin; drug effect; female; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; histone code; host pathogen interaction; liver; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; middle aged; pathogenicity; pathology; risk factor; virology; antiviral therapy; cancer risk; cell structure; disease association; genetic association; hepatitis C; life cycle stage; nonhuman; protein processing; virus replication; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Biopsy; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chromatin; Epigenesis, Genetic; ErbB Receptors; Erlotinib Hydrochloride; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Histone Code; Histones; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Interferons; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Sustained Virologic Response"
"Cortactin as a potential predictor of second esophageal neoplasia in hypopharyngeal carcinoma",2019,"Objective: Hypopharyngeal carcinoma has a very poor prognosis. The high incidence of second esophageal neoplasia is one of the major causes. To establish an efficient follow-up scheme for increasing the diagnostic yield and reducing the adverse impact of second esophageal neoplasia on survival, the purpose of this study was to explore a biomarker to predict second esophageal neoplasia. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive tissue specimens from those patients who underwent tumor resection between September 2007 and October 2015 were collected. Gene amplification was performed by real-time PCR. The expression of cortactin was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The predictive risk factors of developing second esophageal neoplasia and prognostic factors related to survival were analyzed. Results: A total of 187 patients were included with a mean follow-up of 48 months (12–118 months). Second esophageal tumors were found in 53 (28.3%), including 41 (21.9%) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 12 severe dysplasia. The results of multivariate analyses revealed that age (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.16–6.78), cortactin overexpression (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.17–5.33), and stage IV versus I (OR 6.49, 95% CI 1.68–25.18) were independent predictors of second esophageal neoplasia, and second esophageal neoplasia (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05–3.01) was an independent predictor of overall survival. Conclusion: This is the first report to identify a potential biomarker for predicting second esophageal neoplasia in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. In those patients with cortactin overexpression and younger age (?60 years old), close surveillance for second esophageal neoplasia is required. In addition, the real effect of cortactin overexpression on development of primary esophageal carcinoma is required to be validated in a large cohort study. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","cortactin; cortactin; CTTN protein, human; adult; age; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cohort analysis; diagnostic value; distant metastasis; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus dysplasia; esophagus tumor; female; follow up; gene amplification; human; human tissue; hypopharynx carcinoma; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; overall survival; perineural invasion; retrospective study; second cancer; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; genetics; head and neck tumor; hypopharynx tumor; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; middle aged; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; prognosis; proportional hazards model; second cancer; statistical model; survival rate; very elderly; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Cortactin; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasms, Second Primary; Odds Ratio; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Survival Rate"
"Joint Torque Estimation of a Powered Exoskeleton under Compliance Control Loop",2019,"Exoskeletons have been widely used as walking assistive devices for military and rehabilitation purposes. Many exoskeleton control systems detect users' intention by directly sensing their biological signals such as EMG, EEG, force, etc. Therefore, additional sensors are required, resulting in high cost and inconvenience of putting on and taking off the exoskeleton. In this paper, the user's intention is detected by estimating the torque exerted by the user based on exoskeleton dynamics as well as the current and angle of each joint motor; hence, requirements of sensors are diminished. Moreover, we conduct compliance control by modifying joint velocity commands according to the estimated torque and predefined mechanical admittance of each joint. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate that satisfactory estimation of the user's torque can be achieved by the proposed method. ? 2018 IEEE.","Automation; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Process control; Torque; Walking aids; Assistive devices; Biological signals; Joint torques; Joint velocity; Mechanical admittance; Putting on and taking offs; Satisfactory estimation; User's intentions; Compliance control"
"Reversed ophthalmic artery flow following ischemic stroke: a possible predictor of outcomes following carotid artery stenting",2019,"Stroke is the leading cause of death worldwide and stenosis of the carotid artery accounts for more than half of all cases. Carotid duplex is an effective non-invasive ultrasound test which identifies stroke patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis who are candidates for preventative intervention to reduce the risk of recurrence. In patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis, reversed ophthalmic artery flow (ROAF) is often observed at the time of the carotid duplex scan. In this study, we investigated whether ROAF, denoting exhaustion of cerebral collateral flow in ischemic stroke patients affected mid-term functional outcomes following carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedures. In total, 144 consecutive patients with a first episode of ischemic stroke and subsequent CAS procedure conducted between January 2010 and November 2014 at Changhua Christian Hospital, Taiwan were included. Clinical data were obtained by medical record review. Disability was assessed at two time points by utilising the Barthel Index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) before CAS and 12 months post-CAS. Among 85 patients presenting without ROAF, 48/85 (56.4%) had improved mRS scores following stenting. The condition remained unchanged (stationary) in 36/85 (43.5%) patients after stenting and one patient exhibited deteriorated condition 1/85(1.1%). In contrast, among the 59 patients presenting with ROAF, 24/59 (40.6%) had improved mRS score following stenting. The condition remained unchanged (stationary) in the remaining 35/59 (59.3%) patients after stenting, and no patient exhibited deteriorated condition 0/59 (0 %). This study provides evidence that CAS is a valid and effective treatment option regardless of whether patients exhibited ROAF or not. Patients without ROAF were significantly more likely to have improved mid-term functional outcomes compared to those with ROAF. In the group without ROAF admission, CRP may play a role in predicting subsequent functional outcomes, whereas admission Barthel Index was a predictor of outcome in the ROAF group. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","C reactive protein; glycosylated hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; adult; age; aged; artery blood flow; Article; Barthel index; body mass; brain blood vessel; brain blood volume; brain ischemia; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stenting; clinical outcome; collateral circulation; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; digital subtraction angiography; echocardiography; female; human; major clinical study; male; mean transit time; medical record review; middle aged; ophthalmic artery; Rankin scale; recurrence risk; retrospective study; reversed ophthalmic artery flow; brain circulation; brain ischemia; carotid artery obstruction; cerebrovascular accident; complication; diagnostic imaging; endovascular surgery; neuroimaging; ophthalmic artery; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; severity of illness index; stent; Brain Ischemia; Carotid Stenosis; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Collateral Circulation; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Ophthalmic Artery; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Prognosis; Severity of Illness Index; Stents; Stroke"
"Ribavirin facilitates early viral kinetics in chronic hepatitis C patients receiving daclatasvir/asunaprevir",2019,"Background and Aim: Ribavirin (RBV) remains crucial in difficult-to-cure chronic hepatitis C patients receiving directly acting antivirals (DAAs). The current study aimed to address whether RBV enhanced early viral kinetics in patients with DAAs. Methods: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-1b patients were allocated to daclatasvir/asunaprevir +weight-based RBV (1000–1200?mg/day) for 12–24?weeks. HCV RNA levels were compared at day 1, week 1, week 2, and week 4 of treatment. Results: The sustained virological response rate was 100% (67/67) and 96.7% (59/61) in the RBV and non-RBV group, respectively. The HCV RNA levels at treatment week 2 (W2) were significantly lower in the RBV group than in the non-RBV group (0.42?±?0.81 log IU/mL vs 0.79?±?1.03 log IU/mL, P?=?0.04). Among the intermediate responders who remained to have detectable RNA after W1 of treatment, patients with RBV had a significantly higher rate of undetectable HCV RNA (71.4% vs 36.0%, P?=?0.003) and lower HCV RNA level at W2 (0.55?±?0.89 log IU/mL vs 1.32?±?1.04 log IU/mL, P?=?0.001). A more significant magnitude of HCV RNA reduction was also noted from baseline to day 1 (3.15?±?0.38 log IU/mL vs 2.80?±?0.70 log IU/mL, P?=?0.009) and W1 to W2 (1.40?±?0.65 log IU/mL vs 0.88?±?0.78 log IU/mL, P?=?0.007) in the RBV group compared to the non-RBV group among the intermediate responders. Logistic regression analysis revealed that adding RBV independently predicted undetectable HCV RNA at W2 (odds ratio/confidence interval: 4.74/1.54–14.57, P?=?0.007) in the intermediate responders. Conclusions: Adding RBV to DAAs improved early viral kinetic, in particular, for intermediate responders. ? 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",""
"A quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer for dry microparticle analysis",2019,"In this work, we report a new design of a charge detection quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (QIT-MS) for the analysis of micro-sized dry inorganic and bioparticles including red blood cells (RBCs) and different sizes of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The developed method is one of the fastest methods to measure the mass of micro-sized particles. This system allows the online analysis of various micro-sized particles up to 1 × 1017 Da. The calibration of the mass spectrometer has been done by using different sizes of polystyrene (PS) particles (2-15 μm). The measured masses of RBCs were around 1.8 × 1013 Da and MCF-7 cancer cells were between 1 × 1014 and 4 × 1014 Da. The calculated mass distribution profiles of the particles and cells were given as histogram profiles. The statistical data were summarized after Gaussian type fitting to the experimental histogram profiles. The new method gives very promising results for the analysis of particles and has very broad application. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",""
"DNA damage, liver injury, and tumorigenesis: Consequences of DDX3X loss",2019,"The pleiotropic roles of DEAD-box helicase 3, X-linked (DDX3X), including its functions in transcriptional and translational regulation, chromosome segregation, DNA damage, and cell growth control, have highlighted the association between DDX3X and tumorigenesis. However, mRNA transcripts and protein levels of DDX3X in patient specimens have shown the controversial correlations of DDX3X with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevalence. In this study, generation of hepatocyte-specific Ddx3x-knockout mice revealed that loss of Ddx3x facilitates liver tumorigenesis. Loss of Ddx3x led to profound ductular reactions, cell apoptosis, and compensatory proliferation in female mutants at 6 weeks of age. The sustained phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γH2AX) and significant accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks in liver indicated that the replicative stress occurred in female mutants. Further chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that DDX3X bound to promoter regions and regulated the expression of DNA repair factors, DDB2 and XPA, to maintain genome stability. Loss of Ddx3x led to decreased levels of DNA repair factors, which contributed to an accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, replication stress, and eventually, spontaneous liver tumors and DEN-induced HCCs in Alb-Cre/+;Ddx3x flox/flox mice. Implications: These data identify an important role of DDX3X in the regulation of DNA damage repair to protect against replication stress in liver and HCC development and progression. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","ddb2 protein; DEAD box helicase 3; DEAD box protein; histone H2AX; protein; transcription factor Sp1; unclassified drug; xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein; aged; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; carcinogenesis; cell death; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromosome segregation; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; DNA replication; double stranded DNA break; down regulation; excision repair; female; gene deletion; gene knockout; genomic instability; in vitro study; inflammation; liver cell carcinoma; liver injury; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression level; protein phosphorylation; single stranded DNA break"
"Stitching aerial images for vehicle positioning and tracking",2019,"In recent years, applications such as reproduction of traffic accident scene, calculation of traffic flow, etc. use UAVs to collect data by aerial images. If a UAV does not move, the coordinates of objects in images can be considered as reference for predicting parameters such as distance and direction. How-ever, this does not apply if the UAV is moving. In this research, methods of image processing are used to obtain the pinhole model which is similar to perpendicularly taken images, which should be distance-preserving. Then, the method of image stitching is used to find out the correlation of relative position between each image in order to construct a global coordinates system over every images. The common used methods of image stitching are not considered about distance-preserving, and cause the cumulative error usually. In this case, GPS information is used to estimate the starting position of images, then stitching those images to a panorama through applying SIFT feature pair and fine-tuning by the gradient method. At last, this paper integrates methods as mentioned into implementation and presents visualized data, then both the trajectory of UAV and the relative position of objects between images and the panorama can be observed by user in order to verify feasibility and precision of methods. Also the results of this paper can be applied with traffic flows detection in the future. ? 2018 IEEE.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Gradient methods; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cumulative errors; Fish-eye; Global coordinates system; Image stitching; pinhole image; positioning; Relative positions; Vehicle positioning; Data mining"
"HDAC1,2 knock-out and HDACi induced cell apoptosis in imatinib-resistant K562 cells",2019,"Since imatinib (Glivec or Gleevec) has been used to target the BCR-ABL fusion protein, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has become a manageable chronic disease with long-term survival. However, 15%-20% of CML patients ultimately develop resistance to imatinib and then progress to an accelerated phase and eventually to a blast crisis, limiting treatment options and resulting in a poor survival rate. Thus, we investigated whether histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) could be used as a potential anticancer therapy for imatinib-resistant CML (IR-CML) patients. By applying a noninvasive apoptosis detection sensor (NIADS), we found that panobinostat significantly enhanced cell apoptosis in K562 cells. A further investigation showed that panobinostat induced apoptosis in both K562 and imatinib-resistant K562 (IR-K562) cells mainly via H3 and H4 histone acetylation, whereas panobinostat targeted cancer stem cells (CSCs) in IR-K562 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing, we found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 knockout cells significantly induced cell apoptosis, indicating that the regulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 is extremely important in maintaining K562 cell survival. All information in this study indicates that regulating HDAC activity provides therapeutic benefits against CML and IR-CML in the clinic. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Prostasin Impairs Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor Activation to Suppress Dengue Virus Propagation",2019,"Background: Dengue virus (DENV), a common and widely spread arbovirus, causes life-threatening diseases, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. There is currently no effective therapeutic or preventive treatment for DENV infection. Methods: Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that prostasin expression was decreased upon DENV infection. Prostasin expression levels were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in patients with dengue fever and a DENV-infected mice model. Short hairpin RNA against EGFR and LY294002 were used to investigate the molecular mechanism. Results: Based on clinical studies, we first found relatively low expression of prostasin, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored membrane protease, in blood samples from patients with dengue fever compared with healthy individuals and a high correlation of prostasin expression and DENV-2 RNA copy number. DENV infection significantly decreased prostasin RNA levels of in vivo and in vitro models. By contrast, exogenous expression of prostasin could protect ICR suckling mice from life-threatening DENV-2 infection. Mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of DENV propagation by prostasin was due to reducing expression of epithelial growth factor receptor, leading to suppression of the Akt/NF-κB-mediated cyclooxygenase-2 signaling pathway. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that prostasin expression is a noteworthy clinical feature and a potential therapeutic target against DENV infection. ? 2018 The Author(s) 2018.","2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; chromone derivative; cyclooxygenase 2; EGFR protein, mouse; enzyme inhibitor; epidermal growth factor receptor; messenger RNA; morpholine derivative; prostasin; serine proteinase; small interfering RNA; virus RNA; animal; blood; cell line; dengue; Dengue virus; disease model; genetic transfection; genetics; human; metabolism; monocyte; mouse; physiology; signal transduction; virus replication; Animals; Cell Line; Chromones; Cyclooxygenase 2; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Disease Models, Animal; Enzyme Inhibitors; ErbB Receptors; Humans; Mice; Monocytes; Morpholines; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Small Interfering; RNA, Viral; Serine Endopeptidases; Signal Transduction; Transfection; Virus Replication"

The values of n:m CFC between each pair of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies were estimated from eye-open resting-state MEG data. The topographic maps of CFC values between alpha and other frequencies were illustrated. The results of simulation data showed the increased accuracy of phase and n:m CFC estimation for balanced power of two targeted frequencies. Results of MEG data exhibited that CFC maps of low-alpha activity presented broadly distributed coupling with high frequencies (including beta and gamma) in the frontal regions of salient-ventral attention and frontoparietal control networks, whereas high-alpha activity coupling with the gamma band in the posterior part of frontoparietal control network. Our study demonstrates the versatile of n:m CFC values at rest in human brain. Caution should be considered when n:mCFC values would be used as an index of dysfunction at resting state in diseased brains. ? 2018 IEEE.","Brain mapping; Frequency estimation; Magnetoencephalography; Maps; Cortical regions; Crossfrequency couplings (CFC); Different frequency; High frequency HF; Neural communication; Phase synchronization; Potential mechanism; Resting state; Digital signal processing"
"Essential role of visfatin in lipopolysaccharide and colon ascendens stent peritonitis-induced acute lung injury",2019,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by acute and severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Visfatin, which is known as an obesity-related cytokine with pro-inflammatory activities, plays a role in regulation of inflammatory cytokines. The mechanisms of ALI remain unclear in critically ill patients. Survival in ALI patients appear to be influenced by the stress generated by mechanical ventilation and by ALI-associated factors that initiate the inflammatory response. The objective for this study was to understand the mechanisms of how visfatin regulates inflammatory cytokines and promotes ALI. The expression of visfatin was evaluated in ALI patients and mouse sepsis models. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms were investigated using human bronchial epithelial cell lines, BEAS-2B and NL-20. An increase of serum visfatin was discovered in ALI patients compared to normal controls. Results from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry staining also showed that visfatin protein was upregulated in mouse sepsis models. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced visfatin expression, activated the STAT3/NFκB pathway, and increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL1-β, IL-6, and TNF-α in human bronchial epithelial cell lines NL-20 and BEAS-2B. Co-treatment of visfatin inhibitor FK866 reversed the activation of the STAT3/NFκB pathway and the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS. Our study provides new evidence for the involvement of visfatin and down-stream events in acute lung injury. Further studies are required to confirm whether the anti-visfatin approaches can improve ALI patient survival by alleviating the pro-inflammatory process. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Advertising in Young Children's Apps: A Content Analysis",2019,"Objective: Young children use mobile devices on average 1 hour/day, but no studies have examined the prevalence of advertising in children's apps. The objective of this study was to describe the advertising content of popular children's apps. Methods: To create a coding scheme, we downloaded and played 39 apps played by children aged 12 months to 5 years in a pilot study of a mobile sensing app; 2 researchers played each app, took detailed notes on the design of advertisements, and iteratively refined the codebook (interrater reliability 0.96). Codes were then applied to the 96 most downloaded free and paid apps in the 5 And Under category on the Google Play app store. Results: Of the 135 apps reviewed, 129 (95%) contained at least 1 type of advertising. These included use of commercial characters (42%); full-app teasers (46%); advertising videos interrupting play (e.g., pop-ups [35%] or to unlock play items [16%]); in-app purchases (30%); prompts to rate the app (28%) or share on social media (14%); distracting ads such as banners across the screen (17%) or hidden ads with misleading symbols such as ""$"" or camouflaged as gameplay items (7%). Advertising was significantly more prevalent in free apps (100% vs 88% of paid apps), but occurred at similar rates in apps labeled as ""educational"" versus other categories. Conclusion: In this exploratory study, we found high rates of mobile advertising through manipulative and disruptive methods. These results have implications for advertising regulation, parent media choices, and apps' educational value. Copyright ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Fluorescent 10B embedded nanodiamonds as 10B delivery agent for boron neutron capture therapy",2019,"Boron neutron capture therapy is a potentially powerful anti-cancer treatment, the success of which depends heavily on the boron delivery agent. Enabling the real-time tracing of delivery agents as they move through the body is crucial to the further development of boron neutron capture therapy. In this study, we fabricate fluorescent 10B embedded nanodiamonds using physical ion implantation in conjunction with a two-step annealing process. Fluorescent 10B embedded nanodiamonds perform well in cell viability test. The red fluorescence of the 10B embedded nanodiamonds allows their use in fluorescence microscopy and in vivo imaging systems, thereby making it possible to conduct tracking in real time. The proposed fluorescent 10B embedded nanodiamonds, combining optical visibility and 10B transport capability, might be a promising boron delivery agent suitable for a wide range of biomedical applications. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Boron; Embedded systems; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Ion implantation; Medical applications; Neutrons; Real time systems; Biomedical applications; Boron neutron capture therapy; Cell viability; In-Vivo imaging; IVIS; Red fluorescence; Transport capabilities; Two-step annealing; Nanodiamonds"
"Membrane protein-regulated networks across human cancers",2019,"Alterations in membrane proteins (MPs) and their regulated pathways have been established as cancer hallmarks and extensively targeted in clinical applications. However, the analysis of MP-interacting proteins and downstream pathways across human malignancies remains challenging. Here, we present a systematically integrated method to generate a resource of cancer membrane protein-regulated networks (CaMPNets), containing 63,746 high-confidence protein–protein interactions (PPIs) for 1962 MPs, using expression profiles from 5922 tumors with overall survival outcomes across 15 human cancers. Comprehensive analysis of CaMPNets links MP partner communities and regulated pathways to provide MP-based gene sets for identifying prognostic biomarkers and druggable targets. For example, we identify CHRNA9 with 12 PPIs (e.g., ERBB2) can be a therapeutic target and find its anti-metastasis agent, bupropion, for treatment in nicotine-induced breast cancer. This resource is a study to systematically integrate MP interactions, genomics, and clinical outcomes for helping illuminate cancer-wide atlas and prognostic landscapes in tumor homo/heterogeneity. ? 2019, The Author(s).","amfebutamone; biological marker; lactic acid; membrane protein; amfebutamone; antineoplastic agent; CHRNA9 protein, human; nicotinic receptor; nicotinic receptor blocking agent; tumor marker; cancer; gene expression; genetic analysis; membrane; protein; signaling; tumor; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bioinformatics; bioluminescence; breast cancer; carcinogenesis; cell cycle regulation; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; electroporation; female; fluorescence microscopy; gene editing; gene expression; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; luciferase assay; lung metastasis; microarray analysis; mouse; neoplasm; nonhuman; overall survival; protein analysis; protein protein interaction; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; scoring system; sequence alignment; squamous cell lung carcinoma; transient transfection; tumor growth; tumor invasion; Western blotting; animal; drug effect; drug screening; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; information processing; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; mortality; neoplasm; procedures; prognosis; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers, Tumor; Bupropion; Cell Line, Tumor; Datasets as Topic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Mice; Neoplasms; Nicotinic Antagonists; Prognosis; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Receptors, Nicotinic; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Reducing intercity bus crashes through driver rescheduling",2019,"Intercity bus crashes often involve driver fatigue, which itself is usually the result of sleep deprivation, long driving hours, a maladjusted circadian rhythm, or some combination of the above. And driver scheduling has long been suspected as the root cause affecting sleepiness and fatigue. As such, a fundamental question for intercity bus carriers is how to reduce crashes associated with driver schedules, while maintaining a nonstop service? This research seeks to develop a paradigm to minimize overall fleet crash risk by rescheduling. In this study, we first identified those driving schedules associated with the highest crash risks, and a rescheduling scheme is then proposed to reduce fleet crashes overall. A case-study approach was employed to identify driver scheduling associated with higher crash risk, and a mathematical program was then formulated to minimize fleet crash risk. Our results showed that several types of driver schedules would lead to higher crash risk; for example: (1) working in the afternoon or early hours in the morning for two consecutive days; and (2) commencing a driving shift in the mornings, the afternoon or the early hours of the morning after being off-duty for more than 24 h. To meet the challenge of maintaining a nonstop service while simultaneously minimizing the crash risk associated with these risk patterns, a mathematical program was developed, and it was found that rescheduling based on our algorithm could reduce the incidence of crashes by approximately 30 percent. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Buses; Fleet operations; Risks; Scheduling; Case study approach; Circadian rhythms; Driver fatigue; Driver scheduling; Driving hours; Mathematical program; Non-stop service; Sleep deprivation; Accidents; algorithm; car driving; case control study; complication; fatigue; human; occupational accident; personnel management; prevention and control; risk factor; somnolence; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; workload; Accidents, Occupational; Accidents, Traffic; Algorithms; Automobile Driving; Case-Control Studies; Fatigue; Humans; Linear Models; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Risk Factors; Sleepiness; Workload"
"Risk of cholangiocarcinoma in patients undergoing therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-atography or cholecystectomy: A population based study",2019,"BACKGROUND Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly lethal disease that had been underestimated in the past two decades. Many risk factors are well documented for in cholangiocarcinoma, but the impacts of advanced biliary interventions, like endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES), endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation (EPBD), and cholecystectomy, are inconsistent in the previous literature. AIM To clarify the risks of cholangiocarcinoma after ES/EPBD, cholecystectomy or no intervention for cholelithiasis using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). METHODS From data of NHIRD 2004-2011 in Taiwan, we selected 7938 cholelithiasis cases as well as 23814 control group cases (matched by sex and age in a 1:3 ratio). We compared the previous risk factors of cholangiocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma rate in the cholelithiasis and control groups. The incidences of total and subsequent cholangiocarcinoma were calculated in ES/EPBD patients, cholecystectomy patients, cholelithiasis patients without intervention, and groups from the normal population. RESULTS In total, 537 cases underwent ES/EPBD, 1743 cases underwent cholecystectomy, and 5658 cholelithiasis cases had no intervention. Eleven (2.05%), 37 (0.65%), and 7 (0.40%) subsequent cholangiocarcinoma cases were diagnosed in the ES/EPBD, no intervention, and cholecystectomy groups, respectively, and the odds ratio for subsequent cholangiocarcinoma was 3.13 in the ES/EPBD group and 0.61 in the cholecystectomy group when compared with the no intervention group. CONCLUSION In conclusion, symptomatic cholelithiasis patients who undergo cholecystectomy can reduce the incidence of subsequent cholangiocarcinoma, while cholelithiasis patients who undergo ES/EPBD are at a great risk of subsequent cholangiocarcinoma according to our findings. ?

"TACCO, a Database Connecting Transcriptome Alterations, Pathway Alterations and Clinical Outcomes in Cancers",2019,"Because of innumerable cancer sequencing projects, abundant transcriptome expression profiles together with survival data are available from the same patients. Although some expression signatures for prognosis or pathologic staging have been identified from these data, systematically discovering such kind of expression signatures remains a challenge. To address this, we developed TACCO (Transcriptome Alterations in CanCer Omnibus), a database for identifying differentially expressed genes and altered pathways in cancer. TACCO also reveals miRNA cooperative regulations and supports construction of models for prognosis. The resulting signatures have great potential for patient stratification and treatment decision-making in future clinical applications.

"Genetic polymorphism of catechol- O -methyltransferase modulates the association of green tea consumption and lung cancer",2019,"Tea polyphenols are strong antioxidants, which can be rapidly O-methylated by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Thus, it is possible that the genetic polymorphism of COMT can modulate the association of green tea consumption and lung cancer. Here, we designed a case-control study to evaluate the combined effect of green tea consumption and COMT genotypes on the risk of lung cancer. A total of 237 lung cancer patients and 474 healthy controls were recruited. Questionnaires were administered to obtain demographic data, smoking status, green tea consumption, fruits and vegetables intake, exposure to cooking fumes, and family history of lung cancer. Genotypes for COMT were identified by PCR. Smoking, green tea consumption, exposure to cooking fumes, and family history of lung cancer were associated with the development of lung cancer. When green tea drinkers carrying COMT HL/LL genotypes were selected as the reference group, drinkers carrying the COMT HH genotype had a higher risk for the development of lung cancer (odds ratio: 1.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-3.91). Among the current and ever smokers, the elevated risk for lung cancer was more apparent in green tea drinkers carrying the COMT HH genotype compared with green tea drinkers carrying COMT HL/LL genotypes (odds ratio: 5.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.75-19.45). Green tea drinkers with greater activity of the COMT genotype, whereby polyphenols are effectively excluded, will gain fewer protective benefits against lung cancer development. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Favorable gallbladder cancer mortality-to-incidence ratios of countries with good ranking of world's health system and high expenditures on health",2019,"BACKGROUND: The mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) is a marker that reflects the clinical outcome of cancer treatment. MIR as a prognostic marker is more accessible when compared with long-term follow-up survival surveys. Theoretically, countries with good health care systems would have favorable outcomes for cancer; however, no report has yet demonstrated an association between gallbladder cancer MIR and the World's Health System ranking. METHODS: We used linear regression to analyze the correlation of MIRs with the World Health Organization (WHO) rankings and total expenditures on health/gross domestic product (e/GDP) in 57 countries selected according to the data quality. RESULTS: The results showed high crude rates of incidence/mortality but low MIR in more developed regions. Among continents, Europe had the highest crude rates of incidence/mortality, whereas the highest age-standardized rates (ASR) of incidence/mortality were in Asia. The MIR was lowest in North America and highest in Africa (0.40 and 1.00, respectively). Furthermore, favorable MIRs were correlated with good WHO rankings and high e/GDP (p?=?0.01 and p?=?0.030, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The MIR variation for gallbladder cancer is therefore associated with the ranking of the health system and the expenditure on health.","gallbladder tumor; global health; gross national product; health care cost; health care delivery; human; incidence; mortality; World Health Organization; Delivery of Health Care; Gallbladder Neoplasms; Global Health; Gross Domestic Product; Health Expenditures; Humans; Incidence; World Health Organization"
